00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.580 
workouts and more quiet works that
workouts<00:01:51.579> and<00:01:51.969> actually<00:01:52.719> been<00:01:52.899> boxing<00:01:53.319> a<00:01:53.409> lot

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
workouts and actually been boxing a lot

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.129 
workouts and actually been boxing a lot
with<00:01:53.740> Michael<00:01:54.359> jump<00:01:55.359> roping<00:01:57.600> yeah<00:01:58.600> so<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:58.869> think

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139 
with Michael jump roping yeah so I think

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.050 
with Michael jump roping yeah so I think
that<00:01:59.560> you<00:02:00.100> know<00:02:00.219> it's<00:02:00.369> somewhat<00:02:00.609> of<00:02:00.700> its<00:02:00.759> it's

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
that you know it's somewhat of its it's

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.849 
that you know it's somewhat of its it's
a<00:02:01.179> mix<00:02:01.420> of<00:02:01.600> different<00:02:01.719> things<00:02:02.139> what<00:02:02.710> do<00:02:02.770> you

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
a mix of different things what do you

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.139 
a mix of different things what do you
think<00:02:03.100> was<00:02:03.249> the<00:02:03.280> most<00:02:03.609> important<00:02:04.060> part

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
think was the most important part

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.499 
think was the most important part
because<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.630> are<00:02:04.749> a<00:02:04.780> mother<00:02:05.049> also<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:06.509> how

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
because you are a mother also and how

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.559 
because you are a mother also and how
hard<00:02:07.780> was<00:02:08.020> for<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.319> to<00:02:08.410> go<00:02:08.530> back<00:02:08.560> in<00:02:08.890> shape

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
hard was for you to go back in shape

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.840 
hard was for you to go back in shape
it's<00:02:10.569> hard<00:02:10.840> work<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.440> mean<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.830> was<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.340> gym<00:02:12.550> a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
it's hard work I mean I was in the gym a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.940 
it's hard work I mean I was in the gym a
lot<00:02:13.180> like<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.750> first<00:02:13.930> not<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.260> first<00:02:14.620> six

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
lot like the first not the first six

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.490 
lot like the first not the first six
weeks<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:16.180> after<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:17.050> know<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.230> get

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
weeks but like after you know you get

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.190 
weeks but like after you know you get
your<00:02:17.650> muscles<00:02:17.950> back<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.970> was<00:02:19.420> nursing<00:02:19.630> for

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
your muscles back and I was nursing for

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.050 
your muscles back and I was nursing for
like<00:02:20.350> eight<00:02:20.590> months<00:02:20.800> so<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.220> think<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.760> helped

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
like eight months so I think that helped

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.600 
like eight months so I think that helped
as<00:02:22.180> well<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:23.140> nursing<00:02:23.620> they<00:02:23.890> say<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.310> helps
