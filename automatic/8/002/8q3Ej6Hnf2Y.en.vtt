00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.179
 hello to you lana and katya and no this 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.130
 not a review of technology from the company allo 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.410
 This series of videos will be devoted to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.509
 photography art photography already 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.430
 It has long been an art and thanks 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.529
 the development of modern technology and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.960
 availability of digital cameras 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.119
 each of us is partial of it 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.939
 art in today's release we give you 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.650
 tell what kinds there are 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.779
 photos what is composition rule 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.329
 third and how not to fill the horizon 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.050
 kinds of photos there is a great 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.579
 A lot of the main ones are 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.239
 architectural photography 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:47.390
 portrait landscape subject shooting 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.449
 reportage well and most importantly photohunting 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.559
 the most popular of them are portrait and landscape 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.989
 landscape this photo on which 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.620
 shows nature or some other 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.870
 sea terrain forest fields mountains and other in 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.969
 turn landscape motifs are divided into 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.549
 rural urban industrial landscape 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.159
 and sea portrait is an image 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.260
 person or group of people subject to portrait 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.420
 individual life usually comes out 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.760
 person on the border of the portrait genre 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.490
 very dynamic and can often 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.409
 combine with elements of other genres in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.200
 turn portrait shooting 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.689
 produced by large average or general 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 plan and what do you need to get 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.080
 good shot 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.240
 the most important thing is this composition 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.340
 harmonious and object placement frame 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.979
 plays a crucial role as it serves 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.460
 means of expression your author 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.619
 thoughts 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.049
 to get beautiful and expressive 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.159
 pictures just fill a few 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.380
 simple rules 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.110
 the most important thing is to keep the camera level 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.030
 the subject if you shoot a child 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.430
 no need to look at it from high 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.860
 sit down so be at his level 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.960
 eye this will avoid distortion 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.950
 proportions and make a good shot 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.930
 your baby is important 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.890
 snapshot object should not merge with 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.020
 background if you shoot some one 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.509
 object choose a simple part fund 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.280
 which will not distract the viewer for 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.830
 creating a frame effect you can 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.840
 use branches trees and the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.880
 Like this will help create more 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.640
 surround frame try to achieve 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.590
 so that the light source is behind you 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.560
 unless of course you seek to get 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.690
 mysterious silhouette shooting moving 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.310
 Objects arrange it as if 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.540
 would he just go in frame 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.540
 they are already coming out of it 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.629
 try to do so to the top 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.909
 part of the photo didn't look harder 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.129
 lower than this rule applies to 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.659
 sides of the image if in frame 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.969
 there are several identical 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.459
 objects try to do so 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.620
 their number was odd because three 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.890
 little flower looks much more interesting 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.780
 than 2 or 4 if you want to capture 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.760
 someone in the background of the monument or 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.430
 architectural structure do not put it 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.470
 Close to the subject , ask 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.450
 move it a few steps when in 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.450
 the frame will be clearly visible as a person 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:17.250
 the same attractions and the most 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:20.430
 never really shoot 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.620
 background carpet as far as I know 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.650
 there are various ways to build 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.139
 the compositions are actually a lot of them 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.189
 and the easiest way is to use 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.409
 rule of thirds 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.480
 it is that the frame is divided by 3 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.000
 equal parts vertically and along 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.280
 the horizontal lines of the resulting mesh objects 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.690
 located at the intersection of lines 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.979
 contributes to the best visual 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.109
 perception 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.090
 so the subject needs 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.090
 arrange either along the lines or on 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.919
 the intersection of these lines and there are major 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.269
 mistakes that beginners make 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.269
 photographers 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.690
 Yes, and often this one is littered 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.690
 was burning 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.549
 this error is out of parallelism 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.019
 horizon line relative to the top and 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.879
 bottom edge of the photo 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.370
 to place a picture with littered 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.469
 horizon on his page on the social network 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.510
 be prepared for what to you in 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.189
 comments can on run this role or 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.199
 really worth noting that sometimes 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.509
 littered horizon is used for 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.180
 giving the picture an extra express 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.820
 and atmospheric this reception got 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.280
 name is dutch or german corner 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.130
 however, they should not be abused 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.160
 next issue we will discuss necessarily 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.660
 whether to immediately purchase expensive equipment 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.820
 is it possible using a simple soap dish 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.919
 make good pictures what is 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.060
 megapixel and how important is their 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.060
 quantity more
