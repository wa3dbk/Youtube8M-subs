00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
there's a lot of confusion about what

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.520 
there's a lot of confusion about what
medicines<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.770> available<00:01:44.630> how<00:01:45.630> they<00:01:46.229> get

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
medicines are available how they get

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.559 
medicines are available how they get
into<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.979> hands<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.490> beekeepers<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
into the hands of the beekeepers and

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.469 
into the hands of the beekeepers and
whether<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.469> beekeepers<00:01:50.219> are<00:01:50.520> qualified

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
whether the beekeepers are qualified

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.770 
whether the beekeepers are qualified
have<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.049> information<00:01:53.299> will<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.450> indeed

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
have the information will have indeed

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.020 
have the information will have indeed
the<00:01:54.929> money<00:01:55.109> and<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:56.009> able<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.610> use<00:01:56.789> them

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the money and to be able to use them

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.969 
the money and to be able to use them
clearly<00:01:57.569> the<00:01:57.750> competence<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.380> beekeepers

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
clearly the competence of beekeepers

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.249 
clearly the competence of beekeepers
needs<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.490> maximized<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.929> even<00:02:01.200> when

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
needs to be maximized but even when

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.169 
needs to be maximized but even when
you've<00:02:01.439> done<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.679> it<00:02:02.159> isn't<00:02:02.459> adequate<00:02:02.939> if

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
you've done that it isn't adequate if

you've done that it isn't adequate if

products would be health because that's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.420 
products would be health because that's

critical<00:02:54.240> mass<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.630> use<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.470> we<00:02:55.770> get

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
critical mass of use so that we get

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.770 
critical mass of use so that we get
enough<00:02:56.160> money<00:02:56.340> into<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.790> system<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.630> we

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
enough money into the system so that we

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.930 
enough money into the system so that we
can<00:02:57.870> get<00:02:57.990> new<00:02:58.230> products<00:02:58.770> created<00:02:59.340> yeah<00:02:59.760> we

pollination and therefore for

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.710 
pollination and therefore for
productivity<00:03:10.970> we<00:03:11.970> work<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.270> animal<00:03:12.540> health

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
productivity we work in animal health

where<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.739> try<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.040> develop<00:03:14.360> medicines<00:03:15.360> that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
where we try and develop medicines that

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.030 
where we try and develop medicines that
protect<00:03:16.890> bees<00:03:17.459> from<00:03:17.790> getting<00:03:18.360> sick<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.769> there

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
protect bees from getting sick so there

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.979 
protect bees from getting sick so there
did<00:03:20.550> several<00:03:20.850> fronts<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.300> we're<00:03:21.540> active<00:03:21.870> on
