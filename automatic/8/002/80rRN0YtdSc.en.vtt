00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 ah 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.580
 good this exhibition is an exhibition 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.580
 permanent that is characterized by two 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.400
 some things are this collection that is 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.290
 very old dates from the end of the years 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.300
 50 of animals that are maintained by 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.910
 taxidermy they have are animals with 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.550
 congenital malformations and the second 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.070
 part that is the part of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.630
 parasitology that serves us for the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.780
 communication also of public health 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.910
 and in the background when they come to visit us 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.140
 we can tell a bit what the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.089
 more complex diseases 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.600
 we have many specimens that there are not in 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.580
 no other part of the world for example 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.430
 this one that is here that is a crisis 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.559
 congenital that is a calf that has 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.019
 a malformation that is hereditary and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.400
 which is because of a genetic problem 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.890
 this is a beef calf yesterday and as 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.739
 you can see it's really weird because 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.129
 has a very complex malformation not 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.900
 has the edge of the eyes does not have what 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.370
 which corresponds to the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.230
 I nose up and call it a 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.630
 nasal and maxillofacial class because good 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.280
 it is missing most of the nose and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.710
 the maxilla 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.470
 this other a calf that has a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.960
 malformation hip level this 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.780
 it is a fetus that is modified but 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.580
 we also see that something is missing from what 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.800
 missing here in the head the head does not 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.810
 formed then he is considered a 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.730
 Ok, well, this one of the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.580
 specimens that I love to show 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.860
 and especially when children come to us 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.510
 because I ask them what species and in 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.930
 actually it's hard to recognize the 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.229
 species and is a pig is a little pig and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.619
 What this piglet has is that in the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.690
 background suffers from microcephaly his head does not 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.090
 was developed proportionally and 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.030
 therefore a very small head is 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.750
 paw has four fingers at the bottom of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.730
 a polydactyly the cyclops are 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.850
 also generated a good malformation 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.340
 where a failure occurs in the division in 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.490
 the bilateral background of the face and so 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.860
 so much remains one eye as you see 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.240
 there is no nose and good they have this mouth a 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.000
 little more more deformed 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.790
 It is one of the last specimens that 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.180
 arrived that in the background is an animal with 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.820
 two faces and this is called 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.100
 prosoft here we have another one that has two 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.310
 faces 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.100
 then we have this that is a fetus 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.440
 bovine also that has no extremities 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.410
 then it is said that it has an amelia 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.470
 complete this 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.990
 it's really weird and this is a fuzzy love 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.700
 balloons is called so that one could 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.320
 cut this in half 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.170
 tissues appear that can be 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.959
 example hair molars 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.540
 muscle etc. and this generally 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.569
 find when a normal fetus is born a 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.610
 Normal bovine can come attached to it 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.909
 but externally let's say for another 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.519
 umbilical cord this tissue good this 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.590
 a goat and if you can 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.440
 count the legs have seven legs in 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.200
 instead of having the four that should 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:24.190
 should have already that is called 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.790
 stage because it has seven legs we have 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.690
 this one that is an animal that is suffered from 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.040
 hydrocephalus which is also a 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.790
 disease that may affect the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.300
 here is human and good partner months 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.390
 this case is a Siamese that has two 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.000
 heads four front legs two 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.310
 tails and two hind legs and the last 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.620
 that we have here is a calf despite 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.060
 that looks to be someone else 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.860
 animal is a calf that has a 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.460
 problem in bone development 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.660
 long and cartilage growth 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.590
 the bones and therefore it remained 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.830
 little one these are things that happen in 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.800
 nature and that is not so normal that 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.380
 occur and allow us to integrate the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.200
 community to a space that was 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:21.380
 recovered because it was restored and that we 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.380
 allows to entertain and that also educate
