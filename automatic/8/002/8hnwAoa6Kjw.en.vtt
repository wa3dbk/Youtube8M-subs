00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
hits multiple times and it can just keep

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
hits multiple times and it can just keep
you<00:00:53.579> below<00:00:53.940> health<00:00:54.210> gate<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:54.809> kill<00:00:55.079> you

their slag or corrosive balls come down

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.800 
their slag or corrosive balls come down
in<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:04.580> kind<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.760> spread<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.180> pattern

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
in a very kind of spread out pattern

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.780 
in a very kind of spread out pattern
those<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.439> actually<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:07.950> past<00:01:08.189> health<00:01:08.549> gate

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
those can actually get past health gate

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850 
those can actually get past health gate
as<00:01:08.939> well<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> first<00:01:09.990> ball<00:01:10.260> will<00:01:10.439> hit<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
as well like the first ball will hit you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.980 
as well like the first ball will hit you
and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.820> maybe<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.270> last<00:01:12.450> ball<00:01:12.780> will

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and then maybe the last ball will

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.840 
and then maybe the last ball will
actually<00:01:13.020> kill<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.280> that's<00:01:14.610> pretty

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
actually kill you and that's pretty

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.749 
actually kill you and that's pretty
aggravating<00:01:15.500> I<00:01:16.500> got<00:01:17.009> kind<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> lucky<00:01:17.400> there

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
aggravating I got kind of lucky there

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.520 
aggravating I got kind of lucky there
and<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.060> caught<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.420> fearless<00:01:18.869> bonus<00:01:19.259> while

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and I caught a fearless bonus while

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
and I caught a fearless bonus while
Hylian<00:01:20.040> was<00:01:20.430> holding<00:01:20.880> its<00:01:21.000> head<00:01:21.150> still<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
Hylian was holding its head still and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.499 
Hylian was holding its head still and
that<00:01:22.500> allowed<00:01:22.740> me<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:22.979> get<00:01:23.189> extra<00:01:23.610> damage<00:01:24.119> but

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
that allowed me to get extra damage but

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.240 
that allowed me to get extra damage but
more<00:01:24.659> importantly<00:01:25.110> extra<00:01:25.500> fire<00:01:25.710> rate<00:01:25.979> while

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
more importantly extra fire rate while

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.280 
more importantly extra fire rate while
it<00:01:26.460> had<00:01:26.640> its<00:01:26.820> head<00:01:26.970> completely<00:01:27.450> still<00:01:27.600> there<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it had its head completely still there I

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
it had its head completely still there I
was<00:01:29.009> able<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.250> get<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> lot<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.670> extra<00:01:29.850> damage

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
was able to get a lot of extra damage

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
was able to get a lot of extra damage

that way now I'm just trying to keep it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.069 
that way now I'm just trying to keep it
slacked<00:01:32.820> hoping<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.600> will<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.840> able<00:01:33.960> to

second wind opportunities which I you
know<00:02:17.440> will<00:02:17.650> probably<00:02:17.830> need<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.610> that's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
know will probably need so that's

know an infallible and irreversible
death<00:02:35.440> sentence<00:02:35.830> but<00:02:36.100> it's<00:02:36.280> pretty<00:02:36.640> close<00:02:37.060> so

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
death sentence but it's pretty close so

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.660 
death sentence but it's pretty close so
I<00:02:38.110> was<00:02:38.440> able<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.680> get<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.860> second<00:02:39.160> wind<00:02:39.340> off<00:02:39.520> one

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
I was able to get a second wind off one

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.949 
I was able to get a second wind off one
of<00:02:39.700> those<00:02:39.850> little<00:02:40.060> dragons<00:02:40.480> there<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.720> got<00:02:40.930> a

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
of those little dragons there I got a

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.900 
of those little dragons there I got a
critical<00:02:41.350> hit<00:02:41.500> off<00:02:41.620> those<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.520> that's<00:02:42.700> really

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
critical hit off those and that's really

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.670 
critical hit off those and that's really
good<00:02:43.180> because<00:02:43.360> those<00:02:43.690> have<00:02:43.930> kind<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.320> small

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680

up incinerator here but I'm getting a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.420 
up incinerator here but I'm getting a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
lot of critical ascension stacks in the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.400 
lot of critical ascension stacks in the
process<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.239> if<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.900> have<00:02:56.050> enough<00:02:56.260> critical

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
process and if you have enough critical

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.290 
process and if you have enough critical
ascension<00:02:57.040> stacks<00:02:57.280> it's<00:02:57.489> quite<00:02:57.760> alright<00:02:57.910> if

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
ascension stacks it's quite alright if

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.540 
ascension stacks it's quite alright if
only<00:02:58.660> one<00:02:58.840> dragon<00:02:59.290> levels<00:02:59.620> up<00:02:59.800> because<00:03:00.370> it's

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
only one dragon levels up because it's

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.050 
only one dragon levels up because it's
not<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.910> bad<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.810> I'd<00:03:01.959> rather<00:03:02.170> fight

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
not that bad and I'd rather fight

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.270 
not that bad and I'd rather fight

incinerator without boosts being alive

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.820

than<00:03:06.640> fight<00:03:07.000> incinerator<00:03:07.540> at<00:03:07.870> one<00:03:08.590> lower

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
than fight incinerator at one lower

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.340 
than fight incinerator at one lower
level<00:03:09.310> with<00:03:09.489> boosts<00:03:09.820> still<00:03:10.000> being<00:03:10.209> there<00:03:10.510> so

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
level with boosts still being there so

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.380 
level with boosts still being there so
I'll<00:03:11.470> go<00:03:11.620> ahead<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:12.130> take<00:03:12.550> boost<00:03:12.880> out<00:03:13.090> now

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
I'll go ahead and take boost out now

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.479 
should have wanted and that kind of
irritated<00:03:26.560> me<00:03:26.680> when<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:26.860> was<00:03:27.010> trying<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.310> do

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
irritated me when I was trying to do

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.300 
irritated me when I was trying to do
this<00:03:27.840> when<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.930> dragons<00:03:29.290> take<00:03:29.500> off<00:03:29.680> after

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
this when the dragons take off after

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.790 
this when the dragons take off after
coming<00:03:30.820> down<00:03:30.850> momentarily<00:03:31.510> like<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.170> once

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
coming down momentarily like that once

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.770 
coming down momentarily like that once
they<00:03:32.950> actually<00:03:33.520> land<00:03:33.790> again<00:03:34.180> they're<00:03:34.600> going

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
they actually land again they're going

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.430 
they actually land again they're going
to<00:03:34.900> have<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.890> much<00:03:36.489> lower<00:03:36.850> or<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.780> much<00:03:38.140> shorter

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
to have a much lower or a much shorter

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.640 
to have a much lower or a much shorter
time<00:03:38.620> on<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.670> ground<00:03:40.060> on<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.570> platform<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.560> I

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
time on the ground on the platform and I

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.710 
time on the ground on the platform and I
think<00:03:41.860> that's<00:03:42.010> mighty<00:03:42.700> aggravating<00:03:43.390> because

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
think that's mighty aggravating because

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.060 
think that's mighty aggravating because
I<00:03:43.989> might<00:03:44.320> have<00:03:44.350> been<00:03:44.560> able<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.859> kill

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
I might have been able to kill

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.990 
I might have been able to kill
incinerator<00:03:45.670> in<00:03:45.910> one<00:03:46.150> landing

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
incinerator in one landing

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.110 
incinerator in one landing
maybe<00:03:47.810> if<00:03:48.410> he<00:03:48.770> didn't<00:03:49.069> glitch<00:03:49.370> out<00:03:49.610> on<00:03:49.819> me<00:03:50.000> I

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
maybe if he didn't glitch out on me I

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.610 
maybe if he didn't glitch out on me I
don't<00:03:50.239> know<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:52.989> can<00:03:53.989> be<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.230> judge<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.470> that

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
don't know you can be the judge of that

don't know you can be the judge of that
you'll<00:03:55.010> notice<00:03:55.310> how<00:03:55.430> quickly<00:03:55.700> he<00:03:55.910> takes<00:03:56.150> off

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
you'll notice how quickly he takes off

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.960 
you'll notice how quickly he takes off
here<00:03:56.599> and<00:03:57.019> how<00:03:57.920> quickly<00:03:58.190> we're<00:03:58.489> doing<00:03:58.760> damage

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
to him again just trying to boost my

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.410 
to him again just trying to boost my
damage<00:04:02.930> using<00:04:03.110> slag<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.769> death<00:04:03.950> mark<00:04:04.420> but

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
yeah look how quickly he took off I feel

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.030 
yeah look how quickly he took off I feel
like<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.599> it's<00:04:08.810> definitely<00:04:09.050> not<00:04:09.410> any<00:04:09.769> good

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
like that it's definitely not any good

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
one while he was in the air to maintain

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.590 
one while he was in the air to maintain
my<00:04:18.680> critical<00:04:19.070> ascension<00:04:19.430> stacks<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.000> then<00:04:20.510> I

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
my critical ascension stacks and then I

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.750 
my critical ascension stacks and then I
get<00:04:20.780> one<00:04:20.959> off<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.320> little<00:04:21.560> dragon<00:04:21.919> there<00:04:22.130> the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
reason I chose to kill the little dragon

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.010 
reason I chose to kill the little dragon
was<00:04:24.590> because<00:04:24.889> I<00:04:25.010> wanted<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.639> grenade<00:04:26.450> because<00:04:26.840> I

almost down in the killing Lorraine to

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.530 
almost down in the killing Lorraine to
be<00:04:42.800> very<00:04:43.040> important<00:04:43.430> if<00:04:43.520> I'm<00:04:43.639> using<00:04:43.790> melee<00:04:44.270> but

be very important if I'm using melee but

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.990 
be very important if I'm using melee but
obviously<00:04:44.930> I'm<00:04:45.110> not<00:04:45.320> have<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.460> use<00:04:46.580> my<00:04:46.760> mallow
