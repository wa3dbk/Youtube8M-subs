00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.940
 is the same 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.570
 hello enduro friends pro how are you? 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.150
 we find the two more bikes 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.220
 powerful of the urban range the 501 and 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.170
 four and a half we're going to prepare 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.370
 for today a test a bit special not 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.350
 let's do something really 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.350
 spectacular with incredible folding and 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.239
 precisely magazine breaks we're going 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.489
 to make a route, let's check how 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.260
 motorcycles behave in a use 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.940
 usual that you can have 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.739
 doing some roads some 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.090
 Trialeras and let's enjoy them 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.570
 in a really hard terrain 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.570
 do not 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.890
 500 and 450 the two largest bikes that 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.660
 We manufacture vargas and good for this year 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.850
 what they bring new are main 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.310
 Novelty the fork 4 cs white power 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.630
 because since I would tell different in 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.400
 the two bikes but good is a 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.810
 fork that can be regulated with 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.390
 pressures rebounds from the top 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.940
 and they have bet on varna a lot for her 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.650
 this year also the new decoration and 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.210
 good little changes since you know that 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.490
 the good ones are the bikes that 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.680
 they renovated in the past year completely 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.150
 and nothing just to fine tune a little 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.690
 the new etienne injection of 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.690
 suspension 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.390
 the landscape we have here we are 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.819
 enjoying an amazing day in 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.270
 land from Castilla is a true 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.270
 pass 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.170
 come let's do enduro of the good 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.170
 down 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.010
 love 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.860
 plus 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.400
 that's 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.790
 well let's face the second part 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.260
 the lethal trialera is recording yes to see 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.610
 how are you giving us they feel so 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.020
 light as we said before that 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.020
 we started thinking that no 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.030
 cruise 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.650
 as a subject of heat the soft ones 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.440
 all right 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.110
 when you have 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.250
 we lack a little bit of form 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.250
 but let's go up 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.070
 I do not know about you but tell them this 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.070
 revised 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.680
 there is 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.680
 and in the pull up 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.760
 m 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.180
 I tried to do 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.990
 now they are going to vote 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.760
 ah 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.549
 well we have already finished the route healthy and 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.769
 saved did not show a good beating 

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:12.029
 especially the area of ​​the trialera we have 

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:13.799
 could see that as we told you 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.959
 principle if you notice a little bit more 

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:17.819
 heavy that can be a two times or 

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:20.099
 two and a half four times that 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:22.559
 handle better in these lides but good 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.659
 we have left the quagmire we need a 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:26.309
 little depth beyond the Ebro 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.079
 it has been that we have lacked physical form 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:31.289
 to us because they are demanding motorcycles 

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:33.299
 but then making roads and routes 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.679
 narrow and such are super bikes 

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:36.839
 manageable we have enjoyed very much 

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:38.729
 also that the climate and the 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:40.169
 ground was perfect to ride ni 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.369
 nothing but we hope that we have 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.049
 conveyed well the sensations of the 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:45.119
 motorcycle and have enjoyed the video 

00:05:43.049 --> 00:05:47.719
 as much as we do it always 

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:47.719
 enduro pro 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.660
 besides low
