our tutorial on how to setup a me do
this<00:00:39.290> not<00:00:40.290> too<00:00:40.410> hard<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.680> promise<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.940> set

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
this not too hard I promise I'm to set

this not too hard I promise I'm to set
up<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.450> DB<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:43.079> SD<00:00:44.010> SDK<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.489> ATV<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.840> use

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
up a DB for SD SDK and ATV so we can use

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.750 
up a DB for SD SDK and ATV so we can use
that<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.680> next<00:00:46.890> step<00:00:47.039> we're<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that for the next step we're going to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.500 
that for the next step we're going to

going to highlight the code control see
you<00:03:13.800> copy

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
you copy

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.720 
you copy

and control V to paste it in there you
can't<00:03:21.300> control<00:03:21.720> V<00:03:23.569> like<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.019> then<00:03:25.110> you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
can't control V like that and then you

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.649 
can't control V like that and then you
can<00:03:25.349> read<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.069> in<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:27.120> command<00:03:27.269> prompt

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
can read it so in the command prompt

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.030 
can read it so in the command prompt
then<00:03:27.840> we're<00:03:27.989> going<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.170> type<00:03:28.319> fastboot<00:03:28.739> OEM

then we're going to type fastboot OEM
unlock<00:03:29.510> space<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.870> then<00:03:31.230> type<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.099> code

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
unlock space and then type in that code

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.320 
unlock space and then type in that code
then<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.250> want<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.459> double<00:03:35.760> check<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:36.180> and

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
then you want to double check it and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.680 
then you want to double check it and

and it should say unlock complete and

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.270 
and it should say unlock complete and
it'll<00:03:41.660> reboot<00:03:42.020> the<00:03:42.200> device<00:03:42.290> eventually<00:03:43.190> the

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
it'll reboot the device eventually the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.250 
it'll reboot the device eventually the
device<00:03:43.490> will<00:03:43.700> reboot<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.450> have<00:03:44.600> wiped<00:03:44.840> itself

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
device will reboot and have wiped itself

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.500 
device will reboot and have wiped itself
