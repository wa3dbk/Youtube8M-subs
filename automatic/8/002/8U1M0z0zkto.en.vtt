00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.070
 hello good morning, we'll talk later 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.380
 a little bit about the amazing 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.440
 and the butterfly written by the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.330
 jean dominique bauby he did not score 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.860
 It 's a little port for you guys. 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.810
 even is tiny 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.730
 he was a renewable journalist is the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.680
 editor in chief of elle magazine but if not 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.809
 I 'm wrong, I do not know if he owned it. 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.390
 heliosfera anyway he's one of the heads 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.699
 there on a beautiful day he is 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.760
 taking his son for a walk and he 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.310
 suffers from a sudden malady suddenly he 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.320
 have one time and he does not recover 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.149
 when he wakes up and discovers that he 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.860
 is with the lord jim syndrome will 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.440
 appear written here sometime 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.570
 he is totally paralyzed the only one 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.460
 thing that still works is the only organ 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.380
 of it that still works perfectly is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.380
 one of the eyes actually the two eyes 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.270
 work only that one of the eyes is the 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.300
 themselves do not close so he needs to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.040
 end up having to have the eye sewn and 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.229
 such as to have a complication 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.750
 even more so has only one eye 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.700
 working and it is with this eye that he 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.260
 edited this book my people the thing 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.210
 most impressive face of the earth 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.580
 this really really beautiful story 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.440
 very exciting even if it will 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.409
 ask yourself how you got it 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.750
 dictate a book only with the eye working 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.610
 so I highly recommend that you 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.049
 watch the movie he will tell a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.090
 little in the book also another movie 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.729
 becomes clearer because you see a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 doctor there to visit him daily 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.650
 It dictates the alphabet. 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.750
 the letter he wants it flashes and she 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.960
 not that letter and so it went like this 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.700
 that he wrote this book he 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.110
 they memorized all that night 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.970
 that he wanted to edit the next day 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.350
 she arrived they stayed hours and hours 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.930
 doing this 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.790
 the book is very beautiful, it's going to count 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.759
 then some memories of him from the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.009
 childhood his last hours on the day 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.860
 that he had a sudden illness at last the book 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.560
 It's beautiful and so we are a super book. 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.829
 the uppercut has the same 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.230
 100 pages is this chapter only a short 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.450
 news the gigantic letter you will see 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.079
 This one in a sitting is just a book. 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.329
 pretty 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.220
 I already told him, he will tell you about the good 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.680
 life that you had before 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.830
 about the children at last about the family 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.320
 about work all the glamor and beauty 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.560
 which he was inserted and suddenly he 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.270
 locked in his own body and people are 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.880
 very beautiful even this story the movie 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.860
 It's also beautiful, it's really worth it. 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.080
 I have the impression that the film has 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.930
 a little more detail than the book 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.490
 it 's not a thing like that, I do not think 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.600
 first time I see a movie that 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.910
 has a bit more detail than the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.670
 own book is but what happens here 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.620
 then you have only the account it okay 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.470
 and his impressions of how he 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.030
 is now living this way and these 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.750
 memories of him and everything else 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.850
 is the film also brings some details of 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.090
 relatives of friends then bringing 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.620
 some other points of view and also 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.140
 which will add a little history 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.760
 The movie is beautiful too, so there is no 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.680
 soundtrack that is the most 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.660
 The movie is already beginning with the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.180
 merck is one of the songs that I think more 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.730
 of the face of the earth selected are 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.800
 very good even with this then stay 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.160
 Hint to you, then, a beautiful book one 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.600
 movie and have you liked the video? 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.459
 forget to give a young man and help 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.910
 Share a kiss for everyone 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.910
 See you
