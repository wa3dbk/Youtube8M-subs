as<00:00:27.669> a<00:00:27.730> we're<00:00:28.599> technically<00:00:28.960> talking<00:00:29.320> about

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
as a we're technically talking about

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:43.560 
as a we're technically talking about
that

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.270 

so<00:00:44.570> if<00:00:44.690> you<00:00:44.810> saw<00:00:44.960> my<00:00:45.110> thoughts<00:00:45.440> on<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:45.800> 5d<00:00:46.100> mark

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
so if you saw my thoughts on the 5d mark

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.950 
so if you saw my thoughts on the 5d mark
3<00:00:46.340> when<00:00:46.670> it<00:00:46.730> was<00:00:46.820> first<00:00:46.940> announced<00:00:47.270> you<00:00:47.840> know

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
3 when it was first announced you know

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.210 
3 when it was first announced you know
that<00:00:48.110> I<00:00:48.140> was<00:00:48.320> only<00:00:48.530> actually<00:00:48.710> thrilled<00:00:49.070> about

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
that I was only actually thrilled about

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.400 
that I was only actually thrilled about
a<00:00:49.370> few<00:00:49.700> of<00:00:49.730> its<00:00:49.880> features<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.780> better<00:00:50.930> codec

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
a few of its features the better codec

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.500 
a few of its features the better codec
better<00:00:51.980> aliasing<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:52.670> more<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.850> control<00:00:53.300> and

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
better aliasing and more a control and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.870 
better aliasing and more a control and
of<00:00:53.750> course<00:00:54.020> better<00:00:54.380> low-light<00:00:54.620> performance

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
of course better low-light performance

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.680 
of course better low-light performance
now<00:00:55.880> it<00:00:55.970> seems<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.240> two<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:56.660> three

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
now it seems that two of the three

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.330 
now it seems that two of the three
improvements<00:00:57.380> are<00:00:57.500> available<00:00:57.920> for<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.130> mark

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
improvements are available for the mark

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.910 
improvements are available for the mark
2<00:00:58.550> as<00:00:58.700> well<00:00:58.910> in<00:00:59.360> a<00:00:59.720> sense<00:00:59.960> of<00:01:00.470> course<00:01:00.770> you've

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
2 as well in a sense of course you've

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.380 
2 as well in a sense of course you've
probably<00:01:01.130> heard<00:01:01.430> what<00:01:01.700> magic<00:01:01.970> lantern<00:01:02.239> is

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
probably heard what magic lantern is

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.030 
probably heard what magic lantern is
doing<00:01:02.600> with<00:01:02.750> raw<00:01:02.870> video<00:01:03.080> which<00:01:03.500> voids<00:01:03.950> the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
doing with raw video which voids the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.920 
doing with raw video which voids the
need<00:01:04.220> for<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.370> codec<00:01:04.670> whatsoever<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:05.449> the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
need for a codec whatsoever and the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.810 
need for a codec whatsoever and the
aliasing<00:01:06.380> filter<00:01:06.410> from<00:01:06.860> mosaic<00:01:07.280> engineering

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
aliasing filter from mosaic engineering

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.070 
aliasing filter from mosaic engineering
that<00:01:07.910> it<00:01:08.060> first<00:01:08.180> talked<00:01:08.390> about<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:08.690> episode<00:01:09.050> 11

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
that it first talked about in episode 11

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.560 
that it first talked about in episode 11
now<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:09.890> plan<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.310> do<00:01:10.490> some<00:01:10.670> extensive<00:01:11.030> testing

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
now I plan to do some extensive testing

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.240 
now I plan to do some extensive testing
with<00:01:11.660> raw<00:01:11.780> video<00:01:11.990> via<00:01:12.350> magic<00:01:12.740> lantern<00:01:13.040> when<00:01:13.130> it

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
with raw video via magic lantern when it

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.800 
with raw video via magic lantern when it
comes<00:01:13.430> out<00:01:13.550> of<00:01:13.670> alpha<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.270> if<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:14.690> know

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
comes out of alpha and if you know

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.780 
comes out of alpha and if you know
anything<00:01:15.200> about<00:01:15.259> Raw<00:01:15.530> photos<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.700> you

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
anything about Raw photos is that you

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.580 
anything about Raw photos is that you
can<00:01:16.910> get<00:01:17.030> up<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.150> two<00:01:17.450> stops<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.960> light<00:01:17.990> up<00:01:18.380> or

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
can get up to two stops of light up or

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.930 
can get up to two stops of light up or
down<00:01:18.740> that's<00:01:19.220> giving<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:19.550> better<00:01:19.729> low-light

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
down that's giving you better low-light

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.150 
down that's giving you better low-light
performance<00:01:20.119> on<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.750> mark<00:01:20.900> 2<00:01:21.080> anyway<00:01:21.560> but

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
performance on the mark 2 anyway but

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.380 
performance on the mark 2 anyway but
today<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.430> will<00:01:22.729> be<00:01:22.820> talking<00:01:22.970> about<00:01:23.210> the

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
today I will be talking about the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.150 
today I will be talking about the
anti-aliasing<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.380> more<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:24.560> filter<00:01:24.979> for

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
anti-aliasing and more a filter for

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.740 
anti-aliasing and more a filter for
mosaic<00:01:25.550> engineering<00:01:26.060> which<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:26.330> finally<00:01:26.570> got

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
mosaic engineering which I finally got

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.930 
mosaic engineering which I finally got
around<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:27.020> purchasing<00:01:27.530> now<00:01:28.130> for<00:01:28.490> most<00:01:28.610> people

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940

foresee<00:01:45.380> with<00:01:45.500> some<00:01:45.649> of<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.190> I'll<00:01:46.280> just

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
foresee with some of you and I'll just

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.890 
foresee with some of you and I'll just
mention<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.880> before<00:01:47.150> we<00:01:47.270> do<00:01:47.420> some<00:01:47.600> testing

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
mention it before we do some testing

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.719 
mention it before we do some testing
with<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:48.140> bad<00:01:48.290> boy<00:01:48.320> if<00:01:49.010> you<00:01:49.070> are<00:01:49.220> constantly

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
with this bad boy if you are constantly

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.460 
with this bad boy if you are constantly
switching<00:01:49.909> between<00:01:50.240> photos<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:50.930> videos<00:01:51.170> say

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
switching between photos and videos say

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.080 
switching between photos and videos say
for<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.740> wedding<00:01:52.010> or<00:01:52.280> whatever<00:01:52.430> you<00:01:53.060> should

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
for a wedding or whatever you should

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.310 
for a wedding or whatever you should
know<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.510> you<00:01:53.600> can't<00:01:53.870> actually<00:01:54.020> shoot

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
know that you can't actually shoot

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.780 
know that you can't actually shoot
photos<00:01:54.620> while<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.890> filter<00:01:55.190> is<00:01:55.280> in<00:01:55.370> the<00:01:55.460> camera

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
photos while the filter is in the camera

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.610 
photos while the filter is in the camera
of<00:01:56.360> course<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.810> doesn't<00:01:56.960> actually<00:01:57.170> take<00:01:57.500> that

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
of course it doesn't actually take that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.289 
of course it doesn't actually take that
long<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.950> put<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.190> filter<00:01:58.460> in<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.850> remove<00:01:59.119> it

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
long to put the filter in and remove it

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.820 
long to put the filter in and remove it
but<00:01:59.750> in<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.900> heat<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.170> wedding<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.560> may<00:02:00.680> not

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
but in the heat of a wedding you may not

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.340 
but in the heat of a wedding you may not
have<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.070> opportunity<00:02:01.659> well<00:02:02.659> how<00:02:02.990> long<00:02:03.200> does

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
have the opportunity well how long does

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:19.050 
have the opportunity well how long does
it<00:02:03.409> actually<00:02:03.740> take<00:02:05.500> what's<00:02:06.500> by<00:02:06.650> now

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.820 

so<00:02:19.630> now<00:02:19.810> let's<00:02:20.020> take<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.170> look<00:02:20.350> at<00:02:20.500> what<00:02:20.709> this

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
so now let's take a look at what this

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.710 
so now let's take a look at what this
filter<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:21.250> do<00:02:21.459> now<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.270> hardest<00:02:22.540> part

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
filter can do now for the hardest part

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.240 
filter can do now for the hardest part
of<00:02:22.810> my<00:02:22.870> day<00:02:22.900> looking<00:02:23.530> for<00:02:23.590> things<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.160> will

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
of my day looking for things that will

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.949 
of my day looking for things that will
actually<00:02:24.280> cause<00:02:24.730> aliasing<00:02:25.300> when<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.480> want<00:02:25.810> them

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
actually cause aliasing when I want them

00:02:25.959 --> 00:03:12.940 
actually cause aliasing when I want them
to

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610
