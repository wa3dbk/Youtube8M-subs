got the Walther p99 which sort of looks

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.370 
got the Walther p99 which sort of looks
a<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:01.079> bit<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> USP<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.140> could<00:02:04.259> be

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
a little bit like a USP so it could be

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.750 

as<00:03:03.020> we<00:03:03.230> know<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:03.590> can<00:03:03.770> take<00:03:03.950> down<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.430> room

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
as we know this can take down a room

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.640 
as we know this can take down a room
full<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.000> people<00:03:05.330> in<00:03:05.420> seconds<00:03:05.990> as<00:03:06.410> a

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
full of people in seconds as a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.710 
full of people in seconds as a
semi-automatic<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.670> it's<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.120> shotgun<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:08.630> it

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
semi-automatic and it's a shotgun so it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.660 
semi-automatic and it's a shotgun so it
puts<00:03:08.900> people<00:03:09.050> down<00:03:09.290> fast<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:13.370> one<00:03:13.550> right

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
puts people down fast this one right

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.240 
puts people down fast this one right
here<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.940> KSG<00:03:14.360> it's<00:03:14.870> got<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.440> it's

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
here is the KSG it's got to it's

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.770 
here is the KSG it's got to it's
basically<00:03:16.580> got<00:03:16.820> two<00:03:16.940> magazines<00:03:17.420> at<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.600> back

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
basically got two magazines at the back

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.460 
basically got two magazines at the back
and<00:03:18.050> you<00:03:18.110> switch<00:03:18.560> between<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:19.250> two<00:03:19.280> tubes<00:03:20.470> so

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
and you switch between the two tubes so

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.040 
and you switch between the two tubes so
all<00:03:21.710> in<00:03:21.830> all<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.070> have<00:03:22.190> 14<00:03:22.670> shells<00:03:23.270> in<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:24.020> gun

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
all in all you have 14 shells in the gun

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.350 
all in all you have 14 shells in the gun
so<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:24.770> probably<00:03:25.070> going<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.340> be<00:03:25.400> quite<00:03:26.090> good

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
so it's probably going to be quite good

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.880 
so it's probably going to be quite good
also<00:03:27.050> it's<00:03:27.170> pump<00:03:27.410> action

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.880 

this<00:03:34.890> is<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.130> m4<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.760> w5<00:03:36.380> which<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.500> going<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.770> be

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
this is the m4 I w5 which is going to be

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.280 
this is the m4 I w5 which is going to be
the<00:03:37.980> same<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:38.340> m4<00:03:38.670> carbine<00:03:39.120> here<00:03:40.050> we've<00:03:40.170> got<00:03:40.200> a

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
the same as m4 carbine here we've got a

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.540 
the same as m4 carbine here we've got a
dual<00:03:40.560> optics<00:03:41.040> site<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:41.700> uses<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.300> optics

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
dual optics site so it uses to optics

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.960 
dual optics site so it uses to optics
looks<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.670> bit<00:03:44.940> snazzy<00:03:45.740> no<00:03:46.740> I<00:03:46.770> mean<00:03:47.010> looks<00:03:47.730> quite

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
looks a bit snazzy no I mean looks quite

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.220 
looks a bit snazzy no I mean looks quite
nice<00:03:48.180> bit<00:03:49.140> too<00:03:49.320> fancy<00:03:49.770> though<00:03:53.300> this<00:03:54.300> is<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.540> g36c

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
nice bit too fancy though this is a g36c

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.350 
nice bit too fancy though this is a g36c
making<00:03:55.800> its<00:03:55.920> return<00:03:56.040> from<00:03:56.400> call<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.640> duty<00:03:56.850> 4<00:03:56.880> as

making its return from call of duty 4 as
we<00:03:58.350> know<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:58.830> a<00:03:58.980> really<00:03:59.220> good<00:03:59.400> gun<00:03:59.610> but<00:03:59.880> sites

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
we know it's a really good gun but sites

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.030 
we know it's a really good gun but sites
aren't<00:04:00.630> too<00:04:00.780> great<00:04:00.960> as<00:04:01.170> they<00:04:01.290> block<00:04:01.500> up<00:04:01.680> quite

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
aren't too great as they block up quite

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.910 
aren't too great as they block up quite
a<00:04:02.070> lot<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> field<00:04:03.200> sindhu<00:04:04.200> gun<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.530> magpul
