we're<00:00:43.210> using<00:00:43.360> a<00:00:43.570> hey<00:00:44.019> 77<00:00:44.739> pro<00:00:44.980> for<00:00:45.250> MVP<00:00:45.989> asrock

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
we're using a hey 77 pro for MVP asrock

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.110 
we're using a hey 77 pro for MVP asrock
motherboard<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.460> we're<00:00:48.610> using<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.970> haight

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
motherboard and we're using the haight

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.810 
motherboard and we're using the haight
77<00:00:49.719> chipset<00:00:50.110> because<00:00:50.320> again<00:00:50.590> we're<00:00:51.340> using<00:00:51.370> in

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
77 chipset because again we're using in

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.430 
77 chipset because again we're using in
a<00:00:52.350> non<00:00:53.350> k<00:00:53.950> series<00:00:54.250> cpu<00:00:54.850> so<00:00:55.120> it's<00:00:55.300> it's<00:00:55.510> lot<00:00:55.870> as

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
a non k series cpu so it's it's lot as

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.840 
a non k series cpu so it's it's lot as
far<00:00:56.559> as<00:00:56.770> a<00:00:56.800> multiply<00:00:57.190> go<00:00:57.399> so<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:57.640> might<00:00:57.760> be

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
far as a multiply go so you might be

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.040 
far as a multiply go so you might be
doing<00:00:57.969> any<00:00:58.210> overclocking<00:00:58.719> from<00:00:58.960> the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
doing any overclocking from the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.320 
doing any overclocking from the
multiplier<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:01.829> also<00:01:02.829> got<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.250> loose<00:01:04.289> HD<00:01:05.289> 7870

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
multiplier and also got a loose HD 7870

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.690 
multiplier and also got a loose HD 7870
with<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.420> direct<00:01:07.720> CU<00:01:07.899> 2<00:01:08.200> color<00:01:08.470> on<00:01:08.619> there<00:01:08.800> so

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
with the direct CU 2 color on there so

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.160 
with the direct CU 2 color on there so
i'll<00:01:10.060> be<00:01:10.180> doing<00:01:10.300> an<00:01:10.509> unboxing<00:01:10.570> and

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
i'll be doing an unboxing and

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.109 
i'll be doing an unboxing and
benchmarking<00:01:12.100> review<00:01:12.369> on<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.610> as<00:01:12.729> well<00:01:12.850> so

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
benchmarking review on that as well so

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.160 
benchmarking review on that as well so

that's all using that 700 watt psu so
I'll<00:02:31.580> just<00:02:31.610> take<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:32.030> for<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:32.240> closer<00:02:32.510> look<00:02:32.720> so

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
you can see some of the detail there I

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.440 
you can see some of the detail there I
do<00:02:36.710> like<00:02:37.100> these<00:02:37.310> loose<00:02:37.610> graphics<00:02:38.060> cards<00:02:38.360> I

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
do like these loose graphics cards I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.640 
do like these loose graphics cards I
think<00:02:38.630> they<00:02:38.690> look<00:02:38.810> nice<00:02:41.650> unfortunately

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650

as<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.100> see<00:02:49.340> but<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:51.530> doesn't<00:02:51.860> actually

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
as you can see but this doesn't actually

have<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.280> clear<00:02:52.670> side<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.600> it's<00:02:54.170> not<00:02:54.350> hopefully

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
have a clear side so it's not hopefully

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.930 
have a clear side so it's not hopefully
not<00:02:55.130> going<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.400> too<00:02:55.520> much<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.700> an<00:02:55.880> issue
