00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:15.179
 Hi all 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.089
 today I want to bring a discussion topic 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.190
 we have all heard 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.319
 that not all the bible should be taken literally 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.059
 since there are parts that are just metaphors and others and are literal 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.430
 now all this creates confusion since all the people interpret the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.660
 bible in different ways thus creating gerrans between the different branches 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.160
 of Christianity 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.240
 apart from that when an atheist refutes something in the bible for an error that 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.100
 has today either something immoral something like this always happens 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.200
 look what I found in the bible 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.450
 this verse is immoral, look at it for yourself 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.540
 Psalm 137 verse 9 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.780
 happy I will take and star your children against the rock 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.970
 what kind of morality is this 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.290
 how a child crashes can be a blessing 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.720
 foolish man 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.000
 that is not something literal is something metaphorical porteÃ±a refers to the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.390
 word of God 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.880
 but you do not understand it because of your lack of faith I challenge you to a crime that begins on 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.860
 20 that start on the 25th can leave absorbed there is no train 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.770
 descendant of the climacteric monkey the horse if you do not understand the bible is 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.260
 because you're a stupid stupid son of a devil 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.920
 and things like that xd 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.210
 Believers do not decide which parts of the Bible are literal and 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.950
 what are metaphors 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.070
 examples of these would be the story of adam and eva some say it's something 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.070
 literally and that it really was that way and others that that was metaphor 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.369
 another example would be the literal hell or metaphor 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.109
 and so there are no other cases 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.280
 but the most common are when you find something immoral or unpleasant 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 Now my question for believers is 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.810
 there is some indicator or meter that says exactly what part of the bible is 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.150
 literal and what part is metaphorical 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.699
 how they do it to identify a truth of a metaphor 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.829
 but of course an indicator that is not that of Tenerife and ask for an understanding 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.119
 goodbye 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:18.289
 So I propose something to you, but if the believers are to leave 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:20.489
 your comments on the subject 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.560
 if you can make a video giving your point of view about whether the bible is read 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.769
 literally or metaphorically I would appreciate it 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.429
 can you put it in response to this video 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.959
 and if they already have a video of the subject they can also leave it as a 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.399
 answer 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:39.149
 I already know that the subject may seem stupid to the naked eye but for the 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.759
 previous examples I think you will realize the importance of the subject 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:48.089
 believers and their interpretations are contradictory when discussing issues 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:49.599
 religious is treated 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.230
 and for you believers this should be important, do not be late or 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.090
 early they end up saying that the whole bible is a metaphor and that nothing 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.369
 which says never happened xd 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:04.459
 so you know how to comment and give your opinion all comments are 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.939
 welcome the only rules are 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.269
 no insults from both sides 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.629
 Feel free to comment here there will be no insults comments 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.769
 offensive and intolerant will be deleted 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.079
 and second do not leave more than two comments explaining your point of view 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.749
 try to make it as short as possible 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:28.689
 and comment as civilized beings 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.709
 the videos will not have any time limit 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.859
 I only ask you to be well argued 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.509
 you know I hope your comments and videos answer 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.509
 until next time 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.229
 soccer as sensors
