this tons and tons of youth and it's not

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.930 
this tons and tons of youth and it's not
that<00:04:10.799> kind<00:04:10.889> of<00:04:11.010> lingers<00:04:11.310> it's<00:04:11.459> really<00:04:11.730> right

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
that kind of lingers it's really right

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.180 
that kind of lingers it's really right
on<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.239> tongue<00:04:12.480> siliceous<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.650> think<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.069> only

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
on the tongue siliceous I think the only

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.750 
on the tongue siliceous I think the only
way<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.370> cool<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.670> down<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.510> keep<00:04:15.720> anymore

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.210 

so<00:04:20.760> this<00:04:20.910> is<00:04:21.030> like<00:04:21.150> rose<00:04:21.510> petal<00:04:21.959> lusty<00:04:22.710> which

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
so this is like rose petal lusty which

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.420 
so this is like rose petal lusty which
is<00:04:23.340> like<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.900> yogurt<00:04:24.900> based<00:04:25.169> drink<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:25.650> did<00:04:26.310> you
