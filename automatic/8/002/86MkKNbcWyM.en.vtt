00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
hi I'm George churchville from tech 2000

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.280 
hi I'm George churchville from tech 2000
and<00:00:12.030> I'm<00:00:12.120> here<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.420> demonstrate<00:00:12.599> what's

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and I'm here to demonstrate what's

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.890 
and I'm here to demonstrate what's
possible<00:00:13.769> with<00:00:13.920> Cisco<00:00:14.340> learning<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.540> let's

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
possible with Cisco learning so let's

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.300 
possible with Cisco learning so let's
take<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.080> look<00:00:16.289> at<00:00:16.379> our<00:00:16.440> cisco<00:00:16.710> learning<00:00:17.130> kit

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
take a look at our cisco learning kit

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.570 
take a look at our cisco learning kit
here<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.820> we're<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> open<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.840> up<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
here and we're going to open it up and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.700 
here and we're going to open it up and
we've<00:00:20.580> now<00:00:20.910> gone<00:00:21.210> green<00:00:21.600> at<00:00:21.869> Cisco<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.529> let's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
we've now gone green at Cisco so let's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.670 
we've now gone green at Cisco so let's
open<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.160> our<00:00:23.340> course<00:00:23.640> where<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.470> we'll<00:00:25.470> see

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
open up our course where and we'll see

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.730 
open up our course where and we'll see
we're<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:25.980> single<00:00:26.760> area<00:00:27.090> ospf<00:00:27.869> implementation

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
we're in single area ospf implementation

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.439 
we're in single area ospf implementation
so<00:00:29.490> what<00:00:29.580> we're<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.119> work

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
so what we're going to do is work

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.229 
so what we're going to do is work
through<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.840> material<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.820> we<00:00:32.820> could<00:00:33.059> see

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
through this material and we could see

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.000 
through this material and we could see
we<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.510> expand<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.770> move

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
we can expand it and we're going to move

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.880 
we can expand it and we're going to move
ourselves<00:00:35.190> forward<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.800> we're<00:00:37.800> going

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
ourselves forward here and we're going

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
ourselves forward here and we're going
to<00:00:37.950> focus<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.550> topic<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.090> router

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to focus on a topic for router

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.170 
to focus on a topic for router
configuration<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
configuration so here we can see the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.630 
configuration so here we can see the
router<00:00:42.390> commands<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.350> need<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.579> we

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
router commands that we need and if we

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.299 
router commands that we need and if we
need<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> add<00:00:45.300> more<00:00:45.989> information<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:47.010> our

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
need to add more information to our

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.100 
need to add more information to our
lecture<00:00:47.850> material<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.570> another<00:00:48.809> type<00:00:49.079> of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
lecture material we have another type of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
bring up our lab environment and let's

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.840 
bring up our lab environment and let's
bring<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.310> down<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.540> we'll<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.619> login

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.660 

and<00:01:17.850> let's<00:01:18.360> bring<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.720> in

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
so now moving into a work robe router so

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.410 
so now moving into a work robe router so
i<00:01:28.369> can<00:01:28.700> select<00:01:28.909> my<00:01:29.210> router<00:01:29.450> here<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:31.210> away<00:01:32.210> we

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
i can select my router here and away we

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.510 
i can select my router here and away we
go<00:01:32.679> or<00:01:33.679> group<00:01:33.950> outer<00:01:34.219> one<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.869> where<00:01:36.229> we<00:01:36.380> go<00:01:39.520> so

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
go or group outer one and where we go so

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.999 
go or group outer one and where we go so
i'm<00:01:40.880> now<00:01:41.090> at<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.390> router<00:01:41.600> prompt<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.350> i<00:01:42.770> could

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
i'm now at the router prompt and i could

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.569 
i'm now at the router prompt and i could
enable<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:48.229> we<00:01:48.500> could<00:01:48.649> do<00:01:48.890> things<00:01:49.280> that

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
enable and we could do things that

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.109 
enable and we could do things that
involve<00:01:49.939> our<00:01:50.509> lecture<00:01:51.350> material<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.729> we'll<00:01:52.939> be

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
involve our lecture material so we'll be

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.600 
involve our lecture material so we'll be
able<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.360> see<00:01:53.649> so<00:01:54.649> all<00:01:54.829> our<00:01:54.860> lecture

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
able to see so all our lecture

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.160 
able to see so all our lecture
information<00:01:56.119> is<00:01:56.179> now<00:01:56.329> supported<00:01:56.899> by<00:01:57.020> an

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
information is now supported by an

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.789 
information is now supported by an
online<00:01:57.679> lab<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.539> we<00:01:59.539> can<00:01:59.780> switch<00:02:00.229> from<00:02:00.259> that

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
online lab and we can switch from that

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.889 
online lab and we can switch from that
once<00:02:01.729> we<00:02:01.909> think<00:02:02.149> we<00:02:02.270> have<00:02:02.299> enough<00:02:02.659> knowledge

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
once we think we have enough knowledge

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.089 
once we think we have enough knowledge
in<00:02:03.229> this<00:02:03.349> area<00:02:03.739> and<00:02:03.909> bring<00:02:04.909> up<00:02:05.030> an<00:02:05.179> exam<00:02:05.539> prep

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
in this area and bring up an exam prep

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.620 
in this area and bring up an exam prep
so<00:02:07.099> now<00:02:07.220> I<00:02:07.250> think<00:02:07.369> I'm<00:02:07.610> ready<00:02:07.640> for<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.149> exam<00:02:08.239> in
