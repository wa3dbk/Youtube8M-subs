and I was sitting on a route that caused

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.009 
and I was sitting on a route that caused
a<00:00:28.710> great<00:00:29.039> deal<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.310> pain<00:00:29.730> he<00:00:30.119> left<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.869> I

continued to sit there and I went

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.979 
continued to sit there and I went
through<00:00:32.759> many<00:00:33.030> many<00:00:33.180> thoughts<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.809> how<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
through many many thoughts of how to

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.530 
through many many thoughts of how to
make<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> seat<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.920> finally<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.180> sudden

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
make a seat and finally all of a sudden

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.080 
make a seat and finally all of a sudden
I<00:00:36.690> thought<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.380> tree<00:00:37.800> stands<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.730> seats

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
I thought of all tree stands and seats

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.790 
I thought of all tree stands and seats
now<00:00:39.450> perhaps<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:40.020> people<00:00:40.379> who<00:00:40.469> put<00:00:40.680> together

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
now perhaps as people who put together

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.630 
now perhaps as people who put together
and<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> had<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> idea<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.930> concept<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.800> make

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and it had the idea the concept to make

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790 
and it had the idea the concept to make
a<00:00:44.850> folding<00:00:45.270> seat<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:45.930> side<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.350> fix<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
a folding seat with one side to fix the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.510 
a folding seat with one side to fix the
base<00:00:47.129> plate<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.700> got<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.390> whole<00:00:48.660> big<00:00:48.870> one

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
base plate I got up one whole big one

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
what I've done basically is this with

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.450 
what I've done basically is this with
this<00:01:38.280> spike<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.790> watcher<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.780> added<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
this spike and watcher I have added a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
this spike and watcher I have added a
two<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.640> half<00:01:41.820> gallon<00:01:42.240> bucket<00:01:42.540> lid<00:01:42.720> as<00:01:42.960> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
see here white so you could understand

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.429 
see here white so you could understand
it<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.710> common<00:01:47.070> bucket<00:01:47.340> lid<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439
