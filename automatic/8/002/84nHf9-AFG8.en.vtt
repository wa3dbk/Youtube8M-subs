00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
Transworld movie origins took a break to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.009 
Transworld movie origins took a break to
come<00:00:11.490> out<00:00:11.639> here<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.059> contest<00:00:12.450> how<00:00:12.809> do<00:00:12.870> you

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
come out here to this contest how do you

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.450 
come out here to this contest how do you
shift<00:00:13.290> gears<00:00:13.410> between<00:00:13.980> those<00:00:14.130> two<00:00:14.309> things

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
shift gears between those two things

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.070 
shift gears between those two things
because<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:14.880> really<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> different<00:00:15.870> approach

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
because it's really a different approach

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.260 
because it's really a different approach
between<00:00:16.350> each<00:00:16.619> yeah<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.279> gotta<00:00:17.760> say<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.090> wasn't

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
between each yeah I gotta say it wasn't

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.900 
between each yeah I gotta say it wasn't
that<00:00:18.570> easy<00:00:18.750> like<00:00:19.140> when<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.100> first<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.640> wrote

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that easy like when I first like wrote

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.970 
that easy like when I first like wrote
the<00:00:21.029> pipe<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.480> was<00:00:21.660> like<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> super<00:00:22.470> icy<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the pipe it was like a super icy and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.599 
the pipe it was like a super icy and
windy<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.699> felt<00:00:24.240> pretty<00:00:24.420> bad<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:26.580> I

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
windy and I felt pretty bad and and so I

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.429 
windy and I felt pretty bad and and so I
think<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.630> kind<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.840> hard<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.170> come

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
think like it's kind of hard to come

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.620 
think like it's kind of hard to come
back<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.369> pipe<00:00:29.580> after<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:30.150> being<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
back to the pipe after like being in the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.620 
back to the pipe after like being in the
backcountry<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:32.130> month<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:32.700> after<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
backcountry for one month but after a

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.420 
backcountry for one month but after a
few<00:00:33.899> days<00:00:34.079> practicing<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:34.980> went<00:00:35.250> like

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
few days practicing it all went like

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.880 
few days practicing it all went like
together<00:00:36.059> pretty<00:00:36.390> good<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.380> it's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
together pretty good and and it's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.250 
together pretty good and and it's
actually<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.850> enjoyable<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.480> switch<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
actually really enjoyable to switch it

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.000 
actually really enjoyable to switch it
up<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.340> both<00:00:41.520> now<00:00:42.440> seem<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> lot<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
up and to do both now seem like a lot of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.490 
up and to do both now seem like a lot of
riders<00:00:44.160> were<00:00:44.399> having<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.969> tough<00:00:45.329> time<00:00:45.500> putting

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
riders were having a tough time putting

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
riders were having a tough time putting
their<00:00:46.710> runs<00:00:47.010> down<00:00:47.219> today<00:00:47.520> did<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.910> affect

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
their runs down today did that affect

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.970 
their runs down today did that affect
the<00:00:48.390> way<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.930> were<00:00:49.140> riding<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.680> all<00:00:49.800> or

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the way that you were riding at all or

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.680 
the way that you were riding at all or
any<00:00:50.129> year<00:00:50.280> strategy<00:00:51.020> no<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:53.270> I<00:00:54.270> don't

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
any year strategy no I think I I don't

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.860 
any year strategy no I think I I don't
usually<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.379> ride<00:00:56.570> watching<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> other

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.240 
guys I'm more like you know I wanted to
my<00:00:59.730> thing<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> way<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> planned<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> kind<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
my thing the way I planned it kind of so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
my thing the way I planned it kind of so
I<00:01:02.789> didn't<00:01:03.149> already<00:01:03.300> affect<00:01:03.750> me<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.379> sure

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
I didn't already affect me but for sure

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.580 
I didn't already affect me but for sure
it<00:01:04.650> was<00:01:04.830> hard<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.519> did<00:01:05.760> land<00:01:06.240> only<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.840> run

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
it was hard like I did land only one run

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.800 
it was hard like I did land only one run
out<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.010> three<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.689> was<00:01:09.780> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
out of three and the I think there was a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.200 
out of three and the I think there was a
lot<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.049> bad<00:01:10.470> bad<00:01:10.950> swam<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.460> yeah<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.030> hard

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
lot of bad bad swam and yeah it's hard

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
lot of bad bad swam and yeah it's hard
to<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.600> yeah<00:01:13.260> what<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:13.770> was

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
to see that yeah what do you think was

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.620 
to see that yeah what do you think was
going<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> wind<00:01:14.700> was<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.240> anything

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
going on was it wind was there anything

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
going on was it wind was there anything
wrong<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> pipe<00:01:16.229> well<00:01:16.860> we've<00:01:17.070> been<00:01:17.220> used

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
wrong with the pipe well we've been used

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.460 
wrong with the pipe well we've been used
to<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.790> really<00:01:18.150> icy<00:01:18.600> pipe<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.380> was

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to that really icy pipe and now it was

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.770 
to that really icy pipe and now it was
like<00:01:19.710> pretty<00:01:19.950> soft<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.610> wall<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.600> were

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
like pretty soft on this wall so we were

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
like pretty soft on this wall so we were
kind<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.200> pushed<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.710> under<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> copping

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
kind of pushed like under on the copping

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.960 
kind of pushed like under on the copping
a<00:01:23.970> bit<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.830> I<00:01:25.830> don't<00:01:26.189> know<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.610> maybe<00:01:26.880> like

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
a bit and I don't know it's maybe like

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.020 
a bit and I don't know it's maybe like
the<00:01:27.720> transition<00:01:28.320> from<00:01:28.560> eyes<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.700> slosh

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the transition from eyes to like slosh

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.780 
the transition from eyes to like slosh
is<00:01:30.329> maybe<00:01:30.570> not<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:31.140> easy<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.979> don't<00:01:32.700> know

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
is maybe not that easy but I don't know

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
is maybe not that easy but I don't know
and<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.240> didn't<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> contest<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.829> can

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
and I didn't see the contest so I I can

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.980 
and I didn't see the contest so I I can
tell<00:01:35.460> you've<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> lot<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> people<00:01:36.420> fail<00:01:36.810> or

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
tell you've like a lot of people fail or

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.649 
tell you've like a lot of people fail or
not<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.500> yeah<00:01:38.430> probably<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
not but yeah probably because of the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.039 
not but yeah probably because of the
sunny<00:01:39.990> wall<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:41.100> Aleut<00:01:41.790> backside<00:01:42.240> rodeo<00:01:42.600> on

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
sunny wall the Aleut backside rodeo on

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.870 
sunny wall the Aleut backside rodeo on
the<00:01:43.259> last<00:01:43.619> hit<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.369> was<00:01:44.520> kind<00:01:44.820> of

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the last hit I think that was kind of
