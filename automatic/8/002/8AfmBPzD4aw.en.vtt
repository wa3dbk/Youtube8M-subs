00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 do not just be a sports utility 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.450
 have to have diesel engine 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.980
 this is still a very common maxim and 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.719
 now that these engines are more 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.730
 sophisticated cleansers 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.950
 Give it up to put it on. It's your turn. 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.770
 luxury like in today's test 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.869
 the grand cherokee limited if it 's a thing 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.359
 what a Brazilian in general 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 are SUVs with engines 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.550
 diesel so do not stay out 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
 of this national preference the new jeep 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.130
 grand cherokee also comes with engine 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.130
 diesel 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.840
 may seem strange but this propeller 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.809
 v6 is made in Italy with exclusivity 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.920
 to American wedding myth myth that 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.079
 it worked out 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.449
 even more with the company and efficient 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.559
 of a new automatic gearbox of eight 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.079
 speeds 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.460
 quiet operation insulation 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.230
 acoustic is efficient 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.539
 It gets tough for someone who is not very 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.670
 experienced in the subject know if 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.660
 driving the car with a gasoline engine or 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.350
 diesel 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.570
 if you add to it a good performance 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.030
 becomes even more difficult not only for the good 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.130
 motor torque that drag the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.110
 almost two and a half tons with 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.240
 ease but also for the good 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.610
 scheduling of the eight gears and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.110
 allow rapid acceleration and resumption of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.570
 speed 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.360
 not to mention the sport's position of exchange 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.759
 the letters behind the wheel to the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.549
 sequential exchanges resulting in a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.369
 more fun direction a novelty to 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.409
 exchange position in exchange 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.479
 aiming at fuel economy 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.640
 so I hoped it was more 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.740
 economic than the grand cherokee said 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.799
 the old one that had exchange of five 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.290
 and with almost the same 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.290
 at least it remains reasonable 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.310
 When it catches, it soon comes to mind. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.350
 click on face any stop 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.810
 although I find it difficult for someone to 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.020
 venture into an off-road car 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.270
 sophisticated like this if you want 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.270
 the grand cherokee give in the bottle 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.580
 the transmission is square 2 which maintains the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.740
 permanent four-wheel drive and 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.400
 distributes the force automatically to each 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.980
 an 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.590
 depending on the need it still has 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.420
 significantly reduced and beyond the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.430
 allows you to select 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.890
 manually type of floor to king year 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.000
 snow and stones traction control and 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.910
 stability 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.250
 are part of the package but as Cherokee 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.250
 is high you can not use ongoing 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.430
 out the grand cherokee has 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.430
 novelty 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.120
 it's just me 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.930
 Rosinha fight 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.930
 and everything a luxury car should have 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.640
 and so 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.110
 brooklyn 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.440
 You just can not understand this bank. 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.580
 So simple and uncomfortable back 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.920
 story summary 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.599
 for those who enjoy sports utility 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.670
 jeep grand cherokee turbo days is one 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.610
 interesting option since it has a 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.930
 finishing at the level of competitors 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.230
 thing that is more expensive than the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.940
 but it spends less fuel and 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.709
 Resale 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.730
 it is easier to another advantage the jeep brand 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.730
 specialist in this type of car 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.870
 It's beautiful, it's not too bad. 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.370
 so the deep grand cherokee limited 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.170
 diesel is sold without options and costs 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.470
 239 thousand and nine hundred reais 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.610
 the unlimited version of gasoline costs 219 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.670
 nineteen hundred and the laredo the simplest 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.190
 185 thousand 900 years the notes of corn 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.010
 the newsletter starts with a good 8 in 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.280
 performance but falls fast was only for 6 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.380
 in consumption recovers well in safety 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.720
 time once again in stability but 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.300
 complete with 8 notes is finished 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.420
 internal space and trunk and cost 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.420
 benefit
