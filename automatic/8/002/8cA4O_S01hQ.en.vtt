00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.450 
has point zero six so this one truly is
a<00:02:04.460> sample<00:02:05.390> size<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:05.870> then<00:02:06.860> there's<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.250> that

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
a sample size so then there's the that

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.169 
a sample size so then there's the that
gal<00:02:07.730> and<00:02:08.030> this<00:02:08.179> one<00:02:08.360> has<00:02:08.539> 0.25

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
gal and this one has 0.25

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.479 
gal and this one has 0.25
but<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:11.319> full-size<00:02:11.860> only<00:02:12.340> have<00:02:12.959> 0.37<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.980> I

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
but the full-size only have 0.37 so I

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.789 
but the full-size only have 0.37 so I
mean<00:02:15.819> this<00:02:16.569> one<00:02:16.750> cost<00:02:16.930> $30<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.069> this<00:02:19.000> cost

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
mean this one cost $30 and this cost

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:26.160 
mean this one cost $30 and this cost
10:30<00:02:21.780> 10:30<00:02:22.780> 10<00:02:23.769> is<00:02:24.480> there<00:02:25.480> still<00:02:25.629> a<00:02:25.750> question

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
10:30 10:30 10 is there still a question

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.699 
10:30 10:30 10 is there still a question
I<00:02:26.319> don't<00:02:26.560> know<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.430> then<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:28.000> one<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:29.140> what

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.649 
I don't know so then this one the what
is<00:02:29.799> this<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.069> hi<00:02:30.310> beat<00:02:30.549> it's<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.239> really<00:02:31.510> good

on really sick so you'd be able to see

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.990 
on really sick so you'd be able to see
it<00:02:35.409> it's<00:02:35.970> like<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.000> pink<00:02:37.420> pearl<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:37.959> want<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.409> say

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
because I will be purchasing this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.149 
because I will be purchasing this
because<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.510> wasn't<00:02:43.720> sure<00:02:43.900> if<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.560> wanted<00:02:44.889> to<00:02:44.950> get

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
because I wasn't sure if I wanted to get

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.309 
because I wasn't sure if I wanted to get
it<00:02:45.310> but<00:02:45.519> now<00:02:45.760> I'm<00:02:46.030> really<00:02:46.389> sure<00:02:46.569> totally<00:02:47.049> going

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
it but now I'm really sure totally going

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.530 
it but now I'm really sure totally going
to<00:02:47.349> pick<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:49.030> next<00:02:49.209> one<00:02:49.389> is

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
to pick this up and the next one is

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
to pick this up and the next one is
Posey<00:02:50.049> team<00:02:50.819> which<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:52.000> unlike<00:02:52.450> Benetton

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
Posey team which is unlike Benetton

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.819 
Posey team which is unlike Benetton
because<00:02:53.859> benefit<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.760> very<00:02:55.980> thin<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:58.230> red<00:02:59.230> and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
because benefit is very thin and red and

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.800 
because benefit is very thin and red and
this<00:03:00.010> one<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.340> hot<00:03:00.609> pink<00:03:00.939> and<00:03:01.239> it's<00:03:01.359> much

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
this one is hot pink and it's much

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.569 
this one is hot pink and it's much
thicker<00:03:02.170> when<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.650> open<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.040> up<00:03:03.159> it's<00:03:03.400> much

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
thicker when you open it up it's much

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.879 
thicker when you open it up it's much
thicker<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.689> I<00:03:04.720> imagine<00:03:05.439> that<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.680> will<00:03:05.769> be

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
thicker so I imagine that it will be

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.520 
thicker so I imagine that it will be
harder<00:03:06.189> to<00:03:06.340> blend<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:07.540> tried<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.079> on<00:03:08.139> my<00:03:08.290> cheek

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
harder to blend I tried it on my cheek

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.979 
harder to blend I tried it on my cheek
once<00:03:08.859> and<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.400> looked<00:03:09.639> like<00:03:09.879> I<00:03:10.120> got<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.870> don't

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
once and it looked like I got I don't

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.400 
once and it looked like I got I don't
know<00:03:11.639> smacked<00:03:12.639> in<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.879> face<00:03:12.939> by<00:03:13.420> strawberry<00:03:13.870> I

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
know smacked in the face by strawberry I

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.259 
know smacked in the face by strawberry I
don't<00:03:14.650> know<00:03:14.769> it<00:03:14.919> was<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.340> was<00:03:15.400> just<00:03:15.669> not<00:03:15.849> a<00:03:16.060> good

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
don't know it was it was just not a good

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.970 
don't know it was it was just not a good
sheet<00:03:16.510> color<00:03:16.720> for<00:03:16.959> me<00:03:17.079> but<00:03:17.290> on<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.530> lips<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.919> is

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
sheet color for me but on the lips it is

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.970 
sheet color for me but on the lips it is
pretty<00:03:18.400> nice<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.919> the<00:03:21.129> kit<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:23.049> I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
pretty nice so this is the kit and I

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.939 
pretty nice so this is the kit and I
actually<00:03:24.220> really<00:03:24.579> recommended<00:03:25.269> this<00:03:25.449> I<00:03:25.720> was

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
actually really recommended this I was

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.199 
actually really recommended this I was
suspicious<00:03:26.949> because<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:27.639> only<00:03:27.849> comes<00:03:28.060> in

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
suspicious because this only comes in

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.140 
suspicious because this only comes in
two<00:03:28.329> colors<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:29.680> I'm<00:03:30.220> sure<00:03:30.459> there's<00:03:30.669> much<00:03:30.909> more

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
two colors so I'm sure there's much more

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.240 
two colors so I'm sure there's much more
than<00:03:31.329> two<00:03:31.480> colors<00:03:31.659> of<00:03:32.019> women<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:32.829> this<00:03:32.980> world

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
than two colors of women in this world

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.059 
than two colors of women in this world
and<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.639> only<00:03:33.730> comes<00:03:33.970> in<00:03:34.150> two<00:03:34.269> colors<00:03:34.739> but<00:03:35.739> it

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
and it only comes in two colors but it

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.289 
and it only comes in two colors but it
is<00:03:36.519> very<00:03:36.940> blendable<00:03:37.449> on<00:03:37.810> me<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:38.379> I'm<00:03:38.650> like<00:03:38.919> a

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
is very blendable on me and I'm like a

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.379 
is very blendable on me and I'm like a
0-0<00:03:40.299> nc<00:03:40.750> double<00:03:40.780> zero<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:42.970> very

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
0-0 nc double zero and it is very

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.719 
0-0 nc double zero and it is very
blendable<00:03:43.780> on<00:03:44.019> me<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.620> especially<00:03:45.370> if<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.549> use

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:45.729 
blendable on me and especially if I use

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.890 
blendable on me and especially if I use
a<00:03:45.760> bronzer<00:03:46.239> it<00:03:47.879> it's<00:03:48.879> not<00:03:49.120> noticeable<00:03:49.359> it

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
a bronzer it it's not noticeable it

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.589 
a bronzer it it's not noticeable it
doesn't<00:03:50.229> leave<00:03:50.349> a<00:03:50.379> line<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.359> a<00:03:52.389> little

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
doesn't leave a line so this is a little
