no<00:00:21.180> nearly<00:00:21.930> everybody<00:00:22.199> knows<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.740> by<00:00:22.890> now

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
no nearly everybody knows this by now

no nearly everybody knows this by now
you<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.850> don't<00:00:24.090> drink<00:00:24.269> salt<00:00:24.600> water<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.439> why

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
you just don't drink salt water but why

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.380 
you just don't drink salt water but why
if<00:00:25.980> you're<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> verge<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.849> death<00:00:27.090> will

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
if you're on the verge of death will

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.929 
if you're on the verge of death will
salt<00:00:27.689> really<00:00:28.050> kill<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.380> why<00:00:29.039> can't<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.519> drink

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
salt really kill you why can't we drink

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.510 
salt really kill you why can't we drink
salt<00:00:30.269> water<00:00:30.650> before<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.679> look<00:00:31.920> at<00:00:31.980> salt<00:00:32.309> water

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
salt water before we look at salt water

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.880 
salt water before we look at salt water
we<00:00:32.759> need<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.969> look<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.270> human<00:00:33.480> blood<00:00:33.960> our<00:00:34.469> blood

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
we need to look at human blood our blood

has a salinity of nine which means that

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780 
has a salinity of nine which means that
there's<00:00:37.200> nine<00:00:37.410> grams<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.890> salt<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.309> our<00:00:38.399> blood

factor of almost 4 and that's a problem

things which can be a good thing but in

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
things which can be a good thing but in
this<00:01:04.500> case<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:05.430> when<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.420> ingest<00:01:06.720> salt

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this case it's not when you ingest salt

this case it's not when you ingest salt
water<00:01:07.170> you're<00:01:07.470> increasing<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.979> salinity<00:01:08.580> of

shorter<00:02:26.240> but<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:27.080> was<00:02:27.350> because<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.770> was<00:02:27.890> playing

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130

around with some different stuff in
PowerPoint<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.410> just<00:02:31.069> figured<00:02:31.310> out<00:02:31.400> which<00:02:31.640> kind

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
PowerPoint I just figured out which kind

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.220 
PowerPoint I just figured out which kind
of<00:02:32.030> silly<00:02:32.209> because<00:02:32.420> I've<00:02:32.630> used<00:02:32.780> power<00:02:32.959> for<00:02:33.140> my

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
of silly because I've used power for my

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.720 
of silly because I've used power for my
whole<00:02:33.410> life<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.860> don't<00:02:33.980> know<00:02:34.160> why<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.310> didn't

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
whole life so I don't know why I didn't

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.400 
whole life so I don't know why I didn't
know<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.090> earlier<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.720> figured<00:02:36.260> out<00:02:36.350> that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
know of this earlier I figured out that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.900
