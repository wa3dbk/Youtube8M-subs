00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
but it just really felt like nothing was

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.120 
but it just really felt like nothing was
really<00:01:48.509> going<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.380> episode<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.009> all

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
honesty not much really happened I was

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.920 
honesty not much really happened I was
just<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.430> pacing<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:54.000> beyond<00:01:54.630> like

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
just like the pacing was beyond like

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.480 
just like the pacing was beyond like
they've<00:01:55.079> done<00:01:55.110> slow<00:01:55.560> pace<00:01:55.799> they<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> lot

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
they've done slow pace they do it a lot

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.370 
they've done slow pace they do it a lot
but<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.090> episode<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.990> much<00:01:58.200> really

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
but this episode not much really

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.139 
but this episode not much really
happened<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.890> was<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.850> wasn't

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
happened it was just like if it wasn't

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.740 
happened it was just like if it wasn't
even<00:02:00.530> attracted<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:02.040> female<00:02:02.460> Rebecca<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.420> might

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
even attracted a female Rebecca I might

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.330 
even attracted a female Rebecca I might
imagine<00:02:03.960> people<00:02:04.290> would<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.590> screaming<00:02:05.100> even

imagine people would be screaming even

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.740 
imagine people would be screaming even
more<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:05.820> probably<00:02:06.299> people<00:02:06.450> will<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.719> a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
