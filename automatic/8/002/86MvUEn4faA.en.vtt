hello<00:00:02.190> everyone<00:00:02.639> so<00:00:03.600> this<00:00:03.780> afternoon<00:00:03.929> I've

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
hello everyone so this afternoon I've

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.070 
hello everyone so this afternoon I've
been<00:00:04.620> doing<00:00:04.859> some<00:00:04.920> sorting<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:05.899> I've<00:00:06.899> been

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
been doing some sorting and I've been

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.990 
been doing some sorting and I've been
going<00:00:07.379> through<00:00:08.210> my<00:00:09.260> hair<00:00:10.260> bows<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:11.099> dummies

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
going through my hair bows and dummies

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.200 
going through my hair bows and dummies
or<00:00:12.559> passes<00:00:13.700> whichever<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.849> would<00:00:14.910> like<00:00:15.089> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
or passes whichever you would like to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.960 
or passes whichever you would like to
call<00:00:15.360> them<00:00:16.130> and<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.190> think<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.460> finally<00:00:17.640> got<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
call them and I think I finally got a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.019 
call them and I think I finally got a
system<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.230> I'm<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.560> happy<00:00:19.830> about<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.279> I

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
system so I'm really happy about that I

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.660 
system so I'm really happy about that I
have<00:00:21.570> found<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.740> don't<00:00:22.980> use<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> lot<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.519> my

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
have found that I don't use a lot of my

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.550 
have found that I don't use a lot of my
hair<00:00:23.850> bows<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.779> same<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.260> passes

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
hair bows and the same with the passes

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.339 
hair bows and the same with the passes
because<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.800> can't<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.250> them<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.230> I've

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
because I can't see them so what I've

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.290 
because I can't see them so what I've
done<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:29.779> I<00:00:30.779> had<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.140> magnetic<00:00:32.059> board<00:00:33.059> it's

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
done is I had this magnetic board it's

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.270 
done is I had this magnetic board it's
actually<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> white<00:00:33.750> board<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.079> well<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.620> my

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
actually a white board as well in my

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.430 
actually a white board as well in my
office<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:35.820> ages<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.809> don't<00:00:37.050> really<00:00:37.170> use

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
office for ages but I don't really use

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.580 
office for ages but I don't really use
it's<00:00:37.770> quite<00:00:37.950> small<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.809> I<00:00:39.809> got<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
it's quite small so I got it out and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.150 
it's quite small so I got it out and
I've<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:41.219> stuck<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> magnetic<00:00:43.680> ones<00:00:43.890> up

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I've just stuck all the magnetic ones up

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.569 
I've just stuck all the magnetic ones up
there<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.500> course<00:00:46.739> i<00:00:46.950> could<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> bigger

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
there and of course i could get a bigger

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.740 
there and of course i could get a bigger
one<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.090> would<00:00:48.180> probably<00:00:48.360> work<00:00:48.539> better

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
one and it would probably work better

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.600 
one and it would probably work better
but<00:00:49.379> at<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> moment<00:00:49.710> actually<00:00:50.039> iraq's<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
but at the moment actually iraq's I

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.220 
but at the moment actually iraq's I
don't<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> lot<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.300> magnets<00:00:51.719> aren't<00:00:52.020> on

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
don't have a lot with magnets aren't on

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.080 
don't have a lot with magnets aren't on
the<00:00:52.350> dolls<00:00:52.559> most<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.489> my<00:00:53.579> path<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.940> our

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the dolls most of my path is our

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.139 
the dolls most of my path is our
unmodified<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> moment<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> stuck<00:00:56.969> all

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
unmodified at the moment so stuck all

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.619 
unmodified at the moment so stuck all
those<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.539> top<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.629> thought

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
those at the top and then I thought

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.150 
those at the top and then I thought
since<00:01:00.899> they<00:01:01.079> only<00:01:01.199> took<00:01:01.440> off<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.710> room<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.100> do

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
since they only took off that room I do

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.789 
since they only took off that room I do
the<00:01:02.399> hair<00:01:02.579> bows<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:04.260> i'm<00:01:04.320> using<00:01:04.530> these

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the hair bows as well so i'm using these

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
the hair bows as well so i'm using these
little<00:01:05.390> magnetic<00:01:06.390> some<00:01:06.720> tax<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:08.570> they're

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
little magnetic some tax and they're

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.149 
little magnetic some tax and they're
quite<00:01:09.780> strong<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.680> they're<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> same

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
quite strong so they're the same

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.320 
quite strong so they're the same
strength<00:01:11.580> probably<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:14.240> magnets<00:01:15.240> were

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
strength probably is the magnets were

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.109 
strength probably is the magnets were
used<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.689> mounts<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.400> i've<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.909> put<00:01:18.060> all

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
used in the mounts and i've just put all

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
used in the mounts and i've just put all
the<00:01:18.240> hair<00:01:18.420> bows<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:19.040> one<00:01:20.040> or<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.369> them

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the hair bows there one or all of them

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.999 
the hair bows there one or all of them
but<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.840> steno<00:01:22.229> ones<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.710> stick

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
but like the steno ones that stick

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.359 
but like the steno ones that stick
really<00:01:23.310> well<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> they're<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> tax<00:01:25.799> i'm<00:01:26.009> using

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
really well so they're the tax i'm using

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.870 
really well so they're the tax i'm using
power<00:01:27.030> magnets

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.209 

I<00:01:29.969> didn't<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.110> I've<00:01:31.290> got<00:01:31.409> lots<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.770> magnets

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
I didn't like I've got lots of magnets

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.990 
I didn't like I've got lots of magnets
just<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.570> passy<00:01:34.350> magnets<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.250> don't<00:01:35.850> like

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
just the passy magnets but I don't like

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.639 
just the passy magnets but I don't like
having<00:01:36.240> them<00:01:36.479> loose<00:01:36.719> just<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
having them loose just because of the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.969 
having them loose just because of the
cats<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.310> um<00:01:39.149> my<00:01:40.110> nephew<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.590> stuff<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.920> don't

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
cats and um my nephew and stuff I don't

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.440 
cats and um my nephew and stuff I don't
want<00:01:41.659> anyone<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:43.320> swallow<00:01:43.679> our<00:01:44.450> magnet

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
want anyone to swallow our magnet

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.429 
want anyone to swallow our magnet
because<00:01:45.539> that<00:01:45.780> would<00:01:45.929> not<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.079> good<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:48.439> then

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
because that would not be good and then

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.010 
because that would not be good and then
the<00:01:50.069> rest<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.490> my<00:01:50.700> hair<00:01:50.939> hair<00:01:51.569> bows<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.990> in

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the rest of my hair hair bows are in

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
the rest of my hair hair bows are in
here<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:54.590> there's<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> lot<00:01:55.829> less<00:01:56.009> now<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.429> I<00:01:56.490> can

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
here and there's a lot less now so I can

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.840 
here and there's a lot less now so I can
actually<00:01:56.819> just<00:01:57.240> kind<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.350> them<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.850> then

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
actually just kind of see them and then

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.520 
actually just kind of see them and then
in<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.240> jar<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.890> loose<00:02:02.099> ribbons<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
in this jar is just loose ribbons and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.870 
in this jar is just loose ribbons and
then<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.069> other<00:02:05.099> jar<00:02:06.170> there's<00:02:07.170> passes<00:02:07.880> you

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
then in the other jar there's passes you

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.100 
then in the other jar there's passes you
can<00:02:09.030> see<00:02:09.209> them<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.599> side<00:02:09.810> they're<00:02:12.080> not<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
can see them on the side they're not a
