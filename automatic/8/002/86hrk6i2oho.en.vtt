that's<00:01:44.369> about<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> thousand<00:01:45.060> dollars<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.960> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that's about a thousand dollars so you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.550 
that's about a thousand dollars so you
have<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.399> 500<00:01:47.399> dt1<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:50.299> 17<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.479> 55<00:01:51.930> f<00:01:52.200> 2.8

have a 500 dt1 I and the 17 to 55 f 2.8

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.100 
have a 500 dt1 I and the 17 to 55 f 2.8
and<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:55.020> reason<00:01:55.470> why<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> would<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:57.110> is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
and the reason why I would do that is

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.350 
and the reason why I would do that is
because<00:01:58.409> I'm<00:01:58.710> finding<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.170> lens<00:02:02.360> has

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
because I'm finding out the the lens has

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.160 
because I'm finding out the the lens has
quite<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> bit<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.540> your<00:02:06.780> image

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.290 
you know i i'm not sure what nikon lens
is<00:02:47.900> around<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.740> thousand<00:02:49.220> dollars<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.790> best

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
is around a thousand dollars the best

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.610 
is around a thousand dollars the best
lens<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.900> can<00:02:50.930> get<00:02:51.260> for<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> thousand<00:02:52.070> dollars

lens you can get for a thousand dollars

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.290 
lens you can get for a thousand dollars
there<00:02:54.620> Lyn<00:02:54.830> nikon<00:02:55.400> lenses<00:02:55.730> are<00:02:55.880> very

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
there Lyn nikon lenses are very

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.070 
there Lyn nikon lenses are very
expensive<00:02:56.750> maybe<00:02:57.290> more<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:57.620> than<00:02:58.070> canon<00:02:59.080> so

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
expensive maybe more so than canon so

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.010 
expensive maybe more so than canon so
you<00:03:00.590> know<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.710> could<00:03:00.920> always<00:03:00.980> look<00:03:01.340> at<00:03:01.550> at

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
you know you could always look at at

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.300 
you know you could always look at at
sigma<00:03:03.020> or<00:03:03.430> tokina<00:03:04.430> or<00:03:04.760> tamron<00:03:05.740> lenses<00:03:06.740> they<00:03:06.980> I

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
sigma or tokina or tamron lenses they I

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.810 
sigma or tokina or tamron lenses they I
think<00:03:07.580> they<00:03:07.880> have<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.950> know<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.100> know<00:03:10.220> they

think they have you know I know they

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.250 
think they have you know I know they

if your budget is higher then that's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.210 
if your budget is higher then that's
even<00:03:38.360> better<00:03:38.630> obviously<00:03:38.990> because<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.100> can

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
even better obviously because you can

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.660 
even better obviously because you can
get<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.370> better<00:03:40.580> body<00:03:41.180> but<00:03:42.170> man<00:03:42.950> I'm<00:03:43.250> telling

get a better body but man I'm telling
you<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.960> lens<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.740> glass<00:03:46.160> the

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
you that the the lens the glass the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.400 
you that the the lens the glass the
large<00:03:47.420> aperture<00:03:48.080> glass<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.960> how<00:03:51.350> you

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
large aperture glass is is is how you

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.680 
large aperture glass is is is how you
get<00:03:51.770> good<00:03:52.040> pictures<00:03:52.460> and<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:54.520> also<00:03:55.520> at<00:03:56.450> this

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
get good pictures and and also at this

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.760 
get good pictures and and also at this
point<00:03:57.080> I<00:03:58.150> would<00:03:59.150> be<00:03:59.570> less<00:03:59.930> concerned<00:04:00.500> about

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
point I would be less concerned about

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.080 
point I would be less concerned about
having<00:04:01.160> image<00:04:01.910> stabilization<00:04:02.600> technology

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
having image stabilization technology

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.900 
having image stabilization technology
then<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.120> if<00:04:06.110> I<00:04:06.320> had<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.920> do<00:04:07.100> without<00:04:07.460> image

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
then I if I had to do without image

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.390 
then I if I had to do without image
stabilization<00:04:08.330> to<00:04:09.140> have<00:04:09.320> a<00:04:09.350> large<00:04:09.770> aperture

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
stabilization to have a large aperture

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.290 
stabilization to have a large aperture
like<00:04:10.610> 2.8<00:04:11.240> or<00:04:11.480> 1.4<00:04:12.440> or<00:04:12.500> something<00:04:13.130> I<00:04:13.310> would<00:04:14.150> do

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
like 2.8 or 1.4 or something I would do

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.560 
like 2.8 or 1.4 or something I would do
it<00:04:14.450> I<00:04:14.630> would<00:04:15.050> do<00:04:15.350> it<00:04:15.380> now<00:04:15.709> I<00:04:16.340> haven't<00:04:17.209> felt<00:04:17.450> that

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
it I would do it now I haven't felt that

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.330 
it I would do it now I haven't felt that
way<00:04:17.870> in<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.109> past<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:20.030> coming<00:04:20.510> around<00:04:20.600> that

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
way in the past just coming around that

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.159 
way in the past just coming around that
that<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.370> could<00:04:22.640> get<00:04:23.120> away<00:04:23.240> without<00:04:23.660> image

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
that I could get away without image

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.330 
that I could get away without image
stabilization<00:04:24.560> with<00:04:25.100> a

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
stabilization with a

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.010 
stabilization with a
large<00:04:25.460> aperture<00:04:25.970> lens<00:04:26.180> because<00:04:26.480> most<00:04:26.750> of<00:04:26.900> my

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
large aperture lens because most of my

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.629 
large aperture lens because most of my
lenses<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:28.550> have<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.210> 50<00:04:29.660> millimeter<00:04:29.840> f<00:04:30.380> 1.8<00:04:31.370> and

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
lenses I have a 50 millimeter f 1.8 and

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.400 
lenses I have a 50 millimeter f 1.8 and
a<00:04:32.360> 100<00:04:33.199> millimeter<00:04:33.680> f<00:04:33.919> 2.8<00:04:35.050> no<00:04:36.050> image

a 100 millimeter f 2.8 no image

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.909 
a 100 millimeter f 2.8 no image
stabilization<00:04:36.800> on<00:04:37.250> those<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.840> yeah<00:04:38.889> some<00:04:39.889> of

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
stabilization on those and yeah some of

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.010 
stabilization on those and yeah some of
my<00:04:40.100> best<00:04:40.460> pictures<00:04:41.090> are<00:04:41.300> from<00:04:41.449> those<00:04:41.660> lenses

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
my best pictures are from those lenses

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.420 
my best pictures are from those lenses
and<00:04:42.460> I<00:04:43.460> do<00:04:44.240> sometimes<00:04:45.050> come<00:04:45.740> up<00:04:45.889> with<00:04:46.040> a<00:04:46.070> blurry

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
and I do sometimes come up with a blurry

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.909 
and I do sometimes come up with a blurry
picture<00:04:46.729> because<00:04:47.180> if<00:04:47.300> camera<00:04:47.690> shake<00:04:47.930> but<00:04:48.260> you

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
picture because if camera shake but you

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.620 
picture because if camera shake but you
know<00:04:49.010> that's<00:04:49.250> just<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.520> way<00:04:49.639> it<00:04:49.760> is<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.150> then

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
know that's just the way it is and then

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.379 
know that's just the way it is and then
and<00:04:50.930> then<00:04:51.229> this<00:04:51.470> lens<00:04:51.770> right<00:04:52.130> here<00:04:52.580> actually

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
and then this lens right here actually

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.670 
and then this lens right here actually
has<00:04:54.110> image<00:04:54.560> stabilization<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:55.660> it<00:04:56.660> has<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.840> 2.8

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
has image stabilization and it has a 2.8

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.640 
has image stabilization and it has a 2.8
average<00:04:58.610> large<00:04:58.970> aperture<00:04:59.540> so<00:05:00.080> that's<00:05:00.410> why<00:05:00.620> I

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
average large aperture so that's why I

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.350 
average large aperture so that's why I
like<00:05:00.830> this<00:05:01.250> lens<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:01.700> it's<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:01.970> lens<00:05:02.180> I'm

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
like this lens and it's the lens I'm

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.030 
like this lens and it's the lens I'm
using<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:02.810> shoot<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.169> video<00:05:03.850> but<00:05:05.860> that's<00:05:06.860> my

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
using to shoot this video but that's my
