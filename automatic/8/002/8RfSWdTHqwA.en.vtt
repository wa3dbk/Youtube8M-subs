no cuts of damages like on this lead you

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.710 
no cuts of damages like on this lead you
can<00:02:27.780> see<00:02:27.960> there<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.440> obvious<00:02:29.430> damage<00:02:30.330> this

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
can see there is obvious damage this

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.840 
can see there is obvious damage this
one's<00:02:30.960> mostly<00:02:31.740> it's<00:02:31.890> will<00:02:32.040> won't<00:02:32.520> be<00:02:32.730> as

one's mostly it's will won't be as
damage<00:02:33.210> looks<00:02:33.990> like<00:02:34.260> Nick<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.220> that's

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
damage looks like Nick like that that's

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.580 
damage looks like Nick like that that's
right<00:02:36.180> off<00:02:36.360> that's<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.350> wouldn't

charge to test and tag an item

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.539 
charge to test and tag an item
approximately<00:04:19.950> six

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
approximately six

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.540 
approximately six
to<00:04:20.669> ten<00:04:20.879> dollars<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.299> tag<00:04:21.659> and<00:04:22.019> every<00:04:22.770> item<00:04:23.039> must

to ten dollars a tag and every item must
be<00:04:23.819> kind<00:04:24.090> so<00:04:24.750> if<00:04:24.930> you've<00:04:25.110> got<00:04:25.139> a<00:04:25.319> crate<00:04:26.030> that

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
be kind so if you've got a crate that

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.100 
be kind so if you've got a crate that
looks<00:04:27.240> like<00:04:27.419> this<00:04:28.280> every<00:04:29.280> single<00:04:29.520> cord<00:04:30.110> needs

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
looks like this every single cord needs

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.350 
looks like this every single cord needs
to<00:04:31.289> be<00:04:31.379> tested<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.949> tagged<00:04:32.250> every<00:04:32.879> single<00:04:33.150> one

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
to be tested and tagged every single one

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.210 
to be tested and tagged every single one
so<00:04:34.050> there<00:04:34.169> could<00:04:34.319> be<00:04:34.349> a<00:04:34.440> hundred<00:04:34.620> leads<00:04:34.979> in

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
so there could be a hundred leads in

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.999 
so there could be a hundred leads in
there<00:04:35.430> there<00:04:35.940> between<00:04:36.330> six<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:36.960> ten<00:04:37.229> bucks<00:04:37.470> to

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
there there between six and ten bucks to

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.320 
there there between six and ten bucks to
test<00:04:38.310> especially<00:04:39.090> lights<00:04:39.979> even<00:04:40.979> if<00:04:41.159> like<00:04:42.150> this

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
test especially lights even if like this

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.210 
test especially lights even if like this
light<00:04:42.569> has<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.810> removable<00:04:43.169> lead<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:43.949> light

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
light has a removable lead so the light

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.189 
light has a removable lead so the light
itself<00:04:44.610> has<00:04:44.909> to<00:04:45.060> be<00:04:45.150> tagged<00:04:45.449> could<00:04:45.900> say<00:04:46.050> one

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
itself has to be tagged could say one

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.439 
itself has to be tagged could say one
combination<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:47.190> lead<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:47.819> line<00:04:48.180> requires

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
combination of lead and line requires

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.240 
combination of lead and line requires
two<00:04:48.960> tags<00:04:49.259> so<00:04:50.009> if<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.669> lead<00:04:50.990> is<00:04:51.990> not<00:04:52.259> hardwired

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
two tags so if you lead is not hardwired

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.670 
two tags so if you lead is not hardwired
do<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.669> have<00:04:53.789> to<00:04:53.940> test<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.300> tag<00:04:54.659> and<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.289> unit

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
do you have to test the tag and the unit

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.559 
do you have to test the tag and the unit
well<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.460> lead<00:04:56.669> on<00:04:56.849> the<00:04:56.969> unit<00:04:57.270> that's<00:04:57.419> what<00:04:57.539> I

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
well the lead on the unit that's what I

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.469 
well the lead on the unit that's what I
meant<00:04:57.780> yeah<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.259> also<00:04:59.190> especially<00:04:59.909> laptops

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
meant yeah and also especially laptops

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.749 
meant yeah and also especially laptops
and<00:05:01.289> can<00:05:01.500> be<00:05:02.509> they<00:05:03.509> use<00:05:03.990> three<00:05:04.530> tags<00:05:04.830> because

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
and can be they use three tags because

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.999 
and can be they use three tags because
most<00:05:06.120> power<00:05:06.419> packs<00:05:06.780> will<00:05:07.020> come<00:05:07.229> in<00:05:07.379> apart<00:05:07.800> into

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
most power packs will come in apart into

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:17.749 
most power packs will come in apart into
two<00:05:08.370> separate<00:05:09.030> leads<00:05:09.560> like<00:05:15.979> this<00:05:16.979> power<00:05:17.250> pack

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
two separate leads like this power pack

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.170 
two separate leads like this power pack
yep<00:05:18.539> comes<00:05:19.440> apart<00:05:19.800> two<00:05:20.190> sections<00:05:20.639> so<00:05:20.849> that<00:05:20.879> one

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
yep comes apart two sections so that one

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.200 
yep comes apart two sections so that one
power<00:05:21.479> pack<00:05:21.719> will<00:05:21.930> quite<00:05:22.199> two<00:05:22.469> tags<00:05:23.250> yep<00:05:23.759> and

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
power pack will quite two tags yep and

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.330 
power pack will quite two tags yep and
then<00:05:24.509> on<00:05:24.630> top<00:05:24.779> of<00:05:24.840> that<00:05:24.960> this<00:05:25.500> console<00:05:26.130> will

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
then on top of that this console will

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.879 
then on top of that this console will
also<00:05:26.639> require<00:05:27.029> a<00:05:27.090> tag<00:05:27.479> uh-huh<00:05:28.050> so<00:05:28.680> that's

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
also require a tag uh-huh so that's

also require a tag uh-huh so that's
three<00:05:29.219> tablets<00:05:29.610> eggs<00:05:30.000> for<00:05:30.719> this<00:05:30.840> console

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
construction site I believe the

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.720 
construction site I believe the
exhibition<00:07:08.440> center<00:07:08.800> is<00:07:08.950> classified<00:07:09.550> as<00:07:09.640> a

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
exhibition center is classified as a

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.030 
exhibition center is classified as a
construction<00:07:10.090> site<00:07:10.480> so<00:07:10.780> every<00:07:11.260> three<00:07:11.650> months

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
construction site so every three months

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.090 
construction site so every three months
has<00:07:12.760> been<00:07:12.790> a<00:07:13.150> somebody's<00:07:14.110> require<00:07:14.500> one<00:07:14.770> year
