which<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.030> okay<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.480> guess<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
which is okay I guess I like it to be a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.510 
which is okay I guess I like it to be a
hundred<00:00:44.399> because<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.780> game<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.980> exactly

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
hundred because the game is not exactly

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.889

super new maybe you know maybe make it

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.900 
super new maybe you know maybe make it
ninety<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> hundred<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.340> first<00:00:53.579> three

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
ninety to a hundred for the first three

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.790 
ninety to a hundred for the first three
days<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.390> then<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.899> go<00:00:55.050> back<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.410> normal

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
days and then it can go back to normal

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.270
