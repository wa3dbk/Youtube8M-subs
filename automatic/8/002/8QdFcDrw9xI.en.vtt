having fought them both
you<00:02:01.500> know<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.620> for<00:02:02.040> what<00:02:02.190> event<00:02:02.520> for<00:02:02.790> them<00:02:02.970> both

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090

would<00:02:03.300> have<00:02:03.330> been<00:02:03.510> there<00:02:03.690> anyway<00:02:04.020> because

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
would have been there anyway because

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.690 
would have been there anyway because
I've<00:02:04.350> always<00:02:04.530> been<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.830> boxing<00:02:05.250> fan<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
I've always been a boxing fan but the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.270 
I've always been a boxing fan but the
fact<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:05.940> fartin<00:02:06.450> bothers<00:02:06.810> makes<00:02:07.080> me

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
fact that fartin bothers makes me

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.380 
fact that fartin bothers makes me
probably<00:02:08.280> more<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.670> an<00:02:08.759> interested<00:02:09.300> spectator

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
probably more of an interested spectator

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.770 
probably more of an interested spectator
than<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:11.340> know<00:02:11.459> then<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.940> most<00:02:12.240> really<00:02:12.600> but<00:02:12.750> I

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
than you know then the most really but I

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.230 
than you know then the most really but I
think<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.620> mean<00:02:14.250> anyone<00:02:14.610> if<00:02:14.850> anyone's<00:02:15.120> gonna

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
think I mean anyone if anyone's gonna

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.880 
think I mean anyone if anyone's gonna
beat<00:02:15.450> Floyd<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.260> someone<00:02:16.560> who's<00:02:16.740> got

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
beat Floyd if it's someone who's got

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.370 
beat Floyd if it's someone who's got
fast<00:02:17.160> hands<00:02:17.430> fast<00:02:17.640> feet<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.540> he's<00:02:18.900> he's

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
fast hands fast feet you know he's he's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.260 
fast hands fast feet you know he's he's
fought<00:02:19.620> all<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.830> big<00:02:20.040> punches<00:02:20.430> he's<00:02:20.670> too<00:02:20.820> good

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
fought all the big punches he's too good

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.390 
fought all the big punches he's too good
defensively<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:21.959> he<00:02:22.590> picks<00:02:22.830> them<00:02:23.010> off<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
defensively just he picks them off and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.850 
defensively just he picks them off and
shoulder<00:02:23.880> rolls<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.630> mean<00:02:25.470> that's<00:02:25.560> what<00:02:25.770> he

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
shoulder rolls and I mean that's what he

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.590 
shoulder rolls and I mean that's what he
likes<00:02:26.070> fighters<00:02:26.580> coming<00:02:26.790> towards<00:02:27.180> him<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.540> I

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
likes fighters coming towards him but I

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.270 
likes fighters coming towards him but I
think<00:02:27.750> if<00:02:27.900> money<00:02:28.110> usually<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.739> type<00:02:29.250> of

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
think if money usually the type of

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.890 
think if money usually the type of
tactics<00:02:29.760> he<00:02:29.880> did<00:02:30.030> against<00:02:30.239> Oscar<00:02:30.450> De<00:02:30.690> La<00:02:30.720> Hoya

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
tactics he did against Oscar De La Hoya

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.050 
tactics he did against Oscar De La Hoya
uses<00:02:31.410> his<00:02:31.590> speed<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.100> movement<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.610> boxing

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
uses his speed and movement of boxing

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.360 
uses his speed and movement of boxing
foot<00:02:33.750> working<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.380> now<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.709> think<00:02:35.010> that's<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
foot working and now I think that's the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.880 
foot working and now I think that's the
style<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.790> could<00:02:36.030> beat<00:02:36.209> flight<00:02:36.480> slower<00:02:36.890> it's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
style that could beat flight slower it's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.229 
style that could beat flight slower it's
going<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.130> be<00:02:38.190> very<00:02:38.400> very<00:02:38.520> interesting<00:02:38.640> but

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
going to be very very interesting but

one of them fights that needed to happen
I<00:03:13.799> don't<00:03:13.980> think<00:03:14.220> I'm<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.489> will<00:03:14.670> have<00:03:14.790> too<00:03:15.000> much

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
I don't think I'm a will have too much

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.000 
I don't think I'm a will have too much
he<00:03:15.480> can<00:03:15.660> only<00:03:15.870> he<00:03:15.989> can<00:03:16.110> blame<00:03:16.290> evil<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.829> them

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
he can only he can blame evil of them

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.949 
he can only he can blame evil of them
but<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.060> will<00:03:18.180> feel<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.420> little<00:03:18.540> bit<00:03:18.690> goodie

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
but it will feel a little bit goodie

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.050 
but it will feel a little bit goodie
that<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.380> lost<00:03:19.620> his<00:03:19.829> chance<00:03:20.549> out<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.000> you

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
that is lost his chance out but you

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.720 
that is lost his chance out but you
never<00:03:21.180> know<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:22.290> Floyd<00:03:22.709> wins<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.280> fight<00:03:23.519> then

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
never know if Floyd wins the fight then

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.610 
never know if Floyd wins the fight then
he's<00:03:23.850> got<00:03:24.060> one<00:03:24.239> or<00:03:24.390> two<00:03:24.420> fights<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:25.320> try<00:03:25.500> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
he's got one or two fights to try and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.920 
he's got one or two fights to try and
beat<00:03:25.739> rocky<00:03:25.920> Marciano's<00:03:26.579> record<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.630> he<00:03:27.660> might

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
beat rocky Marciano's record so he might

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.390 
beat rocky Marciano's record so he might
still<00:03:28.200> get<00:03:28.350> his<00:03:28.470> chance<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.860> don't<00:03:29.070> think<00:03:29.220> Floyd

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
still get his chance I don't think Floyd

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.920 
still get his chance I don't think Floyd
will<00:03:29.610> retire<00:03:29.850> after<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.209> because<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:30.720> think

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
will retire after this because I think
