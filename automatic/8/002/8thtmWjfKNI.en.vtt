00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello friends, this is me full point 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.299
 and today I will tell you about it funny 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.830
 applications that should help 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.830
 you run the ashk marathon and blue 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.760
 in fact marathon it 's not this 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.040
 jokes are 40 42 kilometers that is 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.960
 someone believes that a marathon is for him 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.850
 five kilometers it's 10 kilometers just 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.670
 run and everything i woke up today 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.960
 woke up by chance absolutely at 6 am 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.970
 then I realized that what I want 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.440
 run on uranium pepper runtastic this 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.670
 all this is all so tired that 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.960
 I wanted to find some other application 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.210
 it's called jeepers and and it will allow 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.920
 me just due to a certain 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.530
 amount of workouts in November to run 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.059
 42 kilometers but she promises so 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.620
 will in fact we look naturally 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.850
 afterwards now about the very 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.190
 application in general actually 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.489
 amount of fitness app in my 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.900
 iphone which no longer recently got 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.250
 rolls off I already poudalal at least 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.440
 half but this is the application itself 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.570
 gi es which accidentally found in the morning 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.210
 she turned out to be really interesting and 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.700
 Here is such a plan I gave me 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.299
 I told him that I am a beginner I 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.939
 I plan to run well there in the morning 4 times in 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.860
 week let's say the first weeks are given here 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.200
 such here sparing that is this 30 minutes 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.790
 on Wednesday I will run again 30 minutes 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.560
 by the way as for today 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.420
 really woke up and really 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.160
 ran you can see all 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.090
 details of this application she 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.070
 shows the graph 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.170
 it shows the average duration 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.730
 speed and and how much I spent on 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.130
 every unit for every 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.990
 time point per kilometer at 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.420
 this is, you run faster well because 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.370
 that here I walked quickly I did not run I did not 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.370
 I know why this happens, but these 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.250
 that's 817 8 minutes 17 seconds per kilometer 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.960
 this is just brisk walking before running 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.790
 I never got it 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.760
 subsequent moments you watch wednesday 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.520
 same 30 minutes 3030 and a distance of approximately 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.230
 same but then already begins well I 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.020
 I don `t call this case Madame because 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.330
 what have 35 minutes ok next there 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.270
 15 minutes were delighted then 45 minutes 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.320
 Skill for Wednesday and follow no 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.380
 such a word well, let it be for 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.010
 the next trace of 45 minutes is this too 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.800
 okay and then 1:05 1:20 then 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.050
 relief 50 minutes then 1:10 then 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.340
 general training already for 8 weeks 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.410
 that is, I have to run around to it yet 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.560
 eight eight weeks you imagine 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.420
 imagine this time 1:35 then some 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.890
 relief but speed there says 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.020
 will roll off 40 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.340
 we can see what mx red means 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.110
 the color there is 533 it is per kilometer it is four 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.190
 several times acceleration the patient should 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.390
 charge for follow this time and i 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.370
 I don't know, I guess I can handle it of course 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.500
 because I have a little idea on November 9 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.250
 run this very marathon this 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.650
 real 42 kilometers here is august 1:45 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.440
 when i will run 1:45 wednesday friends 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.540
 me on tuesday podcast with us on thursday 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.190
 lives as the same where is the time for all 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.690
 This but under this I must run with 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.120
 am 14 meters because in the evening 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.550
 time is just not corny and so 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.200
 further simplify the facilitated phase again 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.570
 certain main physical training preparation 25 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.190
 weeks ahead of me there are 25 min 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.200
 tell you more about this application 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.520
 goes in more detail at the very end 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.940
 see November 9, 5 hours 19 minutes 4 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.110
 seconds 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.239
 42 kilometers 200 meters and 7 minutes well 7 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.790
 half well per kilometer i hope 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.380
 that I will come back well, just because it 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.330
 application but i don't know but somehow 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.770
 motivates can she motivates precisely 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.720
 on the run she can motivates precisely 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.820
 just some interesting servants on 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.980
 in fact, I bought purely on the slogan 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.579
 because the dynamo runs everyone runs 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.930
 single exchange and just go to the appstore 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.670
 I found really interesting 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.090
 do the application just go to 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.790
 appstore 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.769
 there are really a lot of strange 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.870
 interesting applications are not advertising 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.660
 and if I leave this app 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.980
 I will definitely tell on our channel on 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.930
 appleinsider.ru but for now 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.420
 everything suits me 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.739
 jeep application with it was 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.060
 appleinsider.ru stay with us and I 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.060
 sucks and I ran
