00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.990
 hello everyone minutes cancer or like you 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.880
 tell today kill and secrets 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.310
 Easter eggs and sending 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 counter strike global offencive game 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.750
 So 1 reference to the game payday 2 is 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 on the map for the bank of the game counter strike 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.090
 accordingly she is right here 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.280
 here we go in this room and immediately 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.620
 with him here here we are waiting for the first 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.440
 mask she sends us to this game in 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 the game payday 2 who does not know need to rob 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 banks and on the forests of robbers stretched here 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.570
 these masks are the first mask and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.520
 second mask they and they are very easy to find 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.309
 the rest I just did not find I do not know 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.460
 where you don't know what else you have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.229
 somewhere so if you know you can 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.710
 write to me in the comments will be very 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.189
 interesting so now I'm with my friend 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.810
 show you another interesting pretty 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.170
 a secret that I saw recently and 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.430
 randomly and in general from where 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.070
 counter-terrorists know the year bam 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.460
 from the Chartist bomb now I'm all for you 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.460
 will tell 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.530
 let's taste 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.190
 in general, the bomb code is on their 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.810
 diffuser 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.610
 if you buy difuz as known 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.500
 come out see for five seconds like 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.200
 and if without diffusions it is very long 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.800
 so here's a little secret small 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.950
 Easter egg and do not even know not to know 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.570
 Easter eggs simply is secret or 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.140
 fuzov have counter-terrorists and the next 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.810
 secret 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.180
 we have a melon on the map like you 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.390
 you can watch these 2 ogres less and 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.260
 just the buildings will not be from the pipe 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.920
 what kind of reactor do you think 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.420
 surely here are many hacks 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.420
 overload the computer all the cases 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.900
 this is complete crap dudes this is complete 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.070
 crap 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:29.590
 come closer you see pixel and pixel and 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.550
 look further fly down opa and it costs 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.519
 insures 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:40.299
 what is it like this street 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.430
 enlarged copy of these pipes 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:47.650
 so you can watch these red ones 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.130
 front pockets for even if I do 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.709
 pipes 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.980
 it is simply an increase in the figures as well, 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.610
 as these have increased texture and 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.370
 overpass map here these are all sorts of screens 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.799
 buildings that we can only see 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.549
 at a certain angle and because under 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:09.459
 in a different angle and just see neither as 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:12.570
 here is a huge here is this tower just 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.570
 flies forward and so here 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.900
 We see that this is the same increased 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.040
 textures that's how they all look in 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.540
 increased size 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.540
 here in reduced 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:47.330
 Well, now I will tell the sending cities 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.860
 which were either accidents and how am I 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:54.410
 it seems to be a reference to the city of paris 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:58.280
 general card is called marquis operation 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:04.160
 van guard is a sending position that is 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:06.680
 the tower and why do i think it is because 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.130
 recent actions related to 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.820
 Paris custom terrorist I told them strongly 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.330
 danger from terrorists in general were 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.900
 terrorist attacks and Glebe hostages you can 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.570
 to google 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.680
 see what information seems to me 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:30.440
 this card corresponds to the action 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:34.250
 which took place there and the next 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.770
 chain on a slight map to action 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.320
 who were in Ukraine that is 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.810
 Chernobyl is the Chernobyl nuclear 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.110
 power station I think everyone knows all the games 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:49.070
 on this map quite popular by the way 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.320
 they want to build this reactor very much 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.300
 long but due to the situation which is now 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.860
 in Ukraine 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.860
 Of course it is very difficult to do 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.910
 Well, I think they know the next Easter eggs already 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.900
 all absolutely all this paschalka is 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.260
 on the map 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.350
 a salad is a very popular card especially 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.720
 in counter strike 1 6 and counter strike 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.300
 source 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:25.560
 on this map you can find one 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:28.170
 Here is the inscription Riverside precisely in this 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.230
 the city was very game action 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:34.380
 popular game , etc. 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.080
 I have already said that pretty probably everything 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.210
 already know this easter egg 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.510
 those who are unaware I think this information was 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:46.080
 useful to you I want to remind you again 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.090
 what i'm doing is not video specific 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.450
 people like Wait memory Comments are not 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:54.500
 need to smoke based and all things 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:58.470
 I do it for everyone to wanting to watch 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.660
 video but what if it was useful for you 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.240
 or interestingly you can subscribe
