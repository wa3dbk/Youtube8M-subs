00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.220
 hello friends welcome a video more and 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.920
 I hope that I hope you want it that way 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.470
 but I think it will be the last of the 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.330
 lathe as I said I was missing a 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.710
 little thing to do and well you see that already 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.230
 has another aspect completely 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.270
 we have given him a hand of 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.680
 painting that as you know it does 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.680
 miracles most of the time 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.400
 well you see it painted green 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.590
 then in the counterpoint the basis of 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.300
 counterpoint and some more piece like 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.239
 tool holder we have painted it black 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.489
 and news the steering wheel this one you remember us 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.200
 I told you that I was going to put some 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.780
 final mono piece I put this flyer 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.510
 this steering wheel is from an old valve is 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.519
 a valve in the scrap 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.519
 in the junkyard then well then 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.920
 clean it a little bit and paint it black 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.379
 You see that you dig good and then you 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.409
 soldier here a screw I have put a 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.880
 piece of copper tube you have here for 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.880
 that we can move 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.650
 good you see this movement is the one that 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.020
 allows to make and in this way to bring 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.640
 the counterpoint to the piece that I have 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.070
 put here piece of wood for later 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.240
 then do a turning test to 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.760
 see what we are given is a piece of 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.040
 pine I've found out there and good 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.750
 let's see how we are given as a novelty 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.640
 also louis the counterpoint that you know 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.010
 that gave me a lot of pain 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.750
 good head because in the end I put this 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.479
 piece to look at this piece is a piece of 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.070
 tube and inside of a bearing 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.470
 Well, you have a bearing 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.530
 well I had to do there are enough 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.690
 virgueries because 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.060
 The bearing as the tube piece is 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.470
 wider than the bearing danced a 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.780
 little for the sides and I have to poke 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.479
 a big one welded nut good 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.740
 gave more claw than I expected as 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.420
 you see is going crazy about the on the axis it 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.340
 moves on the shaft thanks to a 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.020
 bearing that has inside tip I've 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.390
 used the one that you see I had 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.830
 to be here that is simply 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.010
 put on a piece of screw that is 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.069
 soldier in this part 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.000
 there you can see he's soldier in this part of the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.460
 counterpoint you see it not 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.950
 Well, that's what's new after 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.020
 to leave these two nuts and this one 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.820
 in the back for once 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.530
 we have the position of the counterpoint 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.530
 fixed then thanks to these nuts 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.480
 to lend them and that does not move us 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.120
 the same thing I do with this one here and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.390
 so we prevent us from moving I have 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.390
 here 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.540
 I come from a key 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.060
 it's really is cheering him up a little bit 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.120
 in this to be 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.709
 And the cane, we could talk to you 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.480
 the handle of the type of what he has done 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.920
 a companion per year that remains as 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.650
 much more professional good in the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.270
 moment I do it with the key the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.200
 intention is that it no longer moves like 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.360
 You see, it does not move anymore 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.300
 and we have the counterpoint so good 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.170
 another novelty is that I had good had 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.230
 hanging there 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.060
 a series of capacitors that had the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.670
 good connection is a little bit a 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.640
 little bit more curious we agree 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.500
 a capacitor there did not have a loop 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.800
 then I put him with two flanges 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.190
 plastic and we already have here also the 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.190
 switch 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.460
 then the final result is the 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.100
 counterpoint rotates and already has a bit of 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.590
 This is because this is not the same 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.170
 perfectly aligned 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.180
 today within my possibilities 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.010
 this is what has come out I will teach 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.800
 our time I'm going to put it I'm going to put 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.030
 the camera on the tripod and you will see 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.709
 now the result with a lot 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.450
 and then a turning test for 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.450
 see how as a job I remember 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.320
 to this person 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.840
 Well, you see how it works 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.600
 you have been able to check is the first 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.470
 time in my life that I try to turn a 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.020
 piece 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.060
 I think it's obvious there's no 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.890
 secret is true is not the first time 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.450
 that I do it and therefore upload 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.370
 absolute disaster I hope I can learn 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.810
 now that you see that it works 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.940
 fairly decently 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.370
 from now on well let's go to 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.080
 try to do little things in agreement come 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.889
 Thank you very much for your attention 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.889
 and forever
