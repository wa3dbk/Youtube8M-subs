to create a square of 4 balls so I've

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.190 
to create a square of 4 balls so I've
created<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:01.190> square<00:01:01.489> here<00:01:01.850> out<00:01:02.120> of<00:01:02.810> the<00:01:02.930> black

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.980 
created a square here out of the black
balls<00:01:03.560> but<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.610> can<00:01:04.759> also<00:01:04.910> create<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.540> square

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
balls but you can also create a square

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.109 
balls but you can also create a square
like<00:01:06.200> that<00:01:06.259> as<00:01:06.979> I've<00:01:07.220> demonstrated<00:01:07.369> with<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
like that as I've demonstrated with the

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.790 
like that as I've demonstrated with the
red<00:01:08.270> balls<00:01:08.479> that<00:01:08.660> are<00:01:08.810> in<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:08.990> four<00:01:09.290> set<00:01:09.619> four

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
red balls that are in the four set four

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.710 
red balls that are in the four set four
corners<00:01:10.160> there<00:01:10.369> or<00:01:10.910> you<00:01:11.060> could<00:01:11.240> also<00:01:11.390> create

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
corners there or you could also create

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:20.950 
corners there or you could also create
kind<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:12.649> plus<00:01:13.100> sign<00:01:18.550> and<00:01:19.630> that<00:01:20.630> would<00:01:20.810> also

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
kind of a plus sign and that would also

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.990 
kind of a plus sign and that would also
be<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.410> winning<00:01:21.710> move<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.550> black<00:01:22.729> their

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
be a winning move in the black their

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.969 
be a winning move in the black their
night<00:01:23.240> as<00:01:23.479> you've<00:01:23.750> noticed<00:01:24.140> as<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.680> was<00:01:24.710> moving

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
night as you've noticed as I was moving

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.499

the balls around this is in a very
squishy<00:01:27.229> cube<00:01:27.979> here<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:28.610> there's<00:01:28.819> a<00:01:28.880> great

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:29.209 
squishy cube here so there's a great

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:33.070 
squishy cube here so there's a great
tactile<00:01:30.020> appeal<00:01:30.619> to<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.039> game<00:01:31.630> now<00:01:32.630> on<00:01:32.899> your

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
tactile appeal to this game now on your

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.570 
tactile appeal to this game now on your
turn<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:33.380> can<00:01:33.410> do<00:01:33.590> one<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:33.770> two<00:01:34.069> things<00:01:34.100> you

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
turn you can do one of two things you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.669 
turn you can do one of two things you
can<00:01:34.759> add<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.209> ball<00:01:35.479> now<00:01:35.869> there's<00:01:36.050> three<00:01:36.259> colors

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
can add a ball now there's three colors

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.320 
can add a ball now there's three colors
so<00:01:36.860> we're<00:01:37.009> gonna<00:01:37.100> add<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.580> white<00:01:37.729> ball<00:01:37.970> and

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
so we're gonna add in a white ball and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.630 
so we're gonna add in a white ball and
if<00:01:38.539> you<00:01:38.630> happen<00:01:38.959> to<00:01:38.990> add<00:01:39.200> into<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:39.830> row<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.429> has

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
if you happen to add into a row that has

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.730 
if you happen to add into a row that has
another<00:01:40.880> ball<00:01:41.119> in<00:01:41.300> there<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:41.869> sort<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.229> slides

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
another ball in there it sort of slides

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.309 
another ball in there it sort of slides
in<00:01:43.160> so<00:01:43.580> now<00:01:43.700> there<00:01:43.880> are<00:01:43.910> two<00:01:44.060> balls<00:01:44.600> in<00:01:44.959> this

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
in so now there are two balls in this

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.100 
in so now there are two balls in this
row<00:01:45.679> if<00:01:46.220> black<00:01:46.940> comes<00:01:47.240> along<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.780> wants<00:01:47.990> to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
row if black comes along and wants to

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.719 
row if black comes along and wants to
add<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.259> ball<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:48.920> row<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.369> they<00:01:49.520> may<00:01:49.700> end

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
add a ball to this row and they may end

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.389 
add a ball to this row and they may end
up<00:01:50.030> sliding<00:01:50.569> all<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.500> them<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.069> now<00:01:52.160> this

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
up sliding all of them in and now this

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.449 
up sliding all of them in and now this
roll<00:01:52.670> is<00:01:52.910> full<00:01:53.330> so<00:01:54.289> you<00:01:54.380> can<00:01:54.560> add<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.950> any<00:01:55.099> row

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
roll is full so you can add to any row

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.540 
roll is full so you can add to any row
that<00:01:55.759> is<00:01:55.880> not<00:01:56.030> complete<00:01:56.950> now<00:01:57.950> once<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.280> row<00:01:58.399> is

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
that is not complete now once the row is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.520 
that is not complete now once the row is
complete<00:01:58.910> instead<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.569> adding<00:01:59.810> a<00:02:00.020> ball<00:02:00.200> you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
complete instead of adding a ball you

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.309 
complete instead of adding a ball you
can<00:02:00.560> rotate<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:01.940> take<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.360> ball<00:02:02.509> off

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
can rotate it so you take the ball off

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.430 
can rotate it so you take the ball off
the<00:02:03.590> bottom<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.450> slide<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.599> back<00:02:05.840> in<00:02:06.140> at<00:02:06.410> the

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
the bottom and slide it back in at the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.529 
the bottom and slide it back in at the
top<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:07.099> where<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.459> black<00:02:07.700> was<00:02:08.000> once<00:02:08.209> on<00:02:08.420> the

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
top so where the black was once on the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.860 
top so where the black was once on the
top<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:09.470> now<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.130> middle<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:11.450> hopefully

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
top it is now in the middle so hopefully

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.960 
top it is now in the middle so hopefully
by<00:02:12.130> manipulating<00:02:13.130> your<00:02:13.220> moves<00:02:13.490> you'll<00:02:13.819> be

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
by manipulating your moves you'll be

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.330 
by manipulating your moves you'll be
able<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.330> get<00:02:14.510> one<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.990> those<00:02:15.140> three<00:02:15.709> square

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
able to get one of those three square
