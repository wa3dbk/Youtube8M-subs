horsepower<00:04:48.230> so<00:04:49.230> yesterday<00:04:49.560> we<00:04:50.070> drove<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.760> to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
horsepower so yesterday we drove the to

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.340 
horsepower so yesterday we drove the to
be<00:04:51.480> sixes<00:04:52.140> 340<00:04:53.070> 380<00:04:53.700> horsepower<00:04:53.900> today<00:04:54.900> we're

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
be sixes 340 380 horsepower today we're

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.570 
be sixes 340 380 horsepower today we're
in<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:56.040> mighty<00:04:56.420> supercharged<00:04:57.420> v8<00:04:58.580> 495

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
in the mighty supercharged v8 495

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.570 
in the mighty supercharged v8 495
horsepower<00:05:00.330> is<00:05:00.930> there<00:05:01.380> a<00:05:01.410> huge<00:05:01.860> difference<00:05:02.370> I

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
horsepower is there a huge difference I

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.090 
horsepower is there a huge difference I
think<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:03.390> was<00:05:03.510> very<00:05:03.870> clever<00:05:04.290> of<00:05:04.530> them<00:05:04.710> to

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
think it was very clever of them to

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.430 
think it was very clever of them to
start<00:05:05.430> us<00:05:05.580> off<00:05:05.760> in<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.420> smaller<00:05:06.810> engines<00:05:07.260> and

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
start us off in the smaller engines and

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.260 
start us off in the smaller engines and
then<00:05:07.680> put<00:05:07.890> us<00:05:08.010> in<00:05:08.160> this<00:05:08.310> car<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:08.730> think<00:05:08.850> if<00:05:09.180> we

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
then put us in this car I think if we

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.880 
then put us in this car I think if we
went<00:05:09.420> from<00:05:09.540> this<00:05:09.720> car<00:05:09.990> back<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.440> that<00:05:10.620> car

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
went from this car back to that car

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.310 
went from this car back to that car
which<00:05:11.220> we<00:05:11.370> can't<00:05:11.640> do<00:05:11.910> we<00:05:12.390> might<00:05:12.630> notice<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:13.110> huge

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
which we can't do we might notice a huge

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.100 
which we can't do we might notice a huge
difference<00:05:13.410> but<00:05:14.370> after<00:05:15.060> driving<00:05:15.390> all<00:05:15.780> three

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
difference but after driving all three

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.200 
difference but after driving all three
of<00:05:16.200> them<00:05:16.320> I<00:05:16.530> would<00:05:16.830> say<00:05:17.010> none<00:05:17.550> of<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.940> three

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
of them I would say none of the three

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.350 
of them I would say none of the three
models<00:05:18.570> really<00:05:18.900> lack<00:05:19.500> for<00:05:19.920> power<00:05:20.190> never<00:05:21.000> are

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
models really lack for power never are

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.150 
models really lack for power never are
you<00:05:21.480> going<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.810> be<00:05:21.930> able<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.170> use<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.740> great

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
you going to be able to use the great

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.010 
you going to be able to use the great
automotive<00:05:23.640> cliche<00:05:24.180> that<00:05:24.390> it<00:05:24.540> doesn't<00:05:24.900> have

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
automotive cliche that it doesn't have

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.900 
automotive cliche that it doesn't have
enough<00:05:25.260> power<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:25.590> get<00:05:25.740> out<00:05:25.920> of<00:05:26.040> its<00:05:26.190> way<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:26.880> I

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
enough power to get out of its way so I

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:34.520 
enough power to get out of its way so I
really<00:05:27.360> like

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.950 

the<00:05:35.340> interesting<00:05:35.850> thing<00:05:36.030> about<00:05:36.060> this<00:05:36.390> car<00:05:36.660> is

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
the interesting thing about this car is

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.650 
the interesting thing about this car is
that<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.380> has<00:05:37.590> so<00:05:38.190> much<00:05:38.370> mechanical<00:05:39.150> grip<00:05:39.360> so

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
that it has so much mechanical grip so

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.270 
that it has so much mechanical grip so
when<00:05:39.810> you're<00:05:39.930> really<00:05:40.170> pushing<00:05:40.410> it<00:05:40.650> hard<00:05:40.920> it

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
when you're really pushing it hard it

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.400 
when you're really pushing it hard it
very<00:05:41.730> rarely<00:05:42.120> gets<00:05:42.540> out<00:05:42.690> of<00:05:42.720> line<00:05:42.870> in<00:05:43.200> fact

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
very rarely gets out of line in fact

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.350 
very rarely gets out of line in fact
yesterday<00:05:43.980> at<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.490> track<00:05:44.760> when<00:05:44.970> we<00:05:45.090> turned

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
yesterday at the track when we turned

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.480 
yesterday at the track when we turned
off<00:05:45.540> all<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:45.900> stability<00:05:46.380> control<00:05:46.860> features

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
off all the stability control features

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:54.530 
off all the stability control features
first<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.270> was<00:05:48.360> very<00:05:48.390> easy<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:48.900> spin<00:05:49.770> it<00:05:49.920> up<00:05:53.540> but

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
first it was very easy to spin it up but

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.110 
first it was very easy to spin it up but
then<00:05:54.660> if<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:54.840> try<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.110> do<00:05:55.320> a<00:05:55.350> gradual

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
then if you try to do a gradual

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.970 
then if you try to do a gradual
breakaway<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:57.510> tends<00:05:58.050> not<00:05:58.110> to<00:05:58.320> want<00:05:58.710> to<00:05:58.830> do

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
breakaway it tends not to want to do

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.460 
breakaway it tends not to want to do
that<00:05:59.130> even<00:05:59.910> when<00:06:00.120> you're<00:06:00.270> trying<00:06:00.540> to<00:06:00.960> make<00:06:01.260> it

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
that even when you're trying to make it

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.610 
that even when you're trying to make it
spin<00:06:02.250> out<00:06:02.540> it'll<00:06:03.540> understeer<00:06:04.200> a<00:06:04.230> lot<00:06:04.500> easier

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
spin out it'll understeer a lot easier

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.910 
spin out it'll understeer a lot easier
oversteer<00:06:06.430> so<00:06:06.610> it's<00:06:06.790> a<00:06:06.910> very<00:06:07.210> stable<00:06:07.750> car<00:06:08.260> to

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
oversteer so it's a very stable car to

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.950 
oversteer so it's a very stable car to
begin<00:06:09.400> with<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:09.850> then<00:06:10.120> you<00:06:10.300> add<00:06:10.510> all<00:06:10.840> the

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
begin with and then you add all the

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.500 
begin with and then you add all the
stability<00:06:11.200> control<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:12.100> it<00:06:12.220> and<00:06:12.370> it<00:06:13.120> becomes

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
stability control to it and it becomes

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.720 
stability control to it and it becomes
even<00:06:13.780> more<00:06:14.200> stable<00:06:14.530> so<00:06:15.130> you're<00:06:15.310> really<00:06:15.580> not

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
even more stable so you're really not

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.430 
even more stable so you're really not
going<00:06:15.880> to<00:06:15.940> get<00:06:16.210> in<00:06:16.390> trouble<00:06:16.870> with<00:06:17.020> this<00:06:17.170> car

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
going to get in trouble with this car

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.010 
going to get in trouble with this car
it's<00:06:17.620> not<00:06:17.740> at<00:06:17.920> all<00:06:18.070> dangerous<00:06:18.400> and<00:06:18.970> if<00:06:19.660> there's

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
it's not at all dangerous and if there's

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.500 
it's not at all dangerous and if there's
a<00:06:20.140> you<00:06:20.950> know<00:06:21.070> if<00:06:21.370> there's<00:06:21.610> a<00:06:21.670> Fault<00:06:22.120> in<00:06:22.360> all

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
a you know if there's a Fault in all

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.930 
a you know if there's a Fault in all
that<00:06:22.750> maybe<00:06:23.440> it<00:06:23.830> feels<00:06:24.100> just<00:06:24.490> a<00:06:24.640> little<00:06:24.670> bit

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
that maybe it feels just a little bit

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.510 
that maybe it feels just a little bit
boring<00:06:25.570> a<00:06:28.020> Jag<00:06:29.020> still<00:06:29.440> has<00:06:29.710> so<00:06:30.010> much<00:06:30.190> luxury

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
boring a Jag still has so much luxury

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.000 
boring a Jag still has so much luxury
and<00:06:30.880> style<00:06:31.000> and<00:06:31.480> elegance<00:06:31.600> that<00:06:32.350> that's<00:06:32.680> not

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
and style and elegance that that's not

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.130 
and style and elegance that that's not
that<00:06:33.190> it<00:06:33.310> really<00:06:33.340> gets<00:06:33.790> in<00:06:34.000> the<00:06:34.120> way<00:06:34.360> of<00:06:34.690> the

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
that it really gets in the way of the

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.900 
that it really gets in the way of the
cars<00:06:35.350> sportiness<00:06:35.920> it's<00:06:36.250> that<00:06:36.430> it's<00:06:36.640> sort<00:06:36.850> of

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
cars sportiness it's that it's sort of

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.850 
cars sportiness it's that it's sort of
in<00:06:37.060> addition<00:06:37.360> to<00:06:37.600> it<00:06:37.840> I<00:06:38.020> think<00:06:38.350> if<00:06:38.470> you<00:06:38.590> were<00:06:38.710> to

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
in addition to it I think if you were to

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.880 
in addition to it I think if you were to
take<00:06:39.400> these<00:06:39.640> same<00:06:39.940> cars<00:06:40.360> this<00:06:41.110> and<00:06:41.440> a<00:06:41.500> Cayman

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890 
take these same cars this and a Cayman

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.280 
take these same cars this and a Cayman
on<00:06:41.980> the<00:06:42.070> roads<00:06:42.280> that<00:06:42.400> we<00:06:42.520> just<00:06:42.970> came<00:06:43.180> over<00:06:43.660> you

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
on the roads that we just came over you

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.160 
on the roads that we just came over you
might<00:06:44.830> prefer<00:06:45.160> the<00:06:45.370> camus<00:06:45.970> but<00:06:46.510> if<00:06:46.870> you're<00:06:47.140> a

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
might prefer the camus but if you're a

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.460 
might prefer the camus but if you're a
Jaguar<00:06:47.860> owner<00:06:48.310> or<00:06:48.790> buyer<00:06:49.240> or<00:06:49.600> potential<00:06:50.230> buyer
