00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.960
 hello today we continue the cycle 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.960
 our video reviews 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.240
 and provide you with a replacement 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.020
 oils how to change the oil to 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.590
 car as you have noticed with us 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.170
 the car is still the same simple da sens 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.679
 mean technology holding behind the place 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.230
 oil change the following meaning unscrew 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:33.020
 oil filler lift 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.710
 unscrew the car protection produce 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.129
 poured oil here all back then 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.430
 we twist a drain mouth and we change 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.289
 filter oil filter then in reverse 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.420
 okay 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:52.430
 we twist a drain mouth we put 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.590
 protection we lower the car and produce 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.960
 fill oil that is basically order 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.660
 idle time is gonna be this whole thing 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.750
 doing today in our video review 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.040
 all the same our master Konstantinovich 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.070
 Poltava city 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.369
 here he produces unscrewing oil 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.770
 clamping the necks the protection we took off and here at 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.159
 we see oil in the image 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.270
 drain into the neck as you see here 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.619
 we have a key square so-called 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.579
 10 right away 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:29.360
 Well, apparently there are traces of oil stains 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:32.240
 there is a leak but it's like a sore 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.170
 on automotive data so now 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.420
 we are doing here unscrewing this 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.869
 drain neck and will begin to drain 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.869
 oils 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.360
 here we turn off our young 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.240
 Master to MS -1 Janovich 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.240
 all famously he turns about 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:01.670
 went hot water is wonderful and so 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.090
 oil or years we proceed to the next 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:11.270
 stage is the replacement of the oil filter 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.590
 so I will show you the affairs is so 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.200
 he can see blue 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.200
 we use a special key 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:33.130
 special key answered flour flour 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:36.490
 Well, under normal and as if unscrewed 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.620
 then see the key of course we 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.440
 special now we will show it but 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.720
 it is possible to unscrew it manually 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.600
 and use other key modifications 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.160
 but of course in the economy it is desirable to have 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.430
 This is what we have now 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.640
 Konstantinovich from the city of Poltava 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.790
 will demonstrate here is the national this 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.140
 kit on dick 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.739
 oil see little Yulia and show us 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.739
 now ivy 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:17.159
 such keys are flying out of sight 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.810
 enough original chain here now 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:23.150
 we will show you how this whole thing 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.150
 going on the filter 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.769
 so here so here he dresses 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.780
 Now in this way it is happening and 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.180
 eat and install and remove very 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.460
 probably quite an interesting thing 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.120
 will buy 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.750
 in the household to him and we finally 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.110
 Now we are starting to install a new one. 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:03.870
 filter here we close the oil drain 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.220
 the neck sees and so that so skillfully 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.130
 it turns out the decree found on Janovich from 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.420
 Poltava city 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.420
 Here the filter is 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:25.580
 so watch the new movie filter 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.580
 gum is made and 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.830
 setting it up as they say 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:40.900
 where he will have to see 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.110
 Wonderful 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.880
 Well, of course 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.449
 finally tightening will be done with 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.449
 Soviet yet 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.760
 So 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.229
 so mean all events with massive 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:04.830
 filter and drain neck we did 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.169
 set the filter tightened spun 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.009
 tightened the oil drain cap and 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:14.490
 now we put back protection here guys 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.999
 install it and come to the next 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.009
 the stage after that 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:23.520
 so we went to the next stage 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.539
 More precisely, the stage which I conditionally call 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.509
 what was the aim 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:31.619
 we got it filler you basis 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:34.819
 please fill up the oil 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:34.819
 filler cap 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.059
 so during the pouring of oil we spend 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.770
 periodically level control 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:45.539
 This we mostly daeu sens vlazit 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.680
 tentatively in a three-layered area 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.860
 liters . 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.629
 4 liter jerry me a little bit there 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.139
 and the oil will remain on some 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:58.490
 your 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:58.490
 move husband possible to fill and so on 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.870
 all everything up to fill up 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.919
 maximum and now we will start 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:10.080
 the car pumped the noise of the mother oil 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.779
 beat to the maximum level and now 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.680
 we produce a car factory in order 

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.680
 to this butter 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.060
 Here we started the car literally 10 15 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.120
 shouted oil pressure lamp over back 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.570
 to check we will check further 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.400
 so after we engines 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.560
 pumped oil the last stage is 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:51.660
 check all the same oil level 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:55.440
 whom we take check all 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.240
 normal all oil changes on the car 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.510
 finished thanks bye to new 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.510
 meeting
