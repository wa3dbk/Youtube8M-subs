00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 ode to oi 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:20.720
 4 It's a very special time for hero 2 specialist Hammer. 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.220
 Tendeyo you want your boss to you the nature of the haebeo guide books Level 1 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.040
 Let's start with each one. 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:31.670
 Increases the damage done by your opponent by 10% 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:36.050
 So I added 20% originally . Now I 'm giving you 10% more. 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.650
 I am very sick of that far away, so if the pack is right, 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.840
 And 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:46.879
 The ambiguity did 50 did the damage of artillery annihilated shock resistance Siege Mode 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.400
 It's not a little bit immune, 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.210
 It's very good to be close to transformation. 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.330
 When you enter the self -portraits mode, it becomes concealed. 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.920
 The following general attacks are 100% more vulnerable 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:05.180
 So Hilleberg usually not play the expert group Po Nha 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:10.369
 The more these two tanks Maybe I do a lot of consumption to bowl 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.510
 So it's not going to be so good. 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.560
 It's great. 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:19.490
 Originally there was a 2- gauge reinforcement, and this swirl shell was always a 2-gazelle 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.630
 I had a basic hack to detail the hammers to the floor, but these play professionals 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:29.060
 It's a big difference. It's a suicide boat. 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:32.870
 Focused Attack The next general attack adds 50% damage every 10 seconds. 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.040
 Now this also by this also does a lot of character in a hurry to attack what he also secretly 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.170
 It could be okay. 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.320
 Originally this also some characteristics of the clearing to get together for a long time even in pyeongta b Article 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.030
 I think I'm okay with the cake frame 01 to live. 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.660
 Swirling shells are always good, because the base attack's range is increased by 20%. 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.280
 Because 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:56.990
 Little 1 So this is the heroes that the crossroads can study. 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:02.120
 2 times more power . 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.580
 So I went to Level 1 to play professional Riki, so Level 4 is also Mock 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.140
 I think it's better not to take a lung attack. 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:12.800
 I'm not going to stick around . Now, let's look at level seven. 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:18.650
 As a rule, the navy blue effect increases by 40%. 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.810
 The reduction in the vague'm cooler propeller speed should increase 2 seconds 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.560
 Thank you 20 seconds for cooldown 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.840
 And this is when the foundation of this point dwaeseo lumbar steam always on 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.959
 I can quickly join the battlefield. 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:35.250
 So I waenya associating quite a lot of this in the past seconds 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:38.250
 Hammer ginseng's so frustrating it would be great and slow turtle 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.350
 And then emergency treatment. 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.340
 Emergency treatment is also pretty good for heroes who have these traits 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.410
 Technology. 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.660
 So let 's also say that a dealer is required to have first aid in order to survive this year. 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.140
 I can see it. 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.190
 The 10th level will be Napalm and the 13th level 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:04.200
 I am very invited to the giant ambitions dream. 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:08.790
 And if you do not get a preemptive attack, 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:13.500
 I'd like the damage done by 25% Hey it quite a bit more quietly 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:17.640
 Deoraguyo taken, but generally this is to give the supervisor Gary crash phosphate 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:23.370
 In the middle, a spider mine pushed the target a short distance. 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:26.880
 I do not know how to do it. 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.900
 And where to take the conflict mines 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:35.790
 I took a lot Basil spend 16 years in this also I have mine as a neopeu 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.190
 I have chosen a lot of changes, so hit the beat as far away pyeongta pyeongta pyeongta 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.180
 It's changing now for Hammer. 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:47.070
 So this is the word that writes a lot of the mountain so the time 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:51.870
 The close opponent is an assassin. If this is the case, I 'll shoot this wall. Just 2 w 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:57.269
 When the writing to make an impact, I uncovered a wall dignity 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:00.150
 I really could escape from the edition statement yesterday, creating a wall so 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:04.500
 I have a firewall, and I'm going to be on the run. 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:08.970
 I have a lot more to write on the car 16 map here . 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.690
 It's also a way to live longer with stone leather and siege mode 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.799
 My folk song range dies and continues to grow further 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.019
 Yeah, I do not think it 's up to 100%. 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.109
 Show some expectations to the end of the earth 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.919
 But that does not make it easy. 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.830
 So it's vague that you took this. That's what you usually take. 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.580
 It's in mobility mode. 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:36.000
 I can move in that state. I can not move at a very high speed. 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.110
 I'm not quite moving, and I can not. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.740
 It's moving. It's very attractive. It's a minefield . 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:50.729
 Well, when the executor is out of state , 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.150
 When the deceleration is done with the animal , the normal attack is added to the damage state. 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.110
 It gives. 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.789
 So, especially when you're in class with your son. 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.229
 stitch 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:06.240
 When you're with a ragged hero like this, you can use it with three houses. 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:08.370
 Leave it to take actual kidding, so I have two enforcers pyeongta Hammer 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.849
 I'd really recommend it. 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.979
 Try to take it rather than get one, so Ido Siege mode 14 yes this 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:19.770
 Interior times over it 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:24.060
 I do not see it, so this is why I replaced the cg mode 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:27.990
 I guess you can do that, but rather than bother to get up Roman siege mode 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.220
 It's right, but I'm more immersed than I'm picking it up. 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.080
 Two weeks. 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:37.949
 Pyeongta so that's not very fast, so the state is the hippocampus, 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:42.090
 7.6 if you do not know the intersection 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:46.830
 I'll write that I'm a real head-party Topp Dogg 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:51.539
 What an enormous zest, so 15 days originally with Gangnam 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:56.340
 Try the mouth-side naohmyeonseo was circumcised mostly buried in the pulpit transplant pyeongta 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:59.250
 Are replaced with a hammer and a place I'm completely hate this deal primarily 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.900
 Just give it to increase the level of modified street 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:08.310
 Rank 1 in Bern Chile survival group got 1 Level 7 Level Having live their commitment that 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.180
 I would like to recommend to you once you like the characteristics of flat materials 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.969
 I'll do it 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.930
 4 year alone just a little bit more these days for the original from 1 jjoil Chair Care 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.529
 It's coming down. 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:23.909
 Because other heroes are getting better, but Hammer 's still 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:26.810
 A good hero in practice is a hero that I consider to be a real one 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:26.810
 Show deurija 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:37.210
 Thank you.
