00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
you know that log probably weighs 4,000

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.590 
you know that log probably weighs 4,000
pounds<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:48.340> you're<00:01:48.490> pulling<00:01:48.700> up<00:01:48.970> a<00:01:49.119> hill<00:01:49.330> you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
pounds then you're pulling up a hill you

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.780 
pounds then you're pulling up a hill you
know<00:01:50.410> you're<00:01:50.560> doubling<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.040> weight<00:01:51.160> of<00:01:51.399> it<00:01:51.520> so
