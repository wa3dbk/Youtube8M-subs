00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.370
 can 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.160
 Today I'll show you something again 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.750
 current namely hitman absolution 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.160
 which now for almost three months 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.830
 on the market is for the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.210
 playstation 3 xbox 360 and the pc 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.040
 it is about the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.570
 meanwhile fifth part of the series me 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.980
 have already played all predecessor 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.820
 after the longer break after 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.110
 hitman blood money 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.879
 that is a time for me again 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.590
 won a few people kill for 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.870
 all those who never heard of hitman 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.309
 we play as agent 47 one of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.230
 Scientists in a keel borge 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.989
 conductor profikiller no one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.850
 no emotions but only a feeling 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.260
 Dead people cover so practically 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.120
 Stink normal money like everyone else 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.710
 only with a somewhat unusual occupation 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.120
 in the intro sequence we are explained 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.859
 that our first target is someone 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.629
 our own rows are three 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.409
 January our contact person from the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.239
 predecessors 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.350
 she has opposed the agency 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.290
 and of course one has to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.180
 violent deaths die violent 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.920
 height of the first level also serves 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.820
 at the same time as a small tutorial with it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.710
 Let's get involved with the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.090
 play mechanics can familiarize the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.890
 then looks like this 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.480
 infiltrating a property over the garden 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.040
 and turn off the security staff 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.990
 one after the other so we do not 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.470
 attract attention or not quite 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.470
 so subtle 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.630
 we can bury the corpses in trash 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.280
 they practically hide everywhere 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.170
 stand around in the area or leave as 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.520
 otherwise they will disappear when there are so 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.870
 then we can get hot too 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.730
 hide yourself so as not to get caught 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.590
 I will find that right from the beginning 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.150
 to really horny leon the pro feeling 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.980
 arises when one moves from a to b 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.780
 sneaks people out and the 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.490
 Let the dead disappear is the whole thing 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.750
 also excellent musically accompanied 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.150
 and will be very great from the first minute on 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.550
 coherently presents an additional 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.230
 Help is the instinct of agent 47 den 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.420
 man can activate with keystroke 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.920
 so you get a kind of tail and probably 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.140
 knows where the opponents are and 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.850
 to act tactically or we can the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.950
 Foresee ways to walk and know if we are 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.690
 Anyone who comes too close can also 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.770
 with a kind bullet time several opponents 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.770
 switch off at the same time 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.020
 we can camouflage ourselves even better 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.470
 also the clothes of killed enemies 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.640
 attract 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.050
 however, you have to deal with it 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.910
 behave fairly unobtrusively 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.380
 we like to find it relatively quickly 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.030
 under the shower and can have one 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.440
 to admire part of their right titles 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.060
 then pop them off and leave them 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.890
 back to her corpse so nice because I 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.420
 in the inventory unfortunately no condoms find 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.680
 could and most likely too 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.110
 had left many traces 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.790
 strangely, you still promise 47 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.110
 that we take care of victoria so 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.270
 we also said this one and 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.890
 fuck us now the game begins 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.420
 rightly we have little self in ourselves 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.040
 Danger brought because the agency with 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.570
 their scientists behind victoria 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.520
 is her and therefore also behind 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.769
 us because we protect them I understand 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.269
 honestly not why 47 a tick 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.739
 on a little girl there but 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.150
 Anyway, we have to ask her in front of the agency 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.890
 protect and find out what this is 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.720
 So you can do it at all 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.280
 as usual we always get 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.810
 new places in which we cheat ourselves and 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.800
 Target person we clear out of the way 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.750
 have to be around it all 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.760
 I discover story technically 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.290
 not quite understandable where 47 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.880
 Suddenly take with feeling and 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.170
 but the tussi cares otherwise 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.930
 we have a well staged here 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.400
 absolutely solid to very good little 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.200
 action adventure and who did not want to 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.760
 always wanted to be a profi killer of 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.709
 secretly people from the ambush 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.120
 Of course you can do everything 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.769
 and everyone just makes so flat they 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.060
 also makes a lot of bock 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.829
 or you can have a few thoughts 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.420
 make and actually act like it 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.950
 a real killer would do 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.600
 I start with the basic idea 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.370
 actually every mission but the 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.870
 Temptation is usually so great and me 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.590
 must always use and other innocent 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.590
 shoot dead 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.400
 What I find particularly positive is 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.810
 the good atmosphere of the game at one 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.640
 For example, you have to switch to one 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.319
 huge mass of people are submerging 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.000
 to leave a crime scene without of the 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.379
 to be packed cops I finds crass 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.090
 how many passers-by in some levels 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.099
 running around at the same time as well 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.900
 here for example in chinatown by 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.879
 the whole scenario is extreme 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.949
 authentic the game is not now 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.510
 Absolutely world class and it can go 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.010
 again a bit monotonous 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.780
 but who has never hit a mental one 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.949
 should have tasted it all up 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.600
 watch every case 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.600
 Also there's tap bonus
