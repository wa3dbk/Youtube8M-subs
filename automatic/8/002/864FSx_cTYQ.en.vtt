this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.500> video<00:00:01.890> on<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.939> tie<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.659> knot

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
this is a video on how to tie a knot

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.309 
this is a video on how to tie a knot
that<00:00:04.470> will<00:00:04.710> break<00:00:04.980> free<00:00:05.490> under<00:00:05.970> tension<00:00:06.319> the

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
that will break free under tension the

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.910 
that will break free under tension the
application<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:09.170> carry<00:00:10.170> something<00:00:10.530> around

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
application is to carry something around

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.419 
application is to carry something around
your<00:00:11.190> neck<00:00:11.460> be<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.630> knife<00:00:12.929> or<00:00:13.349> your<00:00:13.889> wallet

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
your neck be it a knife or your wallet

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.660 
your neck be it a knife or your wallet
or<00:00:14.700> your<00:00:15.480> keys<00:00:16.070> some<00:00:17.070> people<00:00:17.400> worry<00:00:17.609> about

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
or your keys some people worry about

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.710 
or your keys some people worry about
getting<00:00:18.180> strangled<00:00:18.810> by<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:20.010> knot<00:00:20.660> this<00:00:21.660> knot

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
getting strangled by the knot this knot

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.920 
getting strangled by the knot this knot
will<00:00:21.960> break<00:00:22.470> free<00:00:22.680> under<00:00:23.010> tension<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:24.510> basic

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
will break free under tension the basic

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.970 
will break free under tension the basic
idea<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.970> you're<00:00:26.970> going<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> make<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.949> u-shape

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
idea is you're going to make a u-shape

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.650 
idea is you're going to make a u-shape
on<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.609> end<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.539> string<00:00:31.140> or<00:00:31.380> rope<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
on one end of the string or rope and

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.270 
on one end of the string or rope and
you're<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> make<00:00:34.290> some<00:00:34.680> other<00:00:34.980> knot

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
you're going to make some other knot

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.910 
you're going to make some other knot
that<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:35.760> compress<00:00:36.300> around<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.710> that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that will compress around it so that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
that will compress around it so that
when<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.430> when<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.000> pull<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.510> it'll

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
when it when you pull on it it'll

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.310 
when it when you pull on it it'll
actually<00:00:40.190> break<00:00:41.190> free<00:00:41.600> okay<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> reason<00:00:42.989> why

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
actually break free okay the reason why

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
actually break free okay the reason why
we<00:00:43.800> don't<00:00:43.980> make<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> knot<00:00:44.520> around<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
we don't make the knot around just the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.350 
we don't make the knot around just the
rope<00:00:45.660> itself<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.640> usually<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> end

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
rope itself is usually at the end

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.750 
rope itself is usually at the end
there's<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.280> rope<00:00:50.550> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
there's you know like this rope is

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.350 
there's you know like this rope is
burned<00:00:51.620> there's<00:00:52.620> some<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
burned there's some kind of a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.340 
burned there's some kind of a
enlargement<00:00:54.360> there<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> might<00:00:55.170> get

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
enlargement there and it might get

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.000 
enlargement there and it might get
tangled<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> want<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> use<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.390> you

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
tangled so you want to use the you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
tangled so you want to use the you
alright<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.699> simplest<00:01:00.329> form<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.140> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
alright so the simplest form of this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.719 
alright so the simplest form of this
knot<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:03.629> tie<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.290> regular<00:01:04.729> overhand

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
knot is to just tie a regular overhand

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.120 
knot is to just tie a regular overhand
knot<00:01:06.380> like<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:09.650> you're<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> take

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
knot like so and you're going to take

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.870 
knot like so and you're going to take
your<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:12.229> insert<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.409> inside<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.220> overhand

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
your you insert it inside the overhand

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.969 
your you insert it inside the overhand
knot<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.409> then<00:01:16.409> you're<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
knot and then you're just going to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.070 
knot and then you're just going to
tighten<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> overhand<00:01:17.970> knot<00:01:18.299> around<00:01:18.810> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
tighten the overhand knot around that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.710 
tighten the overhand knot around that
you<00:01:20.299> all<00:01:21.299> right

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
you all right

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.420 
you all right
so<00:01:23.330> get<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.450> good<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> tight<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
so get it good and tight so that is

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.179 
so get it good and tight so that is
holding<00:01:27.140> around<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> rope<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:30.979> then<00:01:31.979> what

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
holding around the rope and then what

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.149 
holding around the rope and then what
happens<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.170> friction<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.350> depends<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
happens is friction it depends on the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.640 
happens is friction it depends on the
friction<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> rope<00:01:36.060> okay<00:01:36.750> there's<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.500> lot

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
friction on the rope okay there's a lot

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
friction on the rope okay there's a lot
of<00:01:37.799> friction<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.369> might<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.759> sufficient<00:01:38.970> but

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
of friction this might be sufficient but

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.100 
of friction this might be sufficient but
happens<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> pull<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.640> knot

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
happens when you pull on it is this knot

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
happens when you pull on it is this knot
it<00:01:43.110> actually<00:01:43.979> gets<00:01:44.159> pretty<00:01:44.520> tight<00:01:44.880> right

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
it actually gets pretty tight right

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.420 
it actually gets pretty tight right
there<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.130> then<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> lets<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:48.500> okay

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
there and then it lets go okay

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.969 
there and then it lets go okay
this<00:01:50.670> illustrates<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.509> way<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.320> type<00:01:52.799> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
this illustrates the way this type of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.249 
this illustrates the way this type of
knot<00:01:53.159> works<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.149> wouldn't<00:01:54.540> use<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
knot works but I wouldn't use just a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.109 
knot works but I wouldn't use just a
single<00:01:55.470> overhand<00:01:56.159> loop<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:57.000> afraid

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
single overhand loop because I'm afraid

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.690 
single overhand loop because I'm afraid
it<00:01:57.479> might<00:01:57.659> come<00:01:57.930> loose<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.439> certain<00:01:59.310> types<00:01:59.549> of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
it might come loose and certain types of

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.200 
it might come loose and certain types of
rope<00:01:59.939> are<00:02:00.210> slippery<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.649> won't<00:02:02.040> work<00:02:02.210> so

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
rope are slippery so it won't work so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.219 
rope are slippery so it won't work so
what<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.490> tie<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:06.030> double<00:02:06.570> overhand

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
what you do is you tie a double overhand

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.180 
what you do is you tie a double overhand
knot<00:02:07.530> alright<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:09.030> basically<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:10.770> got<00:02:10.950> your

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
knot alright so basically you got your

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.699 
knot alright so basically you got your
rope<00:02:11.400> you're<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.510> come<00:02:12.720> back<00:02:12.930> around

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
rope you're going to come back around

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.429 
rope you're going to come back around
and<00:02:14.400> you're<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.239> do<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:16.140> turn<00:02:18.200> okay<00:02:19.200> and

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
and you're going to do one turn okay and

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.110 
and you're going to do one turn okay and
then<00:02:19.829> a<00:02:20.189> second<00:02:20.760> turn<00:02:20.969> and<00:02:22.370> then<00:02:23.370> with<00:02:23.939> this

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
then a second turn and then with this

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.830 
then a second turn and then with this
end<00:02:24.420> you're<00:02:24.599> going<00:02:24.719> to<00:02:24.780> go<00:02:24.959> back<00:02:25.319> through<00:02:25.980> and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.539

here's your double overhand knot okay so
I've<00:02:35.909> got<00:02:35.969> my<00:02:36.269> hole<00:02:36.719> here<00:02:37.459> I'm<00:02:38.459> going<00:02:38.609> to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
I've got my hole here I'm going to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.770 
I've got my hole here I'm going to
tighten<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.090> down<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.750> little<00:02:39.900> bit<00:02:41.359> I've<00:02:42.359> got

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
tighten this down a little bit I've got

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.059 
tighten this down a little bit I've got
my<00:02:42.989> hole<00:02:43.230> here<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.739> I'm<00:02:44.159> going<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.340> reinsert

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
my hole here and I'm going to reinsert

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.909 
my hole here and I'm going to reinsert
the<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.639> my<00:02:47.970> string<00:02:48.329> or<00:02:48.599> rope<00:02:50.000> like<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.919> and

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
the you in my string or rope like so and

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.670 
the you in my string or rope like so and
then<00:02:53.819> I'm<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.329> to<00:02:54.389> tighten<00:02:54.900> my<00:02:55.169> double

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
then I'm going to tighten my double

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.289 
then I'm going to tighten my double
overhand<00:02:56.129> knot<00:02:56.430> around<00:02:56.909> it<00:02:58.280> all<00:02:59.280> right<00:02:59.430> so<00:03:00.209> you

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
overhand knot around it all right so you

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.089 
overhand knot around it all right so you
can<00:03:00.629> get<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:00.930> good<00:03:01.139> and<00:03:01.260> tight<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.859> is<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
can get this good and tight this is the

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.149 
can get this good and tight this is the
knot<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.549> use<00:03:02.939> because<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:04.560> knots<00:03:04.799> the

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
knot that I use because the knots the

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.830 
knot that I use because the knots the
double<00:03:05.549> overhand<00:03:05.879> knot<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.359> not<00:03:06.540> going<00:03:06.780> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
double overhand knot is not going to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.179 
double overhand knot is not going to
come<00:03:07.019> loose<00:03:07.609> all<00:03:08.609> right<00:03:08.669> and<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:10.650> grips<00:03:10.950> the

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
come loose all right and it grips the

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.250 
come loose all right and it grips the
string<00:03:11.519> pretty<00:03:11.879> well<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.419> have<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.689> tug<00:03:12.900> on<00:03:13.049> it

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
string pretty well you have to tug on it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.530 
string pretty well you have to tug on it
hard<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.709> let<00:03:13.859> it<00:03:13.919> go<00:03:14.040> okay<00:03:15.829> so<00:03:17.180> when<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.299> pull

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
hard to let it go okay so when you pull

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.670 
hard to let it go okay so when you pull
on<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:19.010> same<00:03:20.010> thing<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.549> slips<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.750> grabs<00:03:22.229> and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
on it same thing it slips it grabs and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:31.069 
on it same thing it slips it grabs and
then<00:03:23.060> let's<00:03:24.060> go<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:29.540> depending<00:03:30.540> on<00:03:30.689> the<00:03:30.959> amount

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
then let's go so depending on the amount

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.009 
then let's go so depending on the amount
of<00:03:31.319> friction<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:31.949> have<00:03:32.189> on<00:03:32.400> your<00:03:32.579> string<00:03:33.019> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
of friction you have on your string the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.409 
of friction you have on your string the
double<00:03:34.379> overhand<00:03:34.979> knot<00:03:35.280> might<00:03:35.609> not<00:03:35.849> be<00:03:36.090> enough

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
double overhand knot might not be enough

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.259 
double overhand knot might not be enough
so<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:36.959> do<00:03:37.409> one<00:03:37.829> more<00:03:38.129> turn<00:03:38.489> make<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.060> triple

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
so you do one more turn make it a triple

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.689 
so you do one more turn make it a triple
overhand<00:03:39.989> knot<00:03:40.199> so<00:03:40.530> do<00:03:40.709> one<00:03:40.949> more<00:03:41.159> turn<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.609> the

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
overhand knot so do one more turn of the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.819 
overhand knot so do one more turn of the
rope<00:03:41.909> around<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.569> then<00:03:42.720> back<00:03:42.959> through<00:03:43.319> like<00:03:43.590> I

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
rope around and then back through like I

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.420 
rope around and then back through like I
made<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:45.269> double<00:03:45.629> overhand<00:03:46.019> knot<00:03:46.259> and<00:03:46.500> you

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
made the double overhand knot and you

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.909 
made the double overhand knot and you
could<00:03:47.609> put<00:03:47.819> as<00:03:47.939> many<00:03:48.120> loops<00:03:48.419> as<00:03:48.930> many<00:03:49.379> turns<00:03:49.680> as

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
could put as many loops as many turns as

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.610 
could put as many loops as many turns as
you<00:03:50.069> want<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.519> increase<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.060> friction<00:03:51.620> you

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
you want to increase the friction you

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.740 
you want to increase the friction you
can<00:03:52.799> also<00:03:52.979> use<00:03:53.340> different<00:03:53.579> types<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.269> not<00:03:54.449> for

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
can also use different types of not for

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.780 
can also use different types of not for
this<00:03:54.900> I've<00:03:55.169> done<00:03:55.229> the<00:03:55.709> single<00:03:55.949> overhand<00:03:56.639> and

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
this I've done the single overhand and

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.839 
this I've done the single overhand and
the<00:03:56.939> double<00:03:57.269> double<00:03:57.870> overhand<00:03:58.319> knot<00:03:58.669> you<00:03:59.669> can

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
the double double overhand knot you can

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.349 
the double double overhand knot you can
mess<00:04:00.540> around<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:01.229> you<00:04:01.680> know<00:04:01.799> try<00:04:02.189> other<00:04:02.519> types

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
mess around and you know try other types

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.929 
mess around and you know try other types
of<00:04:03.569> knots<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.079> figure<00:04:04.409> eight<00:04:04.609> it's<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.759> good

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
of knots like a figure eight it's a good

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.300 
of knots like a figure eight it's a good
idea<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.419> experiment<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.590> actually<00:04:07.979> try<00:04:08.250> this

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
idea to experiment and actually try this

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.259 
idea to experiment and actually try this
out<00:04:08.729> I<00:04:09.449> had<00:04:10.229> a<00:04:10.259> double<00:04:10.739> overhand<00:04:11.220> knot<00:04:11.519> tied<00:04:11.909> in

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
out I had a double overhand knot tied in

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.080 
out I had a double overhand knot tied in
my<00:04:12.449> neck<00:04:12.989> rope<00:04:13.290> but<00:04:14.009> I<00:04:14.040> decided<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.819> it<00:04:15.000> was

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
my neck rope but I decided that it was

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.339 
my neck rope but I decided that it was
too<00:04:15.299> tight<00:04:15.629> so<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.049> decided<00:04:16.949> to<00:04:17.159> use<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.310> single

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
too tight so I decided to use a single

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.860 
too tight so I decided to use a single
overhand<00:04:19.349> knot<00:04:19.560> version<00:04:20.269> alright<00:04:21.269> this<00:04:21.599> is

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
overhand knot version alright this is

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.409 
overhand knot version alright this is
the<00:04:22.680> neck<00:04:22.950> lanyard<00:04:23.250> for<00:04:23.610> my<00:04:23.729> Mora<00:04:24.150> knife

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
the neck lanyard for my Mora knife

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.430 
the neck lanyard for my Mora knife
actually<00:04:25.380> prefer<00:04:25.950> to

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
actually prefer to

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.310 
actually prefer to
we<00:04:26.530> get<00:04:26.650> like<00:04:26.800> this<00:04:27.130> around<00:04:27.640> my<00:04:27.880> shoulder<00:04:28.390> all

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
we get like this around my shoulder all

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.650 
we get like this around my shoulder all
right<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:32.610> it's<00:04:33.610> pretty<00:04:33.940> secure

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
right so it's pretty secure

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.660 
right so it's pretty secure
okay<00:04:35.020> but<00:04:35.620> if<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.890> get<00:04:36.070> caught<00:04:36.100> around

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
okay but if you get caught around

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.440 
okay but if you get caught around
something<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:38.260> get<00:04:38.440> caught<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:40.120> comes

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
something and you get caught it comes

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.610 
something and you get caught it comes
loose<00:04:40.800> okay<00:04:41.800> so<00:04:43.020> experiment<00:04:44.020> with<00:04:44.230> your<00:04:44.350> knots

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
loose okay so experiment with your knots

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.390 
loose okay so experiment with your knots
see<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.250> how<00:04:45.430> much<00:04:45.580> friction<00:04:45.910> you<00:04:46.180> like
