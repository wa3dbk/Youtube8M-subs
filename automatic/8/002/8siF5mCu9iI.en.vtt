this<00:01:42.180> was<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> temp<00:01:42.659> one<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.950> went<00:01:44.340> straight<00:01:44.520> into

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this was a temp one I went straight into

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.149 
this was a temp one I went straight into
a<00:01:44.939> game<00:01:45.180> got<00:01:45.659> into<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> game<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> Gold<00:01:46.680> Cup<00:01:46.979> I

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
a game got into a game in the Gold Cup I

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.230 
a game got into a game in the Gold Cup I
thought<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> might<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.670> able<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> grind<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
thought I might be able to grind out a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.030 
thought I might be able to grind out a
drawer<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:48.930> we're<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.140> penalties<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
drawer and then we're not penalties or I

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.770 
drawer and then we're not penalties or I
just<00:01:50.850> thought<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.060> might<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.270> more<00:01:51.390> options

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
just thought they might be more options

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.100 
just thought they might be more options
for<00:01:51.840> me<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> cup<00:01:52.470> more<00:01:53.280> variety<00:01:53.960> but<00:01:54.960> we

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
for me in the cup more variety but we

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.719 
for me in the cup more variety but we
get<00:01:55.320> stitched<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.860> straight<00:01:56.070> away<00:01:56.130> within<00:01:56.399> 10
