00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.609
 firm 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.080
 and for the house 2000 Poland 1991 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.300
 engaged in production 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.399
 elements of foam used in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.010
 construction and allowing to create 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.770
 passive self-contained buildings and for 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.730
 home promotes development 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.070
 energy saving and harmless to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.110
 building environment she is ours 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.160
 the company is now twenty one 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.379
 makes blocks from expanded polystyrene 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.789
 intended for construction 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.109
 energy efficient and passive buildings and 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.910
 constructions alarm clock about fugu long 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.460
 award winning technology and home 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.260
 this is a complex of specialized approaches 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.530
 and erection methods are good 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.390
 isolated underground parts of buildings 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.180
 external walls of floors and roofs 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.880
 the main advantage of this innovative 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.430
 technology is energy saving in 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.590
 difference from traditional isolation here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.030
 eliminated heat leakage entailing 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 additional expenses 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.460
 the whole system and for the house is almost 100 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.829
 elements that connect between 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.780
 like a designer due to 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.700
 this construction can be carried out faster 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.380
 as the amount of work needed on 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.570
 construction site comes down to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.670
 minimal push to create technology and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.680
 for the house was the idea of ​​the maximum 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.600
 quick formwork erection of 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.229
 insulation material full height 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.630
 the floor and filling with concrete we pump 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.210
 pomp well-being of tenants 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.670
 depends on its microclimate which is 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.590
 due to 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.420
 appropriate air 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.649
 building elements and for the house 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.539
 made from fps not support and busting 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.700
 varieties of foamed polystyrene 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.950
 it is thanks to them that the winter is warm at home 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.360
 cool in summer and the structure of the air 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.640
 favorable for residents 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.830
 design versatility created 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.900
 and behind the house allows you to build the most 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.590
 different constructions from private houses and 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.510
 hotels 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.760
 prior to build industrial use 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.590
 award winning application 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.420
 insulation technology and home 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.760
 allows users to building 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.200
 save significantly on 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.690
 operating costs 10 times 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.400
 reduce heating costs limit 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.500
 use of traditional fuel 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.120
 In addition, this technology helps 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.120
 save the environment
