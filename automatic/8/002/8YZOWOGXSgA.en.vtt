00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.480
 samsung samsung galaxy 5 track 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.050
 Here is such a little black appliance today 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 let's see and generally would like to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.500
 tell the browser about the leg he gives us 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.500
 the standard form in android dzhellibin 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.649
 This launcher is very large and wide 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.129
 the functionality further is great 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.560
 number of settings are completely different you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.510

 this phone you can customize 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.570
 by itself also fast speed given 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.580
 the launcher doesn't like it very much and also 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.000
 this advantage is something through 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.680

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.540

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.770
 cons and I for myself so far there is not 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:42.150
