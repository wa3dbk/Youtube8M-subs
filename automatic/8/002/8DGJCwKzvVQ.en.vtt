00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.990
 how to make a paper plane interceptor 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:13.130
 origami hello friends with you vitali 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.130

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:44.420
 bend the sheet now in half again 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.420
 We'll do the interceptor today 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:55.199
 intercept must be miniature and 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:01:09.270
 fast paper planes they are very 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:17.060
 useful for development for development with two 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:21.860
 the parties are now once again bending here 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.860
 That is, there is half still half 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:39.950
 and once again by the way this part will later have 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:45.390
 us come off on new personally 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:59.819

00:01:45.390 --> 00:02:08.450
 we pork out to here in this fold line 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:08.450
 we will bend this edge that is like this 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.590
 the same 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.790

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.300
 Zaginay center too 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:20.640

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:34.070
 multilayer plastic we have billet 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:34.070
 now the middle we once again bend on them 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:48.419
 intercept this but the initial procurement 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.120
 now he is ready for this land 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:58.500
 we don't need 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:59.840

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.419
 little fingers 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.250
 so this part is superfluous and we can cut it off 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.780
 is there any 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.229
 here we use beautiful 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.229
 pins 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:45.250
 now this middle we leave not 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:45.250
 we touch and here these edges we begin 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:13.120
 It turned out such a billet now 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:16.290
 here is this edge parallel to the guy 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.290
 the line we had here 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:59.900
