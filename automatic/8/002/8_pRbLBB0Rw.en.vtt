very<00:03:27.950> good<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:30.019> happen<00:03:30.170> I've<00:03:31.069> put<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.340> lot<00:03:31.489> of

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
very good to happen I've put a lot of

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.670 
very good to happen I've put a lot of
time<00:03:31.849> in<00:03:32.030> this<00:03:34.090> but<00:03:35.090> on<00:03:35.180> top<00:03:35.420> of<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:36.049> I

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
time in this but on top of this I I

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.069 
time in this but on top of this I I
think<00:03:37.220> there's<00:03:37.430> some<00:03:38.060> way<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.299> do<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.659> but<00:03:38.870> I

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
think there's some way to do it but I

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.860 
think there's some way to do it but I
think<00:03:39.639> someone<00:03:40.639> did<00:03:40.760> this<00:03:40.879> on<00:03:41.030> xbox<00:03:41.540> when<00:03:41.750> the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
think someone did this on xbox when the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.220 
think someone did this on xbox when the
patch<00:03:42.079> came<00:03:42.439> out<00:03:42.590> for<00:03:42.829> Xbox<00:03:43.750> apparently<00:03:44.750> you

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
patch came out for Xbox apparently you

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.869 
patch came out for Xbox apparently you
can<00:03:45.439> go<00:03:45.620> on<00:03:45.859> um<00:03:46.189> I<00:03:47.120> think<00:03:48.049> it's<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:49.519> career

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
can go on um I think it's the career

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.360 
can go on um I think it's the career
mode<00:03:50.060> whatever<00:03:50.709> becoming<00:03:51.709> a<00:03:51.799> legend<00:03:52.220> or
