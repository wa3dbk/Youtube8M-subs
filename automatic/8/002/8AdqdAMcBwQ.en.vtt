00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:11.750
 we come back you are seeing in the heart of 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.750
 the beast 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.660

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.130
 know here our social should both 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.480
 for having returned the team the first 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.400
 division after ten years with 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.400
 we the professor gustavo matosas 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.630
 first I'm going to take out the sack 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.130
 I do not feel very comfortable 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.440
 I feel like I'm on the court directing 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.890
 the idea out there 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.840
 it is a job that has many ups and downs 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 like this moment 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.060
 but you have to keep going there is no other 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.150
 way 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.980
 the leader has to when the storm 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.570
 is stronger and the thunder is 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:57.410
 falling hard you have to keep the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.960
 I work doing your job and the smile 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.400
 from ear to ear there is no other way in 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.050
 the book by paulo coelho the alchemist 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.050
 It was a book that changed my life 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.210
 in the part where he mentions that when 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.880
 you want and with all my heart and 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.350
 work to get it the world 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.680
 conspires so you get it 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.890
 from there everything that falls in my 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.049
 I try to read it until I see that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.490
 I'm not interested anymore also deepened in 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.750
 the topic 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.790
 confucius in one in one of his sentences 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.380
 celebrities 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.720
 He said that he who believes that he can 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.450
 the one who believes that he can not surely 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.080
 I was right then I understood 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.220
 that everything goes in what you believe 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.890
 I still think you can and do not think 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.930
 you can surely be true that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.460
 it was something that marked me in my life always 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.560
 I thought that 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.200
 I have no intelligence as most 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.640
 the people 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.640
 what I have is a lot of perseverance 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.729
 I think there are people who have 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.600
 a lot of natural innate talent with which 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.069
 you were born 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.660
 but I also think that they are the ones 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.330
 they fail faster at the time of 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.819
 difficulties 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.640
 so I always believe that 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.740
 the talent that is not worked has 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.740
 Date of Expiry 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.000
 constancy is one of the values ​​that 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.700
 more appreciation in people 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.590
 is what undoubtedly induced the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.260
 team to have evidence about your life 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.230
 about professionalism about 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.290
 plays and the repetitions we do 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.990
 I believe that perseverance is a good 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.340
 invaluable be prepared because you do not know in 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.460
 what time are you going to prioritize the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.290
 preparation 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.240
 especially and we are in a world so 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.460
 competitive 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.600
 that the more things you accumulate from 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.820
 Better knowledge is going to go 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.220
 I think that is an important message 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.890
 especially for the youngest and for 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.340
 those of us who are not so young because the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.150
 life is a constant learning 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.460
 then I saw a movie of a will smith 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.370
 where he had a talk with the son 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.870
 they were practicing basketball for a 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.190
 agreement about the movie I'm very bad 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.460
 to retain names and it does not give me 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.930
 embarrassed to say it meza in search of the 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.890
 beautiful life experience is also 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.840
 very nice but it 's backwards looking for 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.250
 happiness then if he in a 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.640
 moment the son when the son 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.990
 start throwing the basketball hoop and 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.140
 the son tells him that he will be the best 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.550
 of the world and he says nothing not me 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.410
 I also thought the same thing but not 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.940
 obviously it's going to be more or less like 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.230
 It was me 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.180
 then the son who does not see the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.850
 movie son Dad not being me 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.480
 I collapsed all the dreams less badly than 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.480
 They are my dad and my mom 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.380
 then at that moment will smith is given 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.900
 account says for what I just did 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.430
 I just put a limit on my own 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.700
 blood to my son to what taste the most 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.700
 world 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.100
 then he realizes and tells him never 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.320
 let no one or I tell you what 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.210
 you can and what you can not do when 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.160
 have a dream walk behind him and point 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.440
 I think if I had to send a message 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.090
 what has been my life is zero 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.389
 I was a player who did not have big 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.239
 terms 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.090
 I had to work a lot, I'm a product of 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.009
 effort as a coach I feel that everything 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.449
 it cost me twice and I am a product 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.670
 of the effort of studying the 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:33.700
 preparation of the organization 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.120
 I do not know another way 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.350
 I know how to lead a team to help my 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.540
 people do good I will be good 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.300
 because ultimately everything returns is a 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.600
 circle that returns 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.230
 and I think the leaders 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.610
 the main objective they have is 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.860
 organize your people to your strength of 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.629
 work 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.969
 make them coexist in a way 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.220
 respectful and push them towards the 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.139
 objective 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.780
 and do good 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.699
 If you ask me which is the most important 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.419
 do good because everything else is 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:11.689
 passenger because nobody said to do 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.180
 the good your life has to be worse at 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:15.310
 contrary 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.920
 as a leader the main objective what is 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.020
 do good 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.060
 things that help strengthen that 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.940
 push that have to do with the 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.890
 heart then surely there will be another 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.410
 kind of leaders and I respect it 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.200
 I am this type of leader because it is what 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.900
 that they taught me in my house but it is that 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.320
 is ready because in the end the one 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.180
 Expires 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.420
 is the one who is always prepared to 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.420
 to struggle 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.020
