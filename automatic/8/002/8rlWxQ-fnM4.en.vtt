00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
I've been having is that the shaft I

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.470 
I've been having is that the shaft I
think<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.310> need<00:03:22.490> the<00:03:22.610> truck<00:03:22.880> shaft

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
think I need the truck shaft

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.050 
think I need the truck shaft
they're<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.200> little<00:03:24.380> bit<00:03:24.620> thicker<00:03:24.890> but<00:03:25.220> these

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
they're a little bit thicker but these

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.680 
they're a little bit thicker but these
ones<00:03:26.270> are<00:03:26.540> bending<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.790> they<00:03:28.790> also<00:03:29.030> breaking

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
ones are bending and they also breaking

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.790 
ones are bending and they also breaking
I<00:03:29.930> guess<00:03:30.590> it's<00:03:30.950> because<00:03:31.330> it's<00:03:32.330> making<00:03:32.800> this

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
I guess it's because it's making this

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.450 
I guess it's because it's making this
has<00:03:34.010> more<00:03:34.280> than<00:03:34.610> chef<00:03:34.910> has<00:03:35.150> more<00:03:35.990> pressure<00:03:36.460> to

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
has more than chef has more pressure to

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.820 
has more than chef has more pressure to
push<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.820> tire
