00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:15.910
 Enjoy the previous week to see 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.280
 if we can win a great job and I think 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.920
 which is just the result of the three 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.920
 points I think we made a great game 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.900
 suppose this trick for the team is very 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.910
 important we knew we could 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.710
 get two wins in a row, not what 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.670
 we had achieved and can win in 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.910
 home 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.390
 give the fans the victory and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.340
 love there is more confidence and party than 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.739
 finally he decided on errors of his 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:51.640
 fellow in the other curious goal what 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.800
 that we could do something like something else 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.320
 of damage if we had finished a bit 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.730
 better and came close and good form 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.730
 you chore and satisfied 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.600
 Oh God 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.760
 we are prudent and we are nothing euphoric 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.290
 for having these two victories we know 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.479
 it's going to be long and hard until the end 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.040
 and we are aware of that and well I think 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.220
 that we never lost our heads when 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 we had worse good moments we gave faith 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.160
 in the work that we have been doing and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.840
 showing much more tranquility 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.510
 it's not a difficult game but good as 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.220
 creating quite quiet two good 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.810
 then two wins in a row said 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.780
 we continue to happy I think a match 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.280
 to get everything and that we get what 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.350
 less possible things we have to a 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.420
 great team and that we are going to have 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.590
 difficult but good what we are going to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.900
 try to do as little as possible and 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.640
 enjoy the game 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.909
 3 points went very well in the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.909
 locker room 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.930
 I have the dreaded team is 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.930
 focused on these objectives 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.790
 to control 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.370
 the tranquility 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:48.000
 mainly this dress for viewing 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:51.420
 and this communication the change in some 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.050
 moments a little desperate the head 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.050
 down 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.040
 without water, the truth is that it is the first time 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.630
 that this season we achieved it and very 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.100
 happy that's why it was very important 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.100
 victory is important results 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.130
 we know a difficult opponent has made many 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.260
 points in the first round will be going 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.640
 to be complicated like we have not 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.000
 worked throughout the week and has 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.680
 it went well 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.680
 tranquility after all of seeing 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.790
 outside of that it is important for us 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.960
 emotionally and we are very happy for 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.490
 that and you have to keep working too 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.290
 complicated part between lamadrid 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.670
 We will try to do our best and 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.670
 after the derby 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.890
 let's fight we're not going to give away any 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.010
 point to no complicated match team 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.630
 but what attraction for you also in the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.510
 Spanish league I never think that I have not 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.820
 ever played not the truth that is 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.500
 important is a great stadium and good is 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.270
 a showcase but as I say you have to 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.150
 try to do your best and be able to 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.500
 be able to score also 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.509
 personally you can not ask for more 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.710
 people we are going to be calm that 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.509
 the most important ones do not go back to 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.580
 injure yourself after after the 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.550
 three lessons is the most important thing of 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.500
 true the goal per game in the psoe what 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.570
 that sincerely the important one is the 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.940
 sporting has scored winning that is 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.740
 important and then you'll see it against leyva 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.970
 that I also is important in that 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.759
 meaning since talking about the injury 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.400
 our fully recovered continue to be 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.410
 right now I'm fine or not 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.260
 I have pain and little by little 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.720
 fitness that you notice to get to 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.300
 be one hundred percent and be able to be 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.240
 for the coach as best as possible 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.130
 arrival of reinforcements of turn hernÃ¡n ha 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.650
 also changed the economy a bit in 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.090
 the team structure itself 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.729
 players to add up I think that the 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.289
 workouts are being more more 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.910
 intense in that sense because there are more 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.919
 competition to peers are at 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.060
 one hundred percent and you have to be happy 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.060
 because the reinforcements have been good 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.430
 no I do not think it was the card 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.170
 roja commented it with danny anise 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.420
 I put my hands to my face, I do not think 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.880
 has been a struggle the referee has 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.729
 believed that it was maria for both 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.689
 parts and leave it like that 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.689
 something else comes out
