the problem it has is that you would

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.980 
the problem it has is that you would
automatically<00:00:28.110> start<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:29.090> it<00:00:30.090> would<00:00:30.300> give

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
automatically start and it would give

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.290 
automatically start and it would give

you a warning that the battery is low
and<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:33.960> shut<00:00:34.230> down<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:35.000> it<00:00:36.000> would<00:00:36.090> just

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
and it would shut down and it would just

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.689

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
battery because as I just mentioned once

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.480 
battery because as I just mentioned once
you<00:01:06.780> put<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> battery<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.220> just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
you put a battery in it it would just

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.810 
you put a battery in it it would just
start<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:09.119> away<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:10.640> let<00:01:11.640> me

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
start up right away and let me

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.530 
start up right away and let me
demonstrate<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.939> now<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
relatively new you know you can see it

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.630 
relatively new you know you can see it
right<00:01:24.869> there

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.690 

and<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:31.970> prove<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:32.420> let<00:01:32.690> me<00:01:33.280> get<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.340> tester<00:01:36.700> and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
and to prove it let me get a tester and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:51.480 
and to prove it let me get a tester and
see<00:01:38.510> if<00:01:39.110> it<00:01:39.350> does<00:01:39.590> have<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.890> power

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.249 

as<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.270> can<00:01:52.390> see<00:01:52.600> in<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:52.750> tester<00:01:53.140> it's

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
as you can see in the tester it's

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.840 
as you can see in the tester it's
reading<00:01:53.710> is<00:01:53.829> 3.88<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.770> actual<00:01:57.159> voltage<00:01:57.399> of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
reading is 3.88 the actual voltage of

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.359 
reading is 3.88 the actual voltage of
this<00:01:58.030> battery<00:01:58.509> is<00:01:58.869> actually<00:01:59.790> 3.7<00:02:00.790> volts<00:02:02.340> okay

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
this battery is actually 3.7 volts okay

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.940 
this battery is actually 3.7 volts okay
now<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.340> phone<00:02:06.640> doesn't<00:02:07.149> have<00:02:07.390> any<00:02:07.689> sim<00:02:08.649> card

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
now the phone doesn't have any sim card

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.479 
now the phone doesn't have any sim card
in<00:02:09.039> it<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:10.230> I<00:02:11.230> already<00:02:11.470> tried<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.860> with<00:02:12.250> or

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
in it and I already tried it with or

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.460 
in it and I already tried it with or
without<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.090> SIM<00:02:13.360> card<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.870> still<00:02:14.140> does<00:02:14.440> the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
without the SIM card it still does the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.320 
without the SIM card it still does the
same<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:16.450> helped<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.400> mini<00:02:18.400> SD<00:02:18.670> memory

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330
