00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
some would you get some my sub box and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.020 
some would you get some my sub box and
my<00:01:25.259> wires<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.990> popped<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> trunk<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.560> well

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030

my wires I popped the trunk here as well
I'm<00:01:30.229> getting<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.670> bigger<00:01:32.670> alternator<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
I'm getting a bigger alternator and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.039 
I'm getting a bigger alternator and
battery<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:37.670> upside<00:01:38.670> guys

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.279 

I<00:01:43.109> did<00:01:44.109> the<00:01:44.289> big<00:01:44.950> free<00:01:45.189> upgrade<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.990> zero

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
I did the big free upgrade with zero

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.760 
I did the big free upgrade with zero
gauge<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.340> my

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
gauge this is my

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.310 
gauge this is my
positive<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.640> battery

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.550 

little<00:02:01.950> bit<00:02:02.039> crooked

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.719 

it's<00:02:08.560> definitely<00:02:08.739> drawing<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.250> lot<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.459> power

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
it's definitely drawing a lot of power

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.930 
it's definitely drawing a lot of power
on<00:02:10.599> my<00:02:10.840> subs<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.340> definitely<00:02:12.730> need<00:02:12.910> some

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
on my subs so I definitely need some

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.720 
on my subs so I definitely need some
electrical<00:02:13.720> upgrades<00:02:14.220> these<00:02:15.220> will<00:02:15.370> hit<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.519> lot

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
electrical upgrades these will hit a lot

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.400 
electrical upgrades these will hit a lot
harder<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.209> feel<00:02:17.430> send<00:02:18.430> out<00:02:18.519> an<00:02:18.580> audio<00:02:22.410> to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
harder I feel send out an audio to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.300 
harder I feel send out an audio to
twelves<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.129> got<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.519> audio<00:02:24.819> pipe<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.920> about

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.420 

two<00:02:30.310> thousand<00:02:30.849> RMS<00:02:31.299> at<00:02:31.690> 1<00:02:32.230> ohm<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.709> got<00:02:33.069> my<00:02:33.160> 0

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
two thousand RMS at 1 ohm I got my 0

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.789 
two thousand RMS at 1 ohm I got my 0
gauge<00:02:34.260> my<00:02:35.260> wires<00:02:35.500> hooked<00:02:35.680> up<00:02:35.950> some<00:02:37.799> scorch

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
gauge my wires hooked up some scorch

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.589 
gauge my wires hooked up some scorch
RCA's<00:02:41.069> they<00:02:42.069> had<00:02:42.430> pretty<00:02:42.670> hard<00:02:42.940> me<00:02:43.209> not<00:02:43.420> gonna
