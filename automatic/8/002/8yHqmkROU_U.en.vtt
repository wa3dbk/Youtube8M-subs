00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.860
 hello people and hedge gets to one 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.039
 new feature in this tutorial yourself 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.220
 show how to work your run 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.220
 and this without having to buy a card 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:26.480
 that's very good laptops when the kids 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:30.159
 no ram have so extra to install 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.200
 because it's standard ps3 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.430
 it was actually quite hard to 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.980
 it just never has to be understood 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.390
 or just know and then it is 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.600
 actually the easiest thing there is 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:51.020
 and here I gave the balls 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:52.570
 this just unpacks it I got you 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.830
 spread your text 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.960
 that's the one on this left here 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.290
 You can then download these are these 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.300
 we at 10 mb they are out as always 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.310
 let or just lead that is also 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.510
 Now it's time to computer 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.510
 right click and manage 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.550
 Open without seeing this rambus is 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.800
 it raises quite slowly 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.090
 Data storage of data management 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.710
 in brackets locally that a few so much 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.930
 play and then they are yours 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:32.090
 hard drives then make your right click 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.790
 best on the hard drive where 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.580
 you have your private things on it 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.290
 best of all that weapons away all over 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 Games will be that we play and 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.159
 programs become so you have to them 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.170
 confess that now comes where you get that 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.909
 the pictures and stuff like guns 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.760
 war and how to reduce it now 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.760
 then a little pop up opens up here 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.619
 window where it is nice and here then 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.799
 directly the size of my hard drive 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.510
 in andy displayed here we open now 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.070
 open at this point like mine now 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.299
 table moment for me in many sizes 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.319
 and even go into this fame 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:25.480
 bags pull that down and 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:27.790
 then this wave is it is 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.160
 just how much you want to have 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.010
 I take the text work because I have 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.450
 two gigabytes built into my pc and 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:42.340
 That's the beautiful Christmas that is 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:47.650
 actually the minimum amount comes 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.560
 you have to have a reasonable one 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.980
 to have a framework 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:59.079
 then we give in at 6,144 and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.790
 crazy is there in the front still in the 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.390
 hundreds of meters to it 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.319
 62 if you need alone 100 escape 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.920
 lock free with it when released 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:16.350
 We are not overloaded so scaled down 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.600
 we have changed that 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.079
 now always six out of ten gigabit me 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.769
 Assigned there we make the right click 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:28.840
 click on new simple flower and click 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.700
 now the self-explanatory always on 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:37.510
 next game gave no attention on it 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.579
 then loads the they gave you then your 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.139
 own new hard disk created here 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.579
 also in the system under computer here 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.170
 have shown then you make again 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:57.220
 right used around the people that 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:04:00.030
 now softer memory but now 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.260
 she has new disks in 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.290
 quotes but no run to it 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.349
 I explain now so puts us in again 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.900
 the start button violently on computer and 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.359
 properties extended 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.639
 system settings and click 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.220
 Settings being visual effects 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.260
 processes and usage 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.110
 virtual memory virtual memory 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.710
 is the most interesting lead 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.219
 here come effects make up weeks 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.340
 Expanded me is the right one now 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:35.110
 here is what we are for a frame 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.680
 So how much have we built in? 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.879
 to have 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.909
 we now offer to change every two 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:45.520
 system managed at c 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:47.560
 so I painted began melo 7 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.729
 no foreigners and with and at 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.580
 work record by better this 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:05:01.779
 size again the same size and 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:05.259
 Whatever table she sees 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:06.310
 why I took more that is 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.629
 now only because of that 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.090
 I think there is a bit more freedom 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.039
 we need that now click on it 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:17.319
 establish 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:20.020
 okay okay now we have to gram 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:23.560
 Well, I should be fine now 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.960
 have forgiven quite fast 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.979
 Just now as you can see he is up 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.270
 the hard place of the whole files 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.159
 it really is not 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.629
 ran 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:37.229
 if you want to have that 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:42.669
 the following is the normal start button 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:44.949
 on the right computer then again on 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.789
 properties extended the 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:52.539
 system settings then also expanded 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:55.599
 Change settings extended 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.669
 So exactly the lab and no cars 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.939
 file and set which sometimes 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.219
 after this action wanted me 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:08.310
 start where we get the beginning of 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:10.839
 now one more time properties 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.969
 sorry start button computer 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:14.169
 manage 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:24.610
 I may already be on site but 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:27.509
 I see that's why RAM is 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.490
 very important that you do not look at any 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:33.459
 david have taken on this program the 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.190
 Otherwise I got virtual memory 

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:38.550
 could you complications 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:44.480
 give castration at all and then it 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:56.570
 not nice because we right click 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:56.570
 then down to square four now 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:10.470
 achso apology here gets their 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:29.630
 sincerely around working memory people 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:32.960
 music is supposed to be that is missing but 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.960
 never come 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:44.140
 I think about it extra sleep in the 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.710
 as it is now not washed 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.380
 no matter 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:51.600
 I hope that are still like 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:57.210
 except when I did that 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.210
 hope still much fun
