 How to make cheese puffs 

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:12.317
 Stir the flour, sugar and salt in the salad bowl. 

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.410
 140 grams of flour 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.503
 1 teaspoon of sugar 

00:00:18.553 --> 00:00:20.843
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:26.990
 Heat with a large fire until the milk, water and butter boil in the pan. 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.890
 110 grams of butter 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.087
 125 ml milk 

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:35.603
 125 ml butter 

00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:42.295
 Immediately after boiling, pour the mixture into the salad bowl and mix quickly with a spatula or a wooden spoon. 

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:44.020
 Continue to stir under medium heat to allow the water to evaporate. This step is very important. 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.928
 Then turn off the fire and add the eggs one by one. 

00:00:48.977 --> 00:00:49.997
 5 eggs 

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:56.146
 You can use a blender to complete this step, as this step is time consuming and labor intensive. 

00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.931
 It is important to ensure that the previous egg is thoroughly mixed before adding each egg. 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.647
 Now you get a soft puff batter. 

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:23.156
 Add one teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of pepper. 

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:24.948
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:26.748
 1 teaspoon pepper 

00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:29.442
 And 180 grams of cheese 

00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:32.061
 180 grams of cheese 

00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:40.264
 Because these puffs are larger than normal puffs, they need to be grilled for a while. 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.408
 The batter is placed in a piping bag and the dough is extruded into a small dough of the same size. It is worth noting that the baking plate needs to be covered with a layer of oil paper. 

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:52.468
 When there is no flower bag, you can use two spoons. 

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:56.895
 The oven is baked at 170 degrees for 15-20 minutes. The length of the baking depends on the size of the dough. Here, we bake for 20 minutes. 

00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:02.379
 The oven must not be opened during the baking process or the dough will collapse. 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.667
 Then you can turn off the oven. The last thing to note is to leave the puffs in the oven and cool to room temperature.
