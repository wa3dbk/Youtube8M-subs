00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.920
 what are we going to do 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.269
 is going to be preparing the cake and here 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.919
 we have the ingredients 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:22.759
 let's use 7 eggs 175 grams of 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:28.040
 chocolate with desserts 250 grams of 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:31.160
 sugar 150 grams of flour and 150 grams 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.230
 of butter these are the 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.680
 ingredients that we will need to 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.100
 make the cake for our cake 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.100
 sacher 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.629
 to make our cake in first 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.660
 instead we have separated the yolks from 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.510
 clear of the 7 eggs and here in this 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.129
 bolo have put half the sugar 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.250
 which now we are going to add the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.250
 Butter 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.410
 there we have the butter 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.200
 now we are going to beat it and when 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.640
 let's have smoothie 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.640
 we will add the times 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.320
 now we have well beaten and now 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.320
 we add the yolks 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.390
 and we do the same operation we go back to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.930
 beat until we have it right 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.930
 integrated 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.520
 and now we go with the next step is 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.120
 add the chocolate that we already have 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.120
 molten 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.859
 and we throw all the chocolate 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.859
 and once we have it we will beat again 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.109
 now let's throw the flour as 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.890
 You see we are going to walk that always 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:56.860
 it comes in handy for cupcakes and 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.140
 When we have it sifted we will return to 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.190
 beat until we get everything right 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.840
 integrated 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.990
 as soon as we have a well-integrated game 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.379
 we will reserve while we assemble 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.379
 clear 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.370
 well, there we have the mixture already 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.500
 list and now let's move on to assemble the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.170
 clear here we have the whites and the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.240
 sugar let's start to beat and the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.900
 Sugar is important to add at the end 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:31.630
 we will add in two or three times when 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.630
 almost have them mounted we go there 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.160
 Well, as you can see, we already have 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.850
 clear well mounted now let's go 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.640
 adding little by little the other mixture that 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.950
 we had with chocolate and let's go 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.900
 mixing but this time with the 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.410
 spatula or we will not use the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.170
 mixer 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.320
 we're going to mix it up 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.050
 integrating little we will throw two tablespoons 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.420
 we will mix 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.850
 go integrating 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.440
 until we have everything well integrated 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.900
 and the moment we have it right 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.900
 integrated we will put it in the bush 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.740
 Well, we have everything right there 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.510
 mixed now we throw it to the mold that 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.210
 as you see we have it smeared with 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.300
 butter and a little flour and we 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.710
 we go to the oven to 180 degrees 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.710
 about 50 minutes 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.950
 here we have our cake already what 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.650
 we have from the oven let's let 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.890
 cool well and here we have the rest 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.180
 of ingredients on the one hand we have 150 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.540
 grams of peach jam and 3 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.180
 rum spoons that will be to go for 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.630
 put the filling and on the other side 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.350
 we have what is going to be the coverage that 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.760
 we're going to do it with 175 grams of 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.760
 chocolate for desserts and 175 grams of 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.460
 cream first of all let's put a 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.120
 heat the cream and when hot 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.850
 we will add the chocolate we will improve 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.610
 until we are founded 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.560
 and with this we will have ready our 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.290
 coverage let's wait for it 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.760
 cool 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.760
 to be able to make the filling 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.580
 Well, we have already opened in half 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.400
 of the cake as you can see there we have the 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.949
 upper part 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.740
 and the half that we have cut we have already 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.830
 added the jam in which we have 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.630
 dissolved the rum now let's put 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.480
 at the top we are going to cover the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.160
 jam and as soon as we are founded 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.390
 chocolate 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.390
 we will do the coverage 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.300
 Well, we have already covered the cake and 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.640
 As you can see, we cut the part a bit 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.860
 from the top because there is one 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.420
 small scab with the knife with 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.280
 we took care of it 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.680
 we tried to make it more flat and 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.040
 now we are going to pour the chocolate 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.040
 over 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.259
 sensor chocolate and let's go 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.500
 distributing it to cover all the 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.500
 cake 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.460
 Well, here we have our cake 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.000
 we have thrown all the chocolate all 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.830
 around 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.830
 we have distributed it in the center 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.410
 up we tried to leave as smooth 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.889
 possible and now we can only leave that 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.169
 harden 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.560
 to be able to manipulate it and to be able to 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.560
 cut 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.830
 Well, here we have our cake 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.340
 have already spent a few hours the chocolate 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.199
 it is hard 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.590
 and now we are going to remove it from the grid 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:19.669
 and we are going to contribute a portion to see what 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.669
 it looks inside 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.480
 and here we have our sacher cake as 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.180
 you see we have cut a portion 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.830
 so that the cut is seen so that 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.790
 appreciate 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.150
 and what do you say that has a pint 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:45.420
 great to look at 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:48.330
 look at how the layer looks in the center 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.650
 with jam that with the touch of 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.260
 rum that carries the coverage 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.180
 all around 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:01.889
 what do you say we want a portion 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.889
 with pleasure it's the real voice 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.800
 and nothing else, I hope that I have 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.780
 liked this recipe you see what it is 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.870
 very easy to do seems a bit 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.430
 complicated I discovered it with chocolate 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.130
 we have tried to extend the next what 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.620
 better than we can but good we are not 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:22.580
 professionals still I think that has 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.580
 it looked pretty good 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.620
 and nothing then wish you liked it 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.129
 really and that you do it and I leave so 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:33.800
 rich as it is 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:33.800
 and until the next video goodbye
