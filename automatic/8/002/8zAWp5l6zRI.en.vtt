00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 the first story of our project at 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.770
 the north caucasus called the floor manual 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.450
 the reaction in the marina risk I will remind in this 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.400
 project we talk about how 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.410
 migration to the northern Taimyr 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.630
 Caucasus and the Caucasus becomes 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.190
 unmanageable at almost the same time 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.800
 federal authorities have developed 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.480
 the bill made other steps that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.510
 make responsible for inter-ethnic 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.939
 the relationship of local authorities that is chapters 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.039
 cities and districts no wonder that on 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.410
 Roman officials embraced our project 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.340
 like a massive attack though it is in it 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.649
 completely about the other 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.309
 Today the final series of the project is extremely 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.309
 North Caucasus 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.829
 It looks like an international terminal in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.300
 Emelyanovo airport during the night 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.829
 flights from the country of the CIS 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.079
 several times a week planes 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.640
 Krasnoyarsk deliver hundreds of migrants from 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.440
 Central Asia on trains and buses 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.710
 Thousands more come from January to 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.739
 September 2012 on migration registration 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.630
 the service of the region delivered more than 113 thousand 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.890
 foreigners for the same period of the current 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.540
 143900 years 14 people most 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.080
 number of citizens arrived from 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.759
 Tajikistan Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.799
 according to official data Russia came out on 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.090
 second in the world in the number of migrants 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.400
 now in the country 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.560
 11 million as a rule, visitors 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.810
 settle on the outskirts of Krasnoyarsk in 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 the market area is beautiful on the street 26 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.689
 Baku Commissars 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.689
 or as in Moscow in Biryulyovo 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.190
 according to sociologists, whole industries 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.110
 Russian economy depends on 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.780
 people's daily lives turned out to be 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.940
 scientists are dependent on foreign communities 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.920
 demographers claim interethnic 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.140
 skirmishes occur when the number of visitors 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.990
 reaches 10 percent of local 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.330
 population and where the area has no power or 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.330
 desires to infiltrate the migrant colonies 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:13.330
 state thousand rubles lets go yet 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.490
 Demonstrative arrest of a belyavsky villain 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.770
 and small officials closed rates 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.080
 vegetable bases are perceived by many not 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.780
 more than a performance called to create 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.820
 visibility as if the people heard the situation 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.670
 under control but it is a time bomb 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.000
 actions they are problem solving by authority 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.470
 will not solve because this problem 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.740
 i like pay got power itself 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.810
 migrants are fed by the power structure and she 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.780
 not interested in being deprived 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.610
 yourself so feeding and sooner or later 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.709
 we will see how dissatisfaction with migrants 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.080
 will turn into discontent with power which 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.510
 says but do not decide at the same time 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.850
 it turns out that all these problems are not at all 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.989
 belong to the people of the North Caucasus but 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.940
 most conflicts 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.220
 residents of central Russia occur 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.480
 with them they are with enough peaceful 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.480
 Tajiks and Kyrgyz 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.640
 2006 Karelia Kondopoga group 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.860
 Caucasians kill two local 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.400
 residents all ends in massive anti 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.470
 Caucasian speeches and pogroms 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.980
 2013 the city of Pugachev Saratov 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.769
 areas 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.750
 16-year-old Chechen kills a local guy 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.730
 as a result of mass performances and 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.580
 requirements to evict all visitors 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.769
 Finally, the most resonant history of Moscow 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.810
 Manezh Square 2010 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.299
 there is no guarantee that this is not 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.040
 will repeat in any other region of Russia 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.260
 and so do what we have on 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.390
 nothing special happens in the north 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.170
 at least short-sighted crisis 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.360
 condopogs 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:53.530
 the authorities of Karelia at first also represented 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:57.569
 like a domestic stabbing CTC right
