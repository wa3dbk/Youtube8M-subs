00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
okay the these are called loose cages

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.380 
okay the these are called loose cages
now<00:00:04.620> they're<00:00:05.190> called<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.580> loose<00:00:06.029> speaker

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
now they're called the loose speaker

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.620 
now they're called the loose speaker

January's<00:00:15.590> prices<00:00:16.590> they're<00:00:17.340> not<00:00:17.520> cheap<00:00:17.820> but

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
January's prices they're not cheap but

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.910 
January's prices they're not cheap but
you're<00:00:18.449> talking<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.869> calibrated<00:00:19.470> instrument

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
you're talking a calibrated instrument

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.310 
you're talking a calibrated instrument
here<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.580> you've<00:00:21.180> sort<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.539> got<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.689> weigh<00:00:22.170> up

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
here so you've sort of got to weigh up

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.779 
here so you've sort of got to weigh up
the<00:00:22.410> cost<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.830> whether<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> share<00:00:23.699> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the cost of whether like you share it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.279 
the cost of whether like you share it
with<00:00:23.910> some<00:00:24.060> friends<00:00:24.300> maybe<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> club<00:00:25.080> if

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
with some friends maybe at the club if

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.920 
with some friends maybe at the club if
you<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.740> can't<00:00:25.949> justify<00:00:26.250> spending<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.240> you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
you you can't justify spending the you

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.710 
you you can't justify spending the you
know<00:00:28.019> $200<00:00:28.800> 140<00:00:29.460> old<00:00:29.580> dollars<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.119> buying

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
know $200 140 old dollars on buying

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.359 
know $200 140 old dollars on buying
these<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.529> actually<00:00:32.009> maybe<00:00:32.160> get

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
these that you can actually maybe get

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.010 
these that you can actually maybe get
there<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.730> couple<00:00:32.880> members<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> club<00:00:33.989> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
there a couple members of the club that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.510 
there a couple members of the club that
chip<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.380> 20<00:00:34.590> bucks<00:00:34.770> each<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.160> share<00:00:35.340> them

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
chip in 20 bucks each and share them

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.580 
chip in 20 bucks each and share them
it's<00:00:36.239> not<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.420> device<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.960> use<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.290> every<00:00:37.559> day

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
it's not a device you use in every day

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.010 
it's not a device you use in every day
of<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> week<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.480> certainly<00:00:39.809> something

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
of the week but it's certainly something

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.560 
of the week but it's certainly something
that<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.410> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.829> easy<00:00:41.190> access<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.820> now

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
I get older this spring aluminium

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.260 
I get older this spring aluminium
actually<00:00:53.219> begins<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> spring<00:00:53.820> apart<00:00:54.090> they

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
actually begins to spring apart they

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.459 
actually begins to spring apart they
start<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.660> lose<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> little<00:00:55.140> bit<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.320> their

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
start to lose a little bit of their

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
start to lose a little bit of their
calibration<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:58.020> PT<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.160> actually<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
calibration the PT one is actually a

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.970 
calibration the PT one is actually a
screen<00:00:59.910> gauge<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.960> pardoning<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.800> this

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
screen gauge the pardoning of this

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.060 
screen gauge the pardoning of this
spring<00:01:02.969> doesn't<00:01:03.510> tend<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> affect<00:01:04.070> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
spring doesn't tend to affect the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.440 
spring doesn't tend to affect the
measurement<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:06.030> give<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> lot<00:01:06.390> more

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
measurement and they give a lot more

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.640 
measurement and they give a lot more
consistent<00:01:07.080> measurement

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
consistent measurement

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.679

the<00:01:08.159> trouble<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> reason<00:01:09.420> why<00:01:09.659> I

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the trouble is and the reason why I

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.560 
the trouble is and the reason why I
still<00:01:10.080> maintain<00:01:10.260> two<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.939> scale<00:01:12.240> when<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
still maintain two is the scale when you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.020 
still maintain two is the scale when you
get<00:01:12.750> down<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> lower<00:01:13.409> end<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:14.549> much<00:01:14.850> more

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
get down to the lower end is much more

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
get down to the lower end is much more
accurate<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> lever<00:01:15.869> start<00:01:16.290> scale<00:01:17.009> than

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
accurate on the lever start scale than

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.660 
accurate on the lever start scale than
it<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.600> PT<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.290> these<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> scale

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it is on the PT one these have a scale

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
it is on the PT one these have a scale
right<00:01:21.150> down<00:01:21.360> low<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.720> Two<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> Half<00:01:21.990> Men

measurement<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.530> these<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.369> they're<00:01:26.490> very

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
measurement on these but they're very

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.480 
measurement on these but they're very
accurate<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:27.210> 10<00:01:27.420> these<00:01:28.409> start<00:01:28.770> at<00:01:28.920> eight<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
accurate at 10 these start at eight and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.630 
accurate at 10 these start at eight and
I<00:01:30.270> found<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> 80<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.770> marginally

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
I found that the 80 is marginally

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640 
I found that the 80 is marginally
accurate<00:01:33.090> once<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.689> start<00:01:33.960> getting<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.350> above

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
accurate once you start getting up above

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.850 
accurate once you start getting up above
the<00:01:34.920> 13s<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.420> incredibly<00:01:37.170> accurate<00:01:37.229> so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the 13s this is incredibly accurate so

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.469 
the 13s this is incredibly accurate so
you<00:01:37.890> sort<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.400> trade<00:01:38.579> off<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.729> very<00:01:39.030> low-end

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you sort of trade off that very low-end

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.980 
you sort of trade off that very low-end
now<00:01:40.520> whichever<00:01:41.520> gauge<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> use<00:01:42.150> maintain

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
now whichever gauge you use maintain

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.499 
now whichever gauge you use maintain
numbers<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.130> gauge<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.180> need<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
numbers for that gauge if you need to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.510 
numbers for that gauge if you need to
change<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.079> use<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> different<00:01:46.619> gauge<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
change and use a different gauge there a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.760 
change and use a different gauge there a
different<00:01:47.939> scale<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:49.049> you'll<00:01:49.320> need<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.740> have

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
different scale so you'll need to have

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.980 
different scale so you'll need to have
the<00:01:50.490> different<00:01:50.850> numbers<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:52.020> compare

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
the different numbers to compare

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.109 
the different numbers to compare
now<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.620> usage<00:01:54.040> of<00:01:54.159> these<00:01:54.370> gauges<00:01:54.640> it's

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
now the usage of these gauges it's

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.109 
now the usage of these gauges it's
similar<00:01:55.690> but<00:01:55.960> slightly<00:01:56.110> different<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.909> one

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
similar but slightly different this one

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.660 
similar but slightly different this one
has<00:01:58.360> got<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.960> groove<00:01:59.470> in<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.650> back<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.100> a

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
has got a groove in the back and a

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.340 
has got a groove in the back and a
string<00:02:01.210> now<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.510> string<00:02:01.810> isn't<00:02:02.050> just<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.229> hang

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
string now the string isn't just to hang

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.140 
string now the string isn't just to hang
it<00:02:02.470> up<00:02:02.530> on<00:02:02.619> your<00:02:02.740> wall<00:02:02.920> it's<00:02:03.159> actually<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.909> use

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
it up on your wall it's actually to use

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.350 
it up on your wall it's actually to use
pull<00:02:04.659> out<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.320> calibration<00:02:05.860> point<00:02:06.360> hook

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
pull out to the calibration point hook

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.999 
pull out to the calibration point hook
it<00:02:07.450> over<00:02:07.509> your<00:02:07.720> fourth<00:02:07.930> day<00:02:08.110> or<00:02:08.319> you<00:02:08.470> stay<00:02:08.740> and

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
it over your fourth day or you stay and

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.790 
it over your fourth day or you stay and
you<00:02:09.550> pull<00:02:09.819> until<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.929> lever<00:02:11.200> lines<00:02:11.470> up<00:02:11.680> on

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
you pull until the lever lines up on

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.830 
you pull until the lever lines up on
that<00:02:11.950> black<00:02:12.160> line<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:13.209> see<00:02:13.390> here<00:02:13.690> you've

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
that black line you can see here you've

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.449 
that black line you can see here you've
got<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.050> measurement<00:02:14.380> there<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.310> can

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
got a measurement there that you can

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.820 
got a measurement there that you can
read<00:02:15.610> off<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.170> would<00:02:17.410> call<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.650> a

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
read off so I would call that a

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.180 
read off so I would call that a
measurement<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.340> 25<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:20.590> can<00:02:20.620> have<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> look<00:02:21.069> at

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
measurement of 25 you can have a look at

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.740 
measurement of 25 you can have a look at
there<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.819> see<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.300> quilt

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
there and you can see that a quilt

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.790 
there and you can see that a quilt
equates<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.650> about<00:02:24.300> 120<00:02:25.300> kilo<00:02:26.019> R<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.470> think<00:02:26.709> it's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
equates to about 120 kilo R I think it's

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.420 
equates to about 120 kilo R I think it's
yeah<00:02:27.310> kilograms<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.970> tension<00:02:28.360> okay<00:02:29.260> which<00:02:29.620> for

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
yeah kilograms of tension okay which for

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.090 
yeah kilograms of tension okay which for
a<00:02:30.459> two<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.850> half<00:02:30.970> mil<00:02:31.209> wire<00:02:31.450> if<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.380> plenty

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
a two and a half mil wire if you plenty

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.780 
a two and a half mil wire if you plenty
of<00:02:33.400> safety<00:02:34.239> margin<00:02:34.630> further<00:02:35.170> breakage<00:02:35.790> now

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
of safety margin further breakage now

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.890 
of safety margin further breakage now
the<00:02:37.150> PT<00:02:37.450> one<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:38.830> slightly<00:02:39.040> different<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:40.660> act

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
the PT one is slightly different you act

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.570 
the PT one is slightly different you act
the<00:02:41.380> good<00:02:41.560> thing<00:02:41.680> about<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:41.950> one<00:02:42.160> is<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.370> can

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
the good thing about this one is you can

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.500 
the good thing about this one is you can
actually<00:02:42.760> hook<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.750> on<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:45.910> will<00:02:46.090> spring<00:02:46.360> out

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
actually hook it on or will spring out

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.930 
actually hook it on or will spring out
and<00:02:46.780> hook<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.470> on<00:02:47.530> like<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.820> can

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
and hook it on like that and you can

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.130 
and hook it on like that and you can
actually<00:02:48.970> leave<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.480> there<00:02:49.600> while<00:02:49.900> you're

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
actually leave it there while you're

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.670 
actually leave it there while you're
actually<00:02:50.260> adjusting<00:02:50.950> your<00:02:51.040> rig<00:02:52.019> okay<00:02:53.019> now<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
actually adjusting your rig okay now the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.559 
actually adjusting your rig okay now the
usage<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> PT<00:02:54.580> one's<00:02:54.790> slightly<00:02:55.180> different

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
usage of the PT one's slightly different

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.090 
usage of the PT one's slightly different
you<00:02:55.900> can<00:02:56.050> actually<00:02:56.170> leave<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.530> on<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.950> rig

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
you can actually leave it on the rig

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.039 
you can actually leave it on the rig
while<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.400> make<00:02:57.549> your<00:02:57.730> adjustments<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.420> it's

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
while you make your adjustments and it's

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.240 
while you make your adjustments and it's
important<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.440> make<00:02:59.590> sure<00:02:59.739> you<00:02:59.829> line<00:03:00.010> these<00:03:00.190> up

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
important to make sure you line these up

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.460 
important to make sure you line these up
the<00:03:00.459> correct<00:03:00.610> direction<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.870> simply<00:03:02.170> put<00:03:02.350> it

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
the correct direction you simply put it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.940 
the correct direction you simply put it
on<00:03:02.590> and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
on and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.490 
on and
book<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.819> top<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.330> read<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.080> number<00:03:07.170> off<00:03:07.380> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
book the top and read the number off the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.020 
book the top and read the number off the
scarf<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.310> good<00:03:08.490> thing<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.000> can

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
scarf the good thing is is you can

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.760 
scarf the good thing is is you can
actually<00:03:09.300> leave<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.660> hooked<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.230> while

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
actually leave that hooked on while

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.350 
actually leave that hooked on while
you're<00:03:10.980> making<00:03:11.069> adjustments<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.239> can

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
you're making adjustments and you can

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.110 
you're making adjustments and you can
see<00:03:12.540> here<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.230> number<00:03:13.380> 25<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.550> pretty<00:03:14.880> close

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
see here the number 25 is pretty close

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.870 
see here the number 25 is pretty close
as<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.900> scale<00:03:16.200> goes<00:03:16.440> down<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:17.459> will<00:03:17.610> change

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
as the scale goes down it will change

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.940 
as the scale goes down it will change
dramatically<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.780> lever<00:03:19.020> type<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.739> again

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
dramatically the lever type so again

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.440 
dramatically the lever type so again
make<00:03:20.160> sure<00:03:20.430> you're<00:03:20.730> using<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.420> correct

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
make sure you're using the correct

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.940 
make sure you're using the correct
numbers<00:03:22.050> for<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.319> type<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.650> gauge<00:03:22.770> that

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
numbers for the type of gauge that

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.220 
numbers for the type of gauge that
you're<00:03:23.069> using
