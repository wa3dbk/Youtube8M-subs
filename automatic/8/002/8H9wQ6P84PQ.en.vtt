00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.790
 or the one that there have been people in facebook 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:13.580
 people from all over the world what 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.580
 I bring you now nothing more than a simple 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.210
 hands exercise 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.170
 grab skill for this exercise I 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.650
 the only thing I'm going to ask 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.930
 have a metronome as it is this is a 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.130
 metronome 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:37.650
 the metronome is an instrument 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.650
 who is responsible for marking time 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.250
 can not be 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.230
 but on the other hand they can be lowered 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.230
 our world 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.980
 In Internet 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.489
 is happening 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.489
 so that they see it for 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.130
 good as I was commenting 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.300
 objective of this objective 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.310
 exercise 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.800
 is to increase our ability to 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.960
 ok hands then let's do it 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.630
 first slow so that they go understanding 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.670
 What is it about 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.560
 I'm going to set it to 79 bits per minute 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.210
 the exercise consists of 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.050
 in playing four notes by 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.280
 by time per stroke 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.280
 ok then we started 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.800
 so he can listen better 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.409
 the accordion may be sitting 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:43.900
 making inward out and 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:46.120
 I really care what matters 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.709
 it really is that we get skill with 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.709
 ok hands then 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:04.440
 we are going to be going down and going up and 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.300
 can they do this really like 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.620
 you want here in the case of 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:15.090
 grab a little more skill than 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:21.620
 numbers can do it this way is 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.620
 say going up and down then here 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.130
 sometimes I also do it this way 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.989
 and in the different columns 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.540
 and they can do it as you want 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.540
 from bottom to top 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.599
 or from top to bottom like I already did 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.750
 I currently do it at a speed 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.500
 of 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.500
 I feel 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:29.180
 125 already went up doing 30 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:32.860
 bpm but with the double eighth note rhythm 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.360
 eighth note time is not black 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.360
 that marks double the time 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.880
 Y 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.330
 and this is the exercise 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.539
 good people I hope you liked it 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.539
 the video that is of benefit to you this 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.910
 exercise if they do not understand something like they 're going 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.980
 to be here 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.720
 well down here the space of the 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.780
