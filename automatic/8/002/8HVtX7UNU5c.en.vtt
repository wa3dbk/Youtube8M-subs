00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
pretty damn amazing now having said all

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.790 
pretty damn amazing now having said all
of<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.150> let's<00:02:27.480> actually<00:02:27.660> test<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.140> out<00:02:28.260> how

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
of that let's actually test it out how

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.920 
of that let's actually test it out how
does<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> match<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.520> against<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.000> boss<00:02:30.180> okay

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
so this is a suitable location I'll plop

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.690 
so this is a suitable location I'll plop
down<00:02:33.450> my<00:02:33.600> Hydra<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.170> my<00:02:34.739> Ravens<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:35.580> need

Skeletron<00:02:43.830> prime<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.489> be<00:02:44.580> quite<00:02:44.850> tricky<00:02:45.120> and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
Skeletron prime can be quite tricky and

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.720 
Skeletron prime can be quite tricky and
look<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.440> basically<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.069> setup<00:02:47.310> idea

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
look this is basically the setup idea

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.880 
look this is basically the setup idea
like<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.600> Ravens<00:02:48.989> are<00:02:49.110> hitting<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
like the Ravens are hitting it the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.740 
like the Ravens are hitting it the
hydras<00:02:50.250> hitting<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.970> you're<00:02:51.330> hitting<00:02:51.540> it

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
hydras hitting it and you're hitting it

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.600 
hydras hitting it and you're hitting it
to<00:02:51.870> actually<00:02:52.140> regenerate<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:53.010> that's

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
to actually regenerate and that's

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.759 
to actually regenerate and that's
resource<00:02:54.090> into<00:02:54.450> pretty<00:02:54.780> insane<00:02:55.140> damage<00:02:55.560> I

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
resource into pretty insane damage I

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.890 
resource into pretty insane damage I
have<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.160> say<00:02:56.340> especially<00:02:57.120> if<00:02:57.360> all<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.720> Ravens

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900
