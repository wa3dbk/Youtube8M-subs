00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
today's video deals with removing you

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.110 
today's video deals with removing you
know<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.370> censor<00:00:06.410> as<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.560> can<00:00:07.680> see<00:00:08.120> that's

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
know to censor as you can see that's

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.209 
know to censor as you can see that's
kind<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.630> designed<00:00:10.170> similar<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> spark<00:00:11.160> plug

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
kind of designed similar to a spark plug

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.089 
kind of designed similar to a spark plug
instead<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.059> ceramic<00:00:12.540> insulator<00:00:12.960> here<00:00:13.710> you

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
instead of a ceramic insulator here you

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.550 
instead of a ceramic insulator here you
have<00:00:14.309> your<00:00:14.460> three<00:00:14.700> wires<00:00:14.940> running<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.570> some

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
have your three wires running it some

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.560 
have your three wires running it some
only<00:00:16.890> have<00:00:17.070> one<00:00:17.369> some<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.970> more<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.420> all

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
only have one some have more it all

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.590 
only have one some have more it all
depends<00:00:19.070> now<00:00:20.070> when<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.939> was<00:00:21.060> working<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.570> my

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
depends now when I was working in my

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.009 
depends now when I was working in my
garage<00:00:21.980> we<00:00:22.980> used<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.970> these<00:00:24.150> about<00:00:24.600> once<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
garage we used to do these about once a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.950 
garage we used to do these about once a
week<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.029> developed<00:00:27.359> my<00:00:27.810> own

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
week so I kind of developed my own

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.740 
week so I kind of developed my own
little<00:00:28.230> technique<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.519> quickly<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.539> I

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
little technique to do it quickly and I

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.569 
little technique to do it quickly and I
actually<00:00:32.329> change<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.660> tool<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> job<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
actually change the tool to do a job a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.520 
actually change the tool to do a job a
little<00:00:35.850> easier<00:00:36.059> for<00:00:36.329> installation<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
little easier for installation it's a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.350 
little easier for installation it's a
7/8<00:00:38.600> wrench<00:00:39.770> box<00:00:40.770> end<00:00:41.040> wrench<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:42.239> I've

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
7/8 wrench box end wrench and what I've

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.910 
7/8 wrench box end wrench and what I've
done<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.600> I've<00:00:42.870> taken<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.260> socket

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
done is I've taken a socket

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.910 
done is I've taken a socket
I<00:00:43.950> cut<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> socket<00:00:45.030> welded<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.770> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
I cut the socket welded it to it so that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.549 
I cut the socket welded it to it so that
the<00:00:47.100> splines<00:00:47.399> meet<00:00:47.789> up<00:00:47.940> inside<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:49.530> I

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the splines meet up inside and then I

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.040 
the splines meet up inside and then I
ground<00:00:49.950> through<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.120> when<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> time

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
ground through it so that when the time

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.990 
ground through it so that when the time
comes

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
comes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.900 
comes
slides<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> wires<00:00:54.570> easily<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.730> can

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
slides over the wires easily and I can

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
slides over the wires easily and I can
install<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> new<00:00:57.539> one<00:00:57.690> now<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> take<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
install the new one now to take up the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.979 
install the new one now to take up the
old<00:00:59.489> one<00:01:00.109> actually<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.289> quite<00:01:01.500> easy<00:01:02.989> because

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
old one actually it's quite easy because

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.570 
old one actually it's quite easy because
you're<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> save<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.549> can

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you're not going to save it you can

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.910 
you're not going to save it you can
pretty<00:01:06.450> much<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.780> which<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.500> now

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
pretty much do which one with it now

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.690 
pretty much do which one with it now
what<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.189> had<00:01:09.170> decided<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.400> make<00:01:11.549> it

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
what I had decided to do to make it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.750 
what I had decided to do to make it
quick<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.570> take<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> fight<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
quick was I would take a fight and a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:30.350 
quick was I would take a fight and a
hammer<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:27.409> would<00:01:28.409> damage<00:01:29.060> now<00:01:30.060> once

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
hammer and that would damage now once

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.210 
hammer and that would damage now once
it's<00:01:30.600> done<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.470> simple<00:01:31.799> bolt<00:01:32.009> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
it's done it's just a simple bolt that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.350 
it's done it's just a simple bolt that
you're<00:01:32.430> extracting<00:01:34.759> now<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> 7/8<00:01:36.659> socket

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
you're extracting now it is a 7/8 socket

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.740 
you're extracting now it is a 7/8 socket
that<00:01:39.360> fits<00:01:40.170> over<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.360> depending<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.420> where<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
that fits over so depending on where it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.600 
that fits over so depending on where it
is<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.170> sometimes<00:01:43.380> they're<00:01:43.920> down<00:01:44.130> way<00:01:44.460> at

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
is because sometimes they're down way at

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.249 
is because sometimes they're down way at
the<00:01:44.700> back<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.149> you'll<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.750> break<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the back so you'll have to break it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.050 
the back so you'll have to break it
either<00:01:46.860> from<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.310> top<00:01:47.490> or<00:01:47.729> underneath

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
either from up top or underneath

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
either from up top or underneath
wherever<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:50.009> you'll<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
wherever you can and then you'll have to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.700 
wherever you can and then you'll have to
use<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.640> lot<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:50.939> extensions<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:53.930> flex<00:01:54.930> joints

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
use a lot of extensions and flex joints

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.740 
use a lot of extensions and flex joints
to<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.850> able<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.180> everything<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.659> where

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
to be able to get everything to where

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.380 
to be able to get everything to where
you<00:01:57.899> need<00:01:58.079> it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
you need it

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.810 
you need it
now<00:01:59.870> quite<00:02:00.170> often<00:02:00.410> you<00:02:00.800> can't<00:02:01.040> get<00:02:01.280> an<00:02:01.400> impact

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
now quite often you can't get an impact

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.420 
now quite often you can't get an impact
on<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.240> but<00:02:02.480> if<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.690> can<00:02:02.810> get<00:02:02.930> your<00:02:03.140> flexes<00:02:03.740> and

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
on it but if you can get your flexes and

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.850 
on it but if you can get your flexes and
then<00:02:04.760> put<00:02:05.000> pipe<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:06.730> tear<00:02:07.730> ratchet<00:02:08.420> oh<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:09.680> is

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
then put pipe to tear ratchet oh this is

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.970 
then put pipe to tear ratchet oh this is
also<00:02:10.009> easier<00:02:10.460> to<00:02:10.520> do<00:02:10.729> when<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.970> motors<00:02:11.300> more

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
also easier to do when the motors more

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.620 
also easier to do when the motors more
you<00:02:12.980> help<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.340> break<00:02:13.490> up<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.760> rust<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.390> once

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
you help to break up the rust so once

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.170 
you help to break up the rust so once
you've<00:02:14.750> got<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.080> set<00:02:15.550> just<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.670> simple<00:02:16.970> matter

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
you've got that set just a simple matter

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:33.400 
you've got that set just a simple matter
of<00:02:22.270> once<00:02:23.270> it's<00:02:23.480> broken<00:02:23.750> free<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:31.990> it's<00:02:32.990> out<00:02:33.170> on

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
of once it's broken free and it's out on

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.940 
of once it's broken free and it's out on
the<00:02:34.310> ground<00:02:34.520> which<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.090> normal<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:36.590> when<00:02:36.830> you
