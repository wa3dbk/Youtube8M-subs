00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.470

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.790
 it's time to Achievement 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.730
 it's time to try to get into 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.860
 allotment preacher arrow and not easy 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.500
 from a certain distance to i mean i 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.180
 found the same little man who 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.280
 was on video and around this bridge 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.260
 i need to stand 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.450
 but not only that I endured wealth 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.300
 but it is necessary to shoot not directly but that is 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.110
 along such an intricate trajectory that is 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.260
 in an arc let's say so you shoot up and what 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.610
 she got into such a trajectory 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.430
 actually we will try 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.030
 I will do a quick save and start 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.060
 just try to try 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.650
 I feel that this time I can and 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.380
 goodbye your 500 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.459
 in rubles this does not really like 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.459
 we will try 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:29.040
 launching several arrows at once because 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.939
 that no always land don't know with 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.870
 how is it connected 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:39.689
 sometimes very long fly like what I 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.750
 already tired honestly a little bit more and i 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:51.930
 just give up and will be ready to give up to 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:54.780
 head right in the head oh my god 90 about 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.879
 90 attempts I was ready just 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:03.720
 surrender and give the winner the deserved 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:08.370
 500 rubles but as someone said for 500 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.829
 rubles a man is ready for much I will say 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.180
 now rude words but i'm a jerk 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:17.310
 performing this progress so it is possible to prove 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.940
 what is this explicit video so I ran away from 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:27.210
 guards but naturally to write 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:30.730
 steering wheel to go to the table and vk 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.130
 pzr summing up I want to say on this 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.530
 moment is the best achivka which i 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.410
 performed even though they were only 3 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.630
 and this despite the fact that for more than an hour I 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.000
 spent archery in the sky with 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.550
 the expectation that finally the head of it 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.130
 the preacher will be decorated with my arrow 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.530
 most importantly alexander was closest to 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.800
 to get a prize but alas I 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.110
 turned out to be a little more stubborn before 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.810
 say goodbye and have traditionally show 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.540

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.970

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:16.300
 unattainable for me well and of course i 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.470
