00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.250 
consistency hey guys so this is how I
apply<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.010> now<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.790> let<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.480> sit<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:15.840> about

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
apply it now I let this sit for about

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.720 
apply it now I let this sit for about
thirty<00:02:16.830> minutes<00:02:16.980> before<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:18.360> apply<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
thirty minutes before I apply it so the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.540 
thirty minutes before I apply it so the
consistency<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.959> little<00:02:22.500> bit<00:02:22.709> thicker<00:02:23.160> so

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
consistency is a little bit thicker so

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.460 
consistency is a little bit thicker so
it's<00:02:24.000> about<00:02:24.300> an<00:02:24.510> apple<00:02:24.750> sauce<00:02:25.140> consistency

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
