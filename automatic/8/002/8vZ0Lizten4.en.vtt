00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.720
 in this unit we will build the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.940
 set of natural numbers of such a 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.460
 in a way that we can establish 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.160
 mathematically appropriate way is 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.949
 definitions relating to those numbers and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.260
 mainly demonstrate properties 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.630
 relative to these numbers to large 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.670
 star of this first unit are 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.449
 called the one you call the piano as you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.750
 you will see next through the numbers 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.719
 natural that people have their first 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.050
 contact with math 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:40.410
 the role of natural numbers is to provide 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 an abstract model for counting is that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.340
 normally begins naturally 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:54.719
 children start simply is 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:58.710
 numbering words in 123 is what should 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:05.670
 be listed must be pronounced in a 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:09.830
 right order and later is that it is these 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.100
 words will acquire a sense of 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.549
 score 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.470
 then it is this sequence of means 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:23.780
 natural features can be characterized by a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.119
 set of properties is that they were 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.490
 initially introduced by piano by 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.780
 they are called axioms of 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.320
 pity is the fundamental idea in this 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.170
 characterization is the idea of a successor 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.100
 of a natural number is the idea 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.560
 expressed here in this sequence that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.310
 after each natural number always comes a 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.759
 and that this is a process that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.969
 never ends and if the number is repeated 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.100
 sufficient time will allow to reach 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.729
 any natural number greater than 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.820
 be there then these intuitive ideas 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.030
 can be formalized by means of a 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.260
 set jackson - then these axioms 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.330
 are the following 1 axiom 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.430
 is that the whole natural number has a unique 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.180
 successor 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.700
 then it is not possible to have to 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.829
 natural number to have two successors 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.220
 different from the first one it calls 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:33.500
 piano tells us that this is a situation 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:36.349
 which does not occur according to axiom is that 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.140
 different natural numbers have 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.859
 different successors this means that 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.680
 It is not is possible from two 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.609
 natural numbers reach the same 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.560
 successor 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:54.459
 then this is something else that can not 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:58.129
 occur the third axiom is that 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:02.239
 there is a single natural number that 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:07.010
 is the successor that no other is that is 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:10.389
 means it can not happen and we 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.519
 we have for example two sequences 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:16.900
 each one starting from one 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:21.349
 certain point again the third axiom 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:25.609
 prevents this from occurring 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:28.129
 and finally the last axiom is that as 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.139
 We'll see if it's the one who 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:35.419
 more operational point of view 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:37.819
 important of all tells us that s 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:40.370
 I have a certain subset of numbers 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.510
 with the following two is 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.699
 property 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:49.190
 the number 1 is that it is the only one 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:52.819
 number is natural that it is not the successor of 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:57.799
 nobody belongs to this set 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.750
 besides it's yours I have any element 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.079
 of this set 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.750
 his successor is also in that 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.690
 do not serve that it is because of this 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.949
 process from one we would form the 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.650
 his successor 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:15.199
 the idea that this additional tells us is that 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.669
 if these properties are true 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:23.780
 then this set that is has these two 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.080
 properties is the whole set of 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.840
 natural numbers 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:34.169
 it is these axioms they are expressing from a 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.430
 mind accurate mathematical way is everything 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.229
 what we know about 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.270
 natural numbers 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:47.129
 we will see in particular the following 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:49.800
 here the latter add the fourth axiom 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:53.729
 this man called here is an induction is 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.129
 play a key role is in the 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.240
 property establishment 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.240
 to natural numbers
