I do like it it's very reminiscent of my

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.179 
I do like it it's very reminiscent of my
Japanese<00:01:09.240> book<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.560> guys<00:01:10.680> are<00:01:11.040> familiar

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
with me Genki series it this is pretty

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.179 
with me Genki series it this is pretty
much<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.119> Korean<00:01:15.450> version<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.500> textbook

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
much the Korean version of that textbook

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.280 
much the Korean version of that textbook
I<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> feel<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.140> with

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
I really do like it but I feel like with

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
I really do like it but I feel like with
my<00:01:19.530> Japanese<00:01:20.159> textbook<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.240> very

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
my Japanese textbook this was very

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.660 
my Japanese textbook this was very
similar<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> fact<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.590> there's<00:01:23.310> some

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
similar in the fact that there's some

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.710 
similar in the fact that there's some
things<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.320> feel<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.180> would<00:01:27.180> make<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> lot

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
things that I feel like would make a lot

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
things that I feel like would make a lot
more<00:01:27.960> sense<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.750> professor<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:31.470> explaining

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
more sense if a professor was explaining

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.910 
more sense if a professor was explaining
it<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.570> with<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.810> book<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.710> makes

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it to you with this book if that makes

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.590 
it to you with this book if that makes
sense<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.490> think<00:01:35.579> that's<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.180> reason<00:01:36.299> why<00:01:36.540> this

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
sense I think that's the reason why this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.219 
sense I think that's the reason why this
textbook<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.500> very<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.670> heavily<00:01:39.060> used<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
textbook is very very heavily used in a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.730 
textbook is very very heavily used in a
lot<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.939> university<00:01:41.939> Korean<00:01:42.930> courses<00:01:43.439> because

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
lot of university Korean courses because

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.499 
lot of university Korean courses because
it<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> good<00:01:44.280> textbook<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:44.909> there's<00:01:45.240> just

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
it is a good textbook but there's just

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
it is a good textbook but there's just
that<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:46.950> aware<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.250> that

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
that you have to be aware of that

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.160 
that you have to be aware of that
sometimes<00:01:47.939> there<00:01:48.149> are<00:01:48.299> some<00:01:48.540> certain<00:01:48.720> parts

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.410 
to 40 dollars I think some of them just
kind<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.920> ridiculous<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> norm

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
kind of ridiculous it's just the norm

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.330 
kind of ridiculous it's just the norm
workbook<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.230> doesn't<00:02:13.620> even<00:02:13.980> have<00:02:14.310> like
