00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.910
 arrived arrived finally we have between 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.200
 us the samsung galaxy 5 that ends 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.450
 to present samsung in the mobile world 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.460
 congress of barcelona 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.460
 it comes in four colors that we have here 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.279
 that is the electric blue the rest is the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.990
 black in white and a kind of gold 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 believe that we know it still very well 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.169
 as it is in terms of major networks 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.849
 we see that everything suite although it has not 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.860
 suffered I know that such a change so 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.180
 exaggerated that many expected yes that 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.040
 he has committed quite a lot of suicide and the icons 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.260
 they are now flatter more elegant and without 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.000
 doubt very much much more beautiful 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.490
 we can see how 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.600
 the settings menu to change 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.280
 radically probably the new 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.989
 fit is more beautiful and more usable than 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.989
 There is right now in all android 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.360
 and it is very noticeable that a 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.519
 effort to improve and by and by 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.379
 polish that great unfinished business that 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.399
 they always had other terminals the 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.219
 Interface 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.470
 it was everything 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.750
 it's natural with running 2.5 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.909
 2,800 gigahertz and the batteries together 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.070
 to it samsung included technologies in 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.149
 the screen looking to improve the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.130
 battery duration 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.600
 otherwise, official functions 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.340
 specific unique functionalities that 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.080
 have arrived so far on the button 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.429
 home is similar what we 're going now 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.920
 on the iphone three fingerprints are included 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:24.660
 fingernails that we're going to go up adjustments 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.660
 to be able to prove how it works 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.280
 good 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.110
 supposedly he 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.130
 you have to drag the dow several times 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.130
 until it is recognized 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.900
 and once done 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.830
 we could perform functions like 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.510
 unlock the phone with the apart of 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.970
 that the most interesting thing is that samsung 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.950
 has allied with paypal to be able to pay 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.860
 through the unlock button with what 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.479
 which really closes the circle and he 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.190
 it's not just extra functionality 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.020
 that allows us to unlock or download 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.280
 applications as is the case of ios 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.470
 that goes much further and allows us 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.290
 close the ecosystem and make payments to 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.270
 through the mobile phone with the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.569
 As for the back we see that the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:21.080
 galaxy 5 carry this flash in addition 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.300
 it helps us measure the heart rate 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.410
 if we put if we put our finger on it 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.970
 is nothing new is something that we had already 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.080
 seen new applications of ios that already 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.430
 we live we have android apps 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.170
 but what properties come very 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.810
 integrated the heart pulse theme is 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.060
 very important because it also comes 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.350
 present in the rest of the functionalities 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.850
 the rest of the devices that 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.450
 presented samsung as can be the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.730
 galaxy gear or how the army can be 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.290
 we keep seeing interface details by 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.629
 example 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.350
 when we change the blows the 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.960
 wallpapers or widgets 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.180
 we see that the icons are now very much 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.790
 softer even the menus have been 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.769
 softened very much 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.840
 the bear is practically the same and yes 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.819
 that puts some flaw in the design is that 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.609
 the edges is that false aluminum that already 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.359
 we saw with the galaxy s 4 still without 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.250
 convince us 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.650
 so without committing us completely 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.230
 of that in question stop software 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.549
 samsung includes features that allow 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.269
 for example if we are very low in 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.129
 battery holds for a long time that 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.209
 small since we are putting the 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.650
 phone a kind of mode 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.290
 absolute hibernation that allows 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.710
 Save battery according to samsung up to 12 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.550
 more hours this is the new galaxy 5 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.550
 for cell phones
