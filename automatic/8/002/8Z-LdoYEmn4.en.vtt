00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.339
 and 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.780
 what's up, how are you? 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.280
 well as always if you do not know me if 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.290
 you are new or new to this channel 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.210
 welcome to one more episode of this 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.580
 Christmas special, my name is Ricardo 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.260
 we have here every Wednesday and 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.119
 if you already know me, it means that you have 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.280
 been here and thanks for being of 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.980
 new and that they believe is already here is coming 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.260
 approaching each day more is already missing 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.900
 eight days for Christmas that makes the 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.879
 time went by super fast and if you at 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.070
 just like I leave everything for the last and 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.690
 you still do not know what you are going to give or if 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.670
 you already have to but you do not know how 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.260
 wrap it do not worry here it's me 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.540
 to help you and you already know that as 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.670
 always in the quickest and easiest way 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.890
 economical so if you want to know what 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.890
 I speak do not move and get to work 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.800
 and the materials for this first idea 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.800
 are 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.960
 cookies or what they want to give away 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.010
 slats 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.010
 and a small bottle 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.330
 I share this idea because sometimes 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.280
 that we do not have as much money or 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.400
 time to give a more shaped gift 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.410
 but a detail if it is always appreciated and 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.360
 this the easiest thing in the world just 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.010
 we fill the jar with cookies or 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.010
 chocolates or whatever they want 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.229
 we cover and finally we put a 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.229
 monkey and ready 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.840
 for the second idea the materials are 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.740
 china paper 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.560
 a jar 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.810
 gordon 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.810
 and the gift that he puts in the jar 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.340
 for this the only thing we are going to do is 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.769
 fill the bottle that in this case is 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.379
 mayonnaise looks very original and so not 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.870
 spend and recycle what they will fill with 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.090
 who want this gift are enamels and 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.609
 little things like that for the nails that sell for 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.379
 all sides at very good prices and for 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.540
 cap the bottle will use a 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.610
 15 x 15 Chinese paper squares 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.860
 centimeters 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.960
 then we just secure the paper with the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.960
 cord and ready so easy 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.290
 and for this third wrap idea of 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.760
 gift what we need is paper of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.599
 china masking tape 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.569
 molds that I leave it on facebook some 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.690
 golden marker 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.900
 a cardboard box 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.310
 diamond 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.310
 and some cord cited 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.250
 we started using these little plumes 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.170
 paper that we cut we are going to give a touch 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.750
 of color that in this case is golden 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.989
 they can be painted all or only one part 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.819
 or combine them like me after we put 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.010
 a little glue to the part where 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.700
 we painted in gold and covered them 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.700
 with diamond 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.930
 now we wrap the box normally 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.940
 as we do with tissue paper I 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.900
 I recommend one so dark for you 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.900
 highlight the feathers 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.700
 finally we put the cord in the middle 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.700
 from the box with a few laps 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.380
 and then we put the popcorn between 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.380
 cord and ready 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.740
 and for the fourth idea we need paper 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.840
 from china 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:50.650
 or spray paint a cardboard box 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.650
 tape 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.210
 and molds I still use the pens 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.249
 this is very simple let's wrap 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.409
 Normally the box with color paper 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:03.800
 that they want obviously already with the gift 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.800
 in 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.910
 ah 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.890
 and now we're going to use the molds to 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.870
 stamp the paper as we want as they 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.000
 I say I'm using these little feathers 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.460
 you can use the initials of 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.100
 the person to whom they are going to give 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.650
 some hearts flowers I do not know what 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.660
 want to just do a little bit of 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.670
 spray paint on the mold for 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.410
 that is marked and help me with a 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.870
 little tape so that when you 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.670
 painting do not move and ready as they 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.670
 I say you get creative 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.270
 finally we put some monkey with 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.010
 a ribbon and ready 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.010
 the result is this 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.590
 Y 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.740
 and what did you think like I said easy 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.720
 fast and cheap besides very original I know 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.580
 that these ideas will get us out of a hurry 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.890
 already with these days on do not doubt in 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.720
 apply them and if they do this or any 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.460
 of the ideas that I have shown you I do not know 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.200
 I forgot to send me a photo to my networks 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.090
