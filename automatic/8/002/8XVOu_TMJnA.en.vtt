00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.040
 welcome to another episode less 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.269
 sick but just as boring 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.029
 this time summarize the episode 

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:09.530
 participate sounds like a youtube pop 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.700
 the episode begins to air 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.169
 being very nervous because it is going to 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.940
 meet with the prince there are already here they are 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.980
 or as it is pronounced to open the 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.420
 borders between both territories which 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.369
 offers them local foods but 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.320
 let's say these jacksons somewhat demanding 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.509
 and they begin to destroy everything clearly 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.189
 they have temperament problems so 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.509
 which one he ordered made it more imperative 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.089
 teach the city to the ones that more 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.250
 imperatives and here the thing gets something 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.000
 repetitive does not seem beyond that 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.680
 they were yaks destroy everything they understand 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.080
 this is repeated a lot during the episode 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.850
 because it 's part of the wind joke that 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.480
 nothing works and he decides to travel 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.930
 that here they are as pronounced and 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.780
 that happens 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.830
 ok but the train apparently stops 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.830
 because there are sheep on the tracks 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.300
 while the pony bill the others try 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.910
 make the party before the prince 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.470
 I declared war or self clearly the 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.840
 You're carrying with democracy and 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.699
 international treaties and it seems that the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.240
 rimbaud likes to be tied because 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.640
 it's not the first time he does 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.170
 loquillo while I paint and ask for help 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.970
 to a character who I do not remember his 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.070
 name but it seems a second season 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.020
 is the help will come and Christian guide 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.189
 as separating but everyone falls asleep 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.450
 ok and they die ok they are not rescued by 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.340
 The bags and pinky gloves are from the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.340
 beatles that's not a lie 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.649
 after james comes out of nowhere 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.850
 a lot lately that she is 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.890
 making more responsible than others 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.270
 princesses while the rest of the mainz and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.070
 is the secret hiding place of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.420
 pink and where you plan your parties and have 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.490
 records of the things that you like each 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.450
 pony and apparently which one is afraid of 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.450
 the quesadillas 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.649
 and 2010 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.680
 this 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.680
 yes 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.990
 do not you and that's interesting 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.610
 meanwhile pink and manage to evade a 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.650
 monster and they almost manage to remove jackie 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.270
 they are as pronounced but surely 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.340
 the ice there is very fragile and pinti 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.990
 finish the 'san opposable and after 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.480
 a discourse of what matters is not the 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.520
 destination but the end trip and finally 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.500
 get an idea for the party and get 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.210
 intercept the yaks by convincing them 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.910
 establishes the friendship between yaks and ponies 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.590
 and thus avoiding clear war the stia 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.240
 nor aware of that possibility why 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.490
 it is very current how the what 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.130
 fuck did you alive for the end 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.510
 everything ends well and all that shit this 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.070
 episode was fun even though it was from 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.900
 wait with an episode focused on your 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.430
 Most main although in certain 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.930
 parts becomes somewhat repetitive with the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.700
 since destroying everything that does not 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.200
 like but it's compensated with the rest of 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.260
 the jokes and statements of certain 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.460
 seriously quesadillas characters this was 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.770
 a good episode with several jokes and 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.840
 references and I think I ate still 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.230
 he continues to question his existence but 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.200
 it was a good episode and well I think that 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.730
 that's all basically in the episode 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.050
 so with nothing more to say many 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.050
 thanks for watching and see you next 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.480
 yes 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.220
 room 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.760
 I do not want 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.060
 happy 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.050
 for you
