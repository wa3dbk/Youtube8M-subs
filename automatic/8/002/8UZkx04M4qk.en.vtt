it's been beefed up because there's a
power<00:01:50.579> transfer<00:01:51.119> internal<00:01:51.509> sidewalls<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
power transfer internal sidewalls on the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.020 
power transfer internal sidewalls on the
inside<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.520> ultra-high<00:01:53.970> molecular

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
inside of the ultra-high molecular

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.670 
inside of the ultra-high molecular
weighted<00:01:54.840> sidewalls

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
weighted sidewalls

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.010 
weighted sidewalls
so<00:01:56.130> overall<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.299> decks<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.810> pretty

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
so overall the decks can be pretty

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.780 
so overall the decks can be pretty
beefier<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
beefier you know if you if you want a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.910 
beefier you know if you if you want a
jib<00:02:00.149> deck<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.780> might<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.469> good<00:02:01.590> one

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
jib deck this might be a really good one

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
jib deck this might be a really good one
if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> want<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.149> jib<00:02:03.360> deck<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:04.020> has

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
if you if you want a jib deck that has

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.539 
if you if you want a jib deck that has
lots<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.500> pop<00:02:04.710> because<00:02:04.890> there's<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.219> stiffer

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
lots of pop because there's a stiffer

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.950 
lots of pop because there's a stiffer
flex<00:02:05.670> rating<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.930> well

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
flex rating you can have that as well

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.979 
flex rating you can have that as well
that<00:02:07.590> deep<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.910> deep<00:02:09.179> rocker<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.720> between

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
that deep that deep rocker in between

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.900 
that deep that deep rocker in between
the<00:02:10.080> feet<00:02:10.259> really<00:02:10.709> does<00:02:11.009> wonders<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:11.459> giving

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
the feet really does wonders for giving

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.699 
the feet really does wonders for giving
and<00:02:12.150> for

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
and for

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.490 
and for
in<00:02:13.129> powder<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.150> if<00:02:14.299> you<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.780> if<00:02:15.109> you<00:02:15.230> like<00:02:15.409> to

in powder so if you just if you like to
cruise<00:02:15.769> in<00:02:15.950> powder<00:02:16.159> you<00:02:16.400> go<00:02:16.549> into<00:02:16.700> powder<00:02:16.939> then

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
cruise in powder you go into powder then

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.149 
cruise in powder you go into powder then
you<00:02:17.450> go<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.629> like<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.260> regular<00:02:18.500> run<00:02:18.859> and<00:02:19.040> then
