00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.250
 puzzle game today we're going 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.770
 to do delirious madness ranked 12th 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.810
 in our explorer sheet I 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.840
 now located in the steppes of the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.440
 flaming streak the area 40 50 tanks 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.200
 all the northeast is a little heart 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.650
 near the crossing point of tayrac 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.870
 haroun round to we're going back into 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.540
 the cave we will find one more 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.899
 very nasty humanoids so let's go them 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.899
 to avoid 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.290
 then we will pass recipes 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.290
 tent on the right in the tunnel 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.420
 in the tunnel will find archers 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 beds and so on and we're going 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.590
 to go upstairs 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.770
 once these stairs rise we 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.770
 let's go a little bit 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.050
 on this stone then here and we pass 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.940
 over there 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.840
 this puzzle game is rather long so 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.310
 do you expect the same video we 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.760
 jumped on the stone that is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.760
 just there 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.800
 that's what we have to do next 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.560
 it's jumping on the stairs halfway 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.750
 destroyed on the other side seems a 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.650
 little long you can use a boost 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.650
 speed if it reassures you 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.770
 mr 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.180
 the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.799
 a little thing that I forgot to 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.200
 do is disable supported two 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.470
 time to dodge would be stupid to fall 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.470
 right now 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.640

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.180

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.409
 long that's why I'm going to take 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.780
 a little bit of ten hours if you do not 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:52.340

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:54.560
 possible to do it without and we will 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.049

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.579

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.940

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.989
 bottom of the cave 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.989

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.840
 hungry for this puzzle suppose once 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.840

 I had already killed him several times 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.090

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.900
 heart style for a puzzle game and
