 today with you we bring you to this 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.219
 individual 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.769
 the goal is special year because it is 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:16.270
 our friend will not be enough 70 dollars 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:18.600
 it identifies you or nothing is worth it to you 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.600
 obstacles 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.390
 if you better see it for you because if not 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.369
 I see it I do not believe it, not the hot spot 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.739
 competitive me down those are the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.760
 features of the video and now now 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.760
 look at this attention 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.870
 moving what 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.870
 I would announce it 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.120
 as you know in this area of four 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.559
 tickets and he seems sometimes you do not know 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 perfectly where will the 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:59.910
 enemies is not there the friend kills him 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.600
 to the enemy and good because he knows this 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.479
 Guy knows he has admitted because he uses 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.140
 a low attack of Jorge acts implies 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.520
 good as you know many people the most 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.920
 of you probably you will have QUAD 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.930
 model 3 the paradise of the bucks there 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.510
 several types of hacks worth is this the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.920
 which wall wall hack in English that 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.300
 means that you can see through the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.270
 walls which you will understand what what 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.090
 what influences this but through the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.119
 walls then there is the spot to point at 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.890
 English bot of a bot of one already as a 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.750
 machine let's say that is that the machine 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.869
 point for you as you will have seen a lot 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.600
 people and then there are other types already minor 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.130
 like the chat that is every time it jumps 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.550
 it is aimed directly at the head of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.560
 enemy and other types not but this 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.869
 individual that as you see here carries 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.340
 warehouse because you're going to be seeing a 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.250
 through the video goes and you will already 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.980
 seen in some moments always points 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.670
 before turning the corner and now 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.770
 the body of the enemy that if you tell me no 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.440
 roche but without competitive was 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.260
 looking at the corner of the wall 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.790
 pointing because he's focused if I 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.130
 I also do it, I also pointed to 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.780
 crossing a corner is worth but not aimed at 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.780
 the head of the individual in question 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.050
 he is a friend is a friend of mine and of javi 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.270
 son of much speaks of the truth because 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.940
 I know him and not now he does not play 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.590
 that's the way I know it, it just went away 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.810
 with friends you will know how juanillo are 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.860
 watching and in the games and attention that is 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.860
 the key moment of the video 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.660
 Attention 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.060
 pu 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.950
 and this just here waiting but there 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.540
 we are two missing to come because 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.329
 he was seeing through walls 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.560
 or is impressive is with bloodthirsty 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.319
 how hard it is to take out the multiplayer 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.620
 that takes it out in a bar in competitive a 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.019
 hot spot meltdown and the javi days 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.270
 the days to me what this can bring 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.280
 for our clan 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.040
 to see exactly the composition 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.670
 strong that was training not without 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.670
 practice a little 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.249
 if I was not there I was playing with the 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.049
 clan and missing one were missing infiltrated and 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:25.840
 They said some step with our friend 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.019
 and it's still okay, it's not going to change 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.909
 that's because it takes this and then nothing 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.989
 thank goodness it was a friendly against 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:36.010
 people that we know because if you can not 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.450
 handle us completely or not 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.730
 leave them because they were not competitive in 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.669
 life the whole clan does it would load 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.849
 everything they give for their passage already and it is not 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:48.549
 normal than in cognitive someone at 40 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.980
 low as this character is going to do 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.269
 let's say and the rest the mind is not the most 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.269
 it's normal let's say no 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.870
 I do not know if he is good 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.120
 is pretty is pretty good and well I 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.700
 it surprises the truth that there is already ajax in 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.880
 a black ops 2 and good as you know 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.329
 I started is known worldwide because 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.250
 this is already sold worldwide by 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.560
 hacks is worth it because people check it out 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.750
 very easy if this plus the platform more 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.000
 easy to hack is true and I 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.380
 surprised because of old hacks 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.290
 because I am going to explain to you a bit how 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.060
 the theme works in the hacks go by 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.820
 they answer the hacks they control the console 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.979
 of commands goes to the command console 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.470
 let's say the set of actions that 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.290
 are developing let's say in the 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.310
 programming script is worth going 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.130
 happening every time you play 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.100
 then this modifies it for its 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.660
 advantage let's say then this console 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.260
 Command is not available 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.060
 the console is usually shared 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.110
 commands at two months let's say more or 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.180
 unless the game comes out 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.210
 the command console I started so what 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.440
 I know it is not has not come out yet 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.849
 have shared I know the 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.539
 administrator 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:14.089
 sting for this game has a tweeter 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.589
 If you want I can send it, it has already 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.599
 said that a banned more than 100 thousand 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:20.749
 blank accounts this is such a thing 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.639
 an awful lot and so they are 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.679
 doing a bad job is worth so 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.929
 I really recommend, I already know that they are 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:30.289
 many that much hacks the hacks and other 

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:32.479
 but trimming them is five seconds and 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.999
 although it seems that they do not report us yes 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.259
 report that I say rather than 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:38.059
 for example sayings mode had 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:43.399
 too many to sell to all 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:46.330
 that's always the case and had not and you go 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:50.050
 it already comes and goes on your computer and 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:54.930
 imagining that so that one's own 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.930
 team do not say say bad 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:05.140
 we are looking for one thing 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.660
 and with this I was left stone 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.370
 The good thing is that I counted 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.240
 because as we stayed, I played with him 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.819
 every day yes 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.639
 to move to grape uvb is to 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:39.190
 pass it from being there is a step 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.720
 I say large I do not know either me 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.520
 I consider myself the best climbing player 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.550
 in this area but to me to get rid of it 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.940
 to be there you have to go for it 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.940
 let say 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:59.430
 and not without a motor in front of us we take out a pasqual 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.430
 for energetic 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.770
 it assails me 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.949
 yes yes as you see points before 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.259
 come out the guys is awesome the subject and 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.599
 nothing because it was just for a lot 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:15.370
 people maybe I would not have seen this 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:17.139
 explanation of the hacks and so on 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.380
 we had a series that surely 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:22.630
 will resume from outside the chetos and others 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.160
 with which the kids if you have 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.680
 some more doubt about all besides 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.840
 we played we started we are experts any 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.729
 of the three games in whatever you want us 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.560
 we have found with all types of cheto 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:34.720
 Yes, good as you will have seen in the 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.159
 series and do not go see the videos that are 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.909
 impressive the challenges that can 

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:41.860
 get to see and you can win them if you do not 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:44.830
 you have seen that video is also epic 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:47.889
 we won two hacker hair in two 

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.720
 against two in a confrontation going to 

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:52.539
 work I hope you liked the 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.759
 info that you give him alaiki favorites if 

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:58.409
 you think he deserves it and nothing else 

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.409
 our part here and russia-out
