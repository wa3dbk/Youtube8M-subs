00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.519
 more appreciated than hubble users ie 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.519
 you splash me at night 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.660
 obviously we're talking about two tablets 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.970
 completely different xiaomi minute 2 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.029
 to a plastic back cover clearly 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.529
 in short, removable materials 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.669
 slightly different than the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.800
 show mi min ott 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.550
 in this case even the glass in 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.030
 bamboo the two display units are a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.820
 app 5.5 inches for night two the other 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.040
 5.7 for me not ready has me the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 ability to remove the back cover 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.689
 to change the battery to have one 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 microsd to expand memory is also 

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:55.949
 dual sim with the micro sd 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.680
 the two displays are really calibrated 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.049
 very well this was the dominus 2 instead 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.330
 these scum notes you see in both 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.970
 cases like the color palette and well 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.040
 also the touch of these two is reproduced 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.200
 devices is really man responsive 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.270
 up to 10 touches compatible with 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.250
 both smartphones these radmin 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.470
 oct two but also xiaomi works 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.479
 very very well in both cases not 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.320
 we have never encountered any kind of 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.110
 problem on minute we have the version 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.630
 still with kit kat la view i v6 while 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.640
 on regions night two already arrived the bu 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.560
 7 clearly in beta 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.330
 both processors heat up 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.210
 very little on one side we have 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.360
 snapdragon 801 sumi notes from the other the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.670
 brand new helix 10 li mediatek 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.950
 soubrette minute 2 here are some of you 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.100
 antudo test in both devices 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.530
 clearly we are really there with the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.110
 however, you must count on performance 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.030
 than the snapdragon at 801 a year 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.440
 in short, two are abundant on the shoulders 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.020
 devices we need to classify 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.060
 like two fable the really successful 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.220
 two price ranges completely 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.500
 different for all pockets clearly 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.750
 if you want materials you first 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.550
 swarm night if you want anyway 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 excellent materials but you want to save 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.870

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.120
