degree and opened up rough draft to the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.760 
degree and opened up rough draft to the
public<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.670> 2012<00:00:14.690> the<00:00:15.690> whole<00:00:15.839> idea<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.200> open<00:00:16.710> a

brewery<00:00:16.950> just<00:00:17.790> stems<00:00:18.029> from<00:00:18.180> being<00:00:18.540> a<00:00:18.599> home

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
brewery just stems from being a home

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.810 
brewery just stems from being a home
brewer<00:00:18.960> for<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> long<00:00:19.710> time<00:00:19.949> pretty<00:00:20.460> much<00:00:20.550> right

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
brewer for a long time pretty much right

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.700 
brewer for a long time pretty much right
after<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.060> graduated<00:00:21.480> college<00:00:21.600> we<00:00:22.439> had<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> lot

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
after I graduated college we had a lot

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.009 
after I graduated college we had a lot
of<00:00:22.920> Science<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.699> my<00:00:24.300> undergraduate<00:00:24.720> degree

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
of Science in my undergraduate degree

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.080 
of Science in my undergraduate degree
and<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.439> think<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.800> certainly<00:00:26.010> helps<00:00:26.460> because

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and I think that certainly helps because

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.750 
and I think that certainly helps because
brewing<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> science<00:00:28.859> as<00:00:28.949> an<00:00:29.070> art<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
brewing is is a science as an art and a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.250 
brewing is is a science as an art and a
science<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.179> there's<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> lot<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> science<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
science but there's a lot of science and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.900 
science but there's a lot of science and
growing<00:00:31.560> there's<00:00:32.010> a<00:00:32.099> whole<00:00:32.309> process<00:00:32.519> so<00:00:32.879> that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
growing there's a whole process so that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.380 
growing there's a whole process so that
every<00:00:33.300> bear<00:00:33.449> has<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.690> go<00:00:33.960> through<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.710> first

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
every bear has to go through the first

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.149 
every bear has to go through the first
four<00:00:36.390> ingredients<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.989> beer<00:00:37.260> water<00:00:37.769> yeast

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:38.159 
four ingredients of beer water yeast

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.390 
four ingredients of beer water yeast
hops<00:00:38.699> and<00:00:39.180> malted<00:00:39.930> barley<00:00:40.049> what<00:00:40.830> we<00:00:40.949> do<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.280> we

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
hops and malted barley what we do is we

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.850 
hops and malted barley what we do is we
start<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:41.900> grain<00:00:42.900> and<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.199> add<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.530> into<00:00:43.710> our

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
start with grain and we add it into our

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.799 
start with grain and we add it into our
mill<00:00:44.159> and<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.580> kind<00:00:44.729> of<00:00:44.790> crack<00:00:45.150> the<00:00:45.420> barley<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
mill and just kind of crack the barley a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.899 
mill and just kind of crack the barley a
little<00:00:46.080> bit<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.409> it<00:00:46.769> just<00:00:46.949> needs<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> be

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
little bit and it just needs to be

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.609 
little bit and it just needs to be
cracked<00:00:48.269> a<00:00:48.420> little<00:00:48.449> bit<00:00:48.720> so<00:00:48.839> water<00:00:49.080> can<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.470> up

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:49.619 
cracked a little bit so water can get up

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.009 
cracked a little bit so water can get up
into<00:00:49.799> it<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:50.549> that<00:00:51.000> barley<00:00:51.659> is<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
into it because that barley is going to

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.140 
into it because that barley is going to
be<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.320> sugar<00:00:52.559> source<00:00:52.799> that<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.670> yeast<00:00:53.879> is

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
be your sugar source that the yeast is

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.810 
be your sugar source that the yeast is
later<00:00:54.330> going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> eat<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.019> turn<00:00:55.500> into<00:00:55.820> alcohol

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
later going to eat and turn into alcohol

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.439 
later going to eat and turn into alcohol
and<00:00:57.000> co2<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> after<00:00:58.769> we<00:00:58.890> mill<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> barley<00:00:59.670> we

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
and co2 so after we mill the barley we

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.950 
and co2 so after we mill the barley we
add<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:01.049> hot<00:01:01.500> water<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.040> our<00:01:02.189> mash<00:01:02.430> tun<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
add it to hot water in our mash tun and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.649 
add it to hot water in our mash tun and
it<00:01:03.960> sits<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.379> makes<00:01:04.530> kind<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> tea<00:01:05.659> soaking

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it sits and makes kind of a tea soaking

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.450 
it sits and makes kind of a tea soaking
all<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.110> sugar<00:01:07.410> out<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> barley<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
all that sugar out of the barley and

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
all that sugar out of the barley and
there's<00:01:08.640> enzyme<00:01:09.120> reactions<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.870> are<00:01:09.960> going

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
there's enzyme reactions that are going

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.990 
there's enzyme reactions that are going
on<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.560> whole<00:01:10.740> time<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.220> over<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> course

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
on this whole time and over the course

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
on this whole time and over the course
of<00:01:12.240> an<00:01:12.360> hour<00:01:12.480> all<00:01:12.870> that<00:01:13.530> sweetness<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.580> sugar

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
of an hour all that sweetness and sugar

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.160 
of an hour all that sweetness and sugar
comes<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.360> barley<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:15.810> into<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
comes out of the barley and into the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
comes out of the barley and into the
liquid<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:17.160> take<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> liquid<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.940> we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
liquid and we take that liquid and we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.860 
liquid and we take that liquid and we
pump<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> over<00:01:18.660> to<00:01:18.900> our<00:01:19.460> kettle<00:01:20.540> our<00:01:21.540> kettles

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
pump it over to our kettle our kettles

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.260 
pump it over to our kettle our kettles
steam<00:01:22.140> powered<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.340> fits<00:01:23.550> about<00:01:23.700> 15

barrels<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.840> beer<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> time<00:01:25.380> which<00:01:25.620> is<00:01:25.650> about

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
barrels of beer at a time which is about

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.820 
barrels of beer at a time which is about
500<00:01:26.670> gallons<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:28.140> we'll<00:01:28.290> let<00:01:28.410> it<00:01:28.470> boil<00:01:28.710> for

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
500 gallons then we'll let it boil for

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.410 
500 gallons then we'll let it boil for
an<00:01:29.040> hour<00:01:29.160> and<00:01:29.460> all<00:01:29.850> during<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.120> course<00:01:30.330> of

an hour and all during the course of

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.600 
an hour and all during the course of
that<00:01:30.570> boil<00:01:30.870> we're<00:01:31.560> adding<00:01:31.860> hops<00:01:32.070> into<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that boil we're adding hops into it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.790 
that boil we're adding hops into it
different<00:01:33.540> hops<00:01:33.690> at<00:01:33.930> different<00:01:34.230> time<00:01:34.409> periods

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
different hops at different time periods

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.220 
different hops at different time periods
make<00:01:35.430> these<00:01:35.640> different<00:01:35.970> flavors<00:01:36.330> and<00:01:36.630> first

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
make these different flavors and first

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.350 
make these different flavors and first
our<00:01:37.440> bittering<00:01:37.980> hops<00:01:38.010> and<00:01:38.580> by<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:38.820> end<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
our bittering hops and by the end of the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.020 
our bittering hops and by the end of the
boil<00:01:39.620> and<00:01:40.620> even<00:01:40.950> after<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.370> turn<00:01:41.550> off<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> boil

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
boil and even after we turn off the boil

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
boil and even after we turn off the boil
the<00:01:42.900> hops<00:01:43.080> will<00:01:43.320> add<00:01:43.409> sort<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.860> aromatic

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the hops will add sort of that aromatic

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.280 
the hops will add sort of that aromatic
flavor<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.150> you'll<00:01:45.330> get<00:01:45.480> out<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.750> beer<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
flavor that you'll get out of beer and

flavor that you'll get out of beer and
we<00:01:46.380> cool<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.800> beer<00:01:46.979> down<00:01:47.010> as<00:01:47.400> fast<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.970> can

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
we cool that beer down as fast as we can

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.450 
we cool that beer down as fast as we can
using<00:01:48.570> our<00:01:48.690> heat<00:01:48.900> exchanger<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.590> pump<00:01:50.340> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
using our heat exchanger and pump it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.790 
using our heat exchanger and pump it
into<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.300> our<00:01:51.420> fermentors<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.200> it's

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
into one of our fermentors and it's

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.780 
into one of our fermentors and it's
going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> sit<00:01:53.190> in<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.280> fermenter<00:01:53.760> and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
going to sit in that fermenter and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.200 
going to sit in that fermenter and
bubble<00:01:54.420> away<00:01:54.800> when<00:01:55.800> we<00:01:55.920> add<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.190> yeast<00:01:56.400> it<00:01:57.000> has

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
bubble away when we add the yeast it has

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.070 
bubble away when we add the yeast it has
a<00:01:57.240> vigorous<00:01:57.659> fermentation<00:01:58.470> for<00:01:59.420> 45<00:02:00.420> days<00:02:00.450> and

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
a vigorous fermentation for 45 days and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.719 
a vigorous fermentation for 45 days and
then<00:02:01.440> we'll<00:02:01.770> conditioned<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.370> over<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
then we'll conditioned it over the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.980 
then we'll conditioned it over the
course<00:02:02.970> of<00:02:03.150> another<00:02:03.390> two<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:03.780> three<00:02:03.960> weeks

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
course of another two to three weeks

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
course of another two to three weeks
depending<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.830> beer<00:02:05.010> has<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.250> lot<00:02:05.490> of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
depending on what the beer has a lot of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.389 
depending on what the beer has a lot of
our<00:02:05.760> beers<00:02:05.970> here<00:02:06.270> are<00:02:06.830> dry<00:02:07.830> hopped<00:02:08.069> which

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
our beers here are dry hopped which

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.240 
our beers here are dry hopped which
means<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.090> poor<00:02:09.720> hops<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.860> through<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
means we the poor hops in through the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.740 
means we the poor hops in through the
top<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.459> our<00:02:11.700> fermenter<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.510> let<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
top of our fermenter and just let it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.990 
top of our fermenter and just let it
soak<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.620> be

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
soak in that be

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.020 
soak in that be
for<00:02:15.000> almost<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.450> week<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.950> then<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.610> filter<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
for almost a week and then we filter the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.350 
for almost a week and then we filter the
beer<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.710> put<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:19.830> into<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.070> kegs<00:02:20.460> or<00:02:20.760> into

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
beer and put it into the kegs or into

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.830 
beer and put it into the kegs or into
bottles<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.950> get<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.070> out<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.370> people<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:24.750> of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
bottles and get it out to people one of

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.210 
bottles and get it out to people one of
the<00:02:24.900> biggest<00:02:25.050> things<00:02:25.320> that's<00:02:25.500> helped<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:25.920> just

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
