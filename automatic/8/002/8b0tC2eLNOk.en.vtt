allow better air flow which seems to

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.130 
allow better air flow which seems to
make<00:01:35.659> a<00:01:35.720> difference<00:01:35.840> in<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.830> power<00:01:37.929> I've<00:01:38.929> also

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
it and this is what I used i first

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.949 
it and this is what I used i first
drilled<00:02:34.730> with<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.510> one<00:02:37.060> let's<00:02:38.060> see<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.599> think

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
drilled with the one let's see I think

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.479 
drilled with the one let's see I think
it's<00:02:39.110> one<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.680> quarter<00:02:40.129> and<00:02:40.370> two<00:02:41.330> inch<00:02:42.489> but

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
it's one and a quarter and two inch but

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.770 
it's one and a quarter and two inch but
you<00:02:43.640> need<00:02:43.819> to<00:02:43.940> buy<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.150> one<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.569> fits

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
you need to buy the one that fits

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.290 
you need to buy the one that fits
exactly<00:02:44.989> around<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.739> center<00:02:46.099> pipe<00:02:46.310> inside

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
exactly around the center pipe inside

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.080 
exactly around the center pipe inside
the<00:02:47.540> exhaust<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.319> I've<00:02:49.219> drilled<00:02:49.549> you<00:02:49.819> drill

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
the exhaust and I've drilled you drill

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.000 
the exhaust and I've drilled you drill
through<00:02:50.120> three<00:02:50.719> layers<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.109> baffles<00:02:51.769> and

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
through three layers of baffles and

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.309 
through three layers of baffles and
you'll<00:02:52.129> get<00:02:52.459> three<00:02:52.819> rings<00:02:53.090> out<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.659> that

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
you'll get three rings out and that

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.989 
you'll get three rings out and that
makes<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.650> big<00:02:54.799> difference<00:02:54.859> in<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.489> sound<00:02:55.790> of

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:55.999 
makes a big difference in the sound of

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.699 
makes a big difference in the sound of
the<00:02:56.060> bike<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:56.780> I'll<00:02:56.930> go<00:02:57.109> ahead<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.379> start<00:02:57.560> it

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
the bike so I'll go ahead and start it

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:32.449 
the bike so I'll go ahead and start it
up<00:02:57.799> and<00:02:57.950> let<00:02:58.129> you<00:02:58.280> hear<00:02:58.489> it

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:05:34.969 

better<00:03:33.239> sound<00:03:33.659> than<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> stock<00:03:34.379> exhaust

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979
