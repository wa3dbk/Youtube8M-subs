here<00:01:52.010> is<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.810> simulator<00:01:53.810> where<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.410> actually

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
here is the simulator where you actually

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.530 
here is the simulator where you actually
build<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.190> kind<00:01:55.460> of<00:01:55.520> test<00:01:55.760> out<00:01:55.940> different<00:01:55.970> units

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
build a kind of test out different units

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.359 
build a kind of test out different units
and<00:01:56.690> play<00:01:56.810> with<00:01:56.930> them<00:01:57.110> we<00:01:57.770> have<00:01:57.890> kind<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.160> fun

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
and play with them we have kind of fun

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.710 
and play with them we have kind of fun
stuff<00:01:58.640> like<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:59.000> did<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.150> bridge<00:01:59.450> like<00:01:59.660> this

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
stuff like we did a bridge like this

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.900 
stuff like we did a bridge like this
crane<00:02:00.170> up<00:02:00.350> here<00:02:00.530> I'm<00:02:01.009> just<00:02:01.340> going<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.759> play

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.540 
you can then spend on your technology
which<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.380> pretty<00:02:21.560> big<00:02:21.770> departure<00:02:22.130> from

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
which is pretty big departure from

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.130 
which is pretty big departure from
anything<00:02:22.910> we've<00:02:23.239> done<00:02:23.270> previously<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:24.050> our

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
anything we've done previously in our

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.600 
anything we've done previously in our
games<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:25.340> now<00:02:25.520> rather<00:02:25.790> than<00:02:25.940> just<00:02:26.360> doling<00:02:26.660> out

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
games so now rather than just doling out

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.430 
games so now rather than just doling out
upgrades<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.030> spells<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.690> abilities<00:02:29.780> and

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
upgrades and spells and abilities and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.320 
upgrades and spells and abilities and
units<00:02:30.769> themselves<00:02:30.950> we're<00:02:31.760> going<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:31.970> give<00:02:32.120> you

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
units themselves we're going to give you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.180 
units themselves we're going to give you
the<00:02:32.360> power<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.870> choose<00:02:33.200> when<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:33.799> how<00:02:34.130> you

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
the power to choose when and how you

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.270 
the power to choose when and how you
want<00:02:34.549> to<00:02:34.640> buy<00:02:34.790> units<00:02:35.470> sainty<00:02:36.470> like<00:02:36.860> everything

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
want to buy units sainty like everything

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.460 
want to buy units sainty like everything
from<00:02:37.489> upgrades<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.720> marine<00:02:39.230> combat

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
from upgrades like the marine combat

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.310 
from upgrades like the marine combat
shield<00:02:39.950> or<00:02:40.459> things<00:02:41.360> like<00:02:41.450> style<00:02:41.840> cruisers

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
shield or things like style cruisers

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.949 
shield or things like style cruisers
which<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.830> can't<00:02:43.220> yet<00:02:43.430> afford<00:02:43.720> are<00:02:44.720> all

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
which I can't yet afford are all

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.610 
which I can't yet afford are all
available<00:02:45.140> for<00:02:45.560> purchases<00:02:46.280> but<00:02:47.269> since<00:02:48.110> I'm

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
available for purchases but since I'm

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.960 
available for purchases but since I'm
demonstrating<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:49.370> go<00:02:49.549> ahead<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.850> buy<00:02:49.940> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
demonstrating I go ahead and buy the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.580 
demonstrating I go ahead and buy the
high<00:02:50.239> time<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.870> we're<00:02:53.989> done<00:02:54.110> with<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:54.380> area

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
high time so we're done with this area

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.590 
high time so we're done with this area
where<00:02:54.799> you<00:02:54.830> go<00:02:55.010> back<00:02:55.160> up<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.519> bridge

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
where you go back up to the bridge

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.840 
where you go back up to the bridge
and<00:02:56.810> now<00:02:57.500> probably<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.220> most<00:02:58.340> important

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
and now probably the most important

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.820 
and now probably the most important
feature<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.270> bridge<00:02:59.450> itself<00:02:59.570> is<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.620> star

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
feature of the bridge itself is the star

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.210 
feature of the bridge itself is the star
map<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.870> that's<00:03:06.080> any<00:03:06.380> work<00:03:06.650> for<00:03:06.950> additional

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
map so that's any work for additional

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.280 
map so that's any work for additional
information

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
information

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.500 
information
so<00:03:09.950> just<00:03:10.189> likely<00:03:10.610> we're<00:03:10.790> empowering<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.299> as<00:03:11.480> a

so just likely we're empowering you as a

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.349 
so just likely we're empowering you as a
player<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:12.799> choose<00:03:13.189> which<00:03:13.579> technology<00:03:14.299> you

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
player to choose which technology you

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:15.970 
player to choose which technology you
want<00:03:14.599> to<00:03:14.870> decide<00:03:15.170> how<00:03:15.409> you<00:03:15.469> want<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:15.769> advance

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
want to decide how you want to advance

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.410 
want to decide how you want to advance

of these different planets and two

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.250 
of these different planets and two
different<00:03:22.849> missions<00:03:23.329> or<00:03:23.540> just<00:03:23.719> explore<00:03:24.079> them

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
different missions or just explore them

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.929 
different missions or just explore them
so<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.680> see<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.040> Hyperion<00:03:25.489> right<00:03:25.640> now<00:03:25.790> is

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.229 
it's really just information that isn't
necessary<00:03:51.829> for<00:03:52.040> missions<00:03:52.340> itself<00:03:52.730> but<00:03:52.970> really

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
necessary for missions itself but really

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.220 
necessary for missions itself but really
just<00:03:53.269> kind<00:03:53.659> of<00:03:53.720> gives<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.019> little<00:03:54.109> more
