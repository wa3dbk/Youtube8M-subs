and they end up jumping up to a 600
where<00:01:18.700> there's<00:01:18.909> nothing<00:01:19.390> really<00:01:19.630> in<00:01:19.869> between

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
where there's nothing really in between

that that tends to give you at least a
little<00:01:24.070> bit<00:01:24.220> more<00:01:24.369> usability<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.479> know

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
little bit more usability you know

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.179 
little bit more usability you know
starting<00:01:26.200> out<00:01:26.350> just<00:01:26.380> kind<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.799> get<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.010> feel

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
starting out just kind of get the feel

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.640 
starting out just kind of get the feel
for<00:01:27.220> things<00:01:27.580> so<00:01:27.880> one<00:01:28.540> major<00:01:28.990> improvement<00:01:29.229> on

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
for things so one major improvement on

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.289 
for things so one major improvement on
this<00:01:29.770> bike<00:01:30.070> aside<00:01:30.490> from<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.759> displacement

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
this bike aside from the displacement

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.999 
this bike aside from the displacement
improvement<00:01:31.750> would<00:01:32.110> be<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.470> fuel<00:01:32.680> injection

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
improvement would be the fuel injection

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.890 
improvement would be the fuel injection
that's<00:01:33.280> offered<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:34.090> fuel<00:01:34.360> injection<00:01:34.780> in

that's offered the fuel injection in

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.719 
that's offered the fuel injection in
itself<00:01:35.290> you'll<00:01:35.500> notice<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:35.979> about<00:01:36.250> eight

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
itself you'll notice that about eight

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.609 
itself you'll notice that about eight
and<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:36.939> half<00:01:36.970> thousand<00:01:37.600> rpms<00:01:38.049> this<00:01:38.409> thing

tremendous<00:02:57.000> we've<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.650> far<00:02:58.820> every<00:02:59.820> single

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
tremendous we've so far every single

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.520 
tremendous we've so far every single
unit<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.480> we've<00:03:00.690> gotten<00:03:01.050> in<00:03:01.200> for<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
unit that we've gotten in for the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.520 
unit that we've gotten in for the
miniature<00:03:01.830> 300<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.910> saw<00:03:03.240> probably<00:03:03.930> within<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
miniature 300 we saw probably within the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.260 
miniature 300 we saw probably within the
first<00:03:04.800> couple<00:03:04.980> days<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.490> even<00:03:05.580> have<00:03:05.790> them<00:03:06.000> here

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
first couple days we even have them here

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.510 
first couple days we even have them here
so<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:07.410> it's<00:03:07.709> just<00:03:07.770> taken<00:03:08.190> really<00:03:08.340> well<00:03:08.840> to
