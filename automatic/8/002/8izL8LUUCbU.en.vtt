00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.810
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah and the way 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.330
 He is the team that will be the place of America 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.500
 I Irassha' also serves as Yes soaring because it would have been, but your name and ugly fascinated to this 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.370
 I feel Kazuki 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:26.820
 Distance from the burned Tokyo 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.720
 Well, if you go with this foot, it will be 3 hours and 45 minutes and it will be 3 and a half hours are 4 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.380
 Ne 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:36.270
 Unlike failure prevention or something like that I would like to run faster 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:40.360
 There is also a difference in how tired Aso from the left and right after running is different 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.350
 Ah but what it would balance open it this is after all 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:49.800
 It is better to do it from the current stage and correct it 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 I think the approach to the sub-three-Yes please my best regards thank you 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.360
 Now, I will check from the side if you are large 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.830
 It is a firm conscious driving the movement of the upper half of the body 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.870
 However, because I have a weak awareness of crowning including abdominal muscles 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.790
 Energy is that we finally born in the upper body 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.790
 Hanshin has not been transmitted well 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.950
 Let's check from behind with boy next 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:28.820
 It is also influenced by the low awareness of return to the trunk below 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.820
 In other words , it does not seem to fit in Tanda 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.150
 Running is not stable because the speed of foot swinging is different from side to side 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.060
 Also let's fix So who Otoshi's 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.830
 It is up to one to hit 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:55.150
 After all it is 3 hours early 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:02:03.340
 Various arm swing do is amazing want even if moving is also not a change to open properly even 6 eat 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:05.350
 I'm also impressed with the price movement, but with the heart in mind the video delivery of both bodies is a tsunami around the pelvis 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.490
 Facility which matched field tool 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:13.540
 i something this late in the full marathon I'm that feeling 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:17.739
 There I will have that kind of Toka or have been'm from the school by foot becomes painful even 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.830
 There you'll Hey here is not firmly its power 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:25.370
 I'm going to use it with interest Jianji Temple or Hanshin 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:29.629
 Here only has a solid upper and lower It is a waste Nde no good to be firm 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.019
 I will do the basics of the training of the core training because I will check in a little below 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.019
 Because 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.409

 I won't miss doing it 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.800
 Great 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.760
 I 'm hungry 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.760
 I did one more time 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.070
 Yuttan 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.070
 Yes yes then go reverse 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.750
 One time to enter 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.350
 The 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.350
 Swamp 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.110
 Whoa 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.540
 Yes 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.620
 Let's turn to next 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.760
 Raise both feet please raise your feet 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.319
 Let me down 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.330
 It is weak at the end or down 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.090
 Caffe La yo 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:28.560
 Ancient and modern times when in this in is near the bottom of where clothes third here in my abs 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.560
 Yes let's do something 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.600
 This is a weakness 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.800
 For example , I do well in the athletic club of 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.870
 Yes 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.830
 As a dear edition eh Tsu put 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.130
 Yes 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.130
 Poi 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.250
 this 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.250
 After all, this is the goal 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.370
 The next step is up to the waist in Yes Yes your news 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.620
 This is weak 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.960
 I have never been weak 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.950
 Idiopathic pattern is 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.950
 Pop 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.420
 Will probably third place 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.840
 ok it's water 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.120
 Please sweat Raise foot in silver coins 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.120
 Are talking about talking about me I 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.740
 Come on 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:28.040
 I'm not good at my feet I'm only this I 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.730
 It is play , but practice of abs becomes wow sha 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.730
 Stand up from 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.940
 love 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:45.190
 Uda is running because I came 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:50.760
 Actually, learning is a great exercise for using abs , but I'm not using it. 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.760
 It's a wasteful let's just add 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.210
 About Pon sister 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:06.400
 Considerably firm to have sputum firm Sina's bill now 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:09.750
 After that, the left foot comes to the front of the knee is a little like the right so why not next 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.750
 Keep me alone 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:18.950
 I'm I a I'll Toka foot I move large Yo before and after 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:24.560
 Knee back only shake 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:28.010
 Pelvic matters Pelvic pre and post pelvic Kobe 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.330
 So maybe i think there is a difference with sleepy lightning 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.330
 In Yes Well what customers 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.000
 Different left painful place 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:42.280
 It was supposed to be weak know 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.280
 There is muscle power difference of this side 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:50.029
 Te Fe dictionary early value ear 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.029
 Let's reach yes 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.639
 It was a scary tape 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:59.199
 Now 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.199
 I'm sorry for the exercise 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.780
 It's amazing and the difference in the city is 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:08.550
 It's a great type 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.550
 Then let me go, yes 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:17.030
 Well, if the bar is bought, the form of the book will be improved 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.030
 First, from the side 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:28.249
 It can now be used properly Buppi 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:32.439
 Being aware of the trunk, the movement of the whole body is efficiently transformed into a driving force 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:32.439
 I think it is weight transfer from women of 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:37.369
 Next, let's check from the front and the back 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.800
 It has been transformed into an efficient run with less passing 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:53.069
 As I became able to be used conscious of the iliopsoas muscle, the swing of the foot is also improved considerably 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.069
 I will 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:03.939
 If you compare the form before and after the correction, you can see 4 machines well 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:09.020
 By awareness of the sea that want to be like the pair used successfully is up 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:15.190
 I side of the body or the upper half of the body is now Union smoothly 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.190
 I'm approaching an ideal form that can legally create momentum 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:29.630
 Finally, let's compare with the screen from the front and the back 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:34.670
 With the improvement of the difference in foot swing , the running became smooth and a sense of stability was born 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:39.340
 Mr. Today's lecture on how to get the correct form and extend the record 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.340
 Please use it for future training
