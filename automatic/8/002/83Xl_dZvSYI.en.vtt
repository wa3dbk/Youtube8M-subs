00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.990
 and that these people are very good as you are 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.540
 in a new video this time we are in 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.790
 chrome I will bring you a kind of 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.139
 trick a kind of mini tutorial of 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.940
 one thing that I have discovered and it has 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.860
 seemed super interesting and I wanted 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.320
 bring to the channel because it's something super 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.000
 cool and as you can see there is like 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.539
 they are making friendships between cows and 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.539
 creepers 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.199
 I believe that friends of all but guys 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.640
 let's look at the trick that I eat 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.320
 you 've seen that title it's about a 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.270
 super special thing one thing that in 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.760
 theory can not be done in the interface 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.400
 fly and this is the only way I repeat it 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.710
 that is, there is no way or anything 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.589
 it's a trick I just think this 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.300
 they will implement it in 1.9 because if 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.269
 not for this or I do not know 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.680
 surely that the 1.9 metan this 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.379
 position that will be a position for 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.059
 fly is worth and the character or is not the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.920
 graph has to be generated with commands 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.170
 now you see now let's start with the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.680
 tutorial and I think that they will 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.510
 put in yes no 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.070
 by the face does not have to be a 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.300
 Once we have cleaned a bit this I am going to 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.280
 teach what needs to be done to 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.259
 start we have to get the block of 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.880
 commands is worth it is this here what 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.680
 we put here and how you can get it 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.890
 Well, I have the command over here, it's worth 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.410
 that is bar lives space yours 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.840
 space name minecraft two points 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.030
 command with 2m is to remember if it is not going to 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.890
 leave to work blog is worth it once 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.090
 we have this as you see it gives us and the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.649
 game by where we created we can 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.360
 make a command house and we can 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.590
 make a command house but this one 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.620
 now let's do the tutorial we are going to 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.410
 throw this for nothing and nothing guys 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.050
 we put here the command command 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.220
 that will give us our character 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.450
 remind you that I am doing this or 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.100
 it's the first time I'm testing it 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.170
 I do not even have the idea that he's going to 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.580
 come out active electric or whatever I'm 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.710
 testing for the first time with you 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.120
 I have nothing copied what we put 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.020
 quite long and I will leave the command 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.330
 in the description if you want 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.120
 try it I recommend it is super cool and 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.590
 you're going to super well watching the tutorial 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.360
 from what I saw and I say to this there is 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.430
 try it and I will do the the command is 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.580
 all this and it's still quite long is 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.080
 leave the command link 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.700
 If you do not let me put it all in 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.500
 comments or in the description because 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.080
 it's very long but nothing guys we put the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.910
 button here and nothing are ready 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.400
 because we are going to start this to petar 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.080
 guys this is going to start this petar going 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.940
 a duty that will vary here I have 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.470
 seen a part of the video you already see 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.470
 you will see and 321 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.580
 what he is doing is generating the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.590
 character truth is being liando 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.080
 would be a part of you when I do the 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.420
 thing this is dwelling very much already because 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.920
 is going to Paris and goes and does like 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.680
 weird things and now I think it's going to 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.000
 disappear that to see if it disappears is worth 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.910
 Well, these guys want the guys 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.220
 the command and the kraft is done once 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.420
 here and once here what to do 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.280
 what you have to do, you have to make a 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.770
 kind of invocation in a kind of 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.110
 totem is worth we put the egg by 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.710
 here and we have to look to see where 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.740
 it was because we have to find a 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.350
 a rack of these armor that still 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.000
 it did not come out by the way but it was 1.8 not 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.950
 we play nothing or not without nothing files 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.110
 I have to investigate here is not 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.810
 we can here and then we take it and 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.200
 we make shift and click on it 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.849
 straight 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.730
 and there it is on the top 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.340
 remember a bit to remove this and now 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.500
 is this kind of 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.150
 rare thing to invoke as you see 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.090
 I heard the noise is how the noise is 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.040
 like a golem when you hit him 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.319
 anybody was this interesting 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.790
 fence and nothing what is this and what do you like 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.750
 do now guys, well, we have to 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.630
 I came here to catch five or one way 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.730
 less than five wheeler stars or 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.890
 it is that it is super weird because it seems 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.450
 a very but it is not 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.100
 for artists who double with a 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.819
 abbreviated work here is the star 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.850
 of wire cojemos 1 2 3 4 and 5 degrees 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.140
 we put here is already remove this 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.610
 we put it here and you have to throw them 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.800
 the truth is that over looks 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.390
 very much in some way like that of 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.760
 witches or magic it was worth it had to be 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.680
 invoke people and so on and nothing that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.900
 let's throw we throw one here 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.850
 As you can see there, it tells us that we have a 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.100
 of 5 and we are missing four plus two three 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.549
 four and get ready guys because I want 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.290
 now it 's 5 for the perfect one 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.970
 now it would be like you see now going to 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.100
 start spinning this in a super way 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.740
 crazy super cool and will start 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.300
 explore and destroy us the map of 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.770
 map does not destroy joke person 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.880
 will start to spin that is super cool 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.040
 as I said the truth that is done 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.630
 uncle uncle or at least have a 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.370
 dragon egg utility since I did not have 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.140
 nothing because at least now you can do 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.070
 something come tour tour tour tour 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.070
 more with a washing machine 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.030
 and as you see here gives us the position as 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.820
 you see here is 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.890
 that of the fly and he has given us the potion is 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.550
 and what will we do with this we put ourselves in 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.690
 game 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.670
 as from zero and we take it or whatever 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.020
 flying I do not know what is something super weird 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.020
 it's infinite 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.509
 how was it as he claimed 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.220
 and insurance and school guys 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.780
 because this is a little weird no no but 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.660
 I think I want to let me want 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.100
 fly that good guys should fly and 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.020
 girls, I've already discovered how 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.670
 It works, it does not have to be done 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.920
 basically it is to give you right click as 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.840
 you see now it's activated and now it's 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.310
 deactivated since we activate it and 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.530
 it's just as if we had 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.930
 invisible blocks a painted ladder 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.940
 so how about road here I have my bridge 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.430
 visible from the annoying snow because here 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.900
 nobody gets to hit me and that's it and if 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.820
 you want to make an idea home for 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.530
 example an aerial farm is super 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.980
 easy to build for all serve 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.430
 very much give me in mode 1 ok and we take 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.320
 what stands out in this same block 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.140
 ok to see we take it off and we can 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.730
 let's record from scratch and we can build by 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.340
 here or it is as if it were in blocks 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.740
 ok we can make our house pib or 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.390
 beat here I make my house several already 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.970
 it's super interesting it's super cool 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.770
 the truth is that super curious I believe or 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.480
 be I say, I believe that the truth is 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.460
 that exists here is for something 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.880
 it's worth now as under what I do not know is 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.560
 how to lower blocks down but that 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.730
 and you can investigate it because 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.040
 I really do not recommend that you try it 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.720
 it's super cool and basically it would be 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.460
 that's all I told you guys that if 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.620
 this is for something I do not think it's 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.600
 for nothing or for the 1.9 to the best 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.100
 is there for that that will be the use of 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.440
 dragon egg I think the best 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.720
 will be that to make you this mega potion 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.580
 of the play that the dragon egg requires 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.680
 and five star wild that the truth 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.020
 it is very powerful but it is quite 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.990
 That is, five wilder stars 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.920
 He's very still but nothing, guys, I hope 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.430
 that you liked it a lot 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.470
 tutorial when you take off 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.180
 and in fly you call you battles so 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.680
 you have to be very careful 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.720
 truth is that you will have to go down and 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.700
 look for somewhere with water because I 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.040
 true that is the life that I need is for 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.650
 that for example we come here we what 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.820
 we removed vale we stayed down 12 the 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.320
 true that this should change it 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.760
 because I do not know how you get off 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.500
 You yourselves can be yours 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.260
 investigate, you can do whatever you want 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.460
 for this command with this trick and nothing 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.650
 I hope you liked it very much that 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.690
 you know it has served like for a lot more 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.800
 tricks and a lot more curiosity to 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.810
 minecraft that the truth is that it is in 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.790
