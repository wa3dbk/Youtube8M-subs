you
so<00:01:20.040> let's<00:01:20.250> run<00:01:20.400> through<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.670> slow<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.420> there's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
so let's run through it slow so there's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.920 
so let's run through it slow so there's
that<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.439> want<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.070> practice<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.780> as<00:01:36.780> long

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
as you can use a metronome you know

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.580 
as you can use a metronome you know
start<00:01:39.180> off<00:01:39.270> at<00:01:39.479> maybe<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> hundred<00:01:40.079> beats<00:01:40.409> per

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
start off at maybe a hundred beats per

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
start off at maybe a hundred beats per
minute<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.040> work<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.369> way<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.670> up

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
minute and then work your way on up

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.999 
minute and then work your way on up
until<00:01:42.720> about<00:01:42.810> 200<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.590> you'll<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.770> able<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
until about 200 then you'll be able to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.600 
until about 200 then you'll be able to
play<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.250> fast<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.610> me<00:01:44.759> check<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> later
