00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
but if you can just have a look at the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.960 
but if you can just have a look at the
wire<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:34.739> probably<00:02:35.739> could<00:02:36.190> have<00:02:36.220> made<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.670> much

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
wire I probably could have made it much

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.289 
wire I probably could have made it much
more<00:02:37.000> compact<00:02:37.570> but<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:39.310> all<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.610> space<00:02:39.910> so

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
more compact but have all the space so

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.060 
more compact but have all the space so
why<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:40.870> that

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
why do that

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.790 
why do that
so<00:02:44.070> yeah<00:02:44.220> that's<00:02:44.400> about<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:45.080> fully<00:02:46.080> functional

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
so yeah that's about it fully functional

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.010
