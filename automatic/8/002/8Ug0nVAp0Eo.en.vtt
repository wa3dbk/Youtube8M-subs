00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
down also it's not exactly the easiest

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.200 
down also it's not exactly the easiest
to<00:00:50.239> do<00:00:50.420> but<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:50.899> can<00:00:50.930> do<00:00:51.350> it<00:00:51.380> so<00:00:52.160> like<00:00:52.730> that<00:00:52.970> and

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
to do but you can do it so like that and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.190 
to do but you can do it so like that and
then<00:00:53.480> there<00:00:53.750> we<00:00:53.840> go

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
then there we go

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.900 
then there we go
