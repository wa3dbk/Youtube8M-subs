and<00:00:00.630> I'm<00:00:01.500> seeing<00:00:02.040> I'm<00:00:02.639> seeing<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:03.030> coat<00:00:03.240> from

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
and I'm seeing I'm seeing a coat from

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.690 
and I'm seeing I'm seeing a coat from
here<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.780> here<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.620> I'm<00:00:04.740> thinking<00:00:04.980> we'll<00:00:05.549> do

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
here to here and I'm thinking we'll do

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.980 
here to here and I'm thinking we'll do
it<00:00:05.730> around<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> face<00:00:06.240> but<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.569> think<00:00:06.779> we<00:00:06.870> might

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
it around the face but I think we might

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.140 
it around the face but I think we might
want<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.259> do<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.560> whole<00:00:07.799> top<00:00:08.069> pilots<00:00:08.580> little

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
want to do that whole top pilots little

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
teeny one's full keep bowl a little bit

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.049 
teeny one's full keep bowl a little bit
all<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.599> way<00:00:12.690> through<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.929> top<00:00:13.820> it's<00:00:14.820> just

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
all the way through the top it's just

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.689 
all the way through the top it's just
because<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.960> some<00:00:15.990> more<00:00:16.289> oils<00:00:16.710> okay<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
because we do some more oils okay and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.310 
because we do some more oils okay and
then<00:00:17.789> we're<00:00:17.970> going<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> foil<00:00:18.449> her<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.050> think

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
then we're going to foil her and I think

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.720 
then we're going to foil her and I think
we're<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> pull<00:00:20.100> up<00:00:20.189> her<00:00:20.340> crazy<00:00:20.609> i

debate<00:00:38.640> we've<00:00:38.940> learned<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.239> lot<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.629> one

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
debate we've learned a lot of that one

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.770 
debate we've learned a lot of that one
ok<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.000> want<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.690> i'm

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
ok so that's what want to do so i'm

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
thinking i'm going to do just around the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.150 
thinking i'm going to do just around the
front<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.270> front<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.989> let<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.890> big

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
front and in this front and let it big

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.010 
front and in this front and let it big
and<00:00:47.460> i'm<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.149> more<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.420> my<00:00:48.510> honey<00:00:48.780> on

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you're not going to see this much that's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.709 
you're not going to see this much that's
why<00:00:53.579> i<00:00:53.610> say<00:00:53.789> let's<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.149> little<00:00:54.300> bit<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
why i say let's to little bit more to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.240 
why i say let's to little bit more to
the<00:00:54.750> top<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.489> her<00:00:56.850> formula<00:00:57.739> here<00:00:58.739> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the top so there is her formula here so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250 
the top so there is her formula here so
i<00:00:59.309> want<00:00:59.550> some<00:00:59.730> people<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.239> take<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> polls<00:01:01.079> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
i want some people to take the polls I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.609 
i want some people to take the polls I
want<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> mix<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.460> true<00:01:02.910> integrity

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
want you to mix up the true integrity

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.080 
want you to mix up the true integrity
we've<00:01:04.619> got<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> color<00:01:05.159> back<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
we've got the color back there in the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.320 
we've got the color back there in the
bowls<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:07.110> mixed<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:08.070> had<00:01:08.280> German<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.970> her

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
bowls it's mixed up we had German on her

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.210 
bowls it's mixed up we had German on her
roots<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.810> based<00:01:10.049> off<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.409> 10<00:01:10.680> volume

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
roots it's based off the 10 volume

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.590 
roots it's based off the 10 volume
routing<00:01:11.880> table<00:01:12.210> right<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.830> 21<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.700> piece<00:01:15.390> of

25<00:01:16.259> volume<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.799> her<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.159> start<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.520> 10

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
25 volume on her so we start with 10

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.179 
25 volume on her so we start with 10
sheets<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> three<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> half<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.100> we're

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
sheets of three and a half and we're

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.550 
sheets of three and a half and we're
going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.670> 6<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.530> 10<00:01:23.150> 20<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.409> four<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
going to a 6 so it's 10 20 is four and a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:36.160 
going to a 6 so it's 10 20 is four and a
half<00:01:28.009> 30<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.340> five<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.970> half<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.759> want<00:01:33.950> 35

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
half 30 is five and a half so we want 35

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.510 
half 30 is five and a half so we want 35
yes<00:01:37.520> see<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.820> had<00:01:39.030> 25<00:01:40.340> because<00:01:41.340> we

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
yes see when we had 25 because we

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
yes see when we had 25 because we
started<00:01:41.909> with<00:01:42.030> 20<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.890> understand<00:01:44.280> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
started with 20 you understand that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.300 
started with 20 you understand that
those<00:01:44.790> colors<00:01:45.240> are<00:01:45.420> starting<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:45.960> 21<00:01:46.619> true

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
those colors are starting at 21 true

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.179 
those colors are starting at 21 true
integrity<00:01:47.610> starts<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.270> ten<00:01:48.570> volume<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> we

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
integrity starts at ten volume so we

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.800
