00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
four hours what's so funny oh nothing

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.490 
four hours what's so funny oh nothing
it's<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.629> terrified<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.260> flying

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it's just that I'm terrified of flying

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.470 
it's just that I'm terrified of flying
and<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.950> tend<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> laugh<00:00:41.489> when<00:00:41.760> I'm<00:00:41.910> nervous

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.740 

I<00:00:49.070> take<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.190> flying<00:00:50.399> doesn't<00:00:50.789> scare<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.180> no<00:00:51.510> no

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
I take it flying doesn't scare you no no

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660 
I take it flying doesn't scare you no no
I<00:00:51.780> actually<00:00:52.079> think<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> safest

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
I actually think that it's the safest

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.279 
I actually think that it's the safest
way<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.879> travel<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.629> example<00:00:54.960> you're<00:00:55.079> much

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
way to travel for example you're much

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.010 
way to travel for example you're much
more<00:00:55.440> likely<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.860> die<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.160> car<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.090> guess

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
more likely to die in a car so I guess

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.500 
more likely to die in a car so I guess
so<00:00:58.309> set<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.730> car<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.120> can't<00:01:00.359> get

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
so set that in a car you can't get

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.479 
so set that in a car you can't get
sucked<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> fall<00:01:01.350> 35,000<00:01:02.190> feet<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> your

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
sucked out and fall 35,000 feet to your

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.990 
sucked out and fall 35,000 feet to your
death<00:01:02.550> he<00:01:03.149> felt<00:01:03.420> happy<00:01:04.460> yeah<00:01:05.659> not<00:01:06.659> gonna<00:01:06.869> sir
