and<00:03:52.640> that's<00:03:53.640> an<00:03:53.820> interesting<00:03:54.209> question

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
and that's an interesting question

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.960 
and that's an interesting question
because<00:03:54.660> i<00:03:55.260> did<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> video<00:03:55.739> while<00:03:56.220> back<00:03:56.580> and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
because i did a video while back and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.840 
because i did a video while back and
it's<00:03:57.780> actually<00:03:58.230> getting<00:03:59.040> kind<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.400> old<00:03:59.549> now

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
it's actually getting kind of old now

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.310 
it's actually getting kind of old now
and<00:03:59.880> probably<00:04:00.239> need<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.540> update<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.870> video

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
and probably need to update that video

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.870 
and probably need to update that video
and<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:01.860> we'll<00:04:02.010> just<00:04:02.040> kind<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.370> cover<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.670> here

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
and so we'll just kind of cover it here

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.100 
and so we'll just kind of cover it here

figs and all of them but one are in here

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.620 
figs and all of them but one are in here
do<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.180> remember<00:04:15.390> which<00:04:15.570> ones<00:04:15.840> missing<00:04:16.579> it<00:04:17.630> is

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
do you remember which ones missing it is

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.020 
do you remember which ones missing it is
Benny<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.650> spaceman<00:04:20.190> he's<00:04:20.459> not<00:04:20.609> in<00:04:20.760> here<00:04:20.970> I

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
Benny the spaceman he's not in here I

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.350 
Benny the spaceman he's not in here I
took<00:04:21.150> him<00:04:21.450> out<00:04:21.630> for<00:04:21.660> whatever<00:04:22.229> reason<00:04:22.770> and

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
took him out for whatever reason and

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.730 
took him out for whatever reason and
haven't<00:04:24.360> put<00:04:24.510> them<00:04:24.599> back<00:04:24.720> in

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
haven't put them back in

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.760 
haven't put them back in
but<00:04:26.310> we<00:04:26.520> got<00:04:26.729> this<00:04:27.630> was<00:04:27.840> number<00:04:28.139> one<00:04:28.380> so<00:04:28.680> it

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
but we got this was number one so it

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.620 
but we got this was number one so it
went<00:04:28.949> 1<00:04:29.190> through<00:04:29.460> 15<00:04:29.910> when<00:04:30.120> i<00:04:30.180> did<00:04:30.389> it<00:04:30.509> i<00:04:30.569> think

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
went 1 through 15 when i did it i think

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.960 
went 1 through 15 when i did it i think
i<00:04:30.810> started<00:04:31.139> at<00:04:31.259> 15<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.949> went<00:04:32.310> all<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.669> way<00:04:32.699> up

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
i started at 15 and went all the way up

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.610 
i started at 15 and went all the way up
to<00:04:33.000> 1<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:34.460> if<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.880> thought<00:04:36.419> for<00:04:36.720> this<00:04:37.139> question

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
to 1 and if I thought for this question

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.379 
to 1 and if I thought for this question
so<00:04:37.650> all<00:04:37.949> I<00:04:37.979> got<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.310> do<00:04:38.430> here<00:04:38.699> is<00:04:38.880> look<00:04:39.120> at<00:04:39.210> this

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
so all I got to do here is look at this

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.469 
so all I got to do here is look at this
and<00:04:39.690> find<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.199> first<00:04:40.440> one<00:04:40.740> that's<00:04:41.009> a

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
and find the first one that's a

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.260 
and find the first one that's a
character<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:44.910> know<00:04:45.000> that's<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
character and you know that's the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.540 
character and you know that's the
generic<00:04:45.810> that's<00:04:46.440> pretty<00:04:46.740> much<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.919> generic

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
generic that's pretty much a generic

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.629 
generic that's pretty much a generic
that's<00:04:48.000> a<00:04:48.180> generic<00:04:48.720> that's<00:04:49.289> pepper<00:04:49.800> but<00:04:50.550> he's

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
that's a generic that's pepper but he's

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.540 
that's a generic that's pepper but he's
not<00:04:50.669> really<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.660> real<00:04:52.020> person<00:04:52.289> but<00:04:52.889> I<00:04:53.130> guess

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
not really a real person but I guess

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.279 
not really a real person but I guess
that<00:04:53.789> would<00:04:53.940> be<00:04:54.000> technically<00:04:54.539> the<00:04:54.870> answer<00:04:55.169> to

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
that would be technically the answer to

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.439 
that would be technically the answer to
the<00:04:55.380> question<00:04:55.530> would<00:04:55.889> be<00:04:55.949> pepper<00:04:56.400> then<00:04:57.210> we<00:04:57.300> got

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
the question would be pepper then we got

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.890 
the question would be pepper then we got
the<00:04:57.569> brick<00:04:57.810> stir<00:04:58.340> he's<00:04:59.340> a<00:04:59.370> character<00:04:59.900> generic

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
the brick stir he's a character generic

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.439 
the brick stir he's a character generic
a<00:05:01.199> rare<00:05:02.009> rare<00:05:02.849> one<00:05:03.120> there<00:05:04.699> Abraham<00:05:05.699> Lincoln

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
a rare rare one there Abraham Lincoln

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.390 
a rare rare one there Abraham Lincoln
that's<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.930> first<00:05:07.139> one<00:05:07.349> based<00:05:07.530> off<00:05:07.740> of<00:05:07.770> a<00:05:08.039> real

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
that's the first one based off of a real

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.320 
that's the first one based off of a real
person<00:05:09.110> so<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.470> then<00:05:11.130> these<00:05:12.000> are<00:05:12.210> all

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
person so and then these are all

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.540 
person so and then these are all
generics<00:05:12.960> all<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.830> way<00:05:13.919> with<00:05:14.099> and<00:05:14.340> all<00:05:14.400> the

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
generics all the way with and all the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.490 
generics all the way with and all the
rest<00:05:14.699> of<00:05:14.909> them<00:05:14.970> our<00:05:15.300> genetics<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.900> then<00:05:15.990> Benny

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
rest of them our genetics and then Benny

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.279 
rest of them our genetics and then Benny
would<00:05:16.710> have<00:05:16.800> been<00:05:16.919> there<00:05:17.360> but<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.720> lot<00:05:19.259> of

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
would have been there but a lot of

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.620 
would have been there but a lot of
things<00:05:19.500> have<00:05:19.740> changed<00:05:19.770> since<00:05:20.250> then<00:05:20.789> and<00:05:21.120> I'm

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
things have changed since then and I'm

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.339 
things have changed since then and I'm
thinking<00:05:22.940> Carl<00:05:23.940> definitely<00:05:24.720> needs<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:25.080> place

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
thinking Carl definitely needs a place

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.850 
thinking Carl definitely needs a place
in<00:05:25.680> my<00:05:26.340> favorite<00:05:26.759> figs<00:05:27.169> so<00:05:28.169> I<00:05:28.199> need<00:05:28.560> to<00:05:28.680> figure

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
in my favorite figs so I need to figure

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.790 
in my favorite figs so I need to figure
this<00:05:29.310> out<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:29.789> I<00:05:29.820> might<00:05:30.000> need<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.449> change

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
this out and I might need to change

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.350 
this out and I might need to change
things<00:05:31.800> I'm<00:05:32.159> holding<00:05:32.460> him<00:05:32.550> backwards<00:05:32.940> sorry

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
things I'm holding him backwards sorry

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.640 
things I'm holding him backwards sorry
i'm<00:05:33.449> looking<00:05:33.750> through<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.020> viewfinder<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:34.560> i

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
i'm looking through the viewfinder and i

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.709 
i'm looking through the viewfinder and i
just<00:05:34.830> realized<00:05:35.099> that<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:37.580> so<00:05:38.580> Carl<00:05:38.909> I<00:05:39.240> think

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
just realized that and so Carl I think

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:46.129 
just realized that and so Carl I think
is<00:05:40.219> worthy<00:05:41.219> of<00:05:41.400> a<00:05:41.699> place<00:05:41.969> in<00:05:42.270> my<00:05:42.389> top<00:05:42.630> 15<00:05:43.229> and<00:05:45.139> to

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
is worthy of a place in my top 15 and to

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.339 
is worthy of a place in my top 15 and to
be<00:05:46.259> honest<00:05:46.680> i<00:05:47.009> think<00:05:47.789> i<00:05:47.940> would<00:05:48.090> put<00:05:48.449> Carl<00:05:48.810> ahead

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
be honest i think i would put Carl ahead

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.300 
be honest i think i would put Carl ahead
of<00:05:49.560> Abraham<00:05:50.009> Lincoln<00:05:50.460> so<00:05:51.349> I<00:05:52.349> know<00:05:52.800> Abraham<00:05:52.979> is

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
of Abraham Lincoln so I know Abraham is

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.240 
of Abraham Lincoln so I know Abraham is
dead<00:05:53.520> but<00:05:53.880> he<00:05:54.780> still<00:05:54.990> was<00:05:55.199> a<00:05:55.229> real<00:05:55.409> person<00:05:55.590> so<00:05:56.069> I

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
dead but he still was a real person so I

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.070 
dead but he still was a real person so I
think<00:05:56.520> in<00:05:56.880> Carl<00:05:57.180> would<00:05:57.599> rank<00:05:57.780> higher<00:05:58.050> than

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
think in Carl would rank higher than

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.260 
think in Carl would rank higher than
Abraham<00:05:58.530> Lincoln<00:05:59.159> and<00:05:59.310> that<00:05:59.909> would<00:06:00.090> pretty

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
Abraham Lincoln and that would pretty

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.439 
Abraham Lincoln and that would pretty
much<00:06:00.389> put<00:06:00.810> him<00:06:01.050> as<00:06:01.229> my<00:06:01.560> favorite<00:06:02.069> fig<00:06:02.550> based<00:06:03.180> on

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
much put him as my favorite fig based on

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.920 
much put him as my favorite fig based on
a<00:06:03.479> real<00:06:04.139> person<00:06:04.169> and<00:06:05.090> then<00:06:06.090> pepper<00:06:06.479> would<00:06:06.810> be

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
a real person and then pepper would be

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.249 
a real person and then pepper would be
my<00:06:07.110> favorite<00:06:07.289> fig<00:06:07.740> based<00:06:08.130> on<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.430> lego

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
my favorite fig based on a lego

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.559 
my favorite fig based on a lego
character<00:06:10.259> and<00:06:10.860> it's<00:06:11.849> funny<00:06:12.060> I<00:06:12.180> don't<00:06:12.240> have

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
character and it's funny I don't have

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.140 
character and it's funny I don't have
any<00:06:13.199> that<00:06:13.560> are<00:06:13.680> based<00:06:13.919> on<00:06:14.219> other<00:06:14.610> movie

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
question Rick wizard if it'd been a Star

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.439 
question Rick wizard if it'd been a Star
Wars<00:06:24.960> character<00:06:25.020> like<00:06:25.650> Han<00:06:25.860> Solo<00:06:25.889> or<00:06:26.280> r2<00:06:26.940> d2<00:06:27.419> or

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
Wars character like Han Solo or r2 d2 or

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.480 
Wars character like Han Solo or r2 d2 or
something<00:06:27.900> like<00:06:27.990> that<00:06:28.050> I<00:06:28.469> don't<00:06:29.280> even<00:06:29.370> have

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
something like that I don't even have

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.899 
something like that I don't even have
any<00:06:29.699> of<00:06:29.819> those<00:06:29.909> in<00:06:30.120> here<00:06:31.219> and<00:06:32.219> i<00:06:32.310> think<00:06:32.550> i<00:06:32.699> am

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
any of those in here and i think i am

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.879 
any of those in here and i think i am
actually<00:06:33.210> when<00:06:33.599> i<00:06:33.630> did<00:06:33.990> this<00:06:34.229> i<00:06:34.529> may<00:06:34.740> have

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
actually when i did this i may have

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.890 
actually when i did this i may have
intentionally<00:06:35.520> not<00:06:35.760> included<00:06:36.330> anything<00:06:36.719> from

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
intentionally not included anything from

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.760 
intentionally not included anything from
the<00:06:37.080> collectible<00:06:37.729> minifigure<00:06:38.729> round

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
the collectible minifigure round

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.290 
the collectible minifigure round
because<00:06:40.770> another<00:06:41.220> one<00:06:41.430> that<00:06:41.580> would<00:06:41.700> rank<00:06:42.060> up

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
because another one that would rank up

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.510 
because another one that would rank up
here<00:06:42.600> would<00:06:42.840> be<00:06:42.870> the<00:06:44.150> nacho<00:06:45.150> libre<00:06:45.630> character

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
here would be the nacho libre character

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.030 
here would be the nacho libre character
which<00:06:47.520> is<00:06:48.150> not<00:06:48.390> really<00:06:48.420> an<00:06:49.050> officially<00:06:49.680> nacho

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
which is not really an officially nacho

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.890 
which is not really an officially nacho
libre<00:06:50.400> but<00:06:50.580> it's<00:06:50.700> the<00:06:50.820> wrestler<00:06:51.180> from<00:06:51.210> Syrians

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
libre but it's the wrestler from Syrians

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.060 
libre but it's the wrestler from Syrians
one<00:06:52.380> or<00:06:52.830> two<00:06:53.040> I<00:06:53.310> think<00:06:53.670> series<00:06:53.970> one<00:06:54.180> so<00:06:55.070> that's

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
one or two I think series one so that's

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.650 
one or two I think series one so that's
a<00:06:56.160> good<00:06:56.310> question<00:06:56.490> and<00:06:56.880> I<00:06:56.970> think<00:06:57.000> what<00:06:57.570> I'm

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
a good question and I think what I'm

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.570 
a good question and I think what I'm
going<00:06:57.810> to<00:06:57.840> do<00:06:57.990> is<00:06:58.230> I'm<00:06:58.380> going<00:06:58.530> to<00:06:58.590> redo<00:06:59.040> my<00:06:59.070> top

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
going to do is I'm going to redo my top

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.300 
going to do is I'm going to redo my top
15<00:07:00.240> and<00:07:00.600> I<00:07:01.050> need<00:07:01.200> to<00:07:01.290> get<00:07:01.410> nacho<00:07:01.800> libre<00:07:02.160> in

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
15 and I need to get nacho libre in

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.470 
15 and I need to get nacho libre in
there<00:07:02.490> because<00:07:02.700> i<00:07:02.850> think<00:07:02.910> when<00:07:03.180> i<00:07:03.210> did<00:07:03.450> that

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
there because i think when i did that

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.270 
there because i think when i did that
out<00:07:03.750> really<00:07:04.290> didn't<00:07:04.440> want<00:07:04.560> to<00:07:04.620> do<00:07:04.710> collectible

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
out really didn't want to do collectible

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.490 
out really didn't want to do collectible
