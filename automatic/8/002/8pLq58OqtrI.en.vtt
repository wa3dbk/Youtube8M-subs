00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:39.639 
get a little tough like it's okay
I<00:04:37.569> think<00:04:38.569> they<00:04:38.719> see<00:04:38.779> that<00:04:39.109> we<00:04:39.199> really<00:04:39.229> care

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:39.649 
I think they see that we really care

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:41.829 
I think they see that we really care
because<00:04:40.339> we<00:04:40.639> do<00:04:40.849> you<00:04:41.209> know<00:04:41.329> we<00:04:41.479> do<00:04:41.659> this

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:41.839 
because we do you know we do this

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:44.879 
because we do you know we do this
because<00:04:42.019> we<00:04:42.199> really<00:04:42.559> do<00:04:42.859> care<00:04:43.129> this<00:04:43.819> program

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
because we really do care this program

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.999 
because we really do care this program
gives<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.609> opportunity<00:04:46.909> to<00:04:47.629> really<00:04:48.079> step

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
gives the opportunity to really step

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.649 
gives the opportunity to really step
into<00:04:49.219> people's<00:04:49.669> lives<00:04:49.969> and<00:04:50.239> make<00:04:50.299> a

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
into people's lives and make a

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.999 
into people's lives and make a
difference<00:04:51.849> in<00:04:52.849> a<00:04:52.969> really<00:04:53.239> fundamental<00:04:53.809> way

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
difference in a really fundamental way

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.299 
difference in a really fundamental way
and<00:04:55.009> teaches<00:04:55.399> a<00:04:55.429> lot<00:04:55.819> of<00:04:56.029> first-time<00:04:56.509> moms

00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:57.309 
and teaches a lot of first-time moms

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:01.179 
and teaches a lot of first-time moms
what<00:04:58.309> being<00:04:58.849> a<00:04:58.969> mom<00:04:59.179> is<00:04:59.419> all<00:04:59.539> about<00:05:00.189> nurse

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
what being a mom is all about nurse

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.719 
what being a mom is all about nurse
Family<00:05:01.519> Partnership<00:05:02.919> it's<00:05:03.919> like<00:05:04.129> something

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
Family Partnership it's like something

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.849 
Family Partnership it's like something
out<00:05:04.969> of<00:05:04.999> the<00:05:05.179> future<00:05:05.569> it<00:05:06.259> really<00:05:06.529> is<00:05:06.679> I<00:05:06.829> think

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:06.859 
out of the future it really is I think

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:09.549 
out of the future it really is I think
it's<00:05:07.219> before<00:05:07.519> it's<00:05:07.879> time<00:05:08.089> I<00:05:08.119> know<00:05:08.419> it<00:05:08.659> is<00:05:08.809> this

00:05:09.549 --> 00:05:09.559 
it's before it's time I know it is this

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.039 
it's before it's time I know it is this
program<00:05:09.799> is<00:05:10.099> like<00:05:10.129> a<00:05:10.249> bridge<00:05:10.609> to<00:05:10.939> me<00:05:11.119> between

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:12.049 
program is like a bridge to me between

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:15.599 
program is like a bridge to me between
teen<00:05:13.009> pregnancy<00:05:13.639> or<00:05:14.059> early<00:05:14.539> pregnancy<00:05:15.109> and

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:19.459 
self-sufficiency you actually get to go

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:22.659 
self-sufficiency you actually get to go
into<00:05:19.669> the<00:05:20.059> stranger's<00:05:20.809> home<00:05:21.679> and<00:05:22.159> build<00:05:22.459> this
