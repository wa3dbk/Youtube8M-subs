 hello youtube friends 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.559
 this time I come to teach you how 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:14.330
 put habitats in the air only 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.610
 with the session and of iu on facebook and of 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.250
 for that we are going to need 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.520
 to download 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.760
 the coordinates we download from this 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.940
 green which I will leave in the 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.530
 description 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.710
 we are also going to open the link of the multi 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.710
 hack 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.330
 we 're going to our dragon city game 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.260
 to get our data session and from 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.260
 Facebook 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.330
 we click here and see the source of 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.890
 framework 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.890
 as you see here is looking 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:19.630
 we copy our 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.630
 I observed and from and here is the session and d 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.480
 here is to download the map of the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.130
 dragon coordinates if we give in 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.170
 to download 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.650
 and here in free download 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.660
 we wait 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.660
 and appeared here to the releases 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.590
 here it is and multi here 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:56.360
 here I download it we give extract here 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.360
 as you see here is the map 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.820
 now 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.820
 let's copy the data here 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.690
 missing the section and d 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.360
 and we paste 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.360
 and opened migrated dragon city 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.480
 and I have put some things in the air 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.980
 with the previous 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.590
 I play things 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.890
 del charles and its complement this time what 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:42.000
 I'm going to put some habitats here 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.580
 so they can see how it's done 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.170
 once we put the data we give here 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.170
 get the information 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.890
 as you see here, all my information appears 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.890
 we wait a few seconds for it to finish 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:06.950
 and we look here in and I have a map 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.160
 the inhabitants that we have 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.760
 to be able to move it 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:19.599
 I'm going to move the stadium this time 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:23.170
 I will not move seeing the map here 858 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.500
 on the left side that is x and 5 on the side 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.020
 right that is 10 85 we put it 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.560
 here 8 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:36.770
 and 5 and we only give in moving 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.230
 As you can see, I have completed 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.660
 We accept and we wait here for the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.240
 seconds to finish 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.970
 meanwhile we are going to choose another the 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.040
 which one are we going to move 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.510
 let's move 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.510
 Habitat is legendary 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.200
 we see the map we are going to put you here 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.350
 15.5 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.950
 place here is already chosen from the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.390
 sight only we are missing 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.750
 coordinates 15 and 5 and we give you the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.750
 move 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.680
 we choose another 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.080
 a pure habitat 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.960
 we have the map 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.960
 and we choose 25 and 5 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.289
 25 and 5 and we only give in moving 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.689
 we always do the same procedure 

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:46.790
 let's move another habitat 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.480
 what you can do 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:56.700
 the dwelling bligh 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.700
 the light view and we choose the 35 5 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.720
 35 and 5 and we give in moving 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:15.560
 now we only need to restart 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.560
 our dragon city to see the changes 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.200
 as you see here, they appear 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:49.680
 things in the air 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.860
 and they can continue putting according to 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.860
 coordinates 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.710
 who are here 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.710
 go putting it one on one 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.639
 and in friends this would be all 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.550
 in the next video I'm going to show you 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:13.330
 how to train 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.330
 until dragons from level 1 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.740
 a legendary skill with a 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.860
 skill of a legendary
