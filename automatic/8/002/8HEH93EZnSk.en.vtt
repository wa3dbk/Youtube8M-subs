00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
a orange little pedometer we call that a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.310 
a orange little pedometer we call that a
little<00:00:47.370> bracelet<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:48.120> feet<00:00:48.479> and<00:00:48.629> every

time they come into milk they're

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.090 
time they come into milk they're
recorded<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.809> tell<00:00:52.019> how<00:00:52.710> many<00:00:52.769> pounds

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
recorded so we can tell how many pounds

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.459 
recorded so we can tell how many pounds
of<00:00:53.369> milk<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.239> how<00:00:54.809> many<00:00:55.019> steps

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
of milk that they have how many steps

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.410 
of milk that they have how many steps
the<00:00:55.710> cow<00:00:55.860> takes<00:00:56.250> throughout<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.820> day<00:00:56.969> and

the cow takes throughout the day and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420 
the cow takes throughout the day and
that<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.780> recorded<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> computer<00:00:59.070> system

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that is recorded in the computer system

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.240 
that is recorded in the computer system
that's<00:00:59.549> important<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.359> us<00:01:00.769> because<00:01:01.769> then<00:01:02.129> we

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
that's important for us because then we

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.479 
that's important for us because then we
can<00:01:02.460> tell<00:01:03.140> when<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.379> cow<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.860> ready<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.399> be

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
can tell when that cow is ready to be

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.050 
can tell when that cow is ready to be
bred<00:01:06.409> my<00:01:07.409> technician<00:01:07.950> finds<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.429> cows<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.940> me

will make a lot of milk because they're

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.250 
will make a lot of milk because they're
more<00:01:48.780> comfortable<00:01:49.110> with<00:01:49.770> their<00:01:49.979> surroundings

here we've got hay lid the goal of this
mix<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.570> ultimately<00:02:16.410> make<00:02:16.680> milk<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.340> we

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
mix is to ultimately make milk so we

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.370 
mix is to ultimately make milk so we
