this<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.120> not<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.299> large<00:02:56.599> number<00:02:56.720> at<00:02:57.349> all<00:02:57.560> but

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
this is not a large number at all but

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.430 
this is not a large number at all but
let's<00:02:58.489> create<00:02:58.760> another<00:02:58.970> operator<00:02:59.750> triple

for example 3 triple arrow three would

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.470 
for example 3 triple arrow three would

seven trillion hi just think about what

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.110 
seven trillion hi just think about what
it<00:03:33.739> would<00:03:33.950> be<00:03:34.069> like<00:03:34.099> to<00:03:34.549> work<00:03:34.579> our<00:03:34.940> way<00:03:34.970> down

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
it would be like to work our way down

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.680 
it would be like to work our way down
from<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.720> top<00:03:35.930> starting<00:03:36.709> with<00:03:36.919> 3<00:03:37.190> ^<00:03:37.370> 3<00:03:38.150> we<00:03:38.510> got

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
from the top starting with 3 ^ 3 we got

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.620 
from the top starting with 3 ^ 3 we got
27<00:03:39.470> then<00:03:39.919> we<00:03:40.130> have<00:03:40.280> 3<00:03:40.609> to<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.849> power<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.150> 27

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
27 then we have 3 to the power of 27

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.650 
27 then we have 3 to the power of 27
which<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.349> 7<00:03:42.799> trillion<00:03:43.250> then<00:03:43.730> we<00:03:43.940> have<00:03:44.150> 3<00:03:44.480> to

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
which is 7 trillion then we have 3 to

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.379 
which is 7 trillion then we have 3 to

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
the power of 7 trillion and then we have

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.900 
the power of 7 trillion and then we have
3<00:03:47.780> raised<00:03:48.169> to<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.380> power<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.739> 3<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.609> the<00:03:49.730> power

3 raised to the power of 3 to the power

imagined infinity to be very large but I

didn't know it was that large even three
triple<00:06:38.180> arrow<00:06:38.360> three<00:06:38.839> was<00:06:39.139> bigger<00:06:39.469> than<00:06:39.710> my

sense of infinity and once I got to g2

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:44.739 
sense of infinity and once I got to g2
just<00:06:43.099> thinking<00:06:43.610> of<00:06:43.699> how<00:06:43.819> monstrous<00:06:44.240> that

just thinking of how monstrous that
number<00:06:45.139> must<00:06:45.319> be<00:06:45.439> with<00:06:45.949> so<00:06:46.309> many<00:06:46.520> arrows<00:06:46.879> was

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
number must be with so many arrows was

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:50.709 
number must be with so many arrows was
just<00:06:47.869> overwhelming<00:06:48.770> Graham's<00:06:49.580> number<00:06:49.729> is<00:06:50.270> so

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
just overwhelming Graham's number is so

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:53.649 
just overwhelming Graham's number is so
far<00:06:51.169> beyond<00:06:51.619> anything<00:06:51.889> in<00:06:52.520> our<00:06:52.669> reality<00:06:53.029> even

far beyond anything in our reality even

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.079 
far beyond anything in our reality even
the<00:06:53.930> infinitesimal<00:06:54.589> portions<00:06:55.399> of<00:06:55.580> it<00:06:55.729> that<00:06:55.909> we

the infinitesimal portions of it that we

the infinitesimal portions of it that we
can<00:06:56.419> understand<00:06:57.199> are<00:06:57.469> horrifying<00:06:58.339> like

can understand are horrifying like

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:00.429 
can understand are horrifying like

catching a glimpse of something that

with our world its enormity overtakes us

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.739 
with our world its enormity overtakes us
reducing<00:07:07.249> everything<00:07:07.819> that<00:07:07.969> exists<00:07:08.539> and

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:08.749 
reducing everything that exists and

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:11.409 
reducing everything that exists and
anything<00:07:09.439> we<00:07:09.589> could<00:07:09.770> imagine<00:07:09.800> to<00:07:10.729> nothing<00:07:11.210> at

all

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.499 
all
so<00:07:12.649> if<00:07:13.159> you<00:07:13.370> ever<00:07:13.520> feel<00:07:13.819> like<00:07:13.849> talking<00:07:14.059> about

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:14.509 
so if you ever feel like talking about

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.809 
so if you ever feel like talking about
infinity<00:07:15.259> try<00:07:15.830> thinking<00:07:16.219> about<00:07:16.309> Graham's

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:16.819 
infinity try thinking about Graham's

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:19.719 
infinity try thinking about Graham's
number<00:07:16.999> instead<00:07:17.719> try<00:07:18.469> to<00:07:18.499> comprehend<00:07:19.129> as<00:07:19.309> much

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:19.729 
number instead try to comprehend as much

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:21.939 
number instead try to comprehend as much
of<00:07:19.879> that<00:07:19.909> number<00:07:20.330> as<00:07:20.599> you<00:07:20.749> can<00:07:21.020> and<00:07:21.349> then

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:21.949 
of that number as you can and then

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:24.279 
of that number as you can and then
consider<00:07:22.430> whether<00:07:22.759> infinity<00:07:23.509> is<00:07:23.809> what<00:07:24.169> you

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:24.289 
consider whether infinity is what you

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:25.250 
consider whether infinity is what you
really<00:07:24.620> mean

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260 
really mean

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.329 
really mean
