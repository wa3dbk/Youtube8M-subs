00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 In this video I want you two 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.480
 pens in the company but not 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.700
 imagine 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.580
 These two founders are ideally made 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.230
 for it on on capacitive displays of 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.860
 ipad or iphone for example what 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.650
 enter 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.150
 there it is so that the no longer up 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.529
 somehow react to pressure but also 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.789
 an electric field what through 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.189
 finger is changed or the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.470
 fingertip and these pins this 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.130
 feel this finger group after but 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 even more 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.670
 they really make it possible in the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 handwriting input 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.489
 in the imagination we have here only 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.559
 times the subscribed shop per circa 25 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.750
 euro without any batteries 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.059
 works without problems the technique 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.920
 is here that there is a little tip 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 and there are still times so you better 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.450
 slides in so that I tears and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.399
 the lace adapts to it and to be 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.989
 jack white sled where I again 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.390
 especially faster and easier 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.090
 can slide over the display 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 in return, about 60 euros 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.670
 more expensive pen the chart script in the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.400
 evernote edition evernote is yes this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.170
 memo program in the cloud and the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.270
 also have a notebook in the cloud 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.500
 And that's the pin of the work 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.150
 with an aaa battery has one here 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.250
 built-in bluetooth chip and thus 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.320
 the manufacturer promises this chip 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.600
 or this pen is that one if you are 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.640
 with this pen writes that it is one 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.470
 much more accurate the typeface gives and 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.840
 That's what we want to find out today 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.479
 the job script for 60 , so to speak 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.420
 euro or can you also with the 20 to 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.759
 30 euro pen work 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.619
 said in advance of this pen here 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.570
 cheap variant that always works 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.950
 and the expensive variant you need 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.170
 a special program water 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.939
 supported and that is what I am 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.829
 that the app that i mate from evernote 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.229
 I'll click now and open the good one 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.770
 piece and there we have the pins here 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.090
 and we can already see it at the side 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.740
 this apparently already the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.100
 connection exists we look on it 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.840
 pin exactly connected something else 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.490
 to this pen he works 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.439
 really only when it is on 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.479
 So if the battery is inserted and 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.250
 is turned on again 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.840
 then it works otherwise 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.580
 he does not work as he needs 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.890
 definitely the battery and i need it 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.049
 turn on if I but with the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.610
 improved typeface even more 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.530
 would like to work to the basic function 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.629
 then i need an app that too 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.860
 supported and I have two here 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.450
 selection and we'll do a test here 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.549
 the beautiful thing about this pen is that he 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:39.290
 really comfortable and writes 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:42.470
 but we have relatively fair typeface 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.750
 see clearly here I think he 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.730
 hangs something behind 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.410
 he is the precise pure and I find 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.650
 the typeface is either mine 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.650
 handwriting 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.470
 Well, let me put it there 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.579
 he talks a little bit afterwards and 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.500
 is slower okay that's it 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.879
 font picture with this expensive chef that 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.470
 nice is when you give me this bluetooth 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.919
 you can touch what he works here 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.359
 want and it is theoretical writes 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.579
 still theoretically me sure 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.319
 in practice this is different now 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.010
 our 20 euro pin of the same 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:24.650
 manufacturer felt it first he dresses 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.389
 is just as good over the ground 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.859
 maybe a bit loud though 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.859
 otherwise this pen is 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.930
 you see, it works just as well now 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.700
 And that's my impression, too 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.280
 somehow do not understand why me 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.730
 really need two pins here at the 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.400
 whole thing because yes I do not know 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.330
 why should I spend 60 euros for 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.730
 The pen then not so good 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.810
 I call it that's how it is 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.130
 now the cheapest now 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.130
 I write with the pricier over it 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.050
 so both are somehow one 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.620
 Unfamiliar feeling it's never that 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.090
 paper 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.740
 I think maybe with them a bit 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.600
 mined points there and we see that 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.570
 a better writing of the more expensive 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.370
 But it really depends on it 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:27.490
 That's the big question I 'm still doing 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:29.600
 even a test it is not so 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.740
 you notice me in the video but I think 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.900
 it also not exactly 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.600
 and here is this pen essential 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.600
 more precisely oh so now I have to go here 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.720
 I do that to instigate 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:52.250
 a good question 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:54.650
 So now in principle, you see here 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.660
 right here then then i would say 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.640
 both ships are just as good and 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.960
 just as bad you do not experience any 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.540
 Wonder with these pencils and ask 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.190
 Why am I giving myself 50 or 60? 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.040
 euro out like a great pen if the 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.510
 smaller exactly the same thing does it all 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.720
 I would like to finish everything now 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.820
 I personally think that this pen 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.380
 much easier to use is one 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.850
 no battery does not need 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.040
 bluetooth connection you do not need one 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.510
 apps designed specifically for these pens 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.200
 be done but it works 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.970
 always in contrast to the kripo of the 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.130
 promises a precise writing world 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.200
 but only with selected apps the 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.600
 partially cost so what that of 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.300
 evernote is free but there is also 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.830
 then, for example, the heritage and 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.390
 there it is already something again 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.370
 more expensive and costs accordingly 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.020
 and there I find that personally 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.669
 this extra charge for the pen 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.129
 not worth it to find a font picture 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.500
 I am much too similar it is like 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.960
 before making a real pencils 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.210
 real error has much more resistance 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.669
 on the paper as like these pens 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.190
 Slip the only one I find that here 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:04.220
 at this job script something better solved 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.840
 it makes it look pretty hot and that 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.400
 typing feels like I'm more natural 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.259
 because you have one down here 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.030
 tip that gives something else 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.460
 I would say now you can get that 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.979
 buy cheap or real 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.060
 grab paper pen and then it is whole 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.060
 scan in
