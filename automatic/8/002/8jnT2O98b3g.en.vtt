00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:20.119
 a very good plays in front of the republic 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:28.140
 and to see 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:31.619
 lend 36 goals and red card and yellow 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.950
 card that was very exciting 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.540
 we knew that freiburg with the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.960
 certain aggressiveness enter the game 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.960
 becomes 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.460
 so has come in the first one 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.920
 halfway I think by two 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.390
 individual mistakes also one of mine 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.170
 I take on my cap I have to 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.809
 my cap got put into residue 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.550
 and still have us good 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:02.399
 fought back 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:07.070
 that 's a good 20 and then you 're 2 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.070
 and then eleven meters 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.530
 32 and then back 33 is great 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:34.760
 but lost the game now 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:37.610
 Yesterday in any case yes it draws 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.770
 us that we have a strong character 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 team has noticed us how 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.750
 in the second half then especially 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.420
 in power in the stadium we are still warm 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.300
 the fans and and have also been inspired 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.090
 as well as freiburg little little opportunities 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.580
 have always admitted and always good in 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.770
 fight I think then the sc 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.090
 also noticed and by that we are too 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.380
 better come into play again 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.330
 I basically go in each one 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.270
 Bundesliga match went well 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.480
 freiburg clear if you the past 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.410
 also takes games then one has 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:15.110
 noticed that always extremely heated and 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:23.600
 that's how it was yesterday, yes, yes, I have to 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:26.710
 So I have to do it, I have to be fresh 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.190
 cheeky and 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:34.860
 he is good it is very good is small 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.770
 Messetore were on the trigger 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.800
 Obviously, the eleven-meter call for it 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.540
 culprit was in the situation for us and 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.630
 how then made again pressure 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.970
 have been remarkable and 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.700
 that's how the compensation works 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.060
 perfectly fine and yes the last 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.870
 in front of jannik to the gate the ball over the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.140
 line presses 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.960
 It was an incredible feeling and me 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:09.510
 I was really looking forward to it 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:09.510
 kramer dramatic tension and public was 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:25.830
 but also deserves very well 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.830
 one points
