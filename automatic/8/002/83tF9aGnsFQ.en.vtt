00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.170
 welcome to qvc beauty i am reni 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.929
 and I'll show you how to get around today 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.360
 bushy giant eyebrows do so 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.920
 as far as possible it is possible in its own frame 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.900
 I find it a very very nice 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.640
 Look clearly matches the autumn 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.619
 trends and at the moment you can see more 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.990
 bushy eyebrows as normal 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.010
 eyebrows and there are a few small ones 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.810
 Things are a bit different 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.140
 but I have to do it 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.510
 a lot of effect and a lot of fun so here 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 is my eyebrows mine 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.010
 starting material as it were and as you 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.200
 So normally you can see it is like that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.200
 that eyebrows should be plucked 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.950
 that you start here as an extension 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.170
 from the eye in angle from the nose and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.510
 then as an extension of nasa 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.550
 past the eye until then 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.539
 My eyebrows do not go that far 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.300
 That's why I'll get it right away 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.000
 extend a bit and also should 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.680
 at the highest point down here as well 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.199
 a little something to be plucked away with it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.390
 that just seems higher and you do it that way 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.369
 a real bow in it has got 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 i have now left the jewels i have 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.479
 let him even grow up with me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.760
 practically from down here as well as mine 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.490
 hair here and also naturally grow like that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.750
 The line can extend so that it after 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.400
 continue down there 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.549
 I think that makes it all so 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.320
 a bit more masculine and also bushier 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.159
 and fuller and I like that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.170
 actually quite good 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.520
 the hairs down are very bright therefore 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.509
 makes it a little bit for me there 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.070
 fill 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.540
 and I'll be right with that too 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.350
 Eyebrow pencil here in a bit 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.500
 trace 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.320
 and also up there with very whole 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.790
 Gentle, careful strokes are coming 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.979
 on what an eyebrow pencil 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.360
 You always have a light hand 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.159
 if you push too hard then you get 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.549
 We want the right strip 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.399
 Not 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:53.040
 and now I'm going down over here 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.720
 practically straight outwardly that 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.689
 which I do not usually do 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.619
 and I also stress up there 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.619
 a little bit 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.890
 By the way, what you actually do, by the way 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.450
 should not do so you should not 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.489
 Draw up here because that's fine 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.319
 looks unnatural but I think 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.290
 just because it needs so you can 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.690
 Do that and then I'll go 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.849
 very carefully to the outside and me 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.220
 extend the line so a little bit 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.599
 just a bit so the eyebrow 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.709
 a total of longer seems like that 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.120
 something like that and then lacks after 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.400
 Eyebrows go all the way 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.930
 I have to fix that and I have to say that 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.670
 have very stubborn eyebrows you 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.989
 like to move back and forth and 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.540
 then turn down and so 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.579
 Unbelievably 100 active ones will pull out 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.049
 That's why I have one thing very much 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.970
 very sticky is natural 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.440
 personal preference I think so 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.019
 that works best 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.220
 and then they stay where they are 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.709
 and you can even use them 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.410
 So I think so, too 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.420
 very important and right here 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.739
 I always follow her a little bit 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.360
 above and to the middle 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.519
 Do you see that then it will be like that 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.790
 look a bit bushier and then 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.459
 my hair out the way to the outside 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.590
 outside like I practically do 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.540
 down so they go up here 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.519
 and then in a swing to the side 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.780
 I would raise her up here too 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.389
 then I would have my whole thing 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.010
 volume practically broke it down 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.620
 would go up a bit 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.299
 from stand but that so I think on 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.459
 I can do more with this style 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.100
 my eyes out then you can do it 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.230
 modulate practically as you wish 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.150
 and I think that's great, I think 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.980
 They look really cute and fat 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.870
 and I really like it that way 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.319
 I am a big fan of it 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.209
 oh man i love bushy eyebrows 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.130
 By the way, this also works with powder 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.250
 I only have kainz at the moment 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.260
 hair color fits therefore always worth it 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.819
 another pen but I agree 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.799
 powder is even better because 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.840
 We can then really listen and 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.090
 even after eyebrows go again 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.160
 could go in with the powder and then 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.780
 they are even more extreme 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
 the right eyebrow is better 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.099
 become as the left I know too 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.290
 sometimes you do not need such eyes 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.090
 Anyway, a bad hair day or so days 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.200
 that was already heard much more 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.480
 not at all 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.859
 i have to say i love dear love 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.680
 big eyebrows 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.849
 I think that makes it again 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.889
 completely different frame that leaves that 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.380
 face look very different and it 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.350
 Absolutely fits in with this little bit 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.789
 Bushy on then separates as the man 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.590
 just fallen out of bed and born 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.479
 with the perfect bushy eyebrows 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.970
 not much of a matter of taste 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.050
 like bushy eyebrows 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.139
 maybe that's just me too 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.729
 just as a time cultural phenomenon 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.620
 but i like the undone look anyway 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.820
 very much and I think he is very 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.740
 looks great today i got myself 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.020
 I also try my hair 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.720
 not if that has become something but well 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.949
 ok i hope we read so pacific idea 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.949
 see you next time
