lives<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:06.899> rivers<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.230> lakes<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.589> reason

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
lives in rivers and lakes the reason

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.950 
lives in rivers and lakes the reason
being<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.340> waters<00:00:08.670> murky<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.599> can't

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
being the waters murky and so you can't

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.629 
being the waters murky and so you can't
make<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> conventional<00:00:10.860> program<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.400> can't

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
make a conventional program you can't

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.980 
make a conventional program you can't
send<00:00:11.969> somebody<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.450> with<00:00:12.599> an<00:00:12.690> underwater

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
send somebody in with an underwater

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.499 
send somebody in with an underwater
camera<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:14.009> what<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.880> use<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> fishing

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
camera so what I do is I use a fishing

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.859 
camera so what I do is I use a fishing
line<00:00:15.719> but<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.770> me<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.130> more<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.869> means

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
line but this to me is more of a means

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.560 
line but this to me is more of a means
to<00:00:18.990> an<00:00:19.170> end<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.680> sort<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.180> it<00:00:21.180> sort<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.420> is

to an end it's sort of it sort of is

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.000 
to an end it's sort of it sort of is
about<00:00:21.689> fishing<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.470> not<00:00:22.619> about<00:00:22.800> fishing

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
about fishing but it's not about fishing

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.500 
about fishing but it's not about fishing
it's<00:00:23.250> more<00:00:23.460> about<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.760> end<00:00:23.880> result<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.390> more

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
it's more about the end result it's more

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.750 
it's more about the end result it's more
about<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> fish<00:00:24.960> themselves<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.769> lot<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> the

about the fish themselves a lot of the

fish that I go after I initially hear

fish that I go after I initially hear
about<00:00:30.060> them<00:00:30.330> or<00:00:31.170> find<00:00:31.500> out<00:00:31.590> about<00:00:31.740> them<00:00:32.040> from

about them or find out about them from

about them or find out about them from
old<00:00:32.610> books<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:33.239> old<00:00:33.870> sources<00:00:34.559> of

exploration<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:36.809> whatever<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:38.460> thing<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
exploration or whatever the thing is

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.700 
exploration or whatever the thing is
there's<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> limit<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.540> how<00:00:39.660> much<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.290> find

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
there's a limit to how much you can find

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.470 
there's a limit to how much you can find
out<00:00:40.950> remotely<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.790> comes<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.090> point<00:00:42.120> where

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
out remotely there comes a point where

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.920 
out remotely there comes a point where
you've<00:00:42.600> got<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> good<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.440> go<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.980> start

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
you've got a good just go and start

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.000 
you've got a good just go and start
intelligence-gathering<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> ground<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
intelligence-gathering on the ground and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.760 
intelligence-gathering on the ground and
the<00:00:47.190> approach<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:48.379> make<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> point<00:00:49.649> of

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the approach that I make a point of

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069 
the approach that I make a point of
taking<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.719> communicating<00:00:51.719> directly<00:00:51.930> with

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
taking is is communicating directly with

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.080 
taking is is communicating directly with
the<00:00:52.260> local<00:00:52.500> people<00:00:52.680> what's<00:00:53.430> interesting<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the local people what's interesting is a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.490 
the local people what's interesting is a
lot<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.300> these<00:00:54.360> places<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> Congo<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
lot of these places like the Congo the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.299 
lot of these places like the Congo the
Amazon<00:00:56.180> fishing<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.570> very<00:00:57.870> much<00:00:58.829> central<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
Amazon fishing is very much central to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.709 
Amazon fishing is very much central to
people's<00:00:59.579> lives<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.359> an<00:01:01.260> eccentric

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
people's lives it's not a an eccentric

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.690 
people's lives it's not a an eccentric
minority<00:01:03.719> activity<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.979> parts<00:01:05.580> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
minority activity as it is in parts of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.980 
minority activity as it is in parts of
the<00:01:05.760> Western<00:01:06.119> world<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> something

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the Western world so this is something

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.179 
the Western world so this is something
that's<00:01:07.049> very<00:01:07.140> important<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> them<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.040> once

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
that's very important to them and once

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.730 
that's very important to them and once
they<00:01:08.369> actually<00:01:09.110> get<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> sense<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> know

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
they actually get a sense that I know

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.109 
they actually get a sense that I know
what<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.130> talking<00:01:11.490> about<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> am

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
what I'm talking about that I am

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.630 
what I'm talking about that I am
actually<00:01:12.330> capable<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.140> catching<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.130> fish<00:01:14.159> even

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
actually capable of catching a fish even

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.850 
actually capable of catching a fish even
though<00:01:14.760> I'm<00:01:14.970> an<00:01:15.299> outsider<00:01:15.720> they'll<00:01:16.439> open<00:01:16.740> up

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
though I'm an outsider they'll open up

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.649 
though I'm an outsider they'll open up
they'll<00:01:17.070> tell<00:01:17.310> me<00:01:17.340> things<00:01:17.700> they<00:01:17.939> possibly

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
they'll tell me things they possibly

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.899 
they'll tell me things they possibly
wouldn't<00:01:18.900> tell<00:01:19.200> other<00:01:19.549> outsiders<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.790> then

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
wouldn't tell other outsiders and then

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.580 
wouldn't tell other outsiders and then
we<00:01:21.000> go<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> fish

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
we go on from there I think the fish

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
we go on from there I think the fish
that<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:23.040> stands<00:01:23.490> out<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.790> me<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that really stands out for me is the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.010 
that really stands out for me is the
Goliath<00:01:24.990> tigerfish<00:01:25.530> from<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> Congo<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:27.869> is

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
Goliath tigerfish from the Congo this is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
Goliath tigerfish from the Congo this is
a<00:01:28.049> fish<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.530> appearance<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.220> looks<00:01:29.490> like

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
a fish that in appearance it looks like

a fish that in appearance it looks like
a<00:01:29.729> giant<00:01:30.060> piranha<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.930> fact<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
a giant piranha and in fact it is a

watch<00:01:57.280> but<00:01:57.609> this<00:01:57.700> is<00:01:57.789> a<00:01:57.820> fish<00:01:58.060> living<00:01:58.329> in<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
watch but this is a fish living in the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.389 
watch but this is a fish living in the
river<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:59.140> most<00:01:59.679> people<00:01:59.950> just<00:01:59.979> have<00:02:00.189> no<00:02:00.369> idea

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
river that most people just have no idea

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.760 
river that most people just have no idea
that<00:02:01.359> it's<00:02:01.539> there<00:02:01.810> but<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.289> catch<00:02:02.469> a<00:02:02.590> big<00:02:02.740> one

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
that it's there but to catch a big one

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.819 
that it's there but to catch a big one
if<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.219> take<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.119> time<00:02:04.450> from<00:02:05.320> my<00:02:05.500> very<00:02:05.740> first

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
if you take the time from my very first

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.440 
if you take the time from my very first
going<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.490> that<00:02:06.610> part<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:06.969> world<00:02:07.090> emotion

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
going to that part of the world emotion

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.770 
going to that part of the world emotion
catching<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.840> in<00:02:07.960> 25<00:02:08.379> years<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.780> think

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
catching it in 25 years so I think

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.050 
catching it in 25 years so I think
there's<00:02:10.959> enough<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.290> life<00:02:11.530> left<00:02:12.220> now<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.670> have

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
there's enough in life left now to have

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.580 
there's enough in life left now to have
any<00:02:13.239> sort<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.629> similar<00:02:14.080> kind<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.470> experience

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
any sort of similar kind of experience

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.030 
any sort of similar kind of experience
because<00:02:15.430> there's<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.819> sort<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.950> bit<00:02:17.950> of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
because there's a sort of a bit of

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.860 
because there's a sort of a bit of
masochist<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.670> possibly<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.330> but<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.480> think

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
masochist and possibly in it but I think

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.720 
masochist and possibly in it but I think
one<00:02:20.170> thing<00:02:20.440> that's<00:02:20.650> very<00:02:20.709> significant<00:02:21.489> is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
one thing that's very significant is

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.839 
one thing that's very significant is
that<00:02:22.170> any<00:02:23.170> achievement<00:02:24.069> is<00:02:24.250> directly

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
that any achievement is directly

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.789 
that any achievement is directly
proportional<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.810> amount<00:02:25.989> of<00:02:26.290> work<00:02:26.500> the

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
proportional to the amount of work the

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.080 
proportional to the amount of work the
amount<00:02:26.829> of<00:02:27.130> suffering<00:02:27.579> that<00:02:27.610> you've<00:02:27.880> been

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
amount of suffering that you've been

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.460 
amount of suffering that you've been
through<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.569> although<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.930> might<00:02:29.019> not<00:02:29.079> be<00:02:29.260> very

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
through so although it might not be very

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.890 
through so although it might not be very
pleasant<00:02:29.650> at<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.040> time<00:02:30.690> we'll<00:02:31.690> there<00:02:31.840> are

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
pleasant at the time we'll there are

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.420 
pleasant at the time we'll there are
certainly<00:02:32.140> moments<00:02:32.620> but<00:02:32.769> it's<00:02:32.890> looking<00:02:33.160> back

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
certainly moments but it's looking back

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.880 
certainly moments but it's looking back
on<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.819> think<00:02:34.180> yes<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.660> was<00:02:34.890> really

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
on it you think yes that was really

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.729 
on it you think yes that was really
worth<00:02:36.069> doing<00:02:36.280> think<00:02:37.000> about<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.540> fish<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.650> I

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
worth doing think about the fish that I

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.380 
worth doing think about the fish that I
go<00:02:38.920> after<00:02:39.099> all<00:02:39.430> most<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.819> them<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.239> fact

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
go after all most of them is the fact

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.309 
go after all most of them is the fact
that<00:02:40.510> they<00:02:40.840> are<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.980> apex<00:02:42.400> predators<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.660> the

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
that they are the apex predators and the

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.229 
that they are the apex predators and the
good<00:02:44.590> thing<00:02:44.799> about<00:02:44.890> catching<00:02:45.430> them<00:02:45.579> is<00:02:45.790> that

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
good thing about catching them is that

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.660 
good thing about catching them is that
if<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.230> apex<00:02:47.530> predator<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.040> now<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.400> shows

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
if the apex predator is now it shows

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.240 
if the apex predator is now it shows
that<00:02:49.120> everything<00:02:50.019> further<00:02:50.470> down<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:51.099> food

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
that everything further down the food

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.890 
that everything further down the food
pyramid<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.790> also<00:02:52.090> there<00:02:52.269> so<00:02:52.450> it's<00:02:52.599> a<00:02:52.690> very

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
pyramid is also there so it's a very

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.069 
pyramid is also there so it's a very
very<00:02:53.079> good<00:02:53.440> sign<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.459> health<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.840> river

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
very good sign of the health of a river

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.150 
very good sign of the health of a river
I<00:02:56.379> often<00:02:57.370> say<00:02:57.549> that<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.790> world<00:02:58.090> without<00:02:59.160> oysters

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
I often say that a world without oysters

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.610 
I often say that a world without oysters
is<00:03:00.370> actually<00:03:00.819> more<00:03:01.750> frightening<00:03:02.230> than<00:03:02.500> a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
is actually more frightening than a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.550 
is actually more frightening than a
world<00:03:02.769> with<00:03:03.040> them

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
world with them

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.930 
world with them
