00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
you're doing open terrain like this you

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.170 
you're doing open terrain like this you
don't<00:02:01.950> need<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.520> much<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:02.969> kind<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
don't need that as much and you kind of

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.030 
don't need that as much and you kind of
got<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.450> modify<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.930> system<00:02:04.229> so

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
got to modify the system so

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550 
got to modify the system so
use<00:02:05.250> these<00:02:05.430> commonly<00:02:05.970> available<00:02:06.560> templates

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
use these commonly available templates

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.400 
use these commonly available templates
this<00:02:08.520> one<00:02:08.700> has<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.270> example<00:02:09.300> measured<00:02:10.050> three

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this one has for example measured three

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.290 
this one has for example measured three
inches<00:02:10.710> four<00:02:10.979> inches<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.460> five<00:02:11.700> inches<00:02:12.060> wide

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
inches four inches and five inches wide

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.690 
inches four inches and five inches wide
so<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.720> wizard<00:02:13.020> casts<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.440> fireball<00:02:13.980> you

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
so if the wizard casts a fireball you

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.420 
so if the wizard casts a fireball you
just<00:02:14.880> put<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.180> down<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.810> determine

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
just put this down and you determine

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.030 
just put this down and you determine
wargaming<00:02:17.430> style<00:02:17.760> who<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.600> affected<00:02:19.020> by<00:02:19.350> that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
wargaming style who is affected by that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.100 
wargaming style who is affected by that
so<00:02:20.400> rules<00:02:20.910> need<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.300> rewritten<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.870> little

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
so rules need to be rewritten a little

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.720 
so rules need to be rewritten a little
bit<00:02:22.230> but<00:02:22.350> it's<00:02:22.470> not<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.190> hard<00:02:23.460> you<00:02:23.520> can

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
bit but it's not that that hard you can

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.920 
bit but it's not that that hard you can
also<00:02:23.880> get<00:02:24.150> some<00:02:24.390> spray<00:02:25.400> template<00:02:26.660> type<00:02:27.660> of

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
also get some spray template type of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.310 
also get some spray template type of
things<00:02:28.470> where<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.610> know<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.510> thing<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.050> just

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
things where you know the thing is just

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
a different shape for a different type

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.720 
a different shape for a different type

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
you just put that on here like this that

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.030 
you just put that on here like this that
would<00:03:17.640> represent<00:03:17.820> maybe<00:03:18.330> an<00:03:18.510> exit<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.830> then

evocative dungeon hole there and all
right<00:03:43.200> let's<00:03:43.380> move<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:44.209> this<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.750> bin<00:03:46.200> with

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
right let's move on this is the bin with

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.170 
right let's move on this is the bin with
the<00:03:46.769> very<00:03:47.220> large<00:03:47.549> pieces<00:03:48.090> these<00:03:48.900> are<00:03:49.080> cavern

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
the very large pieces these are cavern

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.570 
the very large pieces these are cavern
flats<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.570> actually<00:03:52.530> there<00:03:52.799> should<00:03:53.010> be<00:03:53.130> four

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
flats and actually there should be four

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.340 
flats and actually there should be four
of<00:03:53.640> these<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.030> if<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.540> put<00:03:54.750> them<00:03:54.840> together<00:03:54.959> it

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
of these and if you put them together it

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.220 
of these and if you put them together it
makes<00:03:55.530> one<00:03:55.620> huge<00:03:56.360> table<00:03:57.620> consuming<00:03:59.330> cavern<00:04:00.330> so

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
makes one huge table consuming cavern so

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.110 
makes one huge table consuming cavern so
that<00:04:01.440> here's<00:04:01.709> another<00:04:02.040> one<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.640> notice<00:04:02.880> on

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
that here's another one so you notice on

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.720 
that here's another one so you notice on
one<00:04:03.570> inch<00:04:03.780> they're<00:04:03.989> sort<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.260> flat<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:05.430> they

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
one inch they're sort of flat so they

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.470 
one inch they're sort of flat so they
can<00:04:05.910> go<00:04:06.030> together<00:04:06.180> like<00:04:06.450> this

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
can go together like this

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.520 
can go together like this
make<00:04:07.629> a<00:04:07.659> large<00:04:07.989> cavern<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:08.879> was<00:04:09.879> bad<00:04:10.530> that's

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
make a large cavern that was bad that's

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.559 
make a large cavern that was bad that's
getting<00:04:11.860> ended<00:04:12.159> it<00:04:12.250> out<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.700> sure<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:13.450> can

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
getting ended it out for sure you can

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.390 
getting ended it out for sure you can
make<00:04:13.629> a<00:04:13.690> large<00:04:13.959> cavern<00:04:14.500> like<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:15.010> see<00:04:15.340> how

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
make a large cavern like that see how

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.349 
make a large cavern like that see how
that<00:04:15.459> works<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.590> yeah<00:04:18.280> I've<00:04:18.549> had<00:04:18.699> a<00:04:18.760> lot<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.060> fun

with<00:04:19.570> these<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:20.139> I<00:04:21.070> think<00:04:21.130> it's<00:04:21.459> really<00:04:21.519> it's

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
with these and I think it's really it's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.770 
with these and I think it's really it's
really<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:23.139> deluxe<00:04:23.590> way<00:04:23.949> to<00:04:24.430> play<00:04:25.090> rolling
