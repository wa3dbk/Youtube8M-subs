00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:05.859
 this week we saw the map of the hand of the leader of the motocross national 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.509
 felipe gabarró lush 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.299
 the Alicante tells us the set-up the previous motorcycle combines race 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.300
 I think it's accurate in the car of the final phase of the circuit and 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:20.220
 The last Sunday 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.579
 friendly a little filming your pension best possible position 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.579
 It's a little complicated because one day to another can change a bit 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.970
 the circumstances of time 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.000
 but usually it would be productive 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.400
 nadal dominated from altamira 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.260
 reads little beyond the gn your language pension I think that the point 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.630
 at most a bit of engine carburetion 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.260
 according to the presidency and has defined we are 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.720
 I usually do it 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.140
 over time as I was in the temperature to the title I know you can 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.030
 eat 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.820
 Álvaro talks about the week's choice 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.920
 fabio coentrao as a little our home to 1 with 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.030
 this way we have tires 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.210
 the second compound that there is and the circumstance say quito and loja 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.430
 temperature 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.460
 that is why we say each one what is most appropriate for the indy driver 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.160
 based on what he chose his position on the grid 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 as we know in the output for this next week 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.850
 maybe right now occupies the most straight to the curve without having to 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.500
 do what 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.630
 and be such a long fair 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 your situation 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.100
 we would be coming out better to arrive with the maximum possible speed 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.130
 towards the curve that is 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.880
 one would get as straight as possible aaa to the interior height 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.470
 pilot who has some who has the most suffered have to bear before 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.870
 gas and you can do today 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.460
 outside father a little stopped by satellite they already know done that is not 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.490
 they can strain 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.390
 everything that can meet you 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.380
 that's what's left 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.240
 the quick for a pilot of esade well of the fence 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.720
 it was the massive arrival 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 it looked possible 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.530
 requena with large displacement 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.299
 it's not that I think that 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.659
 nothing big of seville 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
 the first meters that puts in front of the arch and half four times 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.599
 it's very difficult that I know what sense 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.779
 I think the four and a half would be amurrio 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:23.689
 barsa went so badly
