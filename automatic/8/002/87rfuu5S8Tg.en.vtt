beams which are the easiest all you have
to<00:00:08.040> do<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.220> plant<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.610> beans<00:00:08.730> at<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.059> bottom

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
to do is plant the beans at the bottom

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.610 
to do is plant the beans at the bottom
of<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> trellis<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.019> they'll<00:00:10.410> start

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
of the trellis and they'll start

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.310 
of the trellis and they'll start

tied<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.340> trellis<00:00:17.670> because<00:00:17.880> they<00:00:18.180> grip<00:00:18.420> it

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
tied to the trellis because they grip it

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.830

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
trellis but all you have to do when this

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.450 
trellis but all you have to do when this
happens<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.900> gently<00:00:25.590> weave<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.920> back<00:00:26.070> into<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
happens is gently weave it back into the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.820 
happens is gently weave it back into the
trellis<00:00:29.960> winter<00:00:30.960> squash<00:00:31.170> pumpkins<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
trellis winter squash pumpkins and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.560 
trellis winter squash pumpkins and
watermelons<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.610> tendrils<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.270> cling<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
watermelons have tendrils they cling to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.170 
watermelons have tendrils they cling to
the<00:00:33.750> trellises<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.440> help<00:00:34.890> them<00:00:35.040> climb<00:00:35.309> but

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the trellises and help them climb but

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.610 
the trellises and help them climb but
the<00:00:36.329> tendrils<00:00:36.570> alone<00:00:36.930> aren't<00:00:37.170> enough<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the tendrils alone aren't enough to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.470 
the tendrils alone aren't enough to
support<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> weight<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.430> plants<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
support the weight of the plants so to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479 
support the weight of the plants so to
provide<00:00:39.809> additional<00:00:40.079> support<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:41.040> weed<00:00:41.280> them

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
provide additional support we weed them

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.090 
provide additional support we weed them
through<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> trellises<00:00:42.559> this<00:00:43.559> acorn<00:00:43.980> squash

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
through the trellises this acorn squash

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.190 
through the trellises this acorn squash
starts<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> front<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:45.750> moves<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
starts out in the front then moves to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200 
starts out in the front then moves to
the<00:00:46.289> back<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> front<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.030> on

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the back and then to the front and so on

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.360 
the back and then to the front and so on
some<00:00:49.200> extent<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.039> their<00:00:50.219> own

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
some extent will do this on their own

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.160 
some extent will do this on their own
but<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.910> also<00:00:51.149> gently<00:00:51.510> persuade<00:00:51.899> them<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
but I also gently persuade them to

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.290 
but I also gently persuade them to
follow<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.590> pattern<00:00:52.890> usually<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.030> plants

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
follow this pattern usually the plants

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.610 
follow this pattern usually the plants
are<00:00:54.390> malleable<00:00:54.570> enough<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.079> change<00:00:55.320> sides

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
are malleable enough to change sides

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
are malleable enough to change sides
over<00:00:55.829> three<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> five<00:00:56.370> squares<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.480> when

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
over three to five squares but when

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.150 
over three to five squares but when
they're<00:00:57.809> not<00:00:57.989> i<00:00:58.230> coax<00:00:58.620> them<00:00:58.739> where<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> want

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
they're not i coax them where I want

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040 
they're not i coax them where I want
them<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> go<00:00:59.550> by<00:00:59.730> tying<00:01:00.090> them<00:01:00.270> off<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:00.719> garden

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
them to go by tying them off with garden

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.700 
them to go by tying them off with garden
tape<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.770> strips<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.250> fabric<00:01:03.439> when<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> fruits

tape or strips of fabric when the fruits

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.649 
tape or strips of fabric when the fruits
start<00:01:04.949> getting<00:01:05.159> larger<00:01:05.549> often<00:01:06.060> tie<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.330> plant

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
start getting larger often tie the plant

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.960 
start getting larger often tie the plant
near<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> fruit<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.619> trellis<00:01:07.970> this

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
near the fruit to the trellis this

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.280 
near the fruit to the trellis this
usually<00:01:09.270> provides<00:01:09.600> enough<00:01:09.840> support<00:01:10.140> for

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
usually provides enough support for

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.170 
usually provides enough support for
acorn<00:01:10.740> squash<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.280> butternut<00:01:11.580> squash<00:01:11.909> but

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
acorn squash and butternut squash but

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.539 
acorn squash and butternut squash but
large<00:01:12.960> pumpkins<00:01:13.470> cushaw<00:01:13.950> squash<00:01:13.979> and

large pumpkins cushaw squash and

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.580 
large pumpkins cushaw squash and
watermelons<00:01:15.119> need<00:01:15.299> more<00:01:15.540> support<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.530> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
watermelons need more support so I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.649 
watermelons need more support so I
fashioned<00:01:17.009> hammocks<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> old<00:01:17.820> t-shirt<00:01:18.299> to

front to back and so on when the plants
are<00:01:30.390> thin<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.810> one

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
are thin like this one

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.660 
are thin like this one
I<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.590> easily<00:01:31.770> weed<00:01:32.130> them<00:01:32.340> through<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
I can easily weed them through the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.730 
I can easily weed them through the
trellis<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.720> when<00:01:33.900> they're<00:01:34.049> thick<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.530> use

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
trellis but when they're thick I use

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
trellis but when they're thick I use
garden<00:01:35.189> tape<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.549> fabric<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.270> gently<00:01:36.570> pull

this<00:01:42.750> may<00:01:42.930> seem<00:01:42.990> time-consuming<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.979> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
this may seem time-consuming but it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.980 
this may seem time-consuming but it
really<00:01:44.220> isn't<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.850> usually<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.780> when<00:01:45.869> I'm

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
really isn't I usually do it when I'm

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
really isn't I usually do it when I'm
out<00:01:46.079> harvesting<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:46.770> casually<00:01:47.189> strolling

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
out harvesting or casually strolling

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.550 
out harvesting or casually strolling
around<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> garden<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.509> guess<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.259> takes<00:01:49.380> about

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
around the garden I guess it takes about

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.940 
around the garden I guess it takes about
15<00:01:50.070> minutes<00:01:50.399> per<00:01:50.579> week<00:01:51.439> this<00:01:52.439> approach<00:01:52.770> also

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
15 minutes per week this approach also

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.929 
15 minutes per week this approach also
works<00:01:53.399> great<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.729> peas<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.479> cucumbers<00:01:55.939> well

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
works great for peas and cucumbers well

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:57.770 
works great for peas and cucumbers well
