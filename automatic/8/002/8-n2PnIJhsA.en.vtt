has a strong interdisciplinary feel and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.470 
has a strong interdisciplinary feel and
character<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:38.969> strong<00:00:39.210> links<00:00:39.390> with

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
character so we have strong links with

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.380 
character so we have strong links with
geography<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:40.530> Biosciences<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.910> history

science<00:01:51.360> at<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> University<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.350> Exeter

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
science at the University of Exeter

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.950 
science at the University of Exeter
because<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.549> gives<00:01:53.909> me<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.390> opportunity<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
because it gives me the opportunity to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.830 
because it gives me the opportunity to
combine<00:01:55.530> two<00:01:56.399> very<00:01:56.759> interesting<00:01:56.840> disciplines

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
combine two very interesting disciplines

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.709 
combine two very interesting disciplines
this<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> very<00:01:58.829> unique<00:01:59.280> course<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.270> it's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
this is a very unique course and it's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.590 
this is a very unique course and it's
great<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> actually<00:02:01.369> learn<00:02:02.369> both<00:02:02.939> sides<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.479> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
great to actually learn both sides of it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.020 
great to actually learn both sides of it
and<00:02:03.750> then<00:02:03.869> learn<00:02:04.290> about<00:02:04.560> whether<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.340> meet<00:02:05.549> our

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and then learn about whether to meet our

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.029 
and then learn about whether to meet our
students<00:02:06.509> really<00:02:06.750> value<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> fact<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.860> here

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
students really value the fact that here

just a fantastic support network to have
through<00:02:46.109> flint<00:02:46.650> knapping<00:02:46.970> we're<00:02:47.970> looking<00:02:48.269> at

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
through flint knapping we're looking at

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.059 
through flint knapping we're looking at
the<00:02:48.629> development<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.319> human<00:02:49.590> language<00:02:50.040> and

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
the development of human language and

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.640 
the development of human language and
the<00:02:50.640> only<00:02:51.060> insight<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:51.900> into<00:02:52.200> hominid

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the only insight we have into hominid

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.530 
the only insight we have into hominid
brain<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.519> size<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.909> the<00:02:54.030> brain<00:02:54.180> itself

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
brain is the size of the brain itself

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.680 
brain is the size of the brain itself
and<00:02:54.840> what<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.889> people<00:02:56.040> did<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.700> flint

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
and what the people did and flint

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.089 
and what the people did and flint
knapping<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:58.139> something<00:02:58.500> that's<00:02:58.680> preserved

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
knapping is something that's preserved

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.759 
knapping is something that's preserved
and<00:02:59.459> so<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.120> can<00:03:00.269> look<00:03:00.480> at<00:03:00.629> how<00:03:00.810> complex<00:03:01.139> they

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
and so we can look at how complex they

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.580 
and so we can look at how complex they
were<00:03:01.879> thinking<00:03:02.879> back<00:03:03.720> through<00:03:03.989> time<00:03:04.230> if<00:03:04.440> we

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
were thinking back through time if we

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.440 
were thinking back through time if we
understand<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.250> procedures<00:03:05.819> one<00:03:06.329> of<00:03:06.389> the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
understand the procedures one of the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.990 
understand the procedures one of the
most<00:03:06.569> satisfying<00:03:06.780> parts<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.609> being<00:03:08.609> here<00:03:08.909> at

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
most satisfying parts of being here at

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.420 
most satisfying parts of being here at
Exeter<00:03:09.269> is<00:03:09.599> that<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.260> can<00:03:10.560> take<00:03:10.590> students<00:03:11.250> into

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
Exeter is that I can take students into

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.160 
Exeter is that I can take students into
the<00:03:11.519> field<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.940> can<00:03:11.970> excite<00:03:12.540> them<00:03:12.750> about<00:03:12.840> my

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
the field I can excite them about my

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.240 
the field I can excite them about my
research<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.769> if<00:03:13.889> they're<00:03:14.069> really

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
research and if they're really

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.250 
research and if they're really
interested<00:03:14.489> they<00:03:14.940> can<00:03:15.120> actually<00:03:15.720> become<00:03:16.230> part

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
interested they can actually become part

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.500 
interested they can actually become part
of<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.739> research<00:03:17.190> process<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.879> produce

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
of that research process and produce

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
of that research process and produce
something<00:03:19.019> original

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
something original

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.259 
something original
it's<00:03:19.949> not<00:03:20.129> just<00:03:20.400> reiterating<00:03:21.120> or

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
it's not just reiterating or

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.420 
it's not just reiterating or
regurgitating<00:03:22.139> what<00:03:22.260> we<00:03:22.470> tell<00:03:22.680> them<00:03:22.799> they

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
regurgitating what we tell them they

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.860 
regurgitating what we tell them they
actually<00:03:23.730> contribute<00:03:24.150> something<00:03:24.660> original

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
actually contribute something original

from themselves that's exciting stuff

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.750 
from themselves that's exciting stuff
there's<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.230> much<00:03:28.379> variety<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:29.160> archaeology

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
there's so much variety in archaeology

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.520 
there's so much variety in archaeology
globally<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.900> can<00:03:31.049> get<00:03:31.169> so<00:03:31.410> many
