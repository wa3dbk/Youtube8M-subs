00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.130
 new talents

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.710
 also playing benchmark being in 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.670
 the box of the box of pant 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.530

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.630
 conversation is never spoken with rui 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.030

 from the peñafiel and I was telling him that 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.190

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.250
 sorry 17 years 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.059
 Brazilian 190 a forward field that does not 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.690
 it seemed a field suffered from a patatal and 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.120
 nobody appears there is a 17 year old kid 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.920

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.260
 little weight at that time 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.000
 uncoordinate a bit was sticking with 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.680
 all up and down and if it goes with 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.150

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.590

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.200

 some flip-flops scream 4 degrees below zero 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.080

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.540
 peculiar because only geniuses and all 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.520
