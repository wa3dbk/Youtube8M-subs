00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.450 
connection which is the old 30 pin one
it<00:01:48.630> comes<00:01:49.110> with<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:49.979> well<00:01:50.189> that's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
it comes with and this as well that's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190 
it comes with and this as well that's
how<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.759> use<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.329> all<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.689> different<00:01:51.990> pieces

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
how you use the all the different pieces

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.399 
how you use the all the different pieces
and<00:01:52.850> what<00:01:53.850> else<00:01:53.970> yeah<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:56.659> lot<00:01:57.659> else<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:58.049> on

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and what else yeah a lot else going on

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.810 
and what else yeah a lot else going on
there<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.920> tells<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.219> how<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.399> use<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
there just tells you how to use the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.179 
there just tells you how to use the
device<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.390> pretty<00:02:00.689> bog-standard<00:02:01.189> not

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
device but it's pretty bog-standard not

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.859 
device but it's pretty bog-standard not
exactly<00:02:02.640> rocket<00:02:02.850> science<00:02:03.060> if<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.509> move<00:02:03.659> all

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
exactly rocket science if we move all

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.270 
exactly rocket science if we move all
this<00:02:04.290> other<00:02:04.530> way<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.069> peel

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
this other way you can see if we peel

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.250 
this other way you can see if we peel
off<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:09.179> plastic

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
off this plastic

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.690 
off this plastic
and<00:02:12.260> mr.<00:02:12.500> plastic<00:02:12.800> on<00:02:12.920> top<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.160> could<00:02:13.310> see<00:02:13.580> this

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and mr. plastic on top I could see this

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.870 
and mr. plastic on top I could see this
being<00:02:13.850> an<00:02:14.030> absolute<00:02:14.510> fingerprint<00:02:15.140> magnet<00:02:15.880> but

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
being an absolute fingerprint magnet but

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.360 
being an absolute fingerprint magnet but
real<00:02:17.210> nice<00:02:17.510> gloss<00:02:18.020> bit<00:02:18.740> of<00:02:18.830> care<00:02:19.130> there's<00:02:19.310> a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
real nice gloss bit of care there's a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.430 
real nice gloss bit of care there's a
button<00:02:19.580> there<00:02:19.820> if<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.000> press<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:21.080> lights

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
button there if you press it it lights

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.110 
button there if you press it it lights
up<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:21.980> I'm<00:02:22.490> guessing<00:02:22.820> that's<00:02:22.880> how<00:02:23.060> you

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
up and I'm guessing that's how you

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.150 
up and I'm guessing that's how you
charge<00:02:23.810> up<00:02:23.930> devices<00:02:24.350> about<00:02:24.560> turning<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.100> on

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
charge up devices about turning that on

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.630 
charge up devices about turning that on
and<00:02:25.760> if<00:02:26.240> we<00:02:26.270> look<00:02:26.540> here<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.350> can<00:02:27.500> see<00:02:27.800> it's

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
and if we look here you can see it's

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.670 
and if we look here you can see it's
actually<00:02:28.880> feels<00:02:29.180> really<00:02:29.750> releasing<00:02:30.320> quality

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
actually feels really releasing quality

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.620 
actually feels really releasing quality
there's<00:02:30.920> no<00:02:31.070> squid<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.850> doesn't<00:02:32.240> squeeze<00:02:32.420> it

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
there's no squid it doesn't squeeze it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.180 
there's no squid it doesn't squeeze it
all<00:02:32.780> I've<00:02:33.200> had<00:02:33.500> some<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.710> these<00:02:33.830> where<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.070> can

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
all I've had some of these where you can

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.520 
all I've had some of these where you can
squeeze<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.060> creaks<00:02:35.960> and<00:02:36.230> things<00:02:36.380> but

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
squeeze it and it creaks and things but

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.530 
squeeze it and it creaks and things but
this<00:02:36.620> feels<00:02:36.860> really<00:02:37.130> solid<00:02:37.580> it's<00:02:38.120> quite<00:02:38.360> heavy

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
this feels really solid it's quite heavy

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.060 
this feels really solid it's quite heavy
there<00:02:38.810> that's<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.020> only<00:02:39.170> problem<00:02:39.290> but<00:02:39.920> it's

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
there that's the only problem but it's

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.950 
there that's the only problem but it's
no<00:02:40.190> big<00:02:40.400> deal<00:02:40.430> for<00:02:40.610> thirty<00:02:41.030> thousand<00:02:41.750> milliamp

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
no big deal for thirty thousand milliamp

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.380 
no big deal for thirty thousand milliamp
hours<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:42.980> ideal<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.820> if<00:02:44.030> we<00:02:44.150> look<00:02:44.300> at

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
hours that is ideal and if we look at

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.210 
hours that is ideal and if we look at
the<00:02:44.480> back<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.870> see<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.020> model<00:02:45.350> code<00:02:45.800> past

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
the back you can see the model code past

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.620 
the back you can see the model code past
the<00:02:46.370> thirty<00:02:46.580> thousand<00:02:47.000> milliamp<00:02:47.180> hours<00:02:47.540> I

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
the thirty thousand milliamp hours I

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.170 
the thirty thousand milliamp hours I
said<00:02:47.930> input<00:02:48.830> five<00:02:49.190> volt<00:02:49.520> which<00:02:49.730> two<00:02:49.850> thousand

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
said input five volt which two thousand

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.290 
said input five volt which two thousand
milliamp<00:02:50.360> hour<00:02:50.660> up<00:02:51.590> DC<00:02:52.070> five<00:02:52.910> volt<00:02:53.150> which<00:02:53.270> is

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
milliamp hour up DC five volt which is

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.810 
milliamp hour up DC five volt which is
2.1<00:02:53.900> amp<00:02:54.700> or<00:02:55.700> one<00:02:56.480> amp<00:02:56.660> as<00:02:56.870> well<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.760> can

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
2.1 amp or one amp as well so you can

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.920 
2.1 amp or one amp as well so you can
see<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:59.030> made<00:02:59.120> in<00:02:59.300> China<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.810> that's

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
see it's made in China and that's

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.500 
see it's made in China and that's
exactly<00:03:00.260> where<00:03:00.560> ordered<00:03:00.950> from<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.460> here<00:03:02.390> we

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
exactly where ordered from and here we

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.720 
exactly where ordered from and here we
have<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.870> they<00:03:03.710> call<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.190> power<00:03:04.370> bank

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
have it they call it the power bank

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.580 
have it they call it the power bank
while<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.390> picked<00:03:05.660> this<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.930> picked<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.350> up<00:03:06.410> for

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
while I picked this I picked it up for

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.830 
while I picked this I picked it up for
16<00:03:07.130> pounds<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.910> believe<00:03:08.390> they've<00:03:08.510> gone<00:03:08.630> up<00:03:08.750> a

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
16 pounds I believe they've gone up a

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.180 
16 pounds I believe they've gone up a
little<00:03:08.960> bit<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.260> still<00:03:09.500> may<00:03:09.680> be<00:03:09.710> able<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:09.920> find

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
little bit you still may be able to find

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.280 
little bit you still may be able to find
them<00:03:10.340> for<00:03:10.430> 16<00:03:10.790> pounds<00:03:11.150> but<00:03:11.720> I've<00:03:11.870> seen<00:03:12.080> him

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
them for 16 pounds but I've seen him

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.730 
them for 16 pounds but I've seen him
going<00:03:12.470> from<00:03:12.740> 32<00:03:13.250> pounds<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.700> for<00:03:13.840> 150<00:03:14.840> pounds<00:03:15.620> I

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
going from 32 pounds it for 150 pounds I

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.010 
going from 32 pounds it for 150 pounds I
can't<00:03:16.160> see<00:03:16.310> how<00:03:16.520> anyone<00:03:16.970> would<00:03:17.090> spend<00:03:17.450> 150

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
can't see how anyone would spend 150

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.810 
can't see how anyone would spend 150
pounds<00:03:18.320> on<00:03:18.410> this<00:03:18.560> when<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.010> picked<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:19.400> up<00:03:19.610> for

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
pounds on this when I picked this up for

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.660 
pounds on this when I picked this up for
16<00:03:20.209> pounds<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.040> really<00:03:22.220> quick<00:03:22.400> look<00:03:22.550> at

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
16 pounds so this really quick look at

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.750 
16 pounds so this really quick look at
the<00:03:22.730> power<00:03:22.970> bank<00:03:23.680> 30,000<00:03:24.680> milliamp<00:03:25.010> hour<00:03:25.220> but

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
the power bank 30,000 milliamp hour but

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.610 
the power bank 30,000 milliamp hour but
actually<00:03:26.000> boost<00:03:26.240> the<00:03:26.390> pack<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.410> hope<00:03:27.530> you
