00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.460
 the approaches are finished 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.500
 Now I go to my department completely 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.950
 simply very simple in the front area 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.300
 a triangle dividing the point shows 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.300
 to the highest point of the head 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.590
 Lengths of lace are colored 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.380
 Now we go to the triangle 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.550
 there we have thin slices off to 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:57.470
 Share also submit this again 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.060
 a slide and now we want yes 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.640
 have an effect that the length and 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.170
 Spikes lighter are close to me 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.850
 Position where I think 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.830
 Blondage in the fall on stretcher 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.370
 namely that bassey again with after 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.830
 ahead 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.100
 checker once battery where sits the bright 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.610
 point it would be backwards and wear it 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.610
 now the same 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.119
 I start to color the meat 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.510
 here with my tint on the zone 2 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:37.890
 and where I set my point 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.890
 I also wear my LIGHTENING 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.040
 for a further course I take 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.330
 a second quarter where no 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.910
 color on it and paint mine 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.940
 top dark color again fully into the 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:13.840
 Lengths tips of this labs 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:15.400
 repeat I expect the whole thing 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.590
 Now up to the front in bed and 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.150
 very important for you as well 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.040
 the triangle is divided I have one 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.940
 very soft color gradient if that 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.940
 then falls forward again 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.330
 I think now you can already 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.740
 Seeing very well that is quite a whole 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.740
 easier it forward
