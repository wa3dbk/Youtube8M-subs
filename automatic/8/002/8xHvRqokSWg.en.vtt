00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
this is the first one this one is made

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.270 
this is the first one this one is made
in<00:03:56.280> Taiwan<00:03:57.230> let's<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.500> forget<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:59.160> I'll

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
in Taiwan let's just forget and I'll

in Taiwan let's just forget and I'll
forget<00:04:00.120> about<00:04:00.239> this<00:04:00.450> one<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:02.630> with<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.810> carbon

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
forget about this one and with a carbon

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.350 
forget about this one and with a carbon
deep<00:04:05.400> cleansing<00:04:06.000> phone<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:07.410> basically<00:04:08.360> inside

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
deep cleansing phone so basically inside

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.570 
deep cleansing phone so basically inside
it<00:04:09.989> contains<00:04:10.459> carbon<00:04:11.459> powder<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.269> know<00:04:12.510> um

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
it contains carbon powder so you know um

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.780 
it contains carbon powder so you know um
how<00:04:14.580> it<00:04:14.760> works<00:04:15.650> carbon<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.919> molecules<00:04:17.519> of

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
how it works carbon the molecules of

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.009 
how it works carbon the molecules of
carbon<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.870> has<00:04:19.139> this<00:04:19.500> hose<00:04:20.130> or<00:04:20.639> hollows<00:04:21.450> on<00:04:21.959> a

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
carbon it has this hose or hollows on a

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.820 
carbon it has this hose or hollows on a
service<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.760> this<00:04:24.660> molecules<00:04:25.410> of

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
service of it so this molecules of

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.540 
service of it so this molecules of
carbon<00:04:26.160> can<00:04:26.639> actually<00:04:27.270> help<00:04:28.100> absorb<00:04:29.100> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
carbon can actually help absorb the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.719 
carbon can actually help absorb the
excessive<00:04:30.210> oil<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:31.020> help<00:04:31.470> clean<00:04:31.800> out<00:04:32.160> the
