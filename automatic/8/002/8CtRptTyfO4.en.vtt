00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
double bubble zero gravity one as you

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.600 
double bubble zero gravity one as you
can<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.520> has<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.670> much<00:02:15.209> wider<00:02:15.480> arc<00:02:16.430> ten<00:02:17.430> it

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
can see it has a much wider arc ten it

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.580 
can see it has a much wider arc ten it
looks<00:02:17.850> cool<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.570> put<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:21.050> as<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.260> can<00:02:22.380> see

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
looks cool so put that on as you can see

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.350 
looks cool so put that on as you can see
they<00:02:22.769> both<00:02:22.950> got<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.700> buff<00:02:23.850> about<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> same

to<00:02:31.590> shoot<00:02:31.769> video<00:02:31.950> I'm<00:02:32.459> like<00:02:32.640> number<00:02:33.090> with<00:02:33.330> this

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
to shoot video I'm like number with this

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.690 
to shoot video I'm like number with this
so<00:02:33.750> ask<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.440> government<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:35.250> as<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.550> see

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
so ask the government but as you can see

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.990 
so ask the government but as you can see
right<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:36.120> look<00:02:36.930> at<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.410> holes<00:02:37.620> line<00:02:37.920> up

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
right there look at it the holes line up

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.380 
right there look at it the holes line up
so<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.330> right<00:02:39.480> size<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.230> that's<00:02:40.470> good

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
so it is the right size so that's good

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.190 
so it is the right size so that's good
just<00:02:42.390> comparison<00:02:43.019> on<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.860> top<00:02:44.070> part

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.729 

see<00:02:51.200> there<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:53.330> like<00:02:53.480> almost<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:54.140> little<00:02:54.650> bit

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
see there it's like almost a little bit

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.009 
see there it's like almost a little bit
bigger<00:02:55.120> we'll<00:02:56.120> see<00:02:56.360> i'll<00:02:56.510> put<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.750> on<00:02:56.840> and

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
bigger we'll see i'll put it on and

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.690 
bigger we'll see i'll put it on and
start<00:02:57.230> some<00:02:57.379> riding<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.890> check<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.340> out<00:02:58.459> but

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
start some riding and check it out but

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.360 
start some riding and check it out but

you slide it out slide it back in put

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.039 
you slide it out slide it back in put
these<00:03:36.159> fasteners<00:03:36.760> right<00:03:37.030> here<00:03:37.239> on<00:03:37.659> the<00:03:37.870> bottom

these fasteners right here on the bottom

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.319 
these fasteners right here on the bottom
and<00:03:40.079> screw<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.109> in<00:03:41.260> simple<00:03:41.980> as<00:03:42.069> that

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
and screw it in simple as that

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:49.990 
and screw it in simple as that
directions<00:03:43.329> come<00:03:43.510> with<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:46.590> with<00:03:47.590> the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.560 

oh<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:52.280> was<00:03:52.400> down<00:03:52.550> house<00:03:52.790> one<00:03:53.120> out<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.540> hit

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
oh that was down house one out the hit

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.490 
oh that was down house one out the hit
that<00:03:53.930> was

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.130 

the<00:03:59.500> hell<00:03:59.800> is<00:04:00.010> that

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.170 

I<00:04:02.290> guess<00:04:03.069> this<00:04:03.220> spacing<00:04:03.640> in<00:04:03.850> between<00:04:03.880> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
I guess this spacing in between the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.260 
I guess this spacing in between the
lights<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.660> notice<00:04:04.960> that<00:04:05.140> before

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
lights and notice that before

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:16.550 
lights and notice that before
interesting<00:04:07.270> but<00:04:07.780> um<00:04:08.550> that's<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:10.920> looks<00:04:11.920> nice

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.490 

next<00:04:17.280> project<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:17.940> rear<00:04:18.660> seat<00:04:18.900> cowl<00:04:18.930> and

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
next project is rear seat cowl and

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.830 
next project is rear seat cowl and
probably<00:04:20.220> some<00:04:20.340> LED<00:04:20.760> lights<00:04:20.790> or<00:04:21.239> LED<00:04:21.630> lights

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
probably some LED lights or LED lights
