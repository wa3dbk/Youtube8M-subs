00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
looks better on me but I think it's good

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.789 
looks better on me but I think it's good
like<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.150> said<00:01:13.390> do<00:01:13.659> it<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:14.020> your<00:01:14.260> eye<00:01:14.500> shape

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
like you said do it to your eye shape

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.219 
like you said do it to your eye shape
cuz<00:01:15.130> a<00:01:15.159> lot<00:01:15.400> of<00:01:15.430> people<00:01:15.580> try<00:01:16.360> to<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:17.200> know

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
cuz a lot of people try to you know

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.170 
cuz a lot of people try to you know
emulate<00:01:18.159> some<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.400> these<00:01:18.460> four-eyes<00:01:18.850> shapes<00:01:19.060> I

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
emulate some of these four-eyes shapes I

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.540 
emulate some of these four-eyes shapes I
think<00:01:19.360> it's<00:01:19.450> good<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:20.229> yeah<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.430> know

think it's good that you yeah you know

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.220 
think it's good that you yeah you know
really<00:01:21.880> say<00:01:22.030> like<00:01:22.060> do<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:22.660> to<00:01:22.780> your<00:01:22.900> eye<00:01:22.930> shape

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.500 
once that is all blended I like to and

cuz<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.030> think<00:02:27.090> like<00:02:27.450> because<00:02:28.350> it's<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:28.890> pretty

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
cuz I think like because it's so pretty

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.530 
cuz I think like because it's so pretty
but<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.850> can<00:02:29.970> be<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.240> kind<00:02:30.480> of

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
but then it can be like kind of

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.850 
but then it can be like kind of
difficult<00:02:31.050> if<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.350> would<00:02:31.470> be<00:02:31.590> your<00:02:31.680> biggest

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
difficult if what would be your biggest

difficult if what would be your biggest
tip<00:02:32.370> my<00:02:32.730> biggest<00:02:32.970> tip<00:02:33.270> would<00:02:33.420> be<00:02:33.630> get

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
tip my biggest tip would be get

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.410 
tip my biggest tip would be get
oppressed<00:02:34.770> 1<00:02:35.010> get<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> press<00:02:35.670> buy<00:02:35.880> powder<00:02:36.150> don't
