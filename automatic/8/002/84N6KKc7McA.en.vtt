00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.849
 Welcome to the album review of sweets 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.099
 what cello and from there so on the 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:26.539
 we have clarified that 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:28.789
 so far the album offers 3 video 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.510
 I leave the album teaser out 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.460
 now go away 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.080
 the first video extraction of the two 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.730
 is the purpose of shock camera the one 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.800
 nice sample of the absolute beginner 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.660
 also generally offers the beat he 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.730
 forward and makes you want more 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.860
 the video was shot 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.110
 also lets see all in all offers 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.000
 that's a good overall package 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.309
 second video extraction is hackmack where 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.320
 Adherence orders entered the honor 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.820
 the track offers the piano sounds the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.110
 they are underlaid with space 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.150
 Listen as if you were on one 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.860
 hewed metal bucket because that is in no one 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.479
 wise annoying in the opposite of the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.879
 lightning sound matches the 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.559
 soundtrack the featuregäste hauen 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.689
 also pure though I have to say that 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.450
 Qatar has the weakest part of all 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.340
 haftbefehl goes as usual forward 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.960
 the video is artistically high quality 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.789
 produces and does not offer the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.189
 habitual hip hop style the third 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.899
 video extraction is arno alarm from the 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.850
 Beat dress really fat in the face 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.070
 and invites you to nod your head 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.090
 both kick a good path more can 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.770
 you do not say that 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.060
 the single outcouplings are real 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.799
 very successfully selected and 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.310
 represent the album in his 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.310
 whole splendor 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.140
 how technically no wishes remain 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.640
 open from the over gross move is everything 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.920
 in all variations in the album 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.659
 processed gangsta rap with very many 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.320
 Facetten leaves the work best 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.929
 describe 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.670
 everything was produced by m3 and that 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.140
 you can hear it too, there is actually no 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.520
 I do not beat many 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.829
 So who in the musical 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:01.209
 has erectile disorders 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:02.560
 I'd rather listen to a hit feature 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.000
 technology does not need the album 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.099
 you can actually hide it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.530
 that the whole us americans are starting 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.239
 is from warrant to veysel until 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.060
 Hanibal is everything that the heart 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.260
 desires to give himself aleksic and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.450
 rata the honor 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.440
 a total of 17 tracks are waiting on and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.209
 it does not matter if you have the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.610
 standard version or the limited edition 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.290
 Package box has the number of tracks 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.030
 it does not change anything you only have 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.959
 the whole instrumental on the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.099
 second cd 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.870
 we are also hardly fillers 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.209
 the album noticed artificially 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.430
 stretch where the track 05 is to me 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.160
 negatively noticed because hannibal there so 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.170
 incredibly bad rap really annoying 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.880
 who sets his voice as that will 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.540
 album then you will understand what 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.100
 I mean 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.350
 otherwise I have to say that you do not 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.660
 forcibly needed to tilt 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.579
 The album can be carried well and is 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.579
 satisfy everyone 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.790
 The straßenrap has a successful one again 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.250
 album more and the red thread stretches 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.170
 from money laundering at risk up 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.239
 towards poverty through the entire album 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.850
 cliché all topics become yes 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.980
 covered but that's just straßenrap 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.060
 To do this, set firmly the cello and off 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.230
 They are also technically rap 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.030
 have evolved 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.730
 compares it with backyard gago 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.560
 you notice the big differences 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.780
 we come to ratings and there must 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.700
 I say for one it will not 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.370
 rich because unfortunately still missing 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.260
 you look for something on the album punchlines 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.150
 here more or less in vain but 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.100
 it does not have to be that way either 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.440
 it's just a street rap album and 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.269
 for that it presented itself well 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.209
 album gets a two-and- a- half from me 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.060
 think that this is a fair evaluation 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.860
 that was her in reviews chance and how 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.959
 the album comes to you so write 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.850
 but please in the comments 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.560
 Thank you very much to 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.680
 see you and see you next time 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.680
 Review again then look
