 and very good to all vaquitas we are 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.320
 here in minecraft once again and good 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.179
 I'm with the installed mode and I'm ready 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.500
 than the number 10 version that has already 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.000
 taken out okay I just talked to the 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.280
 creator of the bot to explain me 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.620
 everything they have included that are little things 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.780
 but cool a lot is worth one of them is 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.390
 that we can add sound to the waves 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.070
 vital there are a lot of sounds and good 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.660
 let's go see it by the way if 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.239
 I would have looked like I'm square 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.670
 full of muscles is because it's a new 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.860
 texture pack that tomorrow I will bring to 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.140
 the channel is worth tomorrow today only the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.270
 the updates of the dragon block mod 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.380
 it's as I always say below in the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.600
 description you have the new 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.829
 bot update and let's see everything 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.960
 what's included I want you to see 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.980
 something curious and is that the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.450
 Carmen 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.700
 that before was a little ship ado 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.200
 but it works now we're going to load the 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.300
 team to throw it for example to the tree 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.190
 this 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.210
 let's load what to me to me 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.280
 to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.860
 and good as you can see, it works 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.659
 I am not short let's say the kamehameha that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.970
 before it was cut as it went 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.290
 moving forward but there is no problem 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.330
 He told me that it works very well 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.580
 and well we already have the three skills 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.770
 sinbo that was something that I wanted to be worth 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.509
 another thing is that well let's see the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.850
 sounds because they're super curious we're going 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.790
 to raise the sound this good to what I'm going to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.800
 leave 10% and we will create a 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.590
 kamehameha kings tecniques let's give it 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.550
 to create we are going to create a wide 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.130
 we are going to put the color pink 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.130
 red let's put it to explode and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.230
 when now we give to next vale is not going 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.050
 to say what types of sounds we want 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.640
 put the vital wave is worth one is to the 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.920
 time to load what would be the wave 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 vital they are I think they are seven worth 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.460
 let's see them now I will explain it 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.170
 because we can hear it we give it 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.480
 students and we heard it on 2 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.610
 Number 3 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.850
 4 on 4 is the one I like the most 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.850
 this 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.819
 5 and 6 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.940
 and the 7th and good to me because I liked it 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.980
 the 4 is worth because the sound is very effective 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.810
 between load rating and now let's look at 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.239
 when launching it is when 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.880
 launches and is on its way to a goal 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.810
 well let's hope 13 sounds worth we're going to 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.810
 go watching it quickly 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.480
 Wilderness what amount I'll leave 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.480
 10 we have 13 in 11 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.780
 and the 13th that was the one that we had 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.599
 previously it goes by default I'm going to 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.040
 put the 10 and the movement that are 2 is 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.510
 say this west that is obviously new 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.359
 ok we give you to accept and we will see 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.319
 that takes the sounds we do not have 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.700
 pants 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.459
 let's see let's change talking to 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.600
 vital let's try is in a tree in 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.830
 this for example 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.830
 to me 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.330
 such 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.950
 It's worth as you can see it's worth they are 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.810
 sounds that we can customize with the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.730
 vital works is worth other super things 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.129
 curious that here in the l now we have 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.950
 beautiful we can make groups but 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.599
 only on multiplayer servers is 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.120
 say we can have the shirt group 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.430
 from the saiÃ¡ns group or from what 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.379
 you want it and you will not be able to attack them 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.790
 among you I can not prove it because 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.370
 I'm not on a server but I'm telling you 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.530
 that's the way it is and the mission system has 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.690
 changed it's worth to say the enemies are going to 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.840
 appear in a super epic way let's 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.190
 to have here the whole list of missions 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.890
 that we have I only have chalk and 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.060
 invasion image let's accept it and 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.440
 now I 'm going to go to what would be the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.660
 land of the Germans but I remember 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.519
 where it was but good will have to look 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.260
 what was not out there there for the 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.260
 Snow eyes I can fly 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.760
 We'll see how this all appear 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.010
 enemies are going to appear like this from this 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.790
 way when we're going to train here in what 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.680
 what is your land 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.890
 I'm going to put the five that I want 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.890
 see 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.960
 church and another 1000 enemies to the 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.530
 vista vale appear in this super form 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.330
 ethics and they would not stop until you 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.760
 destroyed or have completed the mission 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.340
 It's worth as you can see, it's worth saying 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.730
 always always if you go where you go 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.740
 follows and well no longer appear there there 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.320
 than to look for them that was the truth a 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.410
 boredom and appear in this way 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.480
 It's worth all the enemies mainly 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.010
 then good so that they do not leave because 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.620
 they will leave without stopping as I say 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.320
 so that they come out to us simply you give him 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.050
 to what would be the ele and that leaves and 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.400
 the vision you abandon and it is already 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.890
 have to go back out yes or go for 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.940
 Hence it follows me are assholes 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.540
 It happens to you with the wind of laziness 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.540
 Amen 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.760
 good and this would be what would be the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.990
 emissions system now what I'm going to 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.060
 to do is that I want you to see why we 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.900
 cut the tail if they are going to cut the 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.730
 tail 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.100
 Mr. shirt goes has the power to 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.320
 cut off your tail all with your tail 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.090
 back tail is worth this you are 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.100
 seeing I can make it shorter more 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.990
 as long as it leaves the ones of the 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.090
 Poodles are worth then let's fly 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.729
 towards kamisama fuck no I do not remember 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.169
 where was he to kill me 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:33.889
 and we call directly to look like 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.839
 know that we're going through here and well then 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.949
 cut our tails tomorrow by the way 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.589
 you know, I'm going to bring the pack 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.150
 new textures and also bring a 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.559
 installation tutorial of this mod 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.599
 version because there are people that we 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:47.389
 he has visited we are going to revive him and they do 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:49.789
 sonic pajamas to see sir camps to kill 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:53.749
 here where it puts custom child is worth the 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:56.300
 we give and confirm and with my tail 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:58.129
 asshole and try number cuts do not 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.830
 short and now when we give it back to 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.839
 give her the wench forge tale we confirm and 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.879
 puts the tail again, sometimes it's more 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:06.439
 long other times it's actually shorter 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.580
 I think this one is much longer than the 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.879
 other 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.259
 look at the bigger ones and a little bit more and 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.629
 You can leave it too small too 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.889
 as it takes them out of their noses I do not 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:17.750
 agreement what percentage there was but 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.000
 depending on exploits and whoever is 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.150
 you put it one way or another and 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.379
 well up here the review has things 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.539
 pretty good others not so much but 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:28.849
 good but you liked nothing more 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.590
 see you with new gameplays remember 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.139
 to vote like if you want that tomorrow 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.699
 bring the tutorial a greeting and even the 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.699
 next people like
