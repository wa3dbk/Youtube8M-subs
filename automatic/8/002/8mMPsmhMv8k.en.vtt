00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
break them down no yeah of course you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.130

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140

now<00:00:52.320> yeah<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.829> some<00:00:52.860> arena<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.930> that<00:00:54.930> was

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
now yeah at some arena and that was

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
now yeah at some arena and that was
probably<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.530> saw<00:00:55.860> struggle<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
probably what we saw struggle do if you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.250 
probably what we saw struggle do if you
know<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.820> scored<00:00:57.090> four<00:00:57.449> goals<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.899> liteon

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
know we scored four goals on the liteon

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.049 
know we scored four goals on the liteon
should<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.949> more<00:00:59.129> than<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.309> first<00:00:59.489> staff<00:00:59.760> but

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
should be more than the first staff but

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.459 
should be more than the first staff but
you<00:01:00.149> know<00:01:00.270> something<00:01:00.600> new<00:01:00.780> they<00:01:00.930> put<00:01:01.050> 11<00:01:01.260> men

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you know something new they put 11 men

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.680 
you know something new they put 11 men
behind<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> ball<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.270> they<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.420> try<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
behind the ball and they just try and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.539 
behind the ball and they just try and
get<00:01:03.840> set<00:01:04.080> pieces<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> pom<00:01:04.739> balls<00:01:04.920> into<00:01:05.280> box

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
get set pieces and pom balls into box

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.520 
get set pieces and pom balls into box
and<00:01:05.820> that's<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.420> expect<00:01:06.810> them<00:01:06.990> will<00:01:07.380> be

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and that's what we expect them will be

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.320 
and that's what we expect them will be
ready<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
ready for that we know that we have to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.730 
ready for that we know that we have to
concentrate<00:01:09.630> really<00:01:09.930> hard<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.290> our<00:01:10.439> attacking

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
concentrate really hard on our attacking

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.100 
concentrate really hard on our attacking
playing<00:01:11.130> our<00:01:11.700> penetration<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.630> getting<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
playing our penetration and getting a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.170 
playing our penetration and getting a
ball<00:01:13.320> wide<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.830> fill<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.130> box<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.490> trying

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
ball wide and fill in the box and trying

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.550 
ball wide and fill in the box and trying
to<00:01:15.240> score<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.479> many<00:01:15.509> goals<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.409> it's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
to score as many goals as we can so it's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.020 
to score as many goals as we can so it's
difficult<00:01:16.740> me<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.159> Finland<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> same<00:01:17.729> where

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
difficult me and Finland the same where

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.399 
difficult me and Finland the same where
they<00:01:18.119> came<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.479> sort<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.689> park<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> bus<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
they came and sort of park the bus and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.710 
they came and sort of park the bus and
you<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.159> very<00:01:20.250> hard<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.700> soar<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
you know it's very hard to soar get the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
you know it's very hard to soar get the
tempo<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.040> try<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.549> on

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
tempo going and you know try and be on

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.950 
tempo going and you know try and be on
the<00:01:23.729> front<00:01:23.880> foot<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.390> when<00:01:24.570> teams<00:01:24.810> just

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the front foot you know when teams just

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.410 
the front foot you know when teams just
coming<00:01:25.290> notes<00:01:25.920> play<00:01:26.310> solid<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.119> try<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
coming notes play solid and try and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.910 
coming notes play solid and try and
catch<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> counter-attack<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> know

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
catch on the counter-attack so you know

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.260 
catch on the counter-attack so you know
we<00:01:29.070> probably<00:01:29.250> started<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> little<00:01:29.850> bit<00:01:29.970> rusty

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
we probably started a little bit rusty

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
we probably started a little bit rusty
on<00:01:30.299> Thursday<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.619> think<00:01:31.799> went<00:01:32.130> into

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
on Thursday and but I think went into

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.890 
on Thursday and but I think went into
the<00:01:32.549> second<00:01:32.850> half<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.180> well<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.420> start<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.750> get

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the second half as well we start to get

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.569 
the second half as well we start to get
