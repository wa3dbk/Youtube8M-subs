00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 already of the 20 minutes of boil of the dwelling 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.790
 What in the pan for us to start the people? 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.059
 Yeah, I know it's not good now. 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.620
 A little but I want to show you 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.330
 as he checked then look there he still 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.360
 is boiling that done in the well figure 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.279
 softly I'll give it, I'll move it now 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.680
 Watch it continue voting foam 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.810
 although a little thicker but in 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.689
 foam is not yet at the point where 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.550
 start to move without stopping soon 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.320
 You'll see that point is because it's going 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.150
 is close to putting the condensed milk 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.679
 but it is not yet at this point that people 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.660
 is on the second match 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.300
 another thing we saw there 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.030
 saw that glass is that 300 ml glass 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:49.530
 exactly in the mark of placing 500 ml in 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:51.000
 each glass of 300 ml the same measure of 25 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.860
 minutes 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.320
 now I know you can see that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.850
 Now he's no longer boiling all 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.350
 better is he concentrates a little 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.820
 more than half in some parts of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.729
 peanut the team only in this field 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.640
 O here are standing there that to me 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.080
 It indicates that use that cause as aa 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.140
 the whole family 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.610
 and it is this moment that begins to move and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.350
 did not stop one more 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.150
 so I'll keep stirring until the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.040
 I do not believe you're here with 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.520
 this cause to you do not think it will 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 give more details 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 She is not in the moment now and she is 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.290
 keep moving was the way it is there 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.869
 keep stirring now is the time to 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.549
 Meet the gang, only you, I'll do it. 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.200
 How do I make the recipe for many years? 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.850
 some things I do I notice that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.439
 I do then I just remembered 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.509
 one thing you have to do and I do not know 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.399
 for you how you can see the fire of 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.890
 The way he is now if I stay 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.329
 stirring it does not boil 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.969
 he stopped to see that he simply 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.759
 there is not one in a hot syrup 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.040
 but it does not work then what I do 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.040
 is and is at that point that begins to move 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.320
 I put the normal low stove fire 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.690
 so it's not that mega low fire anymore 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.400
 the normal low fire and here is the movie in 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.600
 up and you can see you start losing 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.260
 just in time 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.570
 and now I move and right there with me 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.740
 stirring it is boiling 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.780
 then it is this point that we are 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.780
 hoping that even with the Mexican club 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.490
 all the time they entered without it not 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.130
 have enough temperature I think the 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.600
 Flemish is never anything different 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.190
 So, the one I was looking for 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.690
 now when it's time for milk 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.570
 condensed other luxuries as you can 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.260
 see the game here very close is the cause 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.750
 now it's very thick but it 's difficult 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.710
 exist to move and especially he 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.170
 begins to form good 15th 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.490
 and then you have the distinct impression so at 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.980
 The less I got this impression was made 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.010
 she repeatedly wrong for 10 that the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.660
 top will channel but this does not 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.040
 It may happen, you have to keep stirring. 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.760
 always not to burn the film can 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.260
 happen a few times with him now 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.000
 when the condensed milk is placed 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.370
 that's the point that we're looking for then 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.240
 I can not explain right here but it gives 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.350
 a little look 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.190
 This is the point that we seek for hours. 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.080
 I stop touching fashion thing that happens 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.790
 It's what I do here. Look at this. 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.100
 foam 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.420
 so it will stay on top and it is 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.360
 with only one point 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.810
 and then I stop and move it starts 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.180
 to form this again before now look 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.380
 little foam is too little because it already 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.420
 it's not so liquid anymore 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.160
 so this is the point of milk 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.030
 condensed what we do in this 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.640
 when we turn off the fire 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.590
 turn the fire off I'll continue some 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.000
 scrambled to soothe a little shameful 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.150
 Let's just say and then I put the milk 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.150
 condensed 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.870
 once placed condensed milk 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.390
 It will be more or less another 20 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:16.950
 minutes I 'm not sure now I gave 34 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:20.430
 35 minutes before the start of the boil and not 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.760
 recipe and now we reneged on fire 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.100
 on low fire not that low but the 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.440
 low and still moving 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.640
 so far we have the end point 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.640
 When are we going to take the 12?
