00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.010
 and we have added 400 milliliters of milk 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.010

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.050
 melt and add the ingredients 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.410

 pepper we prepare basmati rice 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.400
 We boil 200 milliliters of water 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.750

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.120

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.210
 hour 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.990
 now we add the sauce that we have 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.990

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.080
 we stir and let him do chup chup 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.690
 a little while to absorb the 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.790
 liquid 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.970
 in this step we can add a little 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.410
 more of species to taste of the consumer 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.440
 when all the liquid has been absorbed 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.350
 it will only be left to treat it and 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.170
 enjoy it is a long recipe but without 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.270
 doubt the result is worth much already 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.520
 all the liquid has evaporated so 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.730
 We move to place first serve the 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.730
