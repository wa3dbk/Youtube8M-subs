about<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.770> shift<00:00:17.039> detent<00:00:17.550> wheel<00:00:17.779> now<00:00:18.779> as

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
about is the shift detent wheel now as

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.510 
about is the shift detent wheel now as
you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.170> see<00:00:19.350> right<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.650> there's<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.369> of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
you can see right here there's a lot of

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.480 
you can see right here there's a lot of
play<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.660> ship<00:00:21.900> detent<00:00:22.350> wheel<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.769> oval

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
play this this ship detent wheel is oval

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.400 
play this this ship detent wheel is oval
and<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:23.939> basically<00:00:24.240> no<00:00:24.480> good<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.900> want<00:00:25.320> this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and it's basically no good you want this

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.290 
and it's basically no good you want this
wheel<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.010> real<00:00:26.279> tight<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.760> spindle

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
wheel to be real tight on that spindle

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
wheel to be real tight on that spindle
now<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> problem<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.650> had<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.599> my<00:00:30.599> second<00:00:31.170> gear

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
now the problem I had was my second gear

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.620 
now the problem I had was my second gear
shift<00:00:31.619> engine<00:00:32.099> seized<00:00:32.340> broke<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.850> half<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
shift engine seized broke in half the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.910 
shift engine seized broke in half the
other<00:00:33.660> half<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.140> still<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> ship<00:00:34.649> drum

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
other half is still in the ship drum

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.040 
other half is still in the ship drum
here's<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.460> comparison<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> good<00:00:36.809> pinch

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
here's a comparison of what a good pinch

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.299 
here's a comparison of what a good pinch
looked<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:39.360> last<00:00:39.600> problem<00:00:40.010> at<00:00:41.010> least<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
looked like the last problem at least I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.459 
looked like the last problem at least I
hope<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> less<00:00:41.760> there<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.780> tough<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.260> see

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
hope the less there is it's tough to see

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.740 
hope the less there is it's tough to see
on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> camera<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.579> where<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.239> great

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
on the camera but there is where a great

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.389 
on the camera but there is where a great
amount<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.079> wear<00:00:46.230> right<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:47.010> where<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
amount of wear right in here where the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.150 
amount of wear right in here where the
ship<00:00:47.670> detent<00:00:48.180> wheel<00:00:48.329> rise<00:00:48.690> may<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.649> tough<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
ship detent wheel rise may be tough to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
ship detent wheel rise may be tough to
see<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:51.110> lot<00:00:52.110> away<00:00:52.260> right<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.800> there<00:00:53.270> so<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
see a lot away right in there so the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.040 
see a lot away right in there so the
replacement<00:00:55.530> parts<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:58.020> a
