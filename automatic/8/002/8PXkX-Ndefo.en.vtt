more<00:01:57.580> front-heavy<00:01:58.300> lens<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.350> I've<00:01:59.560> got<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.740> lot

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
more front-heavy lens and I've got a lot

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.730 
more front-heavy lens and I've got a lot
of<00:02:00.040> quarter-twenty<00:02:00.820> 3/8<00:02:01.480> exact<00:02:02.230> reports

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
of quarter-twenty 3/8 exact reports

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.290 
of quarter-twenty 3/8 exact reports
exactly<00:02:03.460> there's<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:06.040> any<00:02:06.490> Noga<00:02:06.850> arms<00:02:07.180> or

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
exactly there's for any Noga arms or

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.180 
exactly there's for any Noga arms or
other<00:02:07.420> accessories<00:02:07.840> we<00:02:08.619> also<00:02:08.740> have<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.950> built

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
other accessories we also have a built

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.220 
other accessories we also have a built
in<00:02:09.340> shoe<00:02:09.970> mount<00:02:10.119> for<00:02:10.390> attaching<00:02:10.600> on-camera

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
in shoe mount for attaching on-camera

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.930 
in shoe mount for attaching on-camera
lights<00:02:11.440> or<00:02:11.680> microphones<00:02:12.280> things<00:02:12.610> like<00:02:12.760> that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
lights or microphones things like that

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.580 
lights or microphones things like that
and<00:02:13.270> you've<00:02:13.360> also<00:02:13.630> upgraded<00:02:14.080> something<00:02:14.380> for

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and you've also upgraded something for

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.310 
and you've also upgraded something for
the<00:02:14.680> viewfinder<00:02:15.040> that's<00:02:15.850> right<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.540> on<00:02:17.080> this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
the viewfinder that's right so on this

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.800 
the viewfinder that's right so on this
handle<00:02:17.590> as<00:02:17.740> well<00:02:17.920> we<00:02:18.130> have<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.460> sideways<00:02:19.270> 15

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
handle as well we have the sideways 15

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.570 
handle as well we have the sideways 15
millimeter<00:02:20.200> rod<00:02:20.380> clamp<00:02:20.650> which<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.250> attach

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
millimeter rod clamp which can attach

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.100 
millimeter rod clamp which can attach
the<00:02:21.790> viewfinder<00:02:22.000> directly<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:22.960> you're

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
the viewfinder directly so you're

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.170 
the viewfinder directly so you're
eliminating<00:02:23.650> an<00:02:23.770> extra<00:02:24.070> component<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:25.000> save

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
eliminating an extra component you save

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.510 
eliminating an extra component you save
costs<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.840> weight<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:27.010> then<00:02:27.130> we<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.370> an

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
costs and a weight and then we have an

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.220 
costs and a weight and then we have an
extension<00:02:28.030> here<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.570> lets<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.930> put<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
extension here that lets you put the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.410 
extension here that lets you put the
viewfinder<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.950> lot<00:02:30.459> farther<00:02:30.700> back<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:31.150> studio

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
viewfinder a lot farther back for studio

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.240 
viewfinder a lot farther back for studio
configurations<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.440> want<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.890> spin<00:02:33.130> the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
configurations and I want to spin the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.270 
configurations and I want to spin the
camera<00:02:33.490> around<00:02:33.640> here<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.209> little<00:02:34.450> bit<00:02:34.720> because

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
camera around here a little bit because

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.590 
camera around here a little bit because
although<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.430> don't<00:02:36.550> want<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.760> block<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.120> this

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
although I don't want to block it this

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.180 
although I don't want to block it this
sky<00:02:38.260> right<00:02:38.590> here

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
sky right here

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.480 
sky right here
yes<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:40.630> also<00:02:40.959> yes<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.890> see<00:02:42.070> box<00:02:42.310> is

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
yes so it's also yes the the see box is

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.000 
yes so it's also yes the the see box is
our<00:02:42.610> new<00:02:42.760> cross<00:02:43.060> converter<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.930> we<00:02:44.560> can<00:02:44.800> take

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
our new cross converter so we can take

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.030 
our new cross converter so we can take
either<00:02:45.190> SDI<00:02:45.790> or<00:02:45.910> HDMI<00:02:46.810> inputs<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.500> multi

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
either SDI or HDMI inputs and multi

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.430 
either SDI or HDMI inputs and multi
output<00:02:48.400> three<00:02:49.180> SDI<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:50.050> HDMI

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
output three SDI and to HDMI

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.330 
output three SDI and to HDMI
simultaneous<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.959> we<00:02:52.959> have<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.650> optional<00:02:54.100> 5

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
simultaneous so we have the optional 5

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.160 
simultaneous so we have the optional 5
volt<00:02:54.640> USB<00:02:55.030> port<00:02:55.540> on<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.660> side

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
volt USB port on the side

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.840 
volt USB port on the side
we're<00:02:56.680> actually<00:02:56.830> powering<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.459> wireless

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
we're actually powering a wireless

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.970 
we're actually powering a wireless
transmitter<00:02:58.330> off<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.990> C<00:02:59.170> box<00:02:59.380> itself<00:02:59.739> so

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
transmitter off of the C box itself so

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.620 
transmitter off of the C box itself so
there's<00:03:00.130> no<00:03:00.280> additional<00:03:00.610> power<00:03:01.180> converter

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
there's no additional power converter

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.620 
there's no additional power converter
and<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:03.130> streamlines<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.300> system

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
and it streamlines the the system

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.979 
and it streamlines the the system
without<00:03:05.320> added<00:03:06.220> mess<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.450> we're<00:03:07.600> doing<00:03:07.750> two

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
without added mess so we're doing two

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.040 
without added mess so we're doing two
monitors<00:03:08.320> out<00:03:08.800> of<00:03:08.920> SDI<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.550> one<00:03:10.000> out<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.300> HDMI

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
monitors out of SDI and one out of HDMI

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.140 
monitors out of SDI and one out of HDMI
to<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.410> wireless<00:03:11.800> receiver<00:03:12.190> down<00:03:12.610> here

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
to the wireless receiver down here

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.930 
to the wireless receiver down here
so<00:03:13.600> you've<00:03:13.720> really<00:03:13.750> taken<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:15.070> Blackmagic

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
so you've really taken the Blackmagic

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.810 
so you've really taken the Blackmagic
camera<00:03:16.720> it's<00:03:17.080> all<00:03:17.350> these<00:03:17.530> accessories<00:03:17.890> really

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
camera it's all these accessories really

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.430 
camera it's all these accessories really
