and<00:01:31.860> possibly<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> fastest<00:01:33.240> focusing<00:01:33.780> lens

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and possibly the fastest focusing lens

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.780 
and possibly the fastest focusing lens
that<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.439> own<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.869> color<00:01:37.079> rendition<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:38.070> lovely

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
to 200 is probably the fastest and of my

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.760 
to 200 is probably the fastest and of my
program<00:02:19.560> lenses<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.370> 85<00:02:20.819> 1.4<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.959> definitely

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
program lenses the 85 1.4 is definitely

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.250 
program lenses the 85 1.4 is definitely
the<00:02:22.950> slowest<00:02:23.430> they're<00:02:24.209> both<00:02:24.420> as<00:02:24.750> accurate<00:02:25.140> as

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
the slowest they're both as accurate as

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.170 
the slowest they're both as accurate as
each<00:02:25.410> other<00:02:25.680> once<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.099> has<00:02:26.280> focused<00:02:26.790> lock<00:02:26.970> on

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
each other once it has focused lock on

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.960 
each other once it has focused lock on
but<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.440> would<00:02:28.890> say<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.340> takes<00:02:29.370> anywhere<00:02:29.819> from

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
but I would say it takes anywhere from

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.250 
but I would say it takes anywhere from
50%<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:31.489> 300<00:02:32.489> percent<00:02:32.580> longer<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.720> get<00:02:33.840> focus

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
50% to 300 percent longer to get focus

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.900 
50% to 300 percent longer to get focus
with<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.830> 85<00:02:37.069> so<00:02:38.069> let's<00:02:38.280> just<00:02:38.489> head<00:02:38.730> outside

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
with the 85 so let's just head outside

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.930 
with the 85 so let's just head outside
now<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.900> compare<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.860> two<00:02:41.040> lenses<00:02:41.250> side<00:02:41.730> by

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
now and compare the two lenses side by

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.490 
now and compare the two lenses side by
side<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:44.660> have<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> look<00:02:45.930> at<00:02:46.019> how<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.200> book

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
side and have a look at how the book

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.000 
side and have a look at how the book
between<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> two<00:02:47.280> compares<00:02:48.800> alright<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:49.950> I've

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
between the two compares alright so I've

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.740 
between the two compares alright so I've
just<00:02:50.069> come<00:02:50.370> out<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.640> my<00:02:50.760> local<00:02:51.000> park<00:02:51.390> where

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
just come out to my local park where

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.720 
just come out to my local park where
there's<00:02:51.989> some<00:02:52.290> building<00:02:52.680> going<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.069> behind<00:02:53.519> me

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
there's some building going on behind me

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.820 
there's some building going on behind me
to<00:02:54.450> compare<00:02:55.019> their<00:02:55.290> 70<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:56.420> 285<00:02:57.420> milk<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.739> I've

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
to compare their 70 to 285 milk so I've

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.580 
to compare their 70 to 285 milk so I've
got<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.130> set<00:02:59.400> up<00:02:59.549> here<00:03:00.019> it's<00:03:01.019> not<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.290> most

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
got this set up here it's not the most

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.490 
got this set up here it's not the most
inspiring<00:03:02.220> scene<00:03:02.700> but<00:03:02.940> I've<00:03:03.060> got<00:03:03.239> my<00:03:03.500> little

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
inspiring scene but I've got my little

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.210 
inspiring scene but I've got my little
baby<00:03:04.830> Mickey<00:03:05.340> Mouse<00:03:05.610> here<00:03:06.380> on<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.950> edge<00:03:08.010> of

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
baby Mickey Mouse here on the edge of

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.979 
baby Mickey Mouse here on the edge of
the<00:03:08.370> barbecue<00:03:08.970> with<00:03:09.150> some<00:03:09.360> trees<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
the barbecue with some trees in the

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.059 
the barbecue with some trees in the
background<00:03:10.170> now<00:03:10.500> I've<00:03:10.590> done<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:11.010> way

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
background now I've done it this way

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.949 
background now I've done it this way
because<00:03:11.430> there<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.970> different<00:03:12.450> levels<00:03:12.630> of

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
because there is different levels of

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.170 
because there is different levels of
texture<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.680> you'll<00:03:13.860> be<00:03:14.010> able<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.400> see<00:03:14.670> how<00:03:15.120> the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
texture so you'll be able to see how the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.240 
texture so you'll be able to see how the
blur<00:03:15.900> effect<00:03:15.930> works<00:03:16.880> I'll<00:03:17.880> be<00:03:18.090> showing<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:19.250> 85

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
blur effect works I'll be showing the 85

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:31.190 
blur effect works I'll be showing the 85
at<00:03:20.670> one<00:03:21.540> point<00:03:21.780> for<00:03:24.950> 22.8<00:03:27.500> or

eight four f8 and f-16 now let's just

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.970 
eight four f8 and f-16 now let's just
take<00:03:55.260> 100%<00:03:56.160> crop<00:03:56.819> from<00:03:57.510> both<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.750> them<00:03:58.140> at<00:03:58.410> two

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
take 100% crop from both of them at two

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.789 
take 100% crop from both of them at two
point<00:03:59.250> eight<00:03:59.489> on<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.269> 85<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:02.959> then<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.410> 70

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
point eight on the 85 and then on the 70

point eight on the 85 and then on the 70
to<00:04:04.950> 200<00:04:05.190> at<00:04:05.880> 85<00:04:09.560> okay<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.799> then<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.940> course<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
to 200 at 85 okay and then of course the

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.890 
to 200 at 85 okay and then of course the
obvious<00:04:12.720> benefit<00:04:13.500> on<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:14.069> 70<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.819> 200<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.630> can

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
obvious benefit on the 70 to 200 you can

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.310 
obvious benefit on the 70 to 200 you can
zoom<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:17.010> out<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.639> then<00:04:18.540> actually<00:04:19.079> catch

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
zoom that out and then actually catch

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.719 
zoom that out and then actually catch
more<00:04:20.160> at<00:04:20.549> 70<00:04:21.479> mil<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:22.740> lot<00:04:22.889> wire<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.580> lot

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
more at 70 mil and a lot wire and a lot

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:39.559 
more at 70 mil and a lot wire and a lot
closer<00:04:23.970> at<00:04:24.450> 135<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:27.470> at<00:04:28.470> 200<00:04:29.130> mil

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.029 

okay<00:04:40.569> so<00:04:40.629> what<00:04:41.020> did<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:41.289> think<00:04:41.500> out<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:41.889> those

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
okay so what did you think out of those

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.649 
okay so what did you think out of those
two<00:04:42.370> was<00:04:42.610> there<00:04:42.729> one<00:04:42.909> that<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.090> particularly

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
two was there one that you particularly

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:49.170 
two was there one that you particularly
liked<00:04:44.319> or<00:04:44.699> preferred<00:04:45.699> out<00:04:46.060> of<00:04:46.240> them<00:04:46.590> for<00:04:47.590> me<00:04:48.180> it

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
liked or preferred out of them for me it

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.909 
liked or preferred out of them for me it
is<00:04:49.419> and<00:04:49.750> I<00:04:49.840> know<00:04:49.900> it's<00:04:50.259> I<00:04:50.439> hate<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.770> when<00:04:50.830> people

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
is and I know it's I hate it when people

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.890 
is and I know it's I hate it when people
do<00:04:51.250> this<00:04:51.400> in<00:04:51.580> reviews<00:04:51.969> but<00:04:52.120> it<00:04:52.180> really<00:04:52.419> is<00:04:52.659> hard

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
do this in reviews but it really is hard

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.899 
do this in reviews but it really is hard
to<00:04:53.169> compare<00:04:53.530> them<00:04:53.770> straight<00:04:54.189> up<00:04:54.340> like<00:04:54.550> that

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909 
to compare them straight up like that

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.170 
to compare them straight up like that
I<00:04:54.939> would<00:04:55.659> say<00:04:55.900> four<00:04:56.729> portraits<00:04:57.729> where<00:04:57.909> I<00:04:57.939> can

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
I would say four portraits where I can

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.990 
I would say four portraits where I can
move<00:04:58.389> around<00:04:58.569> and<00:04:59.139> for<00:05:00.099> portraits<00:05:00.520> generally

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
move around and for portraits generally

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.700 
move around and for portraits generally
I<00:05:01.210> prefer<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.900> 85

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
I prefer the 85
