until<00:05:26.099> you<00:05:26.190> go<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.340> sleep<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:27.419> it<00:05:27.539> seems<00:05:27.930> off<00:05:28.409> in

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919

your mouth to inflate it although it

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.680 
your mouth to inflate it although it
probably<00:05:38.340> goes<00:05:38.760> faster<00:05:40.159> simple<00:05:41.159> because

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
probably goes faster simple because

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:48.140 
probably goes faster simple because
humidity<00:05:42.690> gets<00:05:44.029> into<00:05:45.029> the<00:05:46.760> that<00:05:47.760> doesn't

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
humidity gets into the that doesn't

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.080 
humidity gets into the that doesn't
insulate<00:05:48.539> anything
