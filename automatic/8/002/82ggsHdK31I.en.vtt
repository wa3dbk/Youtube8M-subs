that's<00:02:50.910> something<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.380> should<00:02:52.650> have

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
that's something like that should have

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.610 
that's something like that should have
been<00:02:52.920> kept<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.489> know<00:02:53.640> keep<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.900> add<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.590> it

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.900 
series apart from all-stars for the most
part<00:03:36.630> is<00:03:36.930> like<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> simulation<00:03:37.859> it's<00:03:38.250> they<00:03:38.609> try

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
part is like a simulation it's they try

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.539 
part is like a simulation it's they try
and<00:03:38.970> make<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.329> as<00:03:39.600> realistic<00:03:39.959> as<00:03:40.260> possible<00:03:40.549> so

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
and make it as realistic as possible so

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.940 
and make it as realistic as possible so
can<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:41.760> have<00:03:41.880> like<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.359> know<00:03:42.900> do<00:03:43.350> what<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.650> see

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
can I have like you know do what you see

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.120 
can I have like you know do what you see
on<00:03:44.069> TV<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.970> video<00:03:45.180> game<00:03:45.620> but<00:03:46.620> sometimes

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
on TV in the video game but sometimes

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.890 
on TV in the video game but sometimes
you<00:03:47.430> know<00:03:47.549> with<00:03:47.790> matches<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.540> ambulance

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
you know with matches like the ambulance

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.660 
you know with matches like the ambulance
match<00:03:49.079> and<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.829> said<00:03:49.889> there's<00:03:50.250> tag-team

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
match and like I said there's tag-team

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.949 
match and like I said there's tag-team
matches<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.120> mentioned<00:03:51.569> if<00:03:51.660> they're<00:03:51.810> not

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
matches that I mentioned if they're not

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.180 
matches that I mentioned if they're not
in<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.139> video<00:03:52.319> game<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.739> can<00:03:52.950> really

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
in the video game you can really

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.140 
in the video game you can really
simulate<00:03:53.459> those<00:03:54.440> also<00:03:55.440> when<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.400> comes<00:03:56.430> to

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
simulate those also when it comes to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.569 
simulate those also when it comes to
like<00:03:57.630> six-man<00:03:58.049> tag-team<00:03:58.319> matches<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:59.280> believe

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
like six-man tag-team matches I believe

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.910 
like six-man tag-team matches I believe
they've<00:03:59.760> totally<00:04:00.150> removed<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.380> option<00:04:01.799> to

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
they've totally removed the option to

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.009 
they've totally removed the option to
have<00:04:02.040> tornado<00:04:02.639> six-man<00:04:03.180> tag-team<00:04:03.450> match<00:04:03.720> I'm

matches and even the normal ones you
can't<00:04:08.730> set<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:10.040> you<00:04:11.040> know<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.250> get<00:04:11.430> out<00:04:11.519> you
