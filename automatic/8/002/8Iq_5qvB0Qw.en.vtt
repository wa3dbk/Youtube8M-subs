00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.420
 sealed debt 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.449
 he prefers not a simple reminder to the law 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.119
 and meanwhile after his defeat of transparency at the top of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:27.579
 the head 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.679

 we are supposed to be able to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.580
 belabbas lost most of the kilograms for the railway in the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.840
 blood what we want 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.730
 in the parisian thursday 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.630
 the buzz took place at which the tendency to see themselves first will try 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.780
 so that the course of the ruble to wash and it will fade 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.300
 for being originally it makes things a lot easier and more 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.780
 we advance in this city that I did the next day the part of the supporters of m 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.540
 the day yesterday with a ticket for the quarters it takes you form 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.680
 on i-tv that there is none 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.920
 but again it's not too bad but often it ends up being something 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.650
 very good thing right like that so we'll give them a little bit 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.270
 overflowing 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.170
 than a frank 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.460
 I encourage the hand on the champions' heads right away 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.990
 here in a stadium and a snow plow and humility if there are small is 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.000
 same to hold it in place and of course I do not make the debt 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.520
 the police on his way 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 françois give him an aesthetic answer 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.820
 since it's his title as if it were yesterday 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.399
 thanks to a little bit of all this he can for his part between my hope 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.150
 as well 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.069
 we were not mistaken 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.070
 just to qualify 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.740
 Firstly 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.969
 so like everything so I'm going to talk a great master of his choices en route 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.050
 at first autumnal six different general movements like sarah 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.330
 but while German sales to the finiens and France 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
 in 2000 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:25.969
 don bailey it's a beautiful mess 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.489
 messahel said on the radio I do not make it look like nicely central 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.839
 and I do not want the adage remains that ever a fixed place 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.489
 I'm walking I'm still a difference of minus 22 near 80 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.539
 centimeters 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.589
 so now so i'm going to start using the bad luck before 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:47.499
 I give them a little shot see guest article 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.309
 the jurors all the barriers at first 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.999
 so if you understood how I felt this information will be 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:20.839
 given 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:25.589
 break the eggs issued by the agent gelly I walk I want not next 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.169
 or the other 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.109
 for his life 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.919
 yes it will finally take action the separation yes you can be there 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.739
 will talk to something that marks a breakthrough 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.340
 you can also enjoy as soon as it's a mode 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.309
 the 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.029
 Geneva is not very smart 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.869
 always the same if you feel like it's a little bit envied just a 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:50.570
 little quine we discussed 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.989
 you speak 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.989
 m 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.689
 in this country 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.169
 20h22 long time 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.769
 here and of course there is no more pestle in 22 languages 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.309
 9:20 p.m. 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.309
 and the few points 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.169
 - I want to last like that I was married 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:26.159
 I want to do well 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.139
 for info I am aware that it is 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.530
 it's not obvious because indeed the disillusionment sides 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.530
 from the Atlantic that's why we often need 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.610
 in the device the accessory is possible 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.710
 of ettore another runner power 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.879
 a policeman 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.580
 that's basically the hole 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.659
 Friday 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.449
 and you see 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.730
 christian poyer 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.240
 there was no real investigation carried out during the quarter of 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.980
 final of the handball league finalize them 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.360
 by just making a little good wheat 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.439
 and maybe a little bit on the sides like that the rest 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.999
 good if we do not need 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.699
 I think you will agree with me does not need to be affected so 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.759
 it's just the final touch 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.339
 according to him 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.339
 a little pub shot 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.929
 bigeon initiative and we will make the final touch we do not have the 

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:07.169
 sent from the sale 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.169
 the baby is actually a little strange for a gala match 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.419
 and I'm going to blog the hair on the side 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.319
 then just busy from France 

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:52.120
 that's the result on channel see I think and I hope you see when 

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:55.119
 even the difference compared 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.569
 these are the biggest stages and here they are the most complete and even more 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:02.059
 more natural 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:05.059
 obviously I'm not afraid to try the experiment 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.689
 Is it worth it 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:11.530
 at 9:20 on wet hair as after a putsch in point for example it 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:13.839
 have to wait for the ps2 that was drying 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:15.520
 1 already because 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.479
 the bench the second biggest part count of that day if you wanted a 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.260
 on the synthetic it is necessary to wait for the very dry slope 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.149
 and then anyway that's you but 

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:27.749
 this is definitely putting too much heat because you were trying to 

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:29.419
 chili steel at the same time 

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:30.430
 so it's not me 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.580
 we must be happier when they dry and as you have 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.300
 the case 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.880
 you can also you can believe to give them a little bit 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:39.849
 better 

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:42.899
 the principle is that of this range 

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:47.999
 adept the conditioner his passenger or if you do not have to use a 

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:49.399
 a bit 

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:53.899
 of aubert tel but some officials worked well and then that you 

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:57.680
 will have like that enemies in addition to students even more natural 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.199
 ears 

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:03.629
 movements that interest you and you can customize even better 

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:06.689
 I thank you for listening to me there are 12 billion assets
