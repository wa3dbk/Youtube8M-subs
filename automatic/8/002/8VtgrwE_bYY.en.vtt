00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
to the transition that is necessary for

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
to the transition that is necessary for
the<00:01:12.869> muscle<00:01:13.260> up<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.070> help

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the muscle up is what is going to help

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.359 
the muscle up is what is going to help
you<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.600> full<00:01:15.869> muscle<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.009> that's<00:01:17.130> why

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you get the full muscle up so that's why

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
you get the full muscle up so that's why
you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.700> practice<00:01:18.119> repeats<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.840> this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you can practice repeats of this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.190 
you can practice repeats of this
transition<00:01:20.610> movement<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.540> order<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.110> help

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
transition movement in order to help

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.950 
transition movement in order to help
strengthen<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.159> full<00:01:23.340> muscle<00:01:23.700> up

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
strengthen you for the full muscle up

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
strengthen you for the full muscle up
our<00:01:24.960> next<00:01:25.140> movement<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> jump<00:01:26.159> muscle<00:01:26.490> up

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
our next movement is the jump muscle up

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.340 
our next movement is the jump muscle up
this<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.119> where<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.420> jump<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> top

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
this is where we jump into the top

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.490 
this is where we jump into the top
position<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.250> hold<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.960> add<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
position and hold it you can add in a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410 
position and hold it you can add in a
dip<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.130> point<00:01:32.460> that's<00:01:32.700> perfectly<00:01:33.119> fine

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
dip at this point that's perfectly fine

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.120 
dip at this point that's perfectly fine
over<00:01:34.079> today<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> show<00:01:35.040> you

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
over today I'm just going to show you

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.580 
over today I'm just going to show you
the<00:01:35.280> transition<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.479> jump<00:01:36.900> making<00:01:37.380> sure<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the transition we jump making sure to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.649 
the transition we jump making sure to
keep<00:01:37.710> our<00:01:37.829> elbows<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.450> push

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
keep our elbows in and then we can push

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.649 
keep our elbows in and then we can push
up<00:01:39.840> into<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> top<00:01:40.740> position<00:01:41.450> our<00:01:42.450> next

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
up into the top position our next

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.690 
up into the top position our next
movement<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> low<00:01:43.530> muscle<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.399> once

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
movement is the low muscle up so once

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.389 
movement is the low muscle up so once
you<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.149> all<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.229> transitions<00:01:46.920> that

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
you have all of the transitions that

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.429 
you have all of the transitions that
we've<00:01:47.549> worked<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.090> until<00:01:48.240> now<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.290> can

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
we've worked on up until now you can

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.200 
we've worked on up until now you can
start<00:01:49.740> pulling<00:01:50.220> your<00:01:50.250> legs<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.790> off<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
start pulling your legs up off the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.690 
start pulling your legs up off the
ground<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.780> slight<00:01:52.380> jump<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.979> working<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
ground a slight jump and working on the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.760 
ground a slight jump and working on the
full<00:01:53.970> muscle<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> other

so looking at some of the key points for

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.350 
so looking at some of the key points for
the<00:02:28.290> muscle-up<00:02:28.860> first<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.880> we<00:02:30.150> need<00:02:30.330> to

focus on the baby muscle up that's the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.809 
focus on the baby muscle up that's the
first<00:02:34.019> key<00:02:34.230> point<00:02:34.560> once<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.519> get<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
first key point once you get the

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.570 
first key point once you get the
transition<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.590> baby<00:02:37.830> muscle<00:02:38.280> up<00:02:38.430> with
