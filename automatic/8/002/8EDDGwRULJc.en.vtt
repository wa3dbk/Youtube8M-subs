00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.789

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.950
 servers such as this one that 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:17.760
 is still not updated to that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.720
 version of what we will do is close 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.270
 the one for which it is since it is the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.270

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.580
