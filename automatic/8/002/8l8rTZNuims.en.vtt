see right there which connects over here
to<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.440> mixing<00:01:28.830> power<00:01:29.160> it<00:01:29.640> works<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:30.000> really

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
to the mixing power it works out really

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.600 
to the mixing power it works out really
well<00:01:31.640> what<00:01:32.640> else<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:33.030> got<00:01:33.179> yeah<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:34.580> got<00:01:35.580> a
