00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.459 
I play something on it if I could but
it's<00:02:58.609> kind<00:02:59.609> of<00:02:59.640> beyond<00:02:59.939> me<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.420> even<00:03:01.019> know

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
it's kind of beyond me to even know

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.910 
it's kind of beyond me to even know
where<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.680> start<00:03:01.769> on<00:03:02.069> something<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.400> this

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.900 

then<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.209> sixth<00:03:06.510> string<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:07.430> has<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> nice<00:03:08.670> open

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
then the sixth string it has a nice open

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.520 
then the sixth string it has a nice open
sound<00:03:11.060> but<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.270> played<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> sixth<00:03:13.080> string<00:03:13.319> and

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
sound but just played a sixth string and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.410 
sound but just played a sixth string and
then<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.739> course<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.040> have<00:03:14.220> your<00:03:14.250> your<00:03:15.000> your

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
then of course you have your your your

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.910 
then of course you have your your your
high<00:03:15.630> notes<00:03:17.450> which<00:03:18.450> had<00:03:18.660> some<00:03:19.380> sparkle<00:03:20.420> and

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
high notes which had some sparkle and

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:46.119 
high notes which had some sparkle and
then<00:03:22.920> your<00:03:23.069> deep<00:03:26.330> deep<00:03:27.330> bass<00:03:27.600> notes<00:03:27.959> there

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:52.910 

so<00:03:47.129> that's<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.689> 25<00:03:48.689> string<00:03:50.689> harp<00:03:51.689> guitar<00:03:51.920> based

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
so that's it 25 string harp guitar based

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.209 
so that's it 25 string harp guitar based
on<00:03:53.159> kind<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.639> lute<00:03:53.879> shape
