of<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.060> over<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.299> place<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.689> just

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
of going all over the place but I just

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.780 
of going all over the place but I just
thought<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.250> with<00:01:44.250> those<00:01:44.460> three<00:01:44.610> questions

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
thought that with those three questions

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.170 
thought that with those three questions
I<00:01:45.180> didn't<00:01:45.600> realize<00:01:45.680> that<00:01:46.820> every<00:01:47.820> day<00:01:47.970> doing

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I didn't realize that every day doing

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.620 
I didn't realize that every day doing
those<00:01:49.009> would<00:01:50.009> make<00:01:50.310> me<00:01:50.490> realize<00:01:50.909> other<00:01:51.240> things

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
those would make me realize other things

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.569 
those would make me realize other things
I<00:01:51.960> don't<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.890> sounds<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> lot<00:01:53.280> but

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
I don't know that sounds like a lot but

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.179 
I don't know that sounds like a lot but
after<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.360> every<00:01:55.140> day<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> was<00:01:55.740> kind<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.040> like

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
after I every day I was kind of like

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.289 
after I every day I was kind of like
writing<00:01:56.430> something<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.090> oh<00:01:57.180> my

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
writing something down on like oh my

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.969 
writing something down on like oh my
gosh<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.079> realized<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.649> want<00:01:58.890> myself

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
gosh I just realized just want myself

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.719 
gosh I just realized just want myself
and<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.020> separate<00:02:01.020> paper<00:02:01.729> wrote

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and so I on a separate paper wrote

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.209 
and so I on a separate paper wrote
realizations<00:02:03.360> about<00:02:03.450> myself<00:02:03.780> um<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
realizations about myself um for the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.980 
realizations about myself um for the
week<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.210> condensed<00:02:06.659> she

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
week and now I have just a condensed she

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.869 
week and now I have just a condensed she
of<00:02:07.170> realizations<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.069> think<00:02:08.399> what<00:02:08.759> we're

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
of realizations so I think what we're

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.029 
of realizations so I think what we're
going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.989> three

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
going to do is we have the three

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.610 
going to do is we have the three
questions<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.310> our

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
questions on our

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.190 
questions on our
website<00:02:11.920> um<00:02:12.250> go<00:02:13.150> if<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.480> go<00:02:13.599> subscribe<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.110> our

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.380 
website um go if you go subscribe to our
website<00:02:14.349> you'll<00:02:14.890> get<00:02:15.159> a<00:02:15.340> copy<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.090> and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
website you'll get a copy of that and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.580 
website you'll get a copy of that and
you<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.569> either<00:02:16.659> print<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.019> out<00:02:17.110> or<00:02:17.170> put<00:02:17.379> it<00:02:17.470> on

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
you can either print it out or put it on

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.869 
you can either print it out or put it on
your<00:02:17.680> phone<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.069> fill<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.340> out<00:02:18.430> whatever<00:02:18.670> is

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
your phone and fill it out whatever is

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.059 
your phone and fill it out whatever is
easiest<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.319> think<00:02:20.650> we're<00:02:20.739> going<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.920> put

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
easiest but I think we're going to put

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.949 
easiest but I think we're going to put
together<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.430> realization<00:02:22.030> sheet<00:02:22.330> as<00:02:22.510> well<00:02:22.690> I

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
together a realization sheet as well I

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.570 
together a realization sheet as well I
don't<00:02:23.170> want<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.349> get<00:02:23.440> too<00:02:23.709> carried<00:02:24.220> away<00:02:24.370> with

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
don't want to get too carried away with

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.589 
don't want to get too carried away with
this<00:02:24.700> kind<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:24.970> stuff<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.239> don't<00:02:25.299> want<00:02:25.510> to

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
this kind of stuff I don't want to

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.470 
this kind of stuff I don't want to
bombard<00:02:26.170> bombard<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:27.849> do<00:02:27.970> really

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
bombard bombard you but I do really

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.699 
bombard bombard you but I do really
think<00:02:28.599> this<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.019> actually<00:02:29.170> really<00:02:29.379> really

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
think this is actually really really

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.100 
think this is actually really really
important<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.400> realizations<00:02:30.970> it's<00:02:31.840> kind<00:02:32.079> of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
important the realizations it's kind of

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.720 
important the realizations it's kind of
just<00:02:32.230> condensing<00:02:32.829> everything<00:02:33.280> from<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.549> week

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
just condensing everything from the week

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.089 
just condensing everything from the week
on<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.690> realization<00:02:35.200> she<00:02:35.409> the<00:02:35.590> realizations

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
on to realization she the realizations

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.089 
on to realization she the realizations
from<00:02:36.400> exercising<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.569> realized<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.620> am

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
from exercising I realized that I I am

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.920 
from exercising I realized that I I am
out<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.250> shape<00:02:39.370> but<00:02:40.120> I'm<00:02:40.269> stronger<00:02:40.690> than<00:02:40.720> I

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
out of shape but I'm stronger than I

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.750 
out of shape but I'm stronger than I
think<00:02:41.049> I<00:02:41.379> am<00:02:41.409> if<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.799> even<00:02:42.040> makes<00:02:42.069> sense<00:02:42.459> I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
think I am if that even makes sense I

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.550 
think I am if that even makes sense I
also<00:02:43.150> realize<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.540> what<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.780> when<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.170> go<00:02:44.379> work

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
also realize that what I when I go work

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.940 
also realize that what I when I go work
out<00:02:44.739> it's<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:46.209> really<00:02:46.510> really<00:02:46.690> easy<00:02:47.049> to

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
out it's really really really easy to

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.130 
out it's really really really easy to
compare<00:02:48.910> yourself<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.480> start<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.840> make<00:02:49.959> it

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
compare yourself and start to make it

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.920 
compare yourself and start to make it
like<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.319> vain<00:02:50.680> thing<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.459> want<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.120> try<00:02:52.690> and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
like a vain thing and I want to try and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.080 
like a vain thing and I want to try and
make<00:02:53.250> exercising<00:02:54.250> more<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.549> a<00:02:54.640> spiritual

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
make exercising more of a spiritual

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.000 
make exercising more of a spiritual
thing<00:02:55.299> don't<00:02:55.720> compare<00:02:56.260> yourself<00:02:56.379> to<00:02:56.709> other

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
thing don't compare yourself to other

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.069 
thing don't compare yourself to other
people<00:02:57.129> because<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.849> see<00:02:58.390> girls<00:02:58.629> then<00:02:58.780> like<00:02:58.930> all

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
people because I see girls then like all

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.140 
people because I see girls then like all

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
she's got a rockin body and good for her

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.910 
she's got a rockin body and good for her
I<00:03:01.450> mean<00:03:01.659> that's<00:03:01.750> awesome<00:03:02.140> but<00:03:02.560> then<00:03:02.709> I'd<00:03:02.769> start

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
I mean that's awesome but then I'd start

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.460 
I mean that's awesome but then I'd start
to<00:03:03.069> get<00:03:03.159> down<00:03:03.310> on<00:03:03.340> myself<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:03.989> that's<00:03:04.989> just

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
to get down on myself and that's just

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.199 
to get down on myself and that's just
not<00:03:05.709> what<00:03:05.859> it's<00:03:06.010> about<00:03:06.069> that's<00:03:06.640> not<00:03:06.970> what<00:03:07.090> it's

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
not what it's about that's not what it's

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.059 
not what it's about that's not what it's
about<00:03:07.269> it's<00:03:07.750> about<00:03:07.930> feeling<00:03:08.319> better<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.920> so

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
about it's about feeling better and so

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.640 
about it's about feeling better and so
that's<00:03:09.220> why<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.609> second<00:03:10.299> question<00:03:10.480> do<00:03:11.379> I<00:03:11.440> feel

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
that's why the second question do I feel

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.369 
that's why the second question do I feel
better<00:03:11.799> about<00:03:11.950> myself<00:03:12.120> inside<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.299> out<00:03:13.420> plays

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
better about myself inside and out plays
