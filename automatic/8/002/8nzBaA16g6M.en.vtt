in<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.140> segment<00:00:01.319> we're<00:00:01.620> going<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.829> cover<00:00:02.070> how

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
in this segment we're going to cover how

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.519 
in this segment we're going to cover how
to<00:00:02.610> write<00:00:02.909> good<00:00:03.179> dialogue<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.259> brought<00:00:04.470> you

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
to write good dialogue and I brought you

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.670 
to write good dialogue and I brought you
out<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.770> our<00:00:05.100> quiet<00:00:05.759> out-of-the-way<00:00:06.089> location

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
out to our quiet out-of-the-way location

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.040 
out to our quiet out-of-the-way location
because<00:00:07.680> with<00:00:08.280> dialogue<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.450> best<00:00:09.719> thing<00:00:09.929> is

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
because with dialogue the best thing is

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.680 
because with dialogue the best thing is
to<00:00:10.469> hear<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.099> instead<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.790> sitting<00:00:12.360> and

across with fewer words and that meant

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.720 
across with fewer words and that meant
more<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:12.600> you<00:04:13.080> see<00:04:13.350> it's<00:04:13.920> more<00:04:14.190> real<00:04:14.459> than

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
more and you see it's more real than

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.250 
more and you see it's more real than
just<00:04:14.970> talking<00:04:15.240> so<00:04:15.569> as<00:04:15.660> much<00:04:15.810> as<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.049> can<00:04:16.139> get
