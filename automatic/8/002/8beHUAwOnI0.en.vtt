into<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.860> picture<00:04:42.069> you<00:04:42.430> know<00:04:43.199> it's<00:04:44.199> just<00:04:44.319> like

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
into the picture you know it's just like

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:53.660 
into the picture you know it's just like
having<00:04:44.650> petals<00:04:45.160> man<00:04:45.400> like<00:04:45.729> you<00:04:45.970> know

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:05.300 

I<00:05:03.260> could<00:05:04.260> see<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:04.500> really<00:05:04.800> useful<00:05:05.190> and

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
I could see that really useful and

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.400 
I could see that really useful and
recording<00:05:05.790> especially<00:05:06.600> you<00:05:06.900> know<00:05:07.050> that's

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
recording especially you know that's

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.410 
recording especially you know that's
what<00:05:07.590> my<00:05:08.100> school<00:05:08.460> where<00:05:08.700> I<00:05:08.730> come<00:05:08.970> from<00:05:09.000> is<00:05:09.390> that

what my school where I come from is that

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.570 
what my school where I come from is that
that<00:05:09.810> kind<00:05:10.050> of<00:05:10.170> digging<00:05:10.560> in<00:05:11.810> style<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:13.230> um<00:05:13.620> you

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
that kind of digging in style and um you

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.370 
that kind of digging in style and um you
know<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:14.880> that<00:05:15.090> can<00:05:15.270> help<00:05:15.480> with<00:05:15.690> distortion

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
know that that can help with distortion

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:42.790 
know that that can help with distortion
you<00:05:16.530> know<00:05:17.120> set<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:18.150> up<00:05:37.160> what's<00:05:38.160> cool<00:05:38.400> too

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800
