00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
I mean by that is when a deer is beyond

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.700 
I mean by that is when a deer is beyond
25<00:00:10.889> yards<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.519> start<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.120> anticipate<00:00:12.570> how<00:00:13.469> much

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
25 yards I start to anticipate how much

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.220 
25 yards I start to anticipate how much
it's<00:00:13.920> going<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.250> drop<00:00:14.700> from<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.630> sound<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.080> my

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
it's going to drop from the sound of my

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.010 
it's going to drop from the sound of my
bow<00:00:16.440> going<00:00:16.800> off<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.160> deer<00:00:17.670> when<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.359> drops<00:00:18.690> in

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
bow going off a deer when it drops in

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.230 
bow going off a deer when it drops in
reacts<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.619> sound<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.400> generally<00:00:20.910> will<00:00:21.000> go<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
reacts to sound it generally will go a

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.509 
reacts to sound it generally will go a
full<00:00:21.840> body<00:00:22.109> height<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.769> if<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> belly

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
full body height so if this is the belly

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.820 
full body height so if this is the belly
and<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> back<00:00:24.330> its<00:00:24.840> back<00:00:25.140> will<00:00:25.619> be

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and this is the back its back will be

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.009 
and this is the back its back will be
where<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.279> belly<00:00:26.730> was<00:00:27.029> by<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.449> time<00:00:27.539> it

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
where the belly was by the time it

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.919 
where the belly was by the time it
finishes<00:00:28.529> its<00:00:28.830> squat<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:30.029> if<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.269> deer<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.660> about

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
finishes its squat so if a deer is about

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.990 
finishes its squat so if a deer is about
30<00:00:31.260> yards<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.830> sometimes<00:00:32.160> they'll<00:00:32.550> aim<00:00:32.730> about

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
30 yards I sometimes they'll aim about

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.590 
30 yards I sometimes they'll aim about
28<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.290> when<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> deer<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> 35<00:00:35.610> yards<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.239> put<00:00:36.450> my

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
28 but when a deer is 35 yards I put my

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900 
28 but when a deer is 35 yards I put my
30-yard<00:00:37.230> pin<00:00:37.500> right<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.160> heart<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
30-yard pin right on the heart which is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
what I thought was an eight pointer

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.860 
what I thought was an eight pointer
because<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.399> only<00:01:02.550> got<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> side<00:01:03.239> view<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
because I only got a side view of this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.370

buck one time well as I was about to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.380 
buck one time well as I was about to
find<00:01:07.560> out<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.159> actually<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> five<00:01:08.909> pointer

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
find out it was actually a five pointer

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.149 
find out it was actually a five pointer
but<00:01:09.960> anyway<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.710> said<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.040> was<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
but anyway like I said it was a

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.640
