hey what's up guys Alex drops and I'm
back<00:00:02.490> with<00:00:02.700> an<00:00:02.820> update<00:00:02.909> on<00:00:03.120> this<00:00:03.510> canon<00:00:04.020> that<00:00:04.589> i

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
back with an update on this canon that i

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.349 
back with an update on this canon that i
released<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.069> few<00:00:05.220> days<00:00:05.400> ago<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.700> have<00:00:06.089> improved

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
released a few days ago I have improved

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.230 
released a few days ago I have improved
it<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.930> I've<00:00:07.740> added<00:00:08.099> an<00:00:08.429> aiming<00:00:08.820> function

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
it and I've added an aiming function

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.720 
it and I've added an aiming function
completely<00:00:10.080> different<00:00:10.320> design<00:00:10.620> took<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.550> lot

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
completely different design took a lot

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.430 
completely different design took a lot
of<00:00:11.759> tinkering<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.630> lot<00:00:12.929> longer<00:00:13.110> than<00:00:13.410> I

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
of tinkering and a lot longer than I

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.570 
of tinkering and a lot longer than I
thought<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.710> would<00:00:13.860> take<00:00:14.070> but<00:00:14.219> I've<00:00:14.340> had<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> lot

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
thought it would take but I've had a lot

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.330 
thought it would take but I've had a lot
of<00:00:14.700> time<00:00:14.969> on<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:15.179> hands<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:16.020> I've<00:00:16.890> made<00:00:17.220> it

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
of time on my hands and I've made it

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.720 
of time on my hands and I've made it
down<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> about<00:00:17.820> seven<00:00:18.180> by<00:00:18.270> seven<00:00:18.570> by<00:00:18.690> five<00:00:19.730> if

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
down to about seven by seven by five if

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.640 
down to about seven by seven by five if
you<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.970> see<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.869> anything<00:00:22.410> that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
you can see here we have anything that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.800 
you can see here we have anything that
would<00:00:22.769> activate<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.310> left<00:00:23.519> canons<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.180> over

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
would activate the left canons and over

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.509 
would activate the left canons and over
here<00:00:24.990> would<00:00:25.140> activate<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> right<00:00:25.740> canons<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
here would activate the right canons and

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.279 
here would activate the right canons and
then<00:00:26.699> we<00:00:26.789> still<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.210> our<00:00:27.240> range<00:00:27.660> selection

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
then we still have our range selection

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.740 
then we still have our range selection
over<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> pretty<00:00:30.330> modest

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
over here and it's at a pretty modest

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.959 
over here and it's at a pretty modest
size<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:31.830> very<00:00:32.040> usable<00:00:32.579> still

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.549 

I'll<00:00:35.969> give<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> big<00:00:36.540> overview<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
I'll give you a big overview of the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.700 
I'll give you a big overview of the
Canon<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.300> not<00:00:39.300> too<00:00:39.510> big<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.930> think<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.230> took

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
Canon it's not too big I think it's took

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.790 
Canon it's not too big I think it's took
a<00:00:40.800> long<00:00:41.070> time<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.340> compact<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.620> let's<00:00:43.620> give

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
a long time to compact it and let's give

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.520 
a long time to compact it and let's give
it<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.980> few<00:00:44.010> shots<00:00:44.520> here<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:45.530> personal

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
it a few shots here in personal

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.830 
it a few shots here in personal
experience<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.670> testing<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.329> figured

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
experience and testing I have figured

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.139 
experience and testing I have figured
out<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.280> it's<00:00:50.280> better<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.969> both

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
out that it's better if you have both

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.240 
out that it's better if you have both
canons<00:00:51.600> activated<00:00:52.140> rather<00:00:52.350> than<00:00:52.620> none<00:00:52.860> if

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
canons activated rather than none if

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.000 
canons activated rather than none if
you're<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> straight<00:00:54.300> shot<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> so

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you're going for a straight shot and so

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.319 
you're going for a straight shot and so
if<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.340> do<00:00:56.489> full<00:00:56.730> power<00:00:56.969> here<00:01:01.969> and<00:01:02.969> you'll

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
if we just do full power here and you'll

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.969 
if we just do full power here and you'll
see<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.690> goes<00:01:03.870> pretty<00:01:04.260> far

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
see it goes pretty far

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.359 
see it goes pretty far
you<00:01:05.970> also<00:01:06.090> notice<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.659> only<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:07.049> three<00:01:07.530> range

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
you also notice I only have three range

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.070 
you also notice I only have three range
selectors<00:01:08.850> instead<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.299> four<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.960> was

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
selectors instead of four and that was

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.100 
selectors instead of four and that was
mainly<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.530> conserve<00:01:10.860> space<00:01:11.840> now<00:01:12.840> we'll<00:01:12.990> do

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
mainly to conserve space now we'll do

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
mainly to conserve space now we'll do
the<00:01:13.170> lightest<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:19.040> you<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.189> sacrifice<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> bit

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the lightest one you do sacrifice a bit

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
the lightest one you do sacrifice a bit
of<00:01:21.119> accuracy<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.990> design<00:01:22.380> because<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
of accuracy for this design because the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.969 
of accuracy for this design because the
TNT<00:01:23.549> has<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> fall<00:01:24.030> freely<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.830> let's

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
TNT has to fall freely here now let's

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.620 
TNT has to fall freely here now let's
try<00:01:26.220> aiming<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.030> let's<00:01:27.150> try<00:01:27.390> only

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
try aiming it a bit and let's try only

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.580 
try aiming it a bit and let's try only
having<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.140> left<00:01:28.470> activated<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.409> you'll

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
having the left activated and as you'll

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.090 
having the left activated and as you'll
see<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.799> only<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> left<00:01:32.610> TNT<00:01:33.060> came<00:01:33.479> out

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
see you only to the left TNT came out

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
see you only to the left TNT came out
and<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.250> shot<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> right<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.720> would

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and it shot to the right as you would

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.640 
and it shot to the right as you would
expect<00:01:37.100> now<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.400> turn<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.790> off<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.650> turn

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
expect now if we turn this off and turn

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.440 
expect now if we turn this off and turn
this<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:43.549> only<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.880> right<00:01:45.030> side<00:01:45.060> will<00:01:45.329> come

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
this on only the right side will come

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.590 
this on only the right side will come
out<00:01:49.340> seems<00:01:50.340> pretty<00:01:50.520> simple<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.390> reality

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
out seems pretty simple but in reality

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.710 
out seems pretty simple but in reality
it<00:01:51.930> took<00:01:52.140> way<00:01:52.649> longer<00:01:52.680> than<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.220> thought<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.729> if

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it took way longer than I thought and if

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.999 
it took way longer than I thought and if
you're<00:01:54.869> curious<00:01:55.110> about<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.710> did<00:01:55.860> not

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
you're curious about this I did not

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.560 
you're curious about this I did not
include<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.670> row<00:01:56.939> as<00:01:57.210> part<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
include this row as part of the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.020 
include this row as part of the
dimensions<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.399> remove<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
dimensions because you can remove it and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.670 
dimensions because you can remove it and
it'll<00:02:00.240> work<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.540> fine<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it'll work just fine but I like it a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.109 
it'll work just fine but I like it a
little<00:02:01.799> bit<00:02:02.040> neater<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.610> kept<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:02.909> row

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
little bit neater so I kept this row

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.230 
little bit neater so I kept this row
here<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.540> water<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.409> fall<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:04.920> fine

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
here the water can fall in and be fine

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.880 
here the water can fall in and be fine
so<00:02:06.240> without<00:02:06.390> further<00:02:06.630> ado<00:02:06.960> let's<00:02:07.259> get<00:02:07.649> into

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
so without further ado let's get into

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.990 
so without further ado let's get into
building<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:10.310> alright<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.489> we<00:02:11.610> found<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> nice

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
building it alright so we found a nice

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.430 
building it alright so we found a nice
little<00:02:12.180> spot<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.660> build<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.140> I'm<00:02:13.230> going<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
little spot to build it I'm going to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.070 
little spot to build it I'm going to
start<00:02:13.739> off<00:02:13.920> by<00:02:14.459> placing<00:02:15.090> our<00:02:15.300> panel<00:02:15.920> whoops

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
start off by placing our panel whoops

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.630 
start off by placing our panel whoops
of<00:02:19.080> course<00:02:19.410> these<00:02:19.620> colors<00:02:20.010> aren't<00:02:20.250> necessary

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
of course these colors aren't necessary

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.869 
of course these colors aren't necessary
you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.790> use<00:02:20.970> any<00:02:21.150> block<00:02:21.510> which<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.840> choose

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
you can use any block which you choose

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.610 
you can use any block which you choose
however<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:24.330> would<00:02:24.480> suggest<00:02:24.720> using<00:02:25.140> redstone

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
however I would suggest using redstone

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.110 
however I would suggest using redstone
lamps<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.310> easy<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.700> tell<00:02:26.970> when

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
lamps because it's easy to tell when

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.860 
lamps because it's easy to tell when
they<00:02:27.239> are<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.569> for<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.470> aiming<00:02:28.980> feature<00:02:32.870> like

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
they are on for the aiming feature like

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.320 
they are on for the aiming feature like
that<00:02:34.550> now<00:02:35.550> we're<00:02:35.640> gonna<00:02:35.730> need<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:35.910> bunch<00:02:36.209> of

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
that now we're gonna need a bunch of

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.880 
that now we're gonna need a bunch of
different<00:02:36.660> redstone<00:02:37.050> things<00:02:37.349> here<00:02:37.709> let's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
different redstone things here let's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.880 
different redstone things here let's
start<00:02:38.220> off<00:02:38.340> by<00:02:38.690> placing<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.959> row<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.470> redstone

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
start off by placing a row of redstone

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.660 
start off by placing a row of redstone
along<00:02:41.129> here<00:02:41.849> I'm<00:02:42.720> gonna<00:02:43.140> get<00:02:43.379> these<00:02:43.950> Graywolf

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
along here I'm gonna get these Graywolf

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
along here I'm gonna get these Graywolf
as<00:02:45.000> our<00:02:45.840> building<00:02:46.170> block<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:48.150> should<00:02:48.360> be<00:02:48.450> all

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
as our building block it should be all

for the aiming part blocks all around
here<00:03:36.420> now<00:03:37.420> it's<00:03:37.599> time<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.970> do<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.390> said<00:03:40.629> aiming

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
here now it's time to do the said aiming

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.339 
here now it's time to do the said aiming
thing<00:03:41.970> right<00:03:42.970> under<00:03:43.269> each<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.660> these<00:03:43.810> redstone

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
thing right under each of these redstone

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.300 
thing right under each of these redstone
lamps<00:03:44.680> place<00:03:44.950> three<00:03:45.489> dust<00:03:46.180> coming<00:03:46.629> out<00:03:47.310> and

lamps place three dust coming out and

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.229 
lamps place three dust coming out and
get<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.790> sticky<00:03:49.150> piston<00:03:50.519> with<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.549> block<00:03:51.849> on<00:03:52.060> top

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
get a sticky piston with a block on top

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.559 
get a sticky piston with a block on top
and<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:53.230> block<00:03:53.470> right<00:03:53.650> here<00:03:54.569> comparator

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
and a block right here comparator

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:04.259 
and a block right here comparator
redstone<00:04:01.079> redstone<00:04:02.079> and<00:04:02.709> redstone<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:04.030> so

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
redstone redstone and redstone and so

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.940 
redstone redstone and redstone and so
whenever<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:04.599> turn<00:04:04.750> this<00:04:04.870> on<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.590> signal

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
whenever you turn this on the signal

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.500 
whenever you turn this on the signal
will<00:04:06.040> go<00:04:06.130> through<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.579> block<00:04:07.180> from<00:04:07.360> the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
will go through the block from the

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.479 
will go through the block from the
piston<00:04:07.870> but<00:04:08.349> if<00:04:08.470> it's<00:04:08.620> off<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:09.010> won't<00:04:09.250> and

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
piston but if it's off it won't and

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.729 
piston but if it's off it won't and
that's<00:04:09.819> simply<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.510> little<00:04:11.379> toggle<00:04:13.500> same<00:04:14.500> thing

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
that's simply a little toggle same thing

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:27.629 
that's simply a little toggle same thing
on<00:04:14.860> this<00:04:14.950> side

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.830 

and<00:04:28.120> you'll<00:04:28.389> notice<00:04:28.569> a<00:04:28.629> little<00:04:28.719> bit

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
and you'll notice a little bit

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.179 
and you'll notice a little bit
interference<00:04:29.409> they're<00:04:29.560> gonna<00:04:29.800> do<00:04:29.919> this<00:04:29.979> place

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:30.189 
interference they're gonna do this place

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.959 
interference they're gonna do this place
a<00:04:30.219> block<00:04:31.439> and<00:04:32.439> for<00:04:33.039> the<00:04:33.129> most<00:04:33.310> part<00:04:33.550> we're<00:04:33.669> done

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:33.969 
a block and for the most part we're done

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.790 
a block and for the most part we're done
except<00:04:35.219> the<00:04:36.219> TNT<00:04:36.849> that<00:04:37.210> shoots<00:04:37.449> out<00:04:37.599> and<00:04:37.960> this

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
except the TNT that shoots out and this

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.850 
except the TNT that shoots out and this
little<00:04:39.069> delay<00:04:39.789> or<00:04:40.270> subtraction<00:04:41.110> factor<00:04:41.620> over

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
little delay or subtraction factor over

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.760 
little delay or subtraction factor over
here<00:04:42.810> we're<00:04:43.810> gonna<00:04:43.870> need<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.319> subtract<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
here we're gonna need to subtract the

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.170 
here we're gonna need to subtract the
signal<00:04:45.129> from<00:04:45.250> something<00:04:45.729> and<00:04:45.879> there's<00:04:46.030> not

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
signal from something and there's not

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.929 
signal from something and there's not
enough<00:04:46.389> room<00:04:46.629> to<00:04:46.870> make<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.020> wire<00:04:47.259> redstone<00:04:47.949> so

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
enough room to make a wire redstone so

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:50.339 
enough room to make a wire redstone so
I've<00:04:49.300> come<00:04:49.539> to<00:04:49.569> the<00:04:49.659> conclusion<00:04:50.139> that<00:04:50.169> a

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
I've come to the conclusion that a

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.899 
I've come to the conclusion that a
hopper<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.979> your<00:04:51.159> best<00:04:51.340> choice

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
hopper is your best choice

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.170 
hopper is your best choice
put<00:04:52.509> a<00:04:52.539> hopper<00:04:52.960> into<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.379> comparator<00:04:54.009> into<00:04:54.550> the

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
put a hopper into a comparator into the

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.869 
put a hopper into a comparator into the
subtracting<00:04:55.780> comparator<00:04:56.319> over<00:04:56.530> here<00:04:56.879> and

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:57.879 
subtracting comparator over here and

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:00.059 
subtracting comparator over here and
you're<00:04:58.180> actually<00:04:58.419> gonna<00:04:58.509> need<00:04:58.719> four<00:04:59.259> sets<00:04:59.919> of

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
you're actually gonna need four sets of

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.490 
you're actually gonna need four sets of
any<00:05:00.219> block<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.669> want<00:05:00.870> I'll<00:05:01.870> choose<00:05:02.229> dirt

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
any block you want I'll choose dirt

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.080 
any block you want I'll choose dirt
because<00:05:02.770> it's<00:05:02.919> cheap<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:05.610> all<00:05:06.610> four<00:05:06.879> of<00:05:06.909> those

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
because it's cheap and all four of those

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.540 
because it's cheap and all four of those
will<00:05:07.360> be<00:05:07.479> enough<00:05:07.840> so<00:05:08.349> the<00:05:08.469> signal<00:05:08.889> will<00:05:09.430> go

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
will be enough so the signal will go

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.189 
will be enough so the signal will go
either<00:05:09.849> two<00:05:10.090> blocks<00:05:11.069> one<00:05:12.069> block<00:05:12.779> or<00:05:13.779> three

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
either two blocks one block or three

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:21.929 
either two blocks one block or three
blocks<00:05:16.349> now<00:05:17.349> the<00:05:17.409> final<00:05:17.979> thing<00:05:18.279> is<00:05:20.939> actually

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:21.939 
blocks now the final thing is actually

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.149 
blocks now the final thing is actually
we'll<00:05:22.029> get<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.419> that<00:05:22.500> when<00:05:23.500> we<00:05:23.650> need<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.830> get<00:05:24.039> to

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
we'll get to that when we need to get to

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.189 
we'll get to that when we need to get to
that<00:05:24.279> go<00:05:24.639> ahead<00:05:24.699> and<00:05:24.819> place<00:05:25.090> a<00:05:25.360> bro<00:05:25.599> blocks<00:05:25.930> up

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
that go ahead and place a bro blocks up

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:32.219 
that go ahead and place a bro blocks up
here<00:05:28.740> off<00:05:29.740> to<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:30.039> left<00:05:30.310> side<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:30.960> just<00:05:31.960> in

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
here off to the left side I just in

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.119 
here off to the left side I just in
there<00:05:32.469> they're<00:05:32.740> a<00:05:34.259> bunch<00:05:35.259> of<00:05:35.440> repeaters<00:05:35.800> just

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
there they're a bunch of repeaters just

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:37.469 
there they're a bunch of repeaters just
all<00:05:36.339> need<00:05:36.580> to<00:05:36.639> be<00:05:36.759> on<00:05:36.789> the<00:05:36.940> fourth<00:05:37.180> delay

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
all need to be on the fourth delay

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.499 
all need to be on the fourth delay
because<00:05:38.349> TNT<00:05:38.830> takes<00:05:39.219> four<00:05:39.639> seconds<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:40.150> night

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
because TNT takes four seconds to night

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.450 
because TNT takes four seconds to night
I<00:05:40.539> believe<00:05:40.870> and<00:05:41.139> we're<00:05:41.500> gonna<00:05:41.650> need<00:05:41.860> a<00:05:41.889> short

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
I believe and we're gonna need a short

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:53.080 
I believe and we're gonna need a short
delay<00:05:42.580> for<00:05:42.789> that<00:05:44.550> put<00:05:45.550> that<00:05:45.669> into<00:05:45.789> a<00:05:45.879> block

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.450 

with<00:05:53.720> delay<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:56.020> then<00:05:57.020> -<00:05:57.320> here<00:05:57.740> put<00:05:58.130> one<00:05:58.190> of

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
with delay and then - here put one of

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.870 
with delay and then - here put one of
them<00:05:58.580> on<00:05:58.700> a<00:05:58.730> -<00:05:59.150> delay<00:05:59.450> and<00:05:59.690> one<00:05:59.840> of<00:05:59.930> them<00:06:00.110> on<00:06:00.260> one

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.770 

and<00:06:05.110> now<00:06:06.110> dispenser<00:06:06.830> there<00:06:07.070> and<00:06:07.480> we<00:06:08.480> are

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
and now dispenser there and we are

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.280 
and now dispenser there and we are
pretty<00:06:09.080> much<00:06:09.200> done<00:06:09.880> if<00:06:10.880> you<00:06:11.420> want<00:06:11.660> you<00:06:11.840> can<00:06:11.960> go

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
pretty much done if you want you can go

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.600 
pretty much done if you want you can go
ahead<00:06:12.410> and<00:06:12.590> count<00:06:12.800> this<00:06:12.890> that's<00:06:13.100> finished<00:06:13.460> and

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
ahead and count this that's finished and

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.280 
ahead and count this that's finished and
place<00:06:13.790> your<00:06:13.940> water<00:06:14.150> or<00:06:14.510> if<00:06:14.870> you<00:06:14.990> want<00:06:15.140> to<00:06:15.170> add

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
place your water or if you want to add

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.770 
place your water or if you want to add
an<00:06:15.380> extra<00:06:15.620> row<00:06:15.860> it's<00:06:16.340> not<00:06:16.550> necessary<00:06:17.120> to<00:06:17.360> make

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
an extra row it's not necessary to make

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.450 
an extra row it's not necessary to make
it<00:06:17.870> look<00:06:17.960> a<00:06:18.020> little<00:06:18.110> bit<00:06:18.320> neater<00:06:18.470> by

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
it look a little bit neater by

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.160 
it look a little bit neater by
containing<00:06:19.910> the<00:06:20.150> water<00:06:20.330> rather<00:06:20.840> than<00:06:20.990> having

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
containing the water rather than having

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.640 
containing the water rather than having
flow<00:06:21.530> down<00:06:22.930> you<00:06:23.930> can<00:06:24.050> go<00:06:24.140> ahead<00:06:24.230> and<00:06:24.350> do<00:06:24.500> that

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
flow down you can go ahead and do that

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.780 
flow down you can go ahead and do that
as<00:06:24.770> well

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.470 

and<00:06:32.170> your<00:06:33.170> water<00:06:33.350> should<00:06:33.620> be<00:06:34.090> in<00:06:35.090> this<00:06:35.240> whole

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480 
and your water should be in this whole

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.590 
and your water should be in this whole
little<00:06:35.600> hit<00:06:36.080> right<00:06:36.380> there<00:06:37.330> I'm<00:06:38.330> not<00:06:38.480> gonna

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
little hit right there I'm not gonna

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.290 
little hit right there I'm not gonna
make<00:06:38.780> you<00:06:39.050> watch<00:06:39.320> me<00:06:39.350> put<00:06:39.890> all<00:06:39.980> this<00:06:40.130> TNT<00:06:43.300> but

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
make you watch me put all this TNT but

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.790 
make you watch me put all this TNT but
now<00:06:44.420> we're<00:06:44.570> all<00:06:44.660> loaded<00:06:44.870> up<00:06:45.050> and<00:06:45.260> we're<00:06:45.710> ready

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
now we're all loaded up and we're ready

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.940 
now we're all loaded up and we're ready
to<00:06:46.100> give<00:06:46.340> it<00:06:46.430> a<00:06:46.490> few<00:06:46.670> shots<00:06:47.650> if<00:06:48.650> I<00:06:48.800> haven't

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:48.950 
to give it a few shots if I haven't

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.950 
to give it a few shots if I haven't
mentioned<00:06:49.130> already<00:06:49.510> we're<00:06:50.510> going<00:06:50.660> for<00:06:50.900> a

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
mentioned already we're going for a

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.020 
mentioned already we're going for a
straight<00:06:51.260> shot<00:06:51.560> it's<00:06:51.830> better<00:06:52.070> to<00:06:52.280> have<00:06:52.430> both

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
straight shot it's better to have both

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.510 
straight shot it's better to have both
of<00:06:53.060> these<00:06:53.390> on<00:06:53.750> rather<00:06:54.110> than<00:06:54.350> off<00:06:54.590> we're<00:06:55.370> just

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
of these on rather than off we're just

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.040 
of these on rather than off we're just
add<00:06:55.700> to<00:06:55.850> the<00:06:55.880> range<00:06:56.210> and<00:06:56.450> a<00:06:56.600> little<00:06:56.810> bit<00:06:56.900> more

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
add to the range and a little bit more

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.620 
add to the range and a little bit more
accuracy<00:07:00.400> and<00:07:01.400> you'll<00:07:01.850> see<00:07:02.030> that's<00:07:02.240> pretty

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
accuracy and you'll see that's pretty

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.780 
accuracy and you'll see that's pretty
straight<00:07:03.730> if<00:07:04.730> you<00:07:04.880> want<00:07:05.120> I<00:07:05.300> don't<00:07:05.600> I<00:07:06.640> have<00:07:07.640> the

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:07.790 
straight if you want I don't I have the

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.510 
straight if you want I don't I have the
right<00:07:07.820> cannon<00:07:08.300> toggle<00:07:08.690> one<00:07:09.100> it<00:07:10.100> will<00:07:10.220> shoot<00:07:10.400> to

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
right cannon toggle one it will shoot to

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:25.860 
right cannon toggle one it will shoot to
the<00:07:10.580> left<00:07:17.500> and<00:07:19.840> opposite<00:07:20.840> way

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.080 

and<00:07:26.870> that's<00:07:27.290> just<00:07:27.380> about<00:07:27.590> it<00:07:27.940> so<00:07:28.940> I'm<00:07:29.060> pretty

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090 
and that's just about it so I'm pretty

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.450 
and that's just about it so I'm pretty
proud<00:07:29.390> of<00:07:29.450> this<00:07:29.660> and<00:07:29.960> I<00:07:30.680> hope<00:07:30.980> you<00:07:31.160> guys<00:07:31.220> like
