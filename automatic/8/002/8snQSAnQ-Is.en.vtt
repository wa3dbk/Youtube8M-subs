clearance

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.969 
clearance
I<00:01:48.130> think<00:01:48.880> Fiat<00:01:49.479> really<00:01:49.810> have<00:01:50.140> hit<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.619> nail<00:01:50.649> on

the head with the styling of the new
Panda<00:01:53.410> 4x4<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:54.580> chunky<00:01:55.090> bumpers<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.050> way

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
Panda 4x4 the chunky bumpers and the way

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.020 
Panda 4x4 the chunky bumpers and the way
they've<00:01:56.530> got<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.950> law<00:01:57.070> at<00:01:57.250> setting<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.820> front

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030

they've got the law at setting the front
of<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.360> car<00:01:58.570> really<00:01:58.960> don't<00:01:59.409> give<00:01:59.649> this<00:01:59.860> car<00:02:00.250> a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
of the car really don't give this car a

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.389 
of the car really don't give this car a
funky<00:02:01.000> look<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:02.830> would<00:02:02.979> be<00:02:03.100> fair<00:02:03.369> to

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
funky look I think it would be fair to

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.029 
funky look I think it would be fair to
say<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.360> interior<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.500> car<00:02:05.770> is

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
say that the interior of the car is

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.300 
say that the interior of the car is
designed<00:02:06.550> more<00:02:07.030> for<00:02:07.090> function<00:02:07.959> over<00:02:08.500> form<00:02:08.770> but

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
designed more for function over form but

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.490 
designed more for function over form but
everything<00:02:09.819> is<00:02:10.000> nicely<00:02:10.300> laid<00:02:10.780> out<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.349> easy

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
everything is nicely laid out and easy

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.729 
everything is nicely laid out and easy
