00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.670
 and what happens good people what we have 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.180
 here is what I'm going to do is that it's a 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:14.250
 breaking news 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.980
 this thing here is a mix of nothing 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.950
 and toilet paper and shit that had been 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.689
 got stuck in the workshop then what 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.950
 I'm going to do with the subject I read a 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.230
 spoonful so you can try to 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.720
 remove and do a tutorial can that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.360
 how to unclog a toilet with piss 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.180
 toilet paper and shit 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.920
 real happened with this side the spoon this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.250
 side because this is already to eat and that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 the spoon would not be connected we're going to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.230
 try to remove a little and take out the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.890
 toilet paper 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.720
 important steps in this may be the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.650
 keys then 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.380
 do not eat of the toilet paper or not eat 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.750
 the shit or not doing weird stuff no 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.210
 to drink is to see what a beautiful mix 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:07.090
 and color is here next 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.690
 no no no no 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.690
 It is not hygienic 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.060
 and this is the experiment 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.700
 and there it is 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.640
 this is already what with this side the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.369
 spoon you have to go breaking you know no 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.840
 well to talk about the we've already done for 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.880
 half 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.890
 there are like three pieces not when three 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.490
 chunks in total you have to go as well as 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 cutting them as well as if you were 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.310
 crushing this 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.580
 you have 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.480
 well belt and up to here we have already done 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.480
 all placed this 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.650
 what color has color 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.270
 they left this for x 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.649
 Y 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.649
 now the dead man of the castle 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.710
 for lack that has been stuck there are 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.710
 keep pounding logic 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.600
 piece of shit 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.069
 it is a malicious piece 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.069
 if everything went well 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.780
 this danger this piece of 18 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.250
 these are more bad 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.630
 I'm surprised it came out of me 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.819
 because I 'm just a better person and 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.940
 collaborator and all that 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.940
 we leave things 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.790
 it's more 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.829
 it seems that they helped 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.000
 well once we have done here in the 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.590
 castle frame we take this 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.769
 and where was 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.819
 and when the water is I 'm going to go back to 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.290
 to be there a noodle has been well recharged 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.569
 because recharging time is needed and 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.420
 all that 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.720
 Well, we wait a while and the other one is 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.020
 easy 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.410
 well that's already friends I hope that you 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.930
 I really liked this video and that you 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.370
 have served dad when these happen 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.370
 things are worth until later
