now what I still get the the house for
one<00:07:01.909> I'm<00:07:02.180> not<00:07:02.360> sure<00:07:02.620> since<00:07:03.620> I<00:07:03.710> already<00:07:03.800> have

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:04.099 
one I'm not sure since I already have

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:06.129 
one I'm not sure since I already have
this<00:07:04.279> one<00:07:04.340> and<00:07:04.909> now<00:07:05.060> this<00:07:05.240> one<00:07:05.389> is<00:07:05.569> very

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
this one and now this one is very

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.619 
this one and now this one is very
impressive<00:07:06.740> I<00:07:06.979> have<00:07:07.490> to<00:07:07.759> see<00:07:07.999> the<00:07:08.150> scope<00:07:08.389> of

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:08.629 
impressive I have to see the scope of

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.659 
impressive I have to see the scope of
the<00:07:08.900> other<00:07:09.050> one<00:07:09.259> and<00:07:09.590> since<00:07:10.249> I<00:07:10.370> don't<00:07:10.430> have<00:07:10.610> a

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
the other one and since I don't have a

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.719 
the other one and since I don't have a
warmer<00:07:11.180> new<00:07:11.389> me

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729 
warmer new me

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:16.600 
warmer new me
though<00:07:13.729> the<00:07:14.659> likelihood<00:07:14.810> of<00:07:15.139> me<00:07:15.590> cracking<00:07:16.340> one

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
though the likelihood of me cracking one

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:35.040 
though the likelihood of me cracking one
down<00:07:16.879> would<00:07:17.150> be<00:07:17.259> pretty<00:07:18.259> slim

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.050 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:43.209
