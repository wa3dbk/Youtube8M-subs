00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 loud and welcome to one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.960
 new video has new screenshots 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.910
 one of origins popped up one 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.480
 a bit older, and indeed Austria and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.519
 he came 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 I do not know if we have today 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.269
 discovered and I will analyze it 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.220
 I can analyze a lot of the first one 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.789
 you see, I think of the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.640
 cutscene taken for you to do that 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.730
 in quotation marks realistic for the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.940
 original game scenes from around it 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:36.329
 the cinemagic and you just look easy 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.590
 nicolai with olympia then she thinks i 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.399
 Do not know if this is the new one 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.610
 remington new model army dingsbums is 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.289
 because of berit or the execution of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.559
 Laufer The execution in front is one 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.120
 but I think it's a bit too thin 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.140
 could be either the execution or the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.030
 remington arm left pumps its level so 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.120
 shit is then you see smells open 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.710
 me a nice start and of course takeo 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.539
 with another weapon the state too 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.790
 high and I think that's exactly right 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.310
 the scene where the fat fat robot 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.619
 he comes stamping and gives everything and she 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.540
 it's not that the cats will see 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.290
 So start that one 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.950
 bit lame 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.219
 and then 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.600
 then comes bum bum make 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.280
 they will look up then 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.369
 fly something away and then you see 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.770
 the big robot and yes that was it from 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.899
 this scene is the next one that's easy 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.090
 only the zombies at the battlefield like 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.380
 they come out and the important ones 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.119
 Although eyes have already been suggested but 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.659
 Money is always samantha and orange 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.810
 is 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.829
 mexes and i can i am with something like that 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.390
 it's kind of bad money now 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.490
 or heart but i think it's so 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.470
 I quickly believe the maxis 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.689
 map dominate and also the robot 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.140
 What will Max have to do with it? 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.429
 was the head of this project and right 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.640
 on my assistant 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.520
 Well, definitely there you can 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.770
 not much we see soon 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.039
 the one who sees the replace the trailer 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.299
 and then the cinemagic and that's it 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.200
 see us at the next video skin in 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.200
 and servus
