00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.420

 I have with the two now for all 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.600
 first time tried the pieces 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.550
 I wrote for that under 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.289
 other and that is of course one 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.630
 nice thing for the composer if there 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.750
 For the first time hears the singer for 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.159
 he thought the music was singing 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.289
 himself and his little room 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.850
 has thought and that has me already 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.680
 a lot of fun and I think so 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.030
 this could be a really great thing 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.969
 because that was right on it 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.420
 played with band and big orchestra 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.420
 becomes 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.680
 We have just finished the first rehearsal 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.920
 we are brought the great musical for 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.019
 the big clam musical oratorium that 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.510
 for the 111th birthday in september 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.700
 listed is the first number I 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.810
 've ever seen of it is 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.090
 as long as I live cool number super 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.340
 First of all, ask the composer 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.329
 just met at the piano im 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.090
 background maybe he stops too 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.700
 a little something already strumming 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 vigorously practicing it in september 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.150
 Also a great show will be happy 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.299
 on it and hope we see each other soon 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.299
 again 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.150
 and now it is in the 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.790
 exciting phase where the music comes to 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.490
 where the composers are very hot 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.870
 to the text of ulf schmidt then too 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.160
 to compose a bit of music and 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.830
 that it's always the most exciting moment 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.020
 because the piece is awakened to life 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.880
 and we all hear it for the first time 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.140
 nevertheless will succeed and that is 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.910
 actually that's what's on 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.380
 the most exciting for all of us is when you are 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.910
 then starts at once 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.910
 really imagine something below
