00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
for that that only I would really need

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.190 
for that that only I would really need
to<00:04:42.320> test<00:04:42.530> this<00:04:42.680> out<00:04:42.860> but<00:04:43.310> that's<00:04:44.210> not<00:04:44.420> what

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
to test this out but that's not what

have<00:04:49.550> some<00:04:50.230> manuals<00:04:51.230> there<00:04:52.510> but<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.750> guess<00:04:54.020> that

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
have some manuals there but I guess that

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.750 
have some manuals there but I guess that
is<00:04:54.770> pretty<00:04:54.830> much<00:04:55.610> it<00:04:55.970> so<00:04:57.460> that<00:04:58.460> was<00:04:58.610> my
