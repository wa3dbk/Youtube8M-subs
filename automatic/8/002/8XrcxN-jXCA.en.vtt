you<00:00:10.120> how<00:00:10.269> to<00:00:10.740> basically<00:00:11.740> build<00:00:12.389> an<00:00:13.389> underwater

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:14.129 
you how to basically build an underwater

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.859 
you how to basically build an underwater
house<00:00:15.209> structure<00:00:16.209> or<00:00:16.360> wherever<00:00:16.599> you<00:00:16.689> want<00:00:16.810> to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
house structure or wherever you want to

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.290 
house structure or wherever you want to
call<00:00:17.020> it<00:00:17.050> in<00:00:17.770> under<00:00:18.279> 10<00:00:18.460> minutes<00:00:18.490> and<00:00:18.939> it's

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
call it in under 10 minutes and it's

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.720 
call it in under 10 minutes and it's
going<00:00:19.419> to<00:00:19.509> be<00:00:19.570> quite<00:00:19.689> big<00:00:19.930> one<00:00:20.140> so<00:00:20.490> let's<00:00:21.490> get

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
going to be quite big one so let's get

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.179 
going to be quite big one so let's get
into<00:00:21.789> it<00:00:21.970> and<00:00:22.150> before<00:00:22.990> I<00:00:23.230> say<00:00:23.410> anything<00:00:23.650> I'm

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
into it and before I say anything I'm

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.169 
into it and before I say anything I'm
going<00:00:25.060> too<00:00:26.160> far<00:00:27.160> do<00:00:27.340> anything<00:00:27.640> i'm<00:00:27.939> going<00:00:28.119> to

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
going too far do anything i'm going to

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.810 
going too far do anything i'm going to
say<00:00:28.300> that<00:00:28.539> we<00:00:28.869> will<00:00:29.140> be<00:00:29.260> using<00:00:29.550> MCEdit<00:00:30.550> for

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
say that we will be using MCEdit for

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.950 
say that we will be using MCEdit for
this<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.790> under<00:00:33.790> warehouse<00:00:34.470> thing<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:36.960> very

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
this so under warehouse thing and very

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.530 
this so under warehouse thing and very
random<00:00:38.440> seed<00:00:41.580> go<00:00:42.580> left<00:00:42.909> around<00:00:43.180> a<00:00:43.269> little<00:00:43.360> bit

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
random seed go left around a little bit

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.270 
random seed go left around a little bit
why<00:00:43.780> not<00:00:44.290> just<00:00:44.500> type<00:00:44.680> it<00:00:44.830> in<00:00:44.949> some<00:00:45.129> random

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
why not just type it in some random

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.119 
why not just type it in some random
layers<00:00:49.470> so<00:00:50.470> we're<00:00:50.619> going<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.799> have<00:00:50.830> some

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
layers so we're going to have some

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.310 
layers so we're going to have some
random<00:00:51.489> world<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.750> hopefully<00:00:53.049> it's<00:00:53.140> going<00:00:53.229> to

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
random world and hopefully it's going to

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.200 
random world and hopefully it's going to
have<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.470> lot<00:00:53.680> of<00:00:53.739> water<00:00:54.129> but<00:00:54.760> we<00:00:54.940> don't<00:00:55.030> really

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
have a lot of water but we don't really

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.869 
have a lot of water but we don't really
need<00:00:55.510> them<00:00:55.690> in<00:00:55.869> a<00:00:55.930> bar<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.140> bit<00:00:57.960> hopefully<00:00:59.879> this

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
need them in a bar a bit hopefully this

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.509 
need them in a bar a bit hopefully this
world<00:01:01.180> will<00:01:01.449> have<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:02.409> it's<00:01:02.769> definitely<00:01:03.129> that

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
world will have and it's definitely that

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.270 
world will have and it's definitely that
should<00:01:03.790> be<00:01:06.330> yes<00:01:07.330> you'd<00:01:07.510> be<00:01:07.630> about<00:01:07.840> enough<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
should be yes you'd be about enough so

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.279 
should be yes you'd be about enough so
now<00:01:09.700> we're<00:01:09.880> going<00:01:09.970> to<00:01:10.030> go<00:01:10.090> into<00:01:10.270> MCEdit<00:01:11.080> and

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
now we're going to go into MCEdit and

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.069 
now we're going to go into MCEdit and
i'll<00:01:11.380> show<00:01:11.590> you<00:01:11.649> what<00:01:11.890> we<00:01:12.039> have<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.280> do<00:01:13.020> okay<00:01:14.020> so

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
i'll show you what we have to do okay so

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.039 
i'll show you what we have to do okay so
now<00:01:14.289> so<00:01:14.530> now<00:01:14.560> we're<00:01:15.159> in<00:01:15.429> MCEdit<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.630> i'll<00:01:16.899> show

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
now so now we're in MCEdit and i'll show

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.840 
now so now we're in MCEdit and i'll show
you<00:01:17.200> what<00:01:17.590> we<00:01:17.679> have<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.890> do<00:01:17.979> press<00:01:18.250> open<00:01:18.640> level

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
you what we have to do press open level

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.510 
you what we have to do press open level
and<00:01:19.210> i'm<00:01:20.049> guessing<00:01:20.439> it'll<00:01:20.799> be<00:01:21.009> underwater

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
and i'm guessing it'll be underwater

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.630 
and i'm guessing it'll be underwater
house<00:01:21.909> thing<00:01:22.409> look<00:01:23.409> at<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.679> and<00:01:23.859> leveled<00:01:24.549> out

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
house thing look at that and leveled out

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.440 
house thing look at that and leveled out
that<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.820> where<00:01:28.090> we<00:01:28.450> are<00:01:28.570> in<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:29.079> world

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that and here where we are in the world

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.340 
that and here where we are in the world
just<00:01:31.450> let<00:01:31.630> let<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.380> generate<00:01:32.979> first<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:34.350> we're

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
just let let it generate first and we're

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.520 
just let let it generate first and we're
going<00:01:35.469> to<00:01:35.530> make<00:01:35.619> all<00:01:35.799> this<00:01:36.159> an<00:01:36.369> under<00:01:37.149> warr<00:01:37.530> so

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
going to make all this an under warr so

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.880 
going to make all this an under warr so
first<00:01:38.829> thing<00:01:39.009> we're<00:01:39.100> going<00:01:39.249> to<00:01:39.310> do<00:01:39.460> is

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
first thing we're going to do is

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.450 
first thing we're going to do is
basically<00:01:44.640> select<00:01:45.719> lots<00:01:46.719> of<00:01:46.899> well<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.799> lots<00:01:48.310> of

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
basically select lots of well a lots of

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:58.460 
basically select lots of well a lots of
this<00:01:48.999> about<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:51.850> can<00:01:51.999> make<00:01:52.119> it

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.230 

that<00:01:59.130> big<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:02.490> should<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.760> all<00:02:02.910> right<00:02:03.090> all

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that big it should be all right all

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.080 
that big it should be all right all
right<00:02:03.300> and<00:02:04.370> we're<00:02:05.370> going<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.610> fill<00:02:05.910> and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
right and we're going to fill and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.280 
right and we're going to fill and
replace<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.690> fill<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.410> in<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.710> air<00:02:09.050> Phil<00:02:12.290> and

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
replace and fill it in with air Phil and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.170 
replace and fill it in with air Phil and
then<00:02:14.040> we're<00:02:14.190> going<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.370> make<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.030> actual

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
then we're going to make the actual

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.900 
then we're going to make the actual
structure<00:02:15.900> using<00:02:16.380> glass<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.460> we're<00:02:17.730> going<00:02:17.820> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
structure using glass so we're going to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.240 
structure using glass so we're going to
make<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.720> floor<00:02:19.380> actually<00:02:19.980> we're<00:02:20.070> going<00:02:20.190> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
make the floor actually we're going to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.580 
make the floor actually we're going to
make<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.460> floor<00:02:20.760> using<00:02:20.970> glowstone<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.470> can

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
make the floor using glowstone so we can

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.290 
make the floor using glowstone so we can
actually<00:02:22.680> see<00:02:23.070> in<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:24.240> house<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:27.120> we're<00:02:27.240> going

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
actually see in the house so we're going

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.720 
actually see in the house so we're going
to<00:02:27.450> go<00:02:27.510> one<00:02:27.900> block<00:02:28.080> above<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.890> bottom<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.310> one

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
to go one block above the bottom and one

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.960 
to go one block above the bottom and one
block<00:02:30.000> from<00:02:30.030> meets<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> sides<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.940> make<00:02:32.940> a

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
block from meets of the sides and make a

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.340 
block from meets of the sides and make a
one<00:02:33.420> deep<00:02:34.490> if<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.610> can<00:02:35.760> actually<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:37.020> what<00:02:37.260> I'm

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
one deep if I can actually see what I'm

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.330 
one deep if I can actually see what I'm
doing<00:02:39.890> there<00:02:40.890> we<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:42.920> I'm<00:02:43.920> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.160> fill<00:02:44.310> that

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
doing there we go I'm going to fill that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:54.320 
doing there we go I'm going to fill that
in<00:02:44.550> with<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:46.520> glow<00:02:47.520> stone<00:02:48.480> also<00:02:50.120> fill<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:53.330> then

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
in with a glow stone also fill and then
