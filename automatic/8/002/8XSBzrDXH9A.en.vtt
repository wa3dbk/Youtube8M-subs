00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.460
 I know that the network does indeed when 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.059
 we do what we know first I thought it was 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.059
 a lung problem 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.240
 but that feeling was not the fault 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.430
 located close to the chest and comes as up 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.770
 the intestine and it is only removed when we 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.050
 we take responsibility and we assume our 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.270
 mistakes the thing is not easy but you have to 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.509
 achieve it and for that I'm thinking about 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.700
 Some steps are better than those I gave 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.620
 to survive in school that does not 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.510
 they worked, I think thanks to them 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.630
 I'm here again looking for the way 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.940
 of how to recognize an error and amend the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.950
 damage and the word itself is difficult 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.300
 to pronounce and more to apply but the 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.300
 big step is here 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.309
 he could recognize it the first step is 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.829
 accept that the moser moss the most 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.400
 difficult and no no no and it is not to recognize it 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.070
 to please other people 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.980
 and let them know that we put them in but not the 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.710
 Gentlemen recognize one of the same 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.200
 sincerity and even blame strike yes 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.060
 brother you who is very dandruff like 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.670
 you happen to do that but we can not 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.830
 to stay feeling bad that does not 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.110
 fixes nothing and the idea is to try 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.760
 fix the damage and to be able to do it 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.760
 we must go to step 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.630
 2 identify the victims all bad 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.579
 action affects those involved and even 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.069
 those who had nothing to do with that 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.750
 so that there is justice and reparation 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.250
 must make a list of people 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.250
 that were affected 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.159
 The list can be long includes 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.200
 family siblings friends and family 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.140
 from the doorkeeper friends professors 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.750
 real estate and material goods make sure 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.860
 that there is nothing left outside for 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.560
 I can jump to the next three point 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.500
 failures and losses after having 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.359
 located to the victims should know 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.310
 exactly how it hurt them to 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.030
 be able to make compensation 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.120
 correspondent 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.670
 physical and psychological damage affection 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.670
 public good and virtual intimidation 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.750
 enter the list of the damage that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.129
 you could have caused thanks to a 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.129
 childish prank 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.049
 to make sure that everyone receives their 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.599
 reward of painting the walls 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.780
 needed and replenish the horns that 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.440
 touch to buy a vase and still not 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.989
 it's enough because those are things 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.819
 materials and what you really should 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.819
 do is in step 4 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.380
 Do not ask me what that does not apply 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.390
 same in all the steps as well as when 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.250
 you know that the embarras also knows what 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.750
 what you have to do to clean the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.700
 honor 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.060
 and above all to charge the love of the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.480
 people who hurt 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.790
 which are usually the closest 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.099
 this act has nothing to do with the 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.930
 Punctual damage is a bonus wow is a 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.180
 extra effort that you should do 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.000
 to show that he is repentant and 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.250
 that you really care about improving and 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.380
 change we are all exposed to 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.390
 make mistakes because it is natural but not 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.459
 usual you can not return a 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.380
 custom of consulting this manual the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.380
 idea is that you go to the fifth step and 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.099
 do not make the same mistake the idea is 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.870
 get away from the bad behaviors and 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:43.510
 do not collect experiences 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.450
 so avoid getting into trouble for not 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.640
 go back to consult this manual does not create 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.640
 that learning the lesson is fun 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.230
 learn the structuring lesson 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.310
 humiliating and takes time prestige 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.420
 silver 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.380
 and as they say out there crime does not pay 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.380
 then because you were told
