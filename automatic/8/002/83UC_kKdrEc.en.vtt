00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
every single workout you do now this

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.070 
every single workout you do now this
isn't<00:00:12.940> about<00:00:13.000> lifting<00:00:13.480> more<00:00:13.660> weight<00:00:13.719> it's<00:00:13.990> not

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
isn't about lifting more weight it's not

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.110 
isn't about lifting more weight it's not
about<00:00:14.230> running<00:00:14.590> faster<00:00:15.070> farther<00:00:15.459> it's

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.120 
about running faster farther it's

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.730 
about running faster farther it's
actually<00:00:16.390> about<00:00:16.480> eating<00:00:16.900> or<00:00:17.020> more

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
actually about eating or more

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.640 
actually about eating or more
importantly<00:00:18.160> not<00:00:18.610> eating<00:00:19.350> what<00:00:20.350> we<00:00:20.440> want<00:00:20.590> to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650

talk<00:00:20.800> about<00:00:20.830> today<00:00:21.190> is<00:00:21.220> fasted<00:00:22.030> workouts

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
talk about today is fasted workouts

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.470 
talk about today is fasted workouts
that's<00:00:23.830> working<00:00:24.220> out<00:00:24.310> in<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.640> fasted<00:00:25.180> state

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
that's working out in a fasted state

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.420 
that's working out in a fasted state
studies<00:00:26.080> have<00:00:26.110> shown<00:00:26.230> that<00:00:26.440> you<00:00:26.830> burn<00:00:27.070> more

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
studies have shown that you burn more

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.670 
studies have shown that you burn more
fat<00:00:27.820> when<00:00:28.570> you<00:00:28.690> work<00:00:28.900> out<00:00:29.080> at<00:00:29.200> have<00:00:29.290> fasted

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
fat when you work out at have fasted

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.010 
fat when you work out at have fasted
State<00:00:29.950> this<00:00:30.100> is<00:00:30.220> because<00:00:30.720> when<00:00:31.720> you<00:00:31.870> have

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
State this is because when you have

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.930 
State this is because when you have
eaten<00:00:32.259> and<00:00:32.649> you<00:00:32.860> work<00:00:33.040> out<00:00:33.250> your<00:00:33.489> burning<00:00:33.730> the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
eaten and you work out your burning the

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.520 
eaten and you work out your burning the
energy<00:00:34.239> from<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.450> food<00:00:34.780> but<00:00:35.140> if<00:00:35.230> you're<00:00:35.350> in<00:00:35.469> a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
energy from the food but if you're in a

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.139 
energy from the food but if you're in a
fasted<00:00:36.039> state<00:00:36.280> your<00:00:36.640> body<00:00:36.850> is<00:00:36.969> going<00:00:37.089> to

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
fasted state your body is going to

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.540 
fasted state your body is going to
release<00:00:37.300> stored<00:00:37.809> body<00:00:38.109> fat<00:00:38.320> for<00:00:38.800> your<00:00:39.129> energy

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
release stored body fat for your energy

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.910 
release stored body fat for your energy
so<00:00:39.730> you<00:00:39.760> can<00:00:39.999> burn<00:00:40.149> it<00:00:40.359> instead<00:00:40.780> what's<00:00:41.649> more

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
so you can burn it instead what's more

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.279 
so you can burn it instead what's more
eating<00:00:42.789> causes<00:00:43.570> your<00:00:43.659> body<00:00:43.809> to<00:00:43.989> release

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
eating causes your body to release

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.130 
eating causes your body to release
insulin<00:00:44.829> when<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:45.730> produce<00:00:45.909> insulin<00:00:46.510> it

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
insulin when you produce insulin it

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.829 
insulin when you produce insulin it
tells<00:00:47.530> your<00:00:47.710> body<00:00:47.859> chemically<00:00:48.489> to<00:00:49.239> hold<00:00:49.510> on<00:00:49.719> to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
tells your body chemically to hold on to

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.930 
tells your body chemically to hold on to
the<00:00:49.929> fact<00:00:50.199> that<00:00:50.469> insulin<00:00:51.159> says<00:00:51.370> don't<00:00:51.699> let<00:00:51.730> go

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
the fact that insulin says don't let go

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.630 
the fact that insulin says don't let go
of<00:00:52.059> fat<00:00:52.300> we<00:00:52.600> need<00:00:52.839> it<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:53.769> even<00:00:54.190> though<00:00:54.219> you're

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
of fat we need it so even though you're

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.340 
of fat we need it so even though you're
out<00:00:54.819> working<00:00:55.059> out<00:00:55.359> you're<00:00:55.600> running<00:00:56.019> you're

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
out working out you're running you're

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.930 
out working out you're running you're
lifting<00:00:56.829> weights<00:00:57.219> whatever<00:00:57.579> it<00:00:57.670> is<00:00:57.760> you're

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
lifting weights whatever it is you're

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.899 
lifting weights whatever it is you're
trying<00:00:58.059> to<00:00:58.359> burn<00:00:58.539> fat<00:00:58.870> your<00:00:59.829> body<00:00:59.859> has<00:01:00.729> this

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
trying to burn fat your body has this

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.879 
trying to burn fat your body has this
chemical<00:01:01.300> signal<00:01:01.749> that<00:01:01.839> says<00:01:02.079> don't<00:01:02.559> let<00:01:02.649> that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
chemical signal that says don't let that

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.530 
chemical signal that says don't let that
fat<00:01:03.069> go<00:01:03.339> you're<00:01:03.699> working<00:01:04.030> against<00:01:04.390> yourself

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
fat go you're working against yourself

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.080 
fat go you're working against yourself
if<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.590> work<00:01:05.740> out<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:06.040> fasted<00:01:06.520> state<00:01:06.790> it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
if you work out in a fasted state it's

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.639 
if you work out in a fasted state it's
congruent<00:01:07.720> your<00:01:07.900> body<00:01:08.110> is<00:01:08.259> going<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.439> start

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
congruent your body is going to start

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.230 
congruent your body is going to start
releasing<00:01:08.920> that<00:01:09.250> fats<00:01:09.549> whether<00:01:09.790> you<00:01:09.880> can<00:01:10.030> burn

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
releasing that fats whether you can burn

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.139 
releasing that fats whether you can burn
it<00:01:10.420> many<00:01:11.290> studies<00:01:11.649> have<00:01:11.860> shown<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.340> people

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
it many studies have shown that people

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.050 
it many studies have shown that people
actually<00:01:13.479> have<00:01:13.810> more<00:01:14.320> energy<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:15.610> of<00:01:15.909> the

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
actually have more energy because of the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.020 
actually have more energy because of the
released<00:01:16.420> fat<00:01:17.229> into<00:01:17.619> their<00:01:17.770> bloodstream<00:01:18.030> that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
released fat into their bloodstream that

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.730 
released fat into their bloodstream that
they<00:01:19.180> use<00:01:19.390> for<00:01:19.420> energy<00:01:19.960> during<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:20.289> fasted

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
they use for energy during a fasted

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.319 
they use for energy during a fasted
State<00:01:21.009> this<00:01:21.610> is<00:01:21.789> because<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:23.380> body<00:01:23.619> has<00:01:23.770> this

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
State this is because your body has this

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.010 
State this is because your body has this
the<00:01:25.329> safeguard<00:01:26.170> when<00:01:27.159> you<00:01:27.490> are<00:01:28.210> in<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.479> fasted
