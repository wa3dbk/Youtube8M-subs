00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.970
 Hi girls, I'm going to teach you. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.219
 we do is those enamels is almost 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.580
 transparent and you will need 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:22.970
 a basic idea an enamel 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.660
 I'll use these two here and also 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.330
 shadow 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.070
 I'll use the element but it can be 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.130
 any shade 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.980
 in these lines here I used the plate 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.530
 giant with this drawing here and now 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.550
 I will use this here to do with this 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.860
 nail of the law 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.270
 I'm going to use this drawing here to be able to 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.270
 stay in banese henrique 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.670
 but yes 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.320
 now I'm going to color and I'm going first 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.910
 I'll do it later then I'll do the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.310
 for you to have if you 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:20.650
 you want to do it, you can do it 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.430
 I did it, I just took a little bit of 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.950
 neighborhood 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.950
 just to do a little 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:37.890
 It took the enamel better and flew 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 handro 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:57.330
 It's good to have this amount here and I'm going 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:57.330
 mix in there do another little thing 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:09.670
 the darker you go in van the quantity 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:13.080
 What do you think it's good? 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.080
 the color you want 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:24.040
 ready and this color that I want and 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:31.560
 white and that 's the glaze I made myself 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:35.910
 I'll put it here for me to start rolling. 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.910
 I'm going to start coloring now. 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.549
 and you can make multiple colors 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:07.099
 You can use shadow 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:07.099
 you can use income 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.670
 look how beautiful it is 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.970
 That's how it is now I'm going to make some 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:34.290
 other individual kitchen to use 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:44.430
 a base with a goal right here and I'll use it 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:46.909
 this enamel here and now I'll get it 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.909
 I'll try 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.310
 You can do it with shadow too. 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.050
 but the hopscotch 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:35.240
 and this is how it is done 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:38.780
 the glaze is now over, it was a fight 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.550
 so is this enamel is super easy to 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:49.060
 how and pro peace even 12 second 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.060
