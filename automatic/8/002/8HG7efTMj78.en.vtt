goes<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.500> main<00:02:33.680> board<00:02:35.290> now<00:02:36.290> we've<00:02:36.500> already

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
goes to the main board now we've already

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.740 
goes to the main board now we've already
removed<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.340> cover<00:02:37.610> for<00:02:37.910> our<00:02:37.940> t-con<00:02:38.450> board

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
removed the cover for our t-con board

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.880 
removed the cover for our t-con board
right<00:02:38.989> here<00:02:40.180> but<00:02:41.180> this<00:02:41.360> LED<00:02:41.870> driver<00:02:42.200> also<00:02:42.530> has

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
right here but this LED driver also has

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.920 
right here but this LED driver also has
a<00:02:42.920> cover<00:02:43.250> here's<00:02:43.940> what<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.270> t-con<00:02:44.630> board

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
a cover here's what the t-con board

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.750 
a cover here's what the t-con board
cover<00:02:45.200> looked<00:02:45.500> like<00:02:45.650> originally<00:02:46.280> before<00:02:46.459> we

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
cover looked like originally before we

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.080 
cover looked like originally before we
unscrewed<00:02:47.209> it<00:02:51.489> so<00:02:52.489> if<00:02:52.580> you're<00:02:52.730> doing<00:02:52.850> any

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
unscrewed it so if you're doing any

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.750 
unscrewed it so if you're doing any
repairs<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.230> backlight<00:02:54.620> inverter<00:02:54.650> /<00:02:55.370> LED

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
driver or the t-con board you will need

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.850 
driver or the t-con board you will need
to<00:02:58.340> remove<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.420> covers<00:02:59.810> for<00:03:00.320> each<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.709> them

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
to remove the covers for each of them

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.330 
to remove the covers for each of them
before<00:03:01.820> you<00:03:01.970> replace<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.330> board<00:03:06.340> removing

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
before you replace the board removing

before you replace the board removing
the<00:03:07.430> covers<00:03:07.760> can<00:03:07.940> be<00:03:08.060> simply<00:03:08.390> done<00:03:08.570> by

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
the covers can be simply done by

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.810 
the covers can be simply done by
removing<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.320> screws<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.860> hold<00:03:10.100> them<00:03:10.310> to

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
removing the screws that hold them to

is<00:04:29.850> that<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.270> wouldn't<00:04:30.570> have<00:04:30.720> lighting<00:04:31.200> from

the LED driver so your TV would turn on
you<00:04:35.190> could<00:04:35.340> have<00:04:35.460> sound<00:04:35.850> but<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.660> would<00:04:36.780> have
