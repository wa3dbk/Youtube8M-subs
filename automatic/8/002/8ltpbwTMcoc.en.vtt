00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.430
 every day comes a huge amount 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.490
 posts in social networks with about one 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.410
 sense of artem thanks for your songs 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.450
 music helps when new stuff 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.429
 clips and so on me it's all very 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.800
 helps and inspires as probably not 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.510
 what's more when you are perceived 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.220
 as an artist already performing his 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.859
 stuff is worth a lot 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.510
 when I speak no matter what venues 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.640
 let current club or private or 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.260
 concert hall and hear my sing 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 songs it makes you feel 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.300
 Something special I think I am 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.130
 few on yet understand so here 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.590
 I read all this I want to answer many 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.750
 that yes i agree i am not super prolific 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.579
 on the songs the artist is not super often 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.850
 producing material but probably 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.770
 this in my heart i'm glad i'm looking for every 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.140
 sound and every stress or bundle by 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.360
 very long every song for me 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.640
 history and almost always taken 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.710
 I really want to do my life 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.719
 such songs that will remain after you 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.940
 for many years and will obey 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.940
 almost always fresh modern 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.170
 and most importantly really something single 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.299
 maybe just like that 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.549
 I dreamed all my life to make such 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.439
 test 3 which will be absolute 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.900
 balance between floor sounding and then 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.270
 same time rome personal motives which is not 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 confused with anything so meets all 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.189
 standards like our listeners so 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.229
 European single turned out to be a hundred 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.330
 percent biographical motive was 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.869
 is composed somehow just easy and very 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.210
 quickly 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.030
 there was one whole story left 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.680
 rank compose poems and write down i 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.079
 did not experiment and collected for 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.650
 the work team with which I work is no longer 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.110
 First year 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.720
 those people who understand at a glance and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.490
 Exactly the same wavelength as I do for a long time. 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.600
 very carefully chose every sound 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.030
 cleaned something 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.680
 but something added and all the same 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 enjoyed this process 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.229
 Misha Grishanov Saunas I left the singer myself 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.270
 writer with a capital letter written for 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.219
 I have no text from each written 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.960
 im working i understand that he is big 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.810
 the professional in which collected huge 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.430
 number of different ideas shades of choice 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.530
 the one who will help me with the text in this 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.299
 composition question was not at all 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.310
 I am in fact the lyrics never 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.319
 hid namely Misha caught something 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.649
 a condition that is not necessary in 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.830
 quiet 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.660
 Alex Hook professional to the bone 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.180
 one of those with whom i am most familiar 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.530
 of all the musicians of Moscow with him 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.660
 who studies with music 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.510
 I write almost all the songs and this 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.400
 composition is no exception l power words 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.560
 for me it is a person more than 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.940
 musician composer or producer for 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.250
 me he is to some extent exactly 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.390
 native person we are first and foremost a family 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.920
 only then colleagues 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.830
 the person i trust on 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.090
 Today most in music 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.940
 listening to every advice and 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.280
 constantly learning I heard and I know huge 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.560
 number of pianists but how tasty 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.989
 handles laz keys I don't know 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.370
 no one else have to idea with easy 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.680
 draft for this single 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.569
 he is almost without words and unnecessary 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.370
 explanations gave exactly that sound 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.880
 which I heard in my head but could not 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.130
 to explain 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.930
 we have a full understanding of what and 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.959
 artists in which direction should i 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.280
 move without modesty say one thing yes 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.130
 we understood that to some extent 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.390
 do hit but did not expect at all 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.120
 that he will cause just such a reaction 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.040
 I know what are you waiting for before going out 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.620
 this work is already very long 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.570
 almost like I wanted to point out 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.970
 that at the moment the single is on 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.430
 mastering in the states and very soon 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.220
 officially presented and who knows well 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.660
 maybe he will be the same to all of you 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.660
 relatives like me 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.040
 maybe we won't change 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:44.930
 but in memory properties 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.930
 litters to the place were we
