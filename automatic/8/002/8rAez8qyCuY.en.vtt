00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
think that a president should give away

think that a president should give away
the<00:01:54.720> bargaining<00:01:55.229> chip<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.829> personal

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
what you're going to get out of that it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.440 
what you're going to get out of that it

global warming we're gonna have to get

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.570 
global warming we're gonna have to get
back<00:02:19.720> on<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.050> track<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.590> trying<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:21.070> prevent

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
back on the track of trying to prevent

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.730 
back on the track of trying to prevent
nuclear<00:02:21.880> proliferation<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.320> much<00:02:23.530> else

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
nuclear proliferation and so much else

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.910 
nuclear proliferation and so much else
so<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.610> think<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.360> when<00:02:26.020> you've<00:02:26.170> got<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.680> big

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
so I think that when you've got that big

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.400 
so I think that when you've got that big
an<00:02:27.040> agenda<00:02:27.550> facing<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:28.900> should<00:02:29.170> not

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410

that raised serious issues within

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.340 
that raised serious issues within
Pakistan<00:03:03.640> as<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.390> pointed<00:03:04.660> out<00:03:04.750> before<00:03:04.960> the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
Pakistan as I pointed out before the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.110 
Pakistan as I pointed out before the
only<00:03:05.620> person<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.040> separates<00:03:06.490> us<00:03:06.640> from<00:03:06.700> a

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
only person that separates us from a

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.440 
only person that separates us from a
jihadist<00:03:08.520> government<00:03:09.520> in<00:03:09.670> Pakistan<00:03:10.210> with

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
jihadist government in Pakistan with

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.450 
jihadist government in Pakistan with
nuclear<00:03:10.720> weapons<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.620> President<00:03:12.160> Musharraf

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
nuclear weapons is President Musharraf

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.800 
nuclear weapons is President Musharraf
and<00:03:12.850> therefore<00:03:13.450> i<00:03:13.480> thought<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.750> was

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
and therefore i thought it was

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.870 
and therefore i thought it was
irresponsible<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.770> engage<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.580> kind<00:03:15.760> of

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
irresponsible to engage in that kind of

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.150 
irresponsible to engage in that kind of
a<00:03:15.970> suggestion<00:03:16.390> here<00:03:17.230> that's<00:03:17.410> dangerous<00:03:17.860> words

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
a suggestion here that's dangerous words

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.340 
a suggestion here that's dangerous words
mean<00:03:18.520> something<00:03:18.760> in<00:03:19.030> campaigns<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:20.320> i

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
mean something in campaigns and so i

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.450 
mean something in campaigns and so i
think<00:03:20.410> it's<00:03:20.560> an<00:03:20.650> important<00:03:21.010> distinction<00:03:21.310> to

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
think it's an important distinction to

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.370 
think it's an important distinction to
make<00:03:21.550> here<00:03:21.940> we're<00:03:22.390> asking<00:03:22.780> Democrats<00:03:23.230> across

the country to choose amongst us here

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.090 
the country to choose amongst us here
