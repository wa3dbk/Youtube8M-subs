well<00:00:03.030> let's<00:00:03.959> talk<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.290> little<00:00:04.440> bit<00:00:04.740> about<00:00:05.069> a

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
well let's talk a little bit about a

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.339 
well let's talk a little bit about a
very<00:00:05.819> common<00:00:06.180> home<00:00:06.540> appliance<00:00:07.109> gas<00:00:07.799> range

very common home appliance gas range
let's<00:00:10.349> compare<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.830> gas<00:00:10.980> range<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.639> other<00:00:11.790> gas

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
let's compare the gas range to other gas

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.749 
let's compare the gas range to other gas

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.560 
kitchen now in the bottom of a gas range
we<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.289> burner<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.860> typically<00:00:53.570> burns

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
we have a burner that typically burns

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.959 
we have a burner that typically burns
out<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.079> two<00:00:55.320> directions<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.280> there's<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
out in two directions and there's a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.209 
out in two directions and there's a
flame<00:00:57.390> spreader<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.289> bottom<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.010> heat

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
flame spreader on the bottom so the heat

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.860 
flame spreader on the bottom so the heat
will<00:00:59.399> spread<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.149> come<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.510> through<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
will spread out and come up through the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.070 
will spread out and come up through the
ugly<00:01:01.109> more<00:01:01.320> evenly<00:01:01.969> when<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.239> flame<00:01:03.600> hits

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
ugly more evenly when the flame hits

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.700 
ugly more evenly when the flame hits
that<00:01:04.409> metal<00:01:05.060> flame<00:01:06.060> spreader<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:07.380> does

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that metal flame spreader that does

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.510 
that metal flame spreader that does
what's<00:01:08.010> called<00:01:08.280> impinging<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.330> flame<00:01:09.630> which

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
what's called impinging the flame which

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.670 
what's called impinging the flame which
increases<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.939> carbon<00:01:12.390> monoxide<00:01:13.080> output

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
increases the carbon monoxide output

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
increases the carbon monoxide output
because<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> interferes<00:01:14.939> with<00:01:15.060> complete

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
because it interferes with complete

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.440 
because it interferes with complete
combustion<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.909> where<00:01:17.909> does<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:20.119> flue<00:01:21.119> gas

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
combustion and where does this flue gas

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.719 
combustion and where does this flue gas
that's<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.950> no<00:01:23.340> different

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that's really what it is no different

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.190 
that's really what it is no different
than<00:01:23.820> what<00:01:23.970> comes<00:01:24.180> off<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.600> furnace<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.080> your

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
than what comes off your furnace or your

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.679 
than what comes off your furnace or your
water<00:01:25.380> heater<00:01:25.740> come<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> range<00:01:26.759> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
water heater come up on the range it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.039 
water heater come up on the range it
comes<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:28.110> right<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:29.420> just<00:01:30.420> above<00:01:30.659> look<00:01:30.869> up

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
comes out right here just above look up

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.760 
comes out right here just above look up
top<00:01:31.820> now<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.630> biggest<00:01:34.020> problems<00:01:34.560> with

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
top now one of the biggest problems with

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.020 
top now one of the biggest problems with
gas<00:01:35.070> appliances<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.659> when<00:01:38.030> combustion

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
gas appliances is when combustion

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.330 
gas appliances is when combustion
product<00:01:39.540> goes<00:01:39.990> through<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> burner<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.890> second

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
product goes through a burner a second

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.639 
product goes through a burner a second
time<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> reason<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.409> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
time and the reason for that is that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.800 
time and the reason for that is that
most<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> oxygen<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.970> used<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.570> first

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
most of the oxygen is used the first

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.679 
most of the oxygen is used the first
time<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.320> goes<00:01:46.439> through<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> burner<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
time it goes through a burner so if the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.830 
time it goes through a burner so if the
combustion<00:01:49.350> product<00:01:49.770> comes<00:01:49.979> out<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.540> vent

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
combustion product comes out of the vent

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.469 
combustion product comes out of the vent
here<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.680> comes<00:01:53.040> over<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.790> burners<00:01:54.210> while

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
here and comes over the burners while

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.170 
here and comes over the burners while
they're<00:01:54.689> burning<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.740> burners<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.549> somewhat

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
they're burning the burners are somewhat

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.990 
they're burning the burners are somewhat
starved<00:01:57.719> for<00:01:57.990> oxygen

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
starved for oxygen

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.710 
starved for oxygen
as<00:01:59.150> much<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.690> oxygen<00:02:00.290> in<00:02:00.530> those<00:02:01.220> gases<00:02:01.880> has

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
as much of the oxygen in those gases has

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.620 
as much of the oxygen in those gases has
already<00:02:03.050> been<00:02:03.440> consumed<00:02:04.010> so<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.630> increases

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
already been consumed so this increases

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.650 
already been consumed so this increases
the<00:02:05.780> carbon<00:02:06.260> monoxide<00:02:07.040> output<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.450> range

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
the carbon monoxide output of the range

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.130 
the carbon monoxide output of the range
