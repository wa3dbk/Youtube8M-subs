you'd<00:04:13.810> be<00:04:13.900> surprised<00:04:14.229> how<00:04:14.379> much<00:04:14.470> these<00:04:14.680> things

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.219 
you'd be surprised how much these things
can<00:04:15.069> hold<00:04:15.250> they<00:04:15.430> hold<00:04:15.639> a<00:04:15.849> ton<00:04:16.570> of<00:04:16.599> water<00:04:16.989> and

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
can hold they hold a ton of water and

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.830 
can hold they hold a ton of water and
it's<00:04:17.320> going<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.530> probably<00:04:17.709> take<00:04:18.329> like<00:04:19.329> six<00:04:19.690> or

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
it's going to probably take like six or

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.509 
it's going to probably take like six or
more<00:04:19.959> hours<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.440> dry<00:04:20.590> completely<00:04:20.739> you<00:04:21.130> can<00:04:21.310> use

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
more hours to dry completely you can use

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.450 
more hours to dry completely you can use
a<00:04:21.549> hairdryer<00:04:22.000> put<00:04:22.659> it<00:04:22.750> on<00:04:22.870> low<00:04:23.280> because<00:04:24.280> that

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
a hairdryer put it on low because that

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.070 
a hairdryer put it on low because that
could<00:04:24.699> damage<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.389> fibers<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.840> its<00:04:25.960> my

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
could damage the fibers of its my

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.439 
could damage the fibers of its my
heat-resistant<00:04:26.680> um<00:04:27.000> so<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.090> could<00:04:28.270> use<00:04:28.389> a

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
heat-resistant um so you could use a

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.360 
heat-resistant um so you could use a
hairdryer<00:04:28.630> but<00:04:29.080> this<00:04:29.229> does<00:04:29.500> this<00:04:30.159> whole

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
hairdryer but this does this whole

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.430 
hairdryer but this does this whole
