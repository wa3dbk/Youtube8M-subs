00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.109
 well well well I downloaded the new one 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 ford island which is available from 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.639
 marketplace of the live box that you can 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.509
 go directly to the main menu 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.940
 of halo 4 go here is practically 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.160
 neighbors downloaded to the new ford island 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.949
 which is free so it is absolutely 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.699
 free but I only downloaded 150 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:32.160
 4.84 megabytes we send a little bit to 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.380
 look at it infiniti teatro no kato orge e 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.649
 I call this new star ford 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.350
 let's see what we'll find 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.690
 front tendentially I have already given 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.239
 take a look and a very large map 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.219
 and where practically anything can be done 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.050
 I tend to specify to emphasize that 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.500
 I'm not a porter at all 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.969
 anzio skill 0 as a strength e 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.510
 so I don't understand it practically 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.270
 anything 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.079
 but if there is one sure thing is that the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.789
 map is fantastic because I read a little 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.790
 of opinions around people 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.350
 to do and it is wonderful ie huge there 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.150
 you can do pretty much what 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.299
 we want 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.950
 then let's go into camera mode 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.840
 as they say we go and see 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.409
 then I have already seen that one can get up 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.900
 at incredible levels you can go 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.140
 very much at the top and consequently there 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.110
 you can manage achievement maps 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 jones indian horse so you can do it 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.520
 really there is everything you see 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.299
 some platforms like this one below 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.060
 these side all the various islets 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.950
 with the torches of the mountains that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.350
 you see on the horizon and to make you understand 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.649
 what distance is it I am going forward 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.560
 quickly look at how slow 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.590
 take yourself with how big 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.350
 this map really more giff skiff 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.909
 orders will surely have bread for i 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.450
 their teeth 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:06.179
 the structure is practically that 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 bucolic hillside presenting a map 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:12.780
 I would say that there are all the conditions 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.390
 in order to have material in hand 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.250
 really comfy really nice and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.650
 especially to develop new maps 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.090
 it is also competitive and that 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.769
 will allow you to really see gods 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.360
 big shot you really work one thing 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.130
 interesting on which I want you 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.660
 pause then that is the only one I have 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.799
 seen and then I would like to cast cola 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.170
 belfiore of the group of 17,000 unc 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:39.680
 that he will be pointed out in a post is 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.840
 that if I open place object and go to 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.930
 structures in sports island facilities 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.510
 there should be a green screen 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.459
 here it is what the green screen is 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.420
 practically the green screen is the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.980
 classic green tarpaulin that you use 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.950
 for tam ad hollywood at the cinema for 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.849
 practically 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.970
 apparently the scenes turn then mount behind 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.730
 the image you want to 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:15.420
 consequently I would say that you are a real VIP 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:18.670
 machinima and anything else 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.110
 I would say that you could create the stage 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.780
 to show some skits some 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.630
 vignettes some situations of their own 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.540
 perfect video exactly christmas because 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.640
 practically the green towel with many 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.549
 over a people 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.280
 having said that I think I did a 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.319
 very quick review very little 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.470
 technique but I think he gave me to 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.910
 all an idea of ​​how it is 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.090
 incredibly damn big 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.150
 this islàm strength I greet you all 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.450
 even a greeting from richard and 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.069
 italia.com 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.810
 I recommend if you enjoyed the video 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.519
 put a like if you have questions and 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.959
 make them also because we will be ready to 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.799
