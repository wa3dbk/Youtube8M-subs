speed and distance added advantages of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.330 
speed and distance added advantages of
us<00:00:57.660> leveraging<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> technology<00:00:58.800> means<00:00:59.070> that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
us leveraging to technology means that

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.880 
us leveraging to technology means that
we're<00:00:59.460> able<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.079> provide<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.260> application

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
we're able to provide an application

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
we're able to provide an application
that<00:01:02.039> works<00:01:02.160> indoors<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> outdoors<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.660> when

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
that works indoors and outdoors so when

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.630 
that works indoors and outdoors so when
you're<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> treadmill<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:05.189> app<00:01:05.430> can

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you're on the treadmill this app can

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.760 
you're on the treadmill this app can
still<00:01:05.880> work<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.330> provide<00:01:06.659> time<00:01:07.080> distance<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
still work and provide time distance and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.740 
still work and provide time distance and
speed<00:01:08.040> recording<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> go

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
speed recording for you but if you go

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.840 
speed recording for you but if you go
outdoors<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> has<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.040> added<00:01:11.159> advantage<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
outdoors it has the added advantage of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.480 
outdoors it has the added advantage of
using<00:01:12.000> GPS<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.960> map<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.170> route<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.220> can

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
using GPS to map your route so you can

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.330 
using GPS to map your route so you can
always<00:01:14.790> come<00:01:15.030> back<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.270> relive<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> run<00:01:16.340> in

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
always come back and relive the run in

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.370 
always come back and relive the run in
the<00:01:17.400> New<00:01:17.670> nike+<00:01:18.240> gps<00:01:18.270> app<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.960> sometimes
