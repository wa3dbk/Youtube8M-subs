Note<00:02:04.380> 3<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.670> has<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.509> stitching<00:02:07.140> around

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
Note 3 I think has this stitching around

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.229 
Note 3 I think has this stitching around
it<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.459> kind<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:09.060> that

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
it it's like that it's kind of like that

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.260 
it it's like that it's kind of like that
has<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.110> leather<00:02:10.259> stitching<00:02:10.739> around<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.340> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
has the leather stitching around it so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.670 
has the leather stitching around it so
that's<00:02:12.480> how<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> back<00:02:12.930> is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
