00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
logo I'd suggest making a PNG in

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.460 
logo I'd suggest making a PNG in
Photoshop<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:02.300> logo<00:03:03.300> probably<00:03:04.140> something

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
Photoshop and logo probably something

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.130 
Photoshop and logo probably something
about<00:03:05.069> four<00:03:05.670> inches<00:03:05.940> wide<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.660> about<00:03:06.780> two

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
about four inches wide and about two

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.140 
about four inches wide and about two
inches<00:03:07.470> high<00:03:07.680> works<00:03:08.160> pretty<00:03:08.819> well<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:11.150> make

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
inches high works pretty well and make

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.030 
inches high works pretty well and make
it<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.360> PNG<00:03:12.690> because<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.739> way<00:03:13.890> it's

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
it a PNG because that way it's

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.810 
it a PNG because that way it's
transparent<00:03:14.790> jpg<00:03:15.600> will<00:03:15.900> have<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.640> white<00:03:17.640> or<00:03:17.790> a

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
transparent jpg will have a white or a

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.600 
transparent jpg will have a white or a
black<00:03:17.880> background<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.079> it's<00:03:19.650> just<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
black background on it it's just the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.020 
black background on it it's just the
format<00:03:22.010> opacity<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.310> about<00:03:23.489> fifty

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
format opacity I like about fifty

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.970 
format opacity I like about fifty
percent<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.810> go<00:03:24.989> under<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.620> pretty

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
percent if you go under it it's pretty

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.190 
percent if you go under it it's pretty
bright<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.670> don't<00:03:27.120> want<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.480> distract<00:03:27.870> that

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
bright I don't want to distract that

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.430 
bright I don't want to distract that
much<00:03:28.560> from<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.920> image<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.489> do<00:03:29.610> want<00:03:30.060> my<00:03:30.440> my

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
much from the image but I do want my my

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.220 
much from the image but I do want my my
logo<00:03:31.709> on<00:03:31.980> there<00:03:33.110> just<00:03:35.450> some<00:03:36.450> people<00:03:36.780> don't<00:03:37.019> put

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
logo on there just some people don't put

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.690 
logo on there just some people don't put
their<00:03:37.380> logos<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:37.890> there<00:03:38.070> but<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.280> believe<00:03:38.670> that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
their logos on there but I believe that

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.910 
their logos on there but I believe that
your<00:03:39.269> logo<00:03:39.600> ought<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.019> anything<00:03:40.560> that

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
your logo ought to be on anything that

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.380 
your logo ought to be on anything that
goes<00:03:41.070> up<00:03:41.250> on<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.489> internet<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.030> then<00:03:42.209> the

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
goes up on the internet and then the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.710 
goes up on the internet and then the
size<00:03:42.630> proportion<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:44.250> can<00:03:44.519> zoom<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.630> zoom

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
size proportion you can zoom and zoom

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.420 
size proportion you can zoom and zoom
out<00:03:46.049> there<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.380> generally<00:03:46.890> leave<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.250> like

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
out there I generally leave it like

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.699 
out there I generally leave it like
fifteen<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.150> twenty<00:03:48.510> percent<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.470> know<00:03:49.500> you

fifteen to twenty percent you know you

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.199 
fifteen to twenty percent you know you
can<00:03:50.010> fit<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.940> thing<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.750> can<00:03:51.959> fill<00:03:52.380> it

can fit it to that thing you can fill it

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.140 
can fit it to that thing you can fill it
or<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.600> can<00:03:54.780> size<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.079> and<00:03:55.620> then<00:03:55.829> on<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.609> you
