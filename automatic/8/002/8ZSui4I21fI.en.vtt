00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.110 

now<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.500> might<00:02:44.950> want<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.490> switch<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.940> back

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
now you might want to switch it back

00:02:46.120 --> 00:03:06.349 
now you might want to switch it back
again<00:02:46.510> for<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.350> water<00:02:48.100> style

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.420 

now<00:03:07.359> let's<00:03:07.689> work<00:03:07.900> on<00:03:07.959> additional<00:03:08.560> magic<00:03:09.129> which

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
now let's work on additional magic which

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:24.350 
now let's work on additional magic which
is<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.879> kick<00:03:10.120> strike<00:03:10.510> ring

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.780 

now<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.420> color<00:03:25.840> changes<00:03:26.379> whenever<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:27.519> ring

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
now the color changes whenever the ring

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.300 
now the color changes whenever the ring
is<00:03:27.970> scanned<00:03:28.599> on<00:03:28.810> top<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.470> hand<00:03:29.680> for

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
is scanned on top of the hand for

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.539 
is scanned on top of the hand for
example<00:03:30.760> if<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.209> if<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.110> scan<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.920> flame

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
example if you if you scan this flame

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.210 
example if you if you scan this flame
ring<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:34.599> kick<00:03:34.810> strike<00:03:35.140> ring<00:03:35.409> will<00:03:35.680> emit<00:03:36.069> a

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
ring the kick strike ring will emit a

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:54.300 
ring the kick strike ring will emit a
red<00:03:36.730> color

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.740 

and<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.720> logic<00:03:56.230> is<00:03:56.380> if<00:03:56.920> you<00:03:57.459> use<00:03:57.489> this<00:03:58.300> water

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
and the logic is if you use this water

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.229 
and the logic is if you use this water
ring<00:03:59.140> it<00:03:59.620> will<00:03:59.950> emit<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.580> kick<00:04:00.760> strike<00:04:01.000> ring

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
ring it will emit the kick strike ring

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:21.720 
ring it will emit the kick strike ring
will<00:04:01.540> emit<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:02.080> blue<00:04:02.470> color

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.990 

and<00:04:22.470> just<00:04:23.470> for<00:04:23.590> kicks<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:24.010> can<00:04:24.160> even<00:04:24.340> confuse

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
and just for kicks you can even confuse

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.690 
and just for kicks you can even confuse
big<00:04:25.600> scanner<00:04:25.960> when<00:04:26.530> you<00:04:26.650> place<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.100> flame<00:04:27.460> and

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
big scanner when you place the flame and

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:47.210 
big scanner when you place the flame and
then<00:04:28.360> together<00:04:28.750> with<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.860> blue<00:04:30.190> ring

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.610 

and<00:04:48.389> if<00:04:49.389> you<00:04:49.510> place<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.960> ring<00:04:49.990> on<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.440> wrong

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
and if you place the ring on the wrong

00:04:50.620 --> 00:05:09.360 
and if you place the ring on the wrong
side<00:04:50.889> it<00:04:51.130> creates<00:04:51.610> an<00:04:51.760> error<00:04:52.000> message<00:05:08.370> while

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
side it creates an error message while

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.730 
side it creates an error message while
the<00:05:09.610> wizard<00:05:09.940> driver<00:05:10.210> looks<00:05:10.540> great<00:05:10.780> note<00:05:11.470> that

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
the wizard driver looks great note that

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.680 
the wizard driver looks great note that
the<00:05:11.800> pleading<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.730> dark<00:05:12.970> plastic<00:05:13.480> hand

some type of screen protectors also you

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.590 
some type of screen protectors also you

need to take care of the plating as

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.140 
need to take care of the plating as
these<00:05:23.380> scratch<00:05:23.919> easily<00:05:24.220> on<00:05:24.610> any<00:05:24.820> rough

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
these scratch easily on any rough

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.990 
these scratch easily on any rough

temperatures<00:05:28.570> moreover<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.860> limitation<00:05:30.430> is

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
temperatures moreover the limitation is

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.969 
temperatures moreover the limitation is
on<00:05:30.850> the<00:05:31.000> driver<00:05:31.240> itself<00:05:31.690> because<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.560> sounds

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
on the driver itself because the sounds

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.430 
on the driver itself because the sounds
are<00:05:33.160> embedded<00:05:33.760> on<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.090> toy<00:05:34.300> and<00:05:34.630> not<00:05:35.139> on<00:05:35.380> the
