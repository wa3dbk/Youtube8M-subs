00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
this is more of their way of explaining

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.530 
this is more of their way of explaining
how<00:03:48.220> they're<00:03:48.400> not<00:03:48.550> going<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.790> use<00:03:48.970> EXO's

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
how they're not going to use EXO's

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.750

instead<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.320> using<00:03:50.500> EXO<00:03:50.980> that's<00:03:51.280> literally

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
instead of using EXO that's literally

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.640 
instead of using EXO that's literally

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
way for you to deviate from the EXO

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.210 
way for you to deviate from the EXO
which<00:04:07.420> I'm<00:04:07.600> doing<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.990> EXO's<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.620> same

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
which I'm doing the EXO's the same

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.340 
which I'm doing the EXO's the same
I<00:04:09.250> think<00:04:09.820> this<00:04:09.970> uh<00:04:10.150> this<00:04:10.450> is<00:04:10.600> we<00:04:10.750> probably<00:04:10.990> want

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
I think this uh this is we probably want

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.979 
I think this uh this is we probably want
to<00:04:11.410> see<00:04:11.500> some<00:04:11.680> game<00:04:14.250> it's<00:04:15.250> really<00:04:15.670> just<00:04:16.239> as<00:04:16.750> far

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
to see some game it's really just as far

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.500 
to see some game it's really just as far
as<00:04:17.080> introducing<00:04:17.500> me<00:04:18.330> because<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.480> whole

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
as introducing me because the whole

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.390 
as introducing me because the whole
concept<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:20.320> doing<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:20.890> this<00:04:21.010> is<00:04:21.220> that

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
concept of doing so on this is that

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.040 
concept of doing so on this is that
evolution<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:22.150> all<00:04:22.300> have<00:04:22.540> to<00:04:22.750> my<00:04:22.870> tea<00:04:22.930> party

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
advanced warfare we all know we use the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.940 
advanced warfare we all know we use the
