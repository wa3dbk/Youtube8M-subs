00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 all major hotel groups have the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.390
 look to africa 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.680
 but he stands at the general on the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.650
 niche of the five stars 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.960
 well here is the new onomo channel 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.410
 she chose to tackle all three 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.540
 stars 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.980
 in other words the average range we 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.090
 look in less than three years the place 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.369
 has become one of the most 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.630
 connected with dakar a few hundred 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.529
 meters from airport runways 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.930
 international 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.830
 the exhibitions the openings the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.830
 concerts follow one another 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.960
 we asked an artist to use this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.600
 wall it told him that's what dakar 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.579
 and he produced us 100 so it's 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.750
 slices of life are a little bit of everything 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.199
 the little sketches of empty dakar of 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.460
 dubus the palaver the fishing people who 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.930
 greets woman who cook the traffics 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.969
 the horses all this is a slice of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.409
 life dakar welcome artists 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.839
 make frescoes 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.729
 the approach is innovative opened in 2010 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.970
 the onomo hotel in dakar is the first 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.350
 of a nascent hotel chain to 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.360
 differentiate the signboard chose a 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.590
 ethnic marketing approach the color 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.500
 local must display 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.240
 here we talk about ecology culture but we 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.950
 do not forget the technology 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.390
 the target is an African clientele 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.390
 young and trendy 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.970
 we get a lot of men 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.160
 African business transiting on 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.390
 dakar or who come squarely on 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.100
 dakar for seminars 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.590
 today we can note that the man 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.290
 African businesses spend more than 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.880
 time at the hotel than at home with 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.040
 Rooms at 40 thousand francs CFA 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.510
 the strategy of the chain and respond 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.430
 at the emergence of this middle place 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.840
 business and executives who do not 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.820
 do not necessarily seek a palace five 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.340
 stars but who need to be 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.770
 connected we can have someone who is going 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.750
 to be at benin in south africa and new 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.810
 york and have a quadripartite meeting 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.640
 between our customers who are meeting the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.400
 Benin Cape and New York 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.680
 here then 70% of the customer is 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.000
 african to onomo we are very proud of 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.130
 remember that the hotel was built 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.990
 according to local technique, you are specified 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.640
 same as the walls are in raw mud 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.000
 rufisque from the suburbs of 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.459
 dakar 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.930
 an eco concept and what we 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.930
 found of course in the rooms 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.110
 the onomo room which is interesting 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.870
 in the bed for example it's the covers 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.330
 bed that is here and the curtain have been 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.660
 woven in dakar it's issa dionne that has 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.950
 do that with African cotton that has 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.590
 here so there is a local touch with a 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.569
 occupancy rate of 81% and a figure 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.640
 business of 1 billion 600 million 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.810
 francs cfa the establishment is approaching 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.760
 its break-even point 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.340
 just like the other two hotels in the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.140
 mark at abidjan libreville des 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.550
 successful implantations that pushes the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.320
 batipart group owner of 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.080
 teach it to expand as fast as possible 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.550
 possible 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.130
 we have a hotel under construction in Bamako 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.739
 we just laid the foundation stone 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.380
 lomé and today we are in phase 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.319
 expansion of research courses 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.090
 place to implant areas with the word and 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.190
 there is not a single country in Africa that 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.140
 we are not interested in growth 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.970
 sustainable development and the emergence 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.069
 new middle class have comforted 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.370
 their strategy the batipart group 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.290
 announces ambitious program 92 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.450
 billion francs CFA for the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.810
 construction of 25 new hotels in the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.920
 Mark 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.410
 throughout the African continent 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.400
 and gabriel fal you travel a lot 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.930
 I imagine 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.270
 did you notice 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.790
 the emergence of this middle class who 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.520
 is the target of this hotel chain 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.790
 absolutely you know tourism 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.980
 Business develops the africa 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.560
 ars are going to visit the others and we 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.770
 looking to do business and I 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.200
 know the onomo hotel of dakar and 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.720
 I can say that in fact you have 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:09.120
 stayed in his dreams and I even 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:12.959
 been their financial advice and so I 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.169
 have to say that it's really a 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.700
 interesting segments of the market 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:20.220
 today you have in these hotels there 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:26.370
 a room 40 thousand francs CFA 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.660
 that is to say about 80 euros for the 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.120
 to spend a night in a hotel 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.290
 comfortable clean I'm a little 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.330
 curious what you have them 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.840
 advised since you and and their 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.460
 advisors 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.950
 I actually was the editing 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.110
 financial because these are it's 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.050
 a chain that starts that needed 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.060
 to have financial advice on the 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.390
 structure so precisely of their 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.490
 capital financing in debt where 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.510
 to find the best 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.610
 financial conditions 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.310
 so I'm doing it for them but I 'm going 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.310
 also for a channel called 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.010
 that of other chains azalaï or telium 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.930
 it's interesting because I saw 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.340
 that finally the big chains 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.419
 hoteliers was a little bit 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.220
 race to have the best 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.460
 locations you have concept is 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.950
 simple yes it's really part of me 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.500
 say the investment strategy 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.910
 the location for a hotel the net the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.910
 quality and simple touching
