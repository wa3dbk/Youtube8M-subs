00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.930 

in<00:01:01.390> Julia<00:01:02.320> I'm<00:01:02.500> going<00:01:03.130> to<00:01:03.250> play<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.610> same

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
in Julia I'm going to play the same

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.750 
in Julia I'm going to play the same
pattern<00:01:04.420> but<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.350> time<00:01:05.620> I'll<00:01:05.890> add<00:01:06.070> my<00:01:06.250> pinky

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
pattern but this time I'll add my pinky

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:16.330 
pattern but this time I'll add my pinky
finger<00:01:06.790> like<00:01:07.780> this

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.700 

notice<00:01:17.340> how<00:01:17.549> when<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.210> add<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.689> pinky<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
notice how when you add your pinky the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.950 
notice how when you add your pinky the
thumb<00:01:20.009> now<00:01:20.250> only<00:01:20.549> plays<00:01:20.880> half<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.479> bass<00:01:21.659> notes

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
thumb now only plays half the bass notes

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
thumb now only plays half the bass notes
and<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.680> index<00:01:23.040> finger<00:01:23.189> covers<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.909> other

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and the index finger covers the other

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
and the index finger covers the other
half<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> less<00:01:25.799> common<00:01:25.829> approach<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
half this is a less common approach to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.149 
half this is a less common approach to
travel<00:01:27.240> style<00:01:27.509> picking<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.649> I<00:01:28.680> find<00:01:29.009> it's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
travel style picking but I find it's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.160 
travel style picking but I find it's
useful<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.610> help<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:30.119> your<00:01:30.270> pinky<00:01:30.600> involved

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
useful to help get your pinky involved

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.490 
useful to help get your pinky involved
try<00:01:32.100> both<00:01:32.340> ways<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.939> use<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> method<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
try both ways and use the method that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.969 
try both ways and use the method that
works<00:01:34.710> best<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:37.080> first<00:01:37.380> chord<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
works best for you the first chord in

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.999 
works best for you the first chord in
Julia<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.789> C<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:40.020> pinky<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.530> the
