00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
had a bad bushing is blown out pretty

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.240 
had a bad bushing is blown out pretty
bad

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
bad

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.840 
bad
so<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.150> had<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.420> get<00:02:15.570> some<00:02:15.720> new<00:02:15.870> stuff<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.580> that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
so I had to get some new stuff so that

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.000 
so I had to get some new stuff so that
skin<00:02:18.210> at<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.420> washer<00:02:18.870> sky<00:02:19.110> used<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.800> sit

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
skin at this washer sky used to sit

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.800 
skin at this washer sky used to sit
under<00:02:20.040> here<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.210> washer<00:02:21.480> would<00:02:21.600> sit

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
under here but that washer would sit

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.250 
under here but that washer would sit
like<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.850> after<00:02:24.090> once<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.990> get<00:02:25.140> it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
like this and after once you get it

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.190 
like this and after once you get it
through<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.130> caster<00:02:26.520> camber<00:02:26.730> plate

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
through the the caster camber plate

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.870 
through the the caster camber plate
you're<00:02:28.200> gonna<00:02:28.290> have<00:02:28.470> another<00:02:28.680> washer<00:02:30.350> here

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
you're gonna have another washer here

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.030 
you're gonna have another washer here
then<00:02:32.880> you're<00:02:33.000> gonna<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.240> your<00:02:33.360> knife<00:02:33.510> like

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
then you're gonna have your knife like

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.800 
then you're gonna have your knife like
that

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
that

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.680 
that
now<00:02:36.810> there<00:02:37.350> are<00:02:37.470> variances<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:39.240> spacers

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
now there are variances in the spacers

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.050 
now there are variances in the spacers
that<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:40.020> use<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.370> washers<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.790> you

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
that you use and the washers that you

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.840 
that you use and the washers that you
use<00:02:42.440> usually<00:02:43.440> your<00:02:43.740> camber<00:02:44.040> caster<00:02:44.280> kit<00:02:44.670> is

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
use usually your camber caster kit is

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.610 
use usually your camber caster kit is
gonna<00:02:45.060> give<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.390> up<00:02:45.570> different<00:02:45.990> sizes<00:02:46.410> which

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
gonna give you up different sizes which

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.940 
gonna give you up different sizes which
is<00:02:46.650> right<00:02:46.980> here<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> bigger<00:02:49.140> spacer

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
is right here this is a bigger spacer

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.699 
is right here this is a bigger spacer
this<00:02:50.459> bigger<00:02:50.880> spacer<00:02:51.270> usually<00:02:51.660> goes<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
this bigger spacer usually goes on the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.240 
this bigger spacer usually goes on the
bottom

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
bottom

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.730 
bottom
some<00:02:54.060> people<00:02:54.360> might<00:02:54.540> substitute<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.440> bigger

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
some people might substitute this bigger

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.590 
some people might substitute this bigger
spacer<00:02:56.660> for<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.930> washer<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.770> this<00:02:59.600> this

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
spacer for this washer and this this

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.670 
spacer for this washer and this this
spacer<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:02.730> ends<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.060> actually<00:03:03.209> being<00:03:03.680> about

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
spacer it ends up actually being about

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.290 
spacer it ends up actually being about
the<00:03:04.830> same<00:03:05.420> when<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.510> look<00:03:06.690> at<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.120> that's

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
the same when you look at so that's

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.650 
the same when you look at so that's
about<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.840> that's<00:03:10.110> what<00:03:10.290> I'm<00:03:10.440> using<00:03:10.680> and

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
about that that's what I'm using and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.090 
about that that's what I'm using and
then<00:03:12.660> that's<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.080> variance<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.070> a

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
then that's the variance this is a

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.100 
then that's the variance this is a
bigger<00:03:14.370> spacer<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:16.320> then<00:03:16.550> on<00:03:17.550> top<00:03:17.930> instead<00:03:18.930> of

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
bigger spacer and then on top instead of

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.040 
bigger spacer and then on top instead of
having<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.500> washer<00:03:20.390> like<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.540> have<00:03:21.720> cuz<00:03:21.930> these

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
having a washer like I have cuz these

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.500 
having a washer like I have cuz these
are<00:03:22.200> for<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.470> bushings<00:03:23.000> other<00:03:24.000> people<00:03:24.360> will

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
are for the bushings other people will

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.449 
are for the bushings other people will
have<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:25.170> depending<00:03:26.070> on<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.250> type<00:03:26.430> of

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
have this depending on the type of

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.580 
have this depending on the type of
bushing<00:03:26.880> that's<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.269> your<00:03:27.480> camber<00:03:28.350> caster

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
bushing that's in your camber caster

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.770 
bushing that's in your camber caster
plate<00:03:31.580> that's<00:03:32.580> here<00:03:32.880> I'll<00:03:33.420> show<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.660> the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
plate that's here I'll show you the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.940 
plate that's here I'll show you the
difference<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.320> size<00:03:34.560> comparisons<00:03:36.800> this<00:03:37.800> is

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
difference the size comparisons this is

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.930 
difference the size comparisons this is
the<00:03:38.070> bigger<00:03:38.250> one<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.580> smaller<00:03:38.850> now<00:03:40.940> it's

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
the bigger one the smaller now it's

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.490 
the bigger one the smaller now it's
gonna<00:03:42.150> depend<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.750> whether<00:03:43.019> or<00:03:43.110> not<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.380> have

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
gonna depend on whether or not you have

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.490 
gonna depend on whether or not you have
a<00:03:43.530> coil<00:03:43.860> over<00:03:44.070> or<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.519> stock<00:03:45.209> style<00:03:45.540> shock

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
a coil over or a stock style shock

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.270 
a coil over or a stock style shock
assembly<00:03:47.570> I've<00:03:48.570> already<00:03:48.959> put<00:03:49.140> together<00:03:49.290> my

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
assembly I've already put together my

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.530 
assembly I've already put together my
car<00:03:50.580> with<00:03:51.830> this<00:03:52.830> spacer<00:03:53.370> in<00:03:53.610> this<00:03:53.790> washer<00:03:54.330> I

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
car with this spacer in this washer I

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.870 
car with this spacer in this washer I
basically<00:03:55.320> just<00:03:55.440> pretended<00:03:56.100> that<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.570> the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
basically just pretended that the the

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.570 
basically just pretended that the the
that<00:03:59.880> mine<00:04:00.120> have<00:04:00.360> bushings<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.070> it<00:04:02.070> works<00:04:02.310> I

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
that mine have bushings and it works I

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.120 
that mine have bushings and it works I
just<00:04:02.610> checked<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.209> out<00:04:03.299> so<00:04:03.959> I'll<00:04:04.560> go<00:04:04.709> over<00:04:04.739> what

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
just checked it out so I'll go over what

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.600 
just checked it out so I'll go over what
it<00:04:05.220> looks<00:04:05.370> like<00:04:05.549> on<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.760> car<00:04:07.130> this<00:04:08.130> is<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
it looks like on the car this is the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.400 
it looks like on the car this is the
camber<00:04:08.940> caster<00:04:09.180> plate<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:09.780> hasn't<00:04:09.959> had<00:04:10.260> the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
camber caster plate that hasn't had the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.180 
camber caster plate that hasn't had the
strut<00:04:10.680> put<00:04:10.890> through<00:04:11.070> yet<00:04:12.799> that's<00:04:13.799> got<00:04:14.100> the

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
strut put through yet that's got the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.310 
strut put through yet that's got the
adjustability<00:04:14.730> now<00:04:15.060> sometimes<00:04:15.540> then<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.109> put

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
adjustability now sometimes then you put

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.870 
adjustability now sometimes then you put
these<00:04:16.470> in<00:04:16.680> you'll<00:04:16.799> have<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.100> drill<00:04:17.400> an<00:04:17.549> extra

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
these in you'll have to drill an extra

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.650 
these in you'll have to drill an extra
hole<00:04:18.060> I'm<00:04:18.900> gonna<00:04:19.109> go<00:04:19.290> over<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.709> real<00:04:20.040> quick

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
to make sure that it'll clear the hood

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.610 
to make sure that it'll clear the hood
when<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.400> hood<00:06:05.550> comes<00:06:05.820> down<00:06:06.090> so<00:06:06.870> make<00:06:07.590> sure

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
when the hood comes down so make sure

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.610 
when the hood comes down so make sure
you<00:06:08.420> check<00:06:09.420> your<00:06:09.600> hood<00:06:09.780> clearance<00:06:10.020> before<00:06:10.530> you

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
you check your hood clearance before you

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.870 
you check your hood clearance before you
slam<00:06:10.800> your<00:06:10.920> hood<00:06:11.160> because<00:06:11.310> you<00:06:11.520> could<00:06:11.670> damage

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880

where<00:06:37.979> the<00:06:38.070> plate<00:06:38.340> sits<00:06:38.790> so<00:06:39.660> you<00:06:39.720> might<00:06:39.930> have

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
where the plate sits so you might have

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.610 
where the plate sits so you might have
to<00:06:40.080> figure

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
to figure

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.350 
to figure
or<00:06:41.130> make<00:06:41.490> sure<00:06:41.520> you<00:06:41.760> drill<00:06:41.970> the<00:06:42.060> hole<00:06:42.210> in<00:06:42.300> the

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
or make sure you drill the hole in the

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.659 
or make sure you drill the hole in the
right<00:06:42.510> spot<00:06:42.870> there<00:06:43.680> is<00:06:43.800> usually<00:06:44.010> directions

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
right spot there is usually directions

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.810 
right spot there is usually directions
for<00:06:44.850> you<00:06:44.940> to<00:06:44.970> do<00:06:45.210> that<00:06:45.860> also<00:06:46.860> if<00:06:47.460> you're<00:06:47.729> not

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
for you to do that also if you're not

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.760 
for you to do that also if you're not
getting<00:06:48.060> enough<00:06:48.360> camber<00:06:48.810> adjustment<00:06:48.840> out<00:06:49.620> of

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
getting enough camber adjustment out of

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.189 
getting enough camber adjustment out of
these<00:06:49.889> this<00:06:50.280> type<00:06:50.520> of<00:06:50.570> camber<00:06:51.570> caster<00:06:51.780> plate

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
these this type of camber caster plate

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.050 
these this type of camber caster plate
you<00:06:52.680> can<00:06:52.830> actually<00:06:53.130> take<00:06:53.310> this<00:06:53.520> piece<00:06:53.850> over

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
you can actually take this piece over

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.629 
you can actually take this piece over
here<00:06:54.449> and<00:06:54.600> flip<00:06:55.500> it<00:06:55.530> to<00:06:55.800> the<00:06:55.830> other<00:06:55.949> side<00:06:56.190> of

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
here and flip it to the other side of

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.500 
here and flip it to the other side of
the<00:06:56.699> car<00:06:56.960> put<00:06:57.960> it<00:06:58.020> on<00:06:58.169> the<00:06:58.290> other<00:06:58.380> side<00:06:58.500> and

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 
the car put it on the other side and

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.790 
the car put it on the other side and
that's<00:07:00.510> why<00:07:00.690> there's<00:07:00.930> this<00:07:01.080> extra<00:07:01.440> bowl<00:07:01.620> and

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
that's why there's this extra bowl and

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.680 
that's why there's this extra bowl and
then<00:07:01.919> you'll<00:07:02.040> get<00:07:02.190> your<00:07:02.250> more<00:07:03.000> adjustment<00:07:03.570> the

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
then you'll get your more adjustment the

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.080 
then you'll get your more adjustment the
other<00:07:03.870> way<00:07:04.220> because<00:07:05.220> it<00:07:05.490> pretty<00:07:05.729> much<00:07:05.820> will

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
other way because it pretty much will

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.730 
other way because it pretty much will
sit<00:07:06.360> in<00:07:06.479> the<00:07:06.510> max<00:07:07.020> out<00:07:09.350> I'm<00:07:10.350> not<00:07:10.470> sure<00:07:10.650> if

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 
sit in the max out I'm not sure if

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.260 
sit in the max out I'm not sure if
there's<00:07:10.919> anything<00:07:11.160> else<00:07:11.370> I<00:07:11.550> want<00:07:11.729> to<00:07:11.790> go<00:07:11.940> over

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
there's anything else I want to go over

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.510 
there's anything else I want to go over
today<00:07:12.780> just<00:07:13.590> remember<00:07:14.010> when<00:07:14.160> you<00:07:14.250> go<00:07:14.460> to

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
today just remember when you go to

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.820 
today just remember when you go to
actually<00:07:15.060> finally<00:07:15.510> have<00:07:15.810> the<00:07:15.990> alignment<00:07:16.380> done

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
actually finally have the alignment done

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.969 
actually finally have the alignment done
just<00:07:17.820> remember<00:07:18.240> he<00:07:18.389> may<00:07:18.600> or<00:07:18.960> whoever<00:07:19.470> does<00:07:19.770> the

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 
just remember he may or whoever does the

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:21.409 
just remember he may or whoever does the
alignment<00:07:20.340> may<00:07:20.460> have<00:07:20.639> to<00:07:20.820> actually<00:07:21.120> remove

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
alignment may have to actually remove

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:23.600 
alignment may have to actually remove
these<00:07:21.720> plates<00:07:22.080> and<00:07:22.410> make<00:07:22.919> an<00:07:23.039> adjustment<00:07:23.160> to

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
these plates and make an adjustment to

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.420 
these plates and make an adjustment to
where<00:07:23.880> they're<00:07:24.030> sitting<00:07:24.300> if<00:07:24.600> the<00:07:24.720> bolt<00:07:24.960> isn't

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
where they're sitting if the bolt isn't

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.890 
where they're sitting if the bolt isn't
sitting<00:07:26.430> right<00:07:26.729> or<00:07:26.880> wasn't<00:07:27.180> drilled<00:07:27.389> properly

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 
sitting right or wasn't drilled properly

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.330 
sitting right or wasn't drilled properly
they<00:07:28.289> might<00:07:28.440> have<00:07:28.560> to<00:07:28.650> hog<00:07:28.830> out<00:07:29.010> the<00:07:29.160> hole<00:07:29.310> a

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 
they might have to hog out the hole a

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.420 
they might have to hog out the hole a
little<00:07:29.580> bit<00:07:29.850> more<00:07:30.090> to<00:07:30.300> get<00:07:30.449> the<00:07:30.600> angles<00:07:30.990> right

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:31.430 
little bit more to get the angles right

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.590 
little bit more to get the angles right
or<00:07:32.430> they'll<00:07:32.610> have<00:07:32.729> to<00:07:32.910> flip<00:07:33.150> your<00:07:33.270> plates

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:33.600 
or they'll have to flip your plates

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.900 
or they'll have to flip your plates
around<00:07:34.020> I<00:07:34.560> haven't<00:07:35.250> done<00:07:35.340> the<00:07:35.490> alignment<00:07:35.880> on

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:35.910 
around I haven't done the alignment on

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.760 
around I haven't done the alignment on
my<00:07:36.120> car<00:07:36.389> yet<00:07:36.630> obviously<00:07:37.289> it's<00:07:37.410> not<00:07:37.470> put<00:07:37.650> back

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
my car yet obviously it's not put back

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.830 
my car yet obviously it's not put back
together<00:07:37.949> but<00:07:38.400> I'll<00:07:38.760> know<00:07:39.060> if<00:07:39.270> I<00:07:39.389> have<00:07:39.570> to<00:07:39.690> make

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 
together but I'll know if I have to make

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.860 
together but I'll know if I have to make
an<00:07:39.990> adjustment<00:07:40.080> to<00:07:40.530> where<00:07:40.770> this<00:07:40.949> place<00:07:41.220> sits

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:41.870 
an adjustment to where this place sits

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.409 
an adjustment to where this place sits
and<00:07:42.870> then<00:07:43.289> I<00:07:43.320> could<00:07:43.620> do<00:07:43.800> that<00:07:44.010> but<00:07:44.729> I<00:07:45.060> have<00:07:45.330> to

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:45.419 
and then I could do that but I have to

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:47.029 
and then I could do that but I have to
just<00:07:45.450> get<00:07:45.750> them<00:07:45.840> in<00:07:45.990> the<00:07:46.110> car<00:07:46.289> and<00:07:46.530> ready<00:07:46.680> to<00:07:46.800> go

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 
just get them in the car and ready to go

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:49.400 
just get them in the car and ready to go
and<00:07:47.340> I<00:07:47.820> just<00:07:48.060> kind<00:07:48.240> of<00:07:48.330> just<00:07:48.479> self-centred<00:07:49.260> the

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.410 
and I just kind of just self-centred the

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.129 
and I just kind of just self-centred the
whole<00:07:49.590> plate<00:07:49.970> as<00:07:50.970> good<00:07:51.240> as<00:07:51.360> I<00:07:51.510> could<00:07:51.570> right<00:07:52.020> in

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139 
whole plate as good as I could right in

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.560 
whole plate as good as I could right in
the<00:07:52.229> middle<00:07:52.590> of<00:07:52.740> this<00:07:52.860> hole<00:07:53.099> so<00:07:53.400> far<00:07:53.669> just<00:07:54.450> so<00:07:54.539> I

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:54.570 
the middle of this hole so far just so I

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.879 
the middle of this hole so far just so I
can<00:07:54.660> drive<00:07:54.960> the<00:07:55.110> car<00:07:55.139> to<00:07:55.410> get<00:07:55.500> it<00:07:55.560> on<00:07:55.740> the

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:55.889 
can drive the car to get it on the

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:58.339 
can drive the car to get it on the
alignment<00:07:56.160> rack<00:07:56.430> but<00:07:57.180> that's<00:07:57.900> pretty<00:07:58.110> much

00:07:58.339 --> 00:07:58.349 
alignment rack but that's pretty much

00:07:58.349 --> 00:08:01.520 
alignment rack but that's pretty much
everything<00:07:58.590> in<00:07:58.979> a<00:07:59.039> nutshell<00:08:00.169> if<00:08:01.169> you<00:08:01.289> have<00:08:01.410> any
