00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Good morning today, we started talking about a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.750
 very common competition in the rural world 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.090
 who has never seen a rodeo 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.460
 you will know the rules and 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.120
 the equipment used not to hurt 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.219
 the bull 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.410
 our team went to know closely how 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.820
 these animals are treated and prepared 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.939
 for the test 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:27.119
 just take a look at well- behaved animals 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:30.289
 bulls that arrive to weigh 25 arrobas thousand 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.289
 and 200 pounds 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.880
 the look that scares 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.059
 are ready athletes bra competition for 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.110
 a good enhanced power performance 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.350
 and much, much more physical training 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.670
 I'm looking for her good, too. 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.969
 water season 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.399
 I'm keep them in the pasture and in season 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.260
 drought is careful to give a 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.629
 silage a better 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.790
 I also use ration before the rodeo. 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.580
 do a little preparation for them 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 running with them is probably about 30 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.150
 days before the start of the season 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.350
 Dodge also helps because otherwise they 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.100
 stand very still he got very 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.250
 heavy 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.090
 the tropeiro has 23 bulls prepared to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.189
 the rodeo 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.030
 are 12 years looking after the cattle 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.549
 make a good fundamental work today I 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.799
 I have a good handle. You chose the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.960
 best animals have to always stay in 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.119
 up so as not to let anything happen 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.549
 with them but even so it makes them 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.100
 they are gross they glow can happen 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.680
 and before each ride 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.170
 detail is important both for the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.229
 competitor and for the animal 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.420
 the bull can not be ill treated for 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.320
 this equipment should be well 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.479
 clear not to hurt the 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.579
 equipment are all standard 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.380
 spurs are all beautiful do not have 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.159
 may have no end to injure the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.219
 animal 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.850
 CDs are all wool not to injure 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.580
 it is not tight in the animal's life 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.780
 does not hold a testicle has nothing to do 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.129
 With the conversation, Kaka is pressing hurts by 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.050
 that all the public that was 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.489
 so you took the cd wielded 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.830
 any all any actor jumping out 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.459
 it would not have the value of a bull of 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.160
 rodeo today the result is this a show 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.239
 on the sands of botafogo beach already 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.239
 they played the phone 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.159
 and it is during the famous eight seconds that 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.890
 competitor and animal has to show the 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.230
 perfect performance and win a 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.689
 good score 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.780
 the ox is not really an enemy 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.939
 we do not even look at what makes us 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.950
 work that gives the job a good 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.750
 work for us with a good bull 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.060
 of rodeo as I am here is a bull that 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.829
 I'm going to change it it will provide note 5 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.769
 87 and 88 points 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.840
 So it 's depends a lot on doni motta 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.209
 single pawn do a good job 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.139
 the equipment ready and the double well 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.920
 ready 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:14.189
 will be evaluated by the examining judge has 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.889
 five criteria we evaluate a bull it 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:20.129
 You have to evaluate the jump him recoil 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.060
 the intensity and difficulty of the 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.700
 animal 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.599
 and in this and with this criterion the people 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.760
 judges the animal and then see the performance of 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.359
 competitor as it was above to arrive 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.359
 to the final result
