the most part now there is no fold-down
armrest<00:02:16.940> here<00:02:17.360> for<00:02:17.720> cupholders<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.320> you're

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
armrest here for cupholders so you're

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.590 
armrest here for cupholders so you're
limited<00:02:18.800> there<00:02:18.950> but<00:02:19.100> this<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.460> 60/40<00:02:20.300> fold

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
limited there but this is a 60/40 fold

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.330 
limited there but this is a 60/40 fold
down<00:02:20.720> split<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.560> way<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:21.800> can<00:02:22.010> create

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
down split so that way you can create

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.950 
down split so that way you can create
some<00:02:22.580> more<00:02:22.730> space<00:02:22.940> for<00:02:23.000> cargo<00:02:23.510> speaking<00:02:23.870> of

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
500l just kind of put them to the test

here<00:05:36.680> you<00:05:37.220> know<00:05:37.340> a<00:05:37.520> little<00:05:37.730> bit<00:05:37.820> of<00:05:37.910> a<00:05:37.940> body

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
here you know a little bit of a body

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.840 
here you know a little bit of a body
roll<00:05:38.420> so<00:05:39.350> it's<00:05:39.590> not<00:05:39.740> as<00:05:39.950> well<00:05:40.160> weighted<00:05:40.580> as<00:05:40.700> I'd

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
roll so it's not as well weighted as I'd

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.350 
roll so it's not as well weighted as I'd
like<00:05:41.150> in<00:05:41.360> fact<00:05:41.750> it's<00:05:41.960> 61<00:05:42.650> 39<00:05:43.460> in<00:05:43.790> terms<00:05:44.090> of

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
like in fact it's 61 39 in terms of

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.930 
like in fact it's 61 39 in terms of

it being 3,200 pounds could be a little

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.250 
it being 3,200 pounds could be a little
heavier<00:05:58.190> but<00:05:58.970> that's<00:05:59.420> okay

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
heavier but that's okay
