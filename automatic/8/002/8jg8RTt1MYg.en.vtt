farm is about 2,000 hectares we
purchased<00:00:28.550> flexi<00:00:30.109> finger-post<00:00:31.109> crop<00:00:31.410> lifters

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
purchased flexi finger-post crop lifters

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.930 
purchased flexi finger-post crop lifters
last<00:00:33.210> year<00:00:33.600> after<00:00:33.960> seeing<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.700> if<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.880> must

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
last year after seeing them if you must

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.119 
last year after seeing them if you must
be<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.960> at<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.890> whim<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
be for that at a at the whim of

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.080 
be for that at a at the whim of
machinery<00:00:38.579> field<00:00:38.850> basis<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.280> we<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
machinery field basis and we think that

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.600 
machinery field basis and we think that
has<00:00:42.210> probably<00:00:42.450> paid<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.379> itself<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
has probably paid for itself that

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
has probably paid for itself that
purchase<00:00:45.059> has<00:00:45.180> paid<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.450> itself<00:00:45.899> time<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
purchase has paid for itself time and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.450 
purchase has paid for itself time and
time<00:00:46.440> again<00:00:47.539> we<00:00:48.539> had<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> problem<00:00:49.530> last<00:00:49.800> year<00:00:50.039> in

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
time again we had a problem last year in

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.010 
time again we had a problem last year in
that<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.750> had<00:00:51.870> reasonably<00:00:52.620> heavy<00:00:52.800> crops<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
that we had reasonably heavy crops and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.510 
that we had reasonably heavy crops and
we<00:00:55.020> had<00:00:55.410> five<00:00:56.600> rain<00:00:57.600> events<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.440> over<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
we had five rain events which over the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.569 
we had five rain events which over the
period<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> harvest<00:01:00.980> total<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.100> 80

our<00:01:05.610> cereals<00:01:06.060> was<00:01:06.270> born<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:07.200> found<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.740> our

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
our cereals was born we found that our

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.340 
our cereals was born we found that our
field<00:01:09.299> peas<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.140> our<00:01:10.619> lentils<00:01:11.119> were<00:01:12.350> pushed

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
field peas and our lentils were pushed

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.310 
field peas and our lentils were pushed
into<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> progressively<00:01:14.640> pushed<00:01:15.509> down<00:01:16.049> into

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
into the progressively pushed down into

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.249 
into the progressively pushed down into
the<00:01:16.530> ground<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> Flexi<00:01:18.479> fingers<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.140> we

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the ground and the Flexi fingers that we

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.399 
the ground and the Flexi fingers that we
put<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:20.030> made<00:01:21.030> all<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> difference<00:01:21.509> we

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
put on made all the difference we

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.920 
put on made all the difference we
actually<00:01:22.799> grow<00:01:23.460> Morganfield<00:01:24.210> peas<00:01:24.509> which<00:01:24.750> are

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
actually grow Morganfield peas which are

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.640 
actually grow Morganfield peas which are
a<00:01:24.990> forage<00:01:25.680> pea<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.159> they're<00:01:26.970> very<00:01:27.229> bulky<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
a forage pea and they're very bulky and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.950 
a forage pea and they're very bulky and
they<00:01:28.799> had<00:01:28.920> come<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.369> sort<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.150> waist<00:01:30.390> high<00:01:30.659> or

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
they had come up sort of waist high or

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.310 
they had come up sort of waist high or
more<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:32.030> by<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> time<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.570> came<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.930> harvest

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
more and by the time we came to harvest

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.740 
more and by the time we came to harvest
them<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.820> walking<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.450> thin

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
them it was like walking on a thin

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.330 
them it was like walking on a thin
mattress<00:01:37.020> they<00:01:37.470> wouldn't<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:37.890> been<00:01:38.100> more

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
mattress they wouldn't have been more

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.649 
mattress they wouldn't have been more
than<00:01:39.409> 200<00:01:40.409> millimetres<00:01:40.950> off<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.790> ground<00:01:42.030> and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
than 200 millimetres off the ground and

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.090 
than 200 millimetres off the ground and
so<00:01:42.869> there's<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.200> enormous<00:01:43.560> amount<00:01:43.979> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
so there's this enormous amount of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.740 
so there's this enormous amount of
material<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:44.880> when<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.149> first<00:01:45.329> started

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
material now when we first started

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.730 
material now when we first started
harvesting<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.350> peas<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:48.140> pods<00:01:49.140> were<00:01:49.409> still

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
harvesting the peas the pods were still

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.469 
harvesting the peas the pods were still
in<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> top<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.549> plant<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.030> peas<00:01:51.270> were

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
in the top of the plant the peas were

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.670 
in the top of the plant the peas were
probably<00:01:52.549> two<00:01:53.549> still<00:01:53.939> two<00:01:54.119> foot<00:01:54.329> high<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.500> we

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
probably two still two foot high and we

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.219 
probably two still two foot high and we
left<00:01:55.890> quite<00:01:56.189> amount<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.579> material<00:01:57.079> with<00:01:58.079> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
left quite amount of material with the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.100 
left quite amount of material with the
Flex<00:01:58.469> front<00:01:58.770> across<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.549> top<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.930> was

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
Flex front across the top that was

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.020 
Flex front across the top that was
before<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.619> fitted<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> Flexi<00:02:02.369> fingers<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
before we fitted the Flexi fingers and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.459 
before we fitted the Flexi fingers and
then<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.020> season<00:02:04.380> went<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:05.640> quickly

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
then as the season went on we quickly

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.410 
then as the season went on we quickly
attached<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.710> Flexi<00:02:08.069> fingers<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.789> by<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
attached the Flexi fingers and by the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.630 
attached the Flexi fingers and by the
time<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:09.869> got<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.289> end<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> pea

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
time we got to the end of the pea

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.399 
time we got to the end of the pea

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.240 
harvest
we<00:02:14.409> were<00:02:14.739> literally<00:02:16.590> taking<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.709> off<00:02:17.950> and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
we were literally taking this off and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.039 
we were literally taking this off and
rollin<00:02:18.580> up<00:02:18.730> like<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:18.970> carpet<00:02:19.510> for<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.720> Flexi

interesting thing was at the end of the
pea<00:02:26.739> harvest<00:02:27.220> which<00:02:27.370> was<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.610> very<00:02:27.730> last<00:02:27.879> crop

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
pea harvest which was the very last crop

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.259 
pea harvest which was the very last crop
we<00:02:28.420> harvested<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.170> decided<00:02:30.069> I'd<00:02:30.370> go<00:02:30.610> back<00:02:30.910> and

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
we harvested I decided I'd go back and

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.660 
we harvested I decided I'd go back and
look<00:02:31.930> at<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.260> two<00:02:32.470> or<00:02:32.650> three<00:02:32.680> areas<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.459> we'd

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
look at the two or three areas that we'd

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.089 
look at the two or three areas that we'd
harvested<00:02:34.239> after<00:02:34.690> each<00:02:35.170> rain<00:02:35.500> event<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.069> the

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
harvested after each rain event and the

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.920 
harvested after each rain event and the
first<00:02:39.099> part<00:02:39.489> where<00:02:40.299> we<00:02:41.019> had<00:02:41.379> not<00:02:41.980> used<00:02:42.750> lifters

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.110 

we<00:02:46.930> picked<00:02:47.290> up<00:02:49.230> quite<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.290> deal<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:51.010> grain<00:02:51.760> in

we picked up quite a deal of grain in
fact<00:02:52.569> on<00:02:53.170> average<00:02:53.739> probably<00:02:53.950> between<00:02:54.400> 250<00:02:55.180> and

events and we found ourselves not being

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.680 
events and we found ourselves not being
able<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.630> get<00:03:52.810> any<00:03:54.150> lentils<00:03:55.150> back<00:03:55.359> off<00:03:55.540> the

ground without the Flexi fingers and we

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.159 
ground without the Flexi fingers and we
did<00:03:59.709> take<00:04:00.010> them<00:04:00.310> on<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:01.060> off<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.660> number<00:04:02.019> of

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
did take them on and off a number of

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.650 
did take them on and off a number of
times<00:04:02.440> just<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.859> double<00:04:03.220> check<00:04:03.489> as<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.450> whole

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
times just a double check as the whole

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.539 
times just a double check as the whole

cropping the whole harvesting program

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.270 
cropping the whole harvesting program
was<00:04:06.790> problematic<00:04:07.419> and<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:08.319> if<00:04:08.470> we<00:04:08.769> tried<00:04:09.099> with

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
was problematic and so if we tried with

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.460 
was problematic and so if we tried with
oil<00:04:09.519> try<00:04:09.790> without<00:04:10.120> them<00:04:10.299> today<00:04:10.449> and<00:04:10.840> we<00:04:11.349> would

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
oil try without them today and we would

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.409 
oil try without them today and we would
only<00:04:11.590> go<00:04:11.829> a<00:04:11.859> few<00:04:12.069> hundred<00:04:12.129> meters<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.910> say<00:04:13.060> no

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
only go a few hundred meters and say no

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.360 
only go a few hundred meters and say no
we're<00:04:13.690> leaving<00:04:13.810> too<00:04:14.079> much<00:04:14.260> behind<00:04:14.470> we<00:04:15.190> know

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
we're leaving too much behind we know

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.439 
we're leaving too much behind we know
better<00:04:15.579> off<00:04:15.730> in<00:04:15.879> fact<00:04:16.000> we<00:04:16.299> lot<00:04:16.479> worse<00:04:16.660> off<00:04:17.220> so

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
better off in fact we lot worse off so

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.729 
better off in fact we lot worse off so
they<00:04:19.449> really<00:04:20.019> did<00:04:20.229> pay<00:04:20.440> for<00:04:20.470> themselves

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
they really did pay for themselves

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.850 
they really did pay for themselves
particularly<00:04:21.430> was<00:04:21.700> we<00:04:21.909> were<00:04:22.860> fortunate

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
particularly was we were fortunate

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.000 
particularly was we were fortunate
enough<00:04:23.950> after<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:25.380> really

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
enough after a really

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.060 
enough after a really
bad<00:04:27.160> start<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.090> harvest<00:04:29.020> with<00:04:29.800> some

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
bad start to the harvest with some

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.760 
bad start to the harvest with some
premature<00:04:30.340> heat<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:31.440> literally<00:04:32.440> cooked<00:04:32.650> a

premature heat that literally cooked a

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.970 
premature heat that literally cooked a
lot<00:04:32.920> of<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.070> lentils<00:04:33.400> we<00:04:34.360> still<00:04:34.780> gain<00:04:35.530> heat

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
lot of the lentils we still gain heat

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.190 
lot of the lentils we still gain heat
despite<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.640> rain<00:04:36.820> we<00:04:37.120> still<00:04:37.390> gain<00:04:37.660> number1

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.250

think our screenings were somewhere in

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.960 
think our screenings were somewhere in
about<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.590> 10<00:04:44.770> or<00:04:44.860> 12<00:04:45.070> percent<00:04:45.160> mark<00:04:45.580> but

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
about the 10 or 12 percent mark but

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.490 
about the 10 or 12 percent mark but

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500
