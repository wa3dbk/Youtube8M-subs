true-bypass sleeper true bypassing is

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.760 
true-bypass sleeper true bypassing is
super<00:00:16.119> important<00:00:16.630> for<00:00:16.750> an<00:00:17.140> effects<00:00:17.439> board

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
super important for an effects board

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.410 
super important for an effects board
especially<00:00:18.519> if<00:00:18.609> you're<00:00:18.730> like<00:00:18.880> me<00:00:19.119> and<00:00:19.330> you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
especially if you're like me and you

especially if you're like me and you
have<00:00:19.449> between<00:00:19.990> 12<00:00:20.470> and<00:00:20.619> 15<00:00:20.800> effects<00:00:21.340> running

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
have between 12 and 15 effects running

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.160 
have between 12 and 15 effects running
on<00:00:21.849> your<00:00:21.970> effects<00:00:22.240> board<00:00:22.539> you<00:00:22.930> could<00:00:23.050> be

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
on your effects board you could be

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.529 
on your effects board you could be
adding<00:00:23.590> up<00:00:23.680> to<00:00:23.830> 50<00:00:24.190> and<00:00:24.369> 60<00:00:24.850> foot<00:00:25.119> of<00:00:25.330> cable

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
adding up to 50 and 60 foot of cable

length between your guitar and your

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.609 
length between your guitar and your
amplifier<00:00:27.970> so<00:00:28.570> when<00:00:28.750> I<00:00:28.780> go<00:00:29.020> out<00:00:29.140> and<00:00:29.289> spend<00:00:29.560> a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
amplifier so when I go out and spend a

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.109 
amplifier so when I go out and spend a
lot<00:00:29.800> of<00:00:29.920> money<00:00:30.070> on<00:00:30.220> an<00:00:30.310> amplifier<00:00:30.760> if<00:00:31.000> you're

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
lot of money on an amplifier if you're

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.580 
lot of money on an amplifier if you're
gonna<00:00:31.270> fill<00:00:31.570> up<00:00:31.750> your<00:00:31.779> board<00:00:32.110> with<00:00:32.289> ton<00:00:32.469> of

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
gonna fill up your board with ton of

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.500 
gonna fill up your board with ton of
effects<00:00:32.949> that<00:00:33.039> just<00:00:33.309> suck<00:00:33.550> your<00:00:33.730> volume<00:00:34.149> suck

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
effects that just suck your volume suck

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.959 
effects that just suck your volume suck
your<00:00:34.660> tone<00:00:34.899> and<00:00:35.199> your<00:00:35.340> high-end<00:00:36.340> Sparkle<00:00:36.850> from

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
your tone and your high-end Sparkle from

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.029 
your tone and your high-end Sparkle from
your<00:00:37.180> amp<00:00:37.329> having<00:00:38.289> a<00:00:38.379> pedal<00:00:38.710> like<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.890> true

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
your amp having a pedal like a true

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.099 
your amp having a pedal like a true
bypass<00:00:39.429> looper<00:00:39.879> can<00:00:40.300> fix<00:00:40.569> a<00:00:40.690> lot<00:00:40.870> of<00:00:40.929> your

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
bypass looper can fix a lot of your

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.049 
bypass looper can fix a lot of your
problems<00:00:41.559> this<00:00:41.949> allows<00:00:42.249> you<00:00:42.429> to<00:00:42.519> have<00:00:42.670> three

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
problems this allows you to have three

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.119 
problems this allows you to have three
different<00:00:43.269> loops<00:00:43.690> of<00:00:43.960> pedals<00:00:44.469> that<00:00:44.649> you<00:00:44.859> can

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
different loops of pedals that you can

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.610 
different loops of pedals that you can
turn<00:00:45.280> on<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.789> off<00:00:45.909> with<00:00:46.389> just<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.690> switch<00:00:46.989> so

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
turn on and off with just a switch so

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.049 
turn on and off with just a switch so
you<00:00:47.679> may<00:00:47.859> want<00:00:48.069> to<00:00:48.129> put<00:00:48.339> three<00:00:48.969> different

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
you may want to put three different

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.119 
you may want to put three different
pedals<00:00:49.479> on<00:00:49.659> here<00:00:49.870> or<00:00:50.019> three<00:00:50.260> different<00:00:50.469> loops

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
pedals on here or three different loops

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.309 
pedals on here or three different loops
of<00:00:51.339> pedals<00:00:51.670> meaning<00:00:52.030> that<00:00:52.149> you<00:00:52.329> have<00:00:52.510> four<00:00:53.139> or

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
of pedals meaning that you have four or

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.039 
of pedals meaning that you have four or
five<00:00:53.350> petals<00:00:53.949> on<00:00:54.100> each<00:00:54.579> different<00:00:55.149> loop<00:00:55.420> so

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
five petals on each different loop so

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.450 
five petals on each different loop so
let's<00:00:56.260> put<00:00:56.409> this<00:00:56.499> on<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:56.679> pedal<00:00:57.010> board<00:00:57.129> and<00:00:57.399> look

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
let's put this on a pedal board and look

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.219 
let's put this on a pedal board and look
at<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.699> many<00:00:57.879> ways<00:00:58.089> that<00:00:58.149> we<00:00:58.420> can<00:00:58.629> use<00:00:58.929> this

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.229 
at the many ways that we can use this

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:00.329 
at the many ways that we can use this
true<00:00:59.469> bypass<00:00:59.799> looper

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
true bypass looper

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.160 
true bypass looper
okay<00:01:01.089> so<00:01:01.149> we're<00:01:01.359> checking<00:01:01.569> out<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.899> nose

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
okay so we're checking out the nose

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.649 
okay so we're checking out the nose
little<00:01:02.739> true<00:01:03.069> bypass<00:01:03.429> looper<00:01:03.789> and<00:01:03.909> in<00:01:04.420> short

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
little true bypass looper and in short

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.510 
little true bypass looper and in short
true<00:01:05.019> bypass<00:01:05.379> basically<00:01:05.950> means<00:01:06.190> that<00:01:06.369> you're

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
true bypass basically means that you're

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.310 
true bypass basically means that you're
reducing<00:01:06.970> your<00:01:07.030> cable<00:01:07.479> length<00:01:07.659> and<00:01:07.930> you're

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
reducing your cable length and you're

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.469 
reducing your cable length and you're
taking<00:01:08.650> certain<00:01:08.950> effects<00:01:09.549> pedals<00:01:10.000> out<00:01:10.180> of

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
taking certain effects pedals out of

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.510 
taking certain effects pedals out of
your<00:01:10.690> effects<00:01:11.500> chain<00:01:11.770> altogether<00:01:12.340> when

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
your effects chain altogether when

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.310 
your effects chain altogether when
they're<00:01:12.640> not<00:01:12.760> being<00:01:12.940> used<00:01:13.300> this<00:01:13.750> increases

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
they're not being used this increases

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.560 
they're not being used this increases
your<00:01:14.350> amp<00:01:14.800> Sparkle<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.640> volume<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.360> tone

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
your amp Sparkle the volume and the tone

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.900 
your amp Sparkle the volume and the tone
overall<00:01:17.530> so<00:01:18.220> there's<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.460> lot<00:01:18.610> of<00:01:18.640> different

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
overall so there's a lot of different

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.370 
overall so there's a lot of different
ways<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.210> can<00:01:19.330> use<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.810> feature<00:01:20.050> of<00:01:20.170> true

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
ways you can use the feature of true

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.230 
ways you can use the feature of true
bypass<00:01:20.800> so<00:01:21.280> I've<00:01:21.340> set<00:01:21.550> up<00:01:21.580> three<00:01:21.940> different

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
bypass so I've set up three different

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.520 
bypass so I've set up three different
ways<00:01:22.390> with<00:01:22.690> this<00:01:22.810> pedal<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.230> I'm<00:01:23.320> going<00:01:23.440> to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
ways with this pedal and I'm going to

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.410 
ways with this pedal and I'm going to
show<00:01:23.620> you<00:01:23.650> how<00:01:23.770> each<00:01:24.010> way<00:01:24.190> is<00:01:24.250> important<00:01:24.760> so

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
show you how each way is important so

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.820 
show you how each way is important so
let's<00:01:25.600> check<00:01:25.750> out<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.110> first<00:01:26.320> loop<00:01:26.620> or<00:01:26.800> the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
let's check out the first loop or the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.580 
let's check out the first loop or the
first<00:01:27.040> channel<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.460> this<00:01:27.610> pedal<00:01:27.790> and<00:01:28.590> this

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
first channel of this pedal and this

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.410 
first channel of this pedal and this
little<00:01:29.830> looper<00:01:30.190> has<00:01:30.370> three<00:01:30.940> different<00:01:31.120> loops

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
little looper has three different loops

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.230 
little looper has three different loops
on<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.530> with<00:01:33.010> this<00:01:33.160> one<00:01:33.220> it's<00:01:33.730> cool<00:01:34.030> because

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
on it so with this one it's cool because

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.910 
on it so with this one it's cool because
it's<00:01:34.420> small<00:01:34.960> enough<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.260> you<00:01:35.410> can<00:01:35.500> just<00:01:35.770> buy

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
it's small enough that you can just buy

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.350 
it's small enough that you can just buy
two<00:01:35.980> of<00:01:36.190> these<00:01:36.310> or<00:01:36.640> you<00:01:36.880> know<00:01:37.000> get<00:01:37.210> two<00:01:37.330> of

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
two of these or you know get two of

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.940 
two of these or you know get two of
these<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.780> link<00:01:38.170> them<00:01:38.320> together<00:01:38.470> then<00:01:38.860> you

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
these and link them together then you

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.530 
these and link them together then you
have<00:01:39.070> six<00:01:39.400> or<00:01:39.640> get<00:01:39.820> three<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.240> link<00:01:40.390> those

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
have six or get three and link those

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.210 
have six or get three and link those
together<00:01:40.660> then<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:40.930> have<00:01:41.080> nine<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.010> can

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
together then you have nine so you can

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.670 
together then you have nine so you can
you<00:01:42.550> can<00:01:42.700> create<00:01:43.210> as<00:01:43.510> many<00:01:43.540> loops<00:01:44.080> as<00:01:44.230> you<00:01:44.380> as

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
you can create as many loops as you as

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.520 
you can create as many loops as you as
you<00:01:44.800> want<00:01:45.010> so<00:01:45.190> on<00:01:45.910> this<00:01:46.060> first<00:01:46.120> loop<00:01:46.750> I<00:01:47.050> have

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
you want so on this first loop I have

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.370 
you want so on this first loop I have
three<00:01:47.980> different<00:01:48.370> pedals<00:01:49.170> altogether<00:01:50.170> in<00:01:50.320> the

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
three different pedals altogether in the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.310 
three different pedals altogether in the
first<00:01:50.590> loop<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.970> my<00:01:52.030> far<00:01:52.420> right<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.780> have<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> BB

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
first loop on my far right I have a BB

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.410 
first loop on my far right I have a BB

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
pedal is a BB II sonic stomp which is an

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.969 
pedal is a BB II sonic stomp which is an
EQ<00:02:01.390> boost<00:02:01.510> you<00:02:01.720> can<00:02:01.840> adjust<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.290> process<00:02:02.560> and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
EQ boost you can adjust the process and

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.520 
EQ boost you can adjust the process and
the<00:02:03.040> lo<00:02:03.190> contour<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.900> third<00:02:05.080> pedal<00:02:05.290> in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
the lo contour and the third pedal in

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.029 
the lo contour and the third pedal in
the<00:02:05.620> loop<00:02:05.800> is<00:02:06.010> a<00:02:06.310> modded<00:02:06.820> love<00:02:07.030> pedal<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.619> all

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
the loop is a modded love pedal so all

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.089 
the loop is a modded love pedal so all
these<00:02:09.399> pedals<00:02:09.819> are<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.119> but<00:02:11.080> they<00:02:11.200> only<00:02:11.409> turn

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
these pedals are on but they only turn

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.640 
these pedals are on but they only turn
on<00:02:12.250> when<00:02:12.519> I<00:02:12.550> turn<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.390> true<00:02:13.989> bypass<00:02:14.290> sleeper

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
on when I turn the true bypass sleeper

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.250 
on when I turn the true bypass sleeper
channel<00:02:14.889> one<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:16.269> they're<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.569> now<00:02:16.840> but<00:02:17.170> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
channel one so they're on now but the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.699 
channel one so they're on now but the
true<00:02:17.379> bypass<00:02:17.709> channel<00:02:17.769> is<00:02:18.099> off

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
true bypass channel is off

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:33.870 
true bypass channel is off
Felicity<00:02:20.709> are<00:02:20.770> all<00:02:20.950> three<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:21.250> together

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.550 

then<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.030> asked<00:02:35.330> why<00:02:35.540> would<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:35.960> three

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
then you asked why would I have three

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.740 
then you asked why would I have three
different<00:02:36.710> pedals<00:02:37.190> on<00:02:37.460> one<00:02:37.700> loop<00:02:37.910> well<00:02:38.570> let's

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
different pedals on one loop well let's

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.770 
different pedals on one loop well let's
say<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:38.960> wanted<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.500> create<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.040> specific

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
say I wanted to create a specific

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.440 
say I wanted to create a specific
overdrive<00:02:41.780> or<00:02:42.140> lead<00:02:42.590> tone<00:02:42.890> well<00:02:43.730> here<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.120> have

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
overdrive or lead tone well here I have

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.520 
overdrive or lead tone well here I have
a<00:02:44.650> line<00:02:45.650> boost<00:02:45.980> also<00:02:46.550> have<00:02:47.000> an<00:02:47.240> EQ<00:02:47.660> boost<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.140> I

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
a line boost also have an EQ boost and I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.890 
a line boost also have an EQ boost and I
have<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:49.070> overdrive<00:02:49.580> tone<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.090> want<00:02:50.390> so

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
have the overdrive tone that I want so

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.690 
have the overdrive tone that I want so
I'm<00:02:50.990> basically<00:02:51.140> creating<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.130> unique

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
I'm basically creating a unique

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.510 
I'm basically creating a unique
overdrive<00:02:53.390> sound<00:02:53.690> which<00:02:54.320> is<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.920> little<00:02:55.400> bit

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
overdrive sound which is a little bit

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.820 
overdrive sound which is a little bit
base<00:02:55.760> here<00:02:56.210> it<00:02:56.450> provides<00:02:57.020> me<00:02:57.350> with<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.530> little

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
base here it provides me with a little

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.860 
base here it provides me with a little
boost<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.850> has<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.060> very<00:02:59.360> very<00:02:59.660> good

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
boost and it has a very very good

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:09.920 
boost and it has a very very good
overdrive<00:03:00.500> feature<00:03:00.740> with<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> love<00:03:01.340> pedal

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.630 

now<00:03:10.930> that's<00:03:11.170> how<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:11.380> use<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.830> I<00:03:11.890> use<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.100> for<00:03:12.400> a

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
now that's how I use it I use it for a

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.850 
now that's how I use it I use it for a
unique<00:03:13.120> sounding<00:03:13.480> overdrive<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.440> can<00:03:14.620> add

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
unique sounding overdrive you can add

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.710 
unique sounding overdrive you can add
multiple<00:03:15.250> trim<00:03:15.760> lows<00:03:15.970> or<00:03:16.300> multiple

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
multiple trim lows or multiple

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.140 
multiple trim lows or multiple
OverDrive's<00:03:17.560> or<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.220> can<00:03:18.370> use<00:03:18.520> this<00:03:18.670> looper

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
OverDrive's or you can use this looper

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.970 
OverDrive's or you can use this looper
however<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.660> want<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.380> that's<00:03:20.620> how<00:03:20.740> I<00:03:20.770> have

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
however you want so that's how I have

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.070 
however you want so that's how I have
these<00:03:21.280> three<00:03:21.520> setup<00:03:21.819> now<00:03:22.000> alright<00:03:22.780> let's<00:03:22.959> take

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
these three setup now alright let's take

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.050 
these three setup now alright let's take
a<00:03:23.140> look<00:03:23.440> at<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.860> second<00:03:24.580> channel<00:03:24.880> or<00:03:25.030> the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
a look at the second channel or the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.290 
a look at the second channel or the
second<00:03:25.510> loop<00:03:25.690> on<00:03:26.200> my<00:03:26.620> little<00:03:26.830> looper<00:03:27.300> the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
second loop on my little looper the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.470 
second loop on my little looper the
second<00:03:28.660> channel<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.020> have<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.500> Line<00:03:29.739> six<00:03:30.010> m9<00:03:30.580> now

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
second channel I have a Line six m9 now

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.260 
second channel I have a Line six m9 now
the<00:03:31.540> m9<00:03:31.989> is<00:03:32.350> special<00:03:33.100> because<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.520> has<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:34.030> lot

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
the m9 is special because it has a lot

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.449 
bypass or not well I have the m9 set
where<00:03:42.970> true<00:03:43.300> bypass<00:03:43.660> is<00:03:43.870> not<00:03:44.110> on<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:45.010> I've

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
where true bypass is not on so I've

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.370 
where true bypass is not on so I've
hooked<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.940> up<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.209> this<00:03:46.360> pedal<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.200> can

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
hooked it up to this pedal so I can

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.680 
hooked it up to this pedal so I can
manually<00:03:47.830> control<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.550> true<00:03:48.970> bypass<00:03:49.360> and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
manually control the true bypass and

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.020 
manually control the true bypass and
that's<00:03:50.620> important<00:03:51.070> because<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.430> m9<00:03:51.820> has<00:03:52.000> a

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
that's important because this m9 has a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.300 
that's important because this m9 has a
lot<00:03:52.300> electronics<00:03:52.959> has<00:03:53.110> lots<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.769> wiring<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.220> a

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
lot electronics has lots of wiring and a

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.250 
lot electronics has lots of wiring and a
big<00:03:54.459> circuit<00:03:54.850> board<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:55.239> if<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.870> want<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.080> take

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
big circuit board so if you want to take

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.960 
big circuit board so if you want to take
the<00:03:56.410> m9<00:03:56.769> out<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.190> your<00:03:57.280> signal<00:03:57.670> all<00:03:57.760> together

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
the m9 out of your signal all together

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.120 
the m9 out of your signal all together
just<00:03:58.930> turn<00:03:59.140> it<00:03:59.260> off<00:03:59.319> with<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.590> little<00:03:59.860> looper

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
just turn it off with a little looper

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.170 
just turn it off with a little looper
and<00:04:00.220> then<00:04:00.700> when<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:00.940> play<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.269> guitar<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.790> m9

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
and then when you play the guitar the m9

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.470 
and then when you play the guitar the m9
is<00:04:04.420> like<00:04:04.600> it's<00:04:04.750> not<00:04:04.870> even<00:04:05.019> there<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:07.300> you're

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
is like it's not even there so you're

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.240 
is like it's not even there so you're
losing<00:04:07.630> no<00:04:07.900> tone<00:04:08.170> you're<00:04:08.410> losing<00:04:08.709> no<00:04:08.830> volume

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
losing no tone you're losing no volume

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.390 
losing no tone you're losing no volume
and<00:04:09.700> you're<00:04:09.790> losing<00:04:10.290> nothing<00:04:11.290> from<00:04:11.769> having

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
and you're losing nothing from having

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.479 
and you're losing nothing from having
the<00:04:12.489> m9<00:04:12.790> on<00:04:12.940> your<00:04:13.030> board<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:15.010> when<00:04:15.130> you<00:04:15.220> turn<00:04:15.370> it

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
the m9 on your board so when you turn it

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:30.320 
the m9 on your board so when you turn it
on<00:04:15.640> then<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.060> effects<00:04:16.359> come<00:04:16.600> on

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.150 

maybe<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.080> want<00:04:31.289> to<00:04:31.349> have<00:04:31.440> some<00:04:31.620> overdraft<00:04:32.069> of

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
maybe I want to have some overdraft of

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:42.850 
maybe I want to have some overdraft of
that

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.740 

I've<00:04:43.860> also<00:04:44.070> thought<00:04:44.370> about<00:04:44.430> adding<00:04:44.880> my<00:04:45.180> DL<00:04:45.480> for

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
I've also thought about adding my DL for

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.410 
I've also thought about adding my DL for
my<00:04:46.260> Line<00:04:46.470> six<00:04:46.800> pedal<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.670> the<00:04:47.700> looper<00:04:48.060> as<00:04:48.150> well

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
my Line six pedal to the looper as well

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.050 
my Line six pedal to the looper as well
having<00:04:49.410> kind<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.890> same<00:04:50.130> effect<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.940> whole

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
having kind of the same effect the whole

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.850 
having kind of the same effect the whole
this<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.390> big<00:04:51.660> pedal<00:04:52.050> there's<00:04:52.290> lots<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:52.590> wiring

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
this a big pedal there's lots of wiring

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.860 
this a big pedal there's lots of wiring
and<00:04:53.160> sometimes<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.090> don't<00:04:54.150> want<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.510> in<00:04:54.660> my

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
and sometimes I don't want it in my

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.320 
and sometimes I don't want it in my
effects<00:04:55.770> chain<00:04:56.070> at<00:04:56.190> all<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.790> if<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.060> hook<00:04:57.240> it

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
effects chain at all so if you hook it

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.390 
effects chain at all so if you hook it
up<00:04:57.480> through<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:58.170> little<00:04:58.470> looper<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:59.010> takes<00:04:59.280> it

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
up through the little looper it takes it

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.670 
up through the little looper it takes it
out<00:04:59.520> completely<00:04:59.810> so<00:05:00.810> that's<00:05:01.170> another<00:05:01.410> way<00:05:01.590> is

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
out completely so that's another way is

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.680 
out completely so that's another way is
you<00:05:01.800> can<00:05:01.860> have<00:05:01.980> the<00:05:02.070> Liebherr<00:05:02.390> alright<00:05:03.390> for

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
you can have the Liebherr alright for

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.780 
you can have the Liebherr alright for
the<00:05:03.810> final<00:05:04.170> demonstration<00:05:04.890> on<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.310> third

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
the final demonstration on the third

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.620 
the final demonstration on the third
loop<00:05:06.060> or<00:05:06.390> the<00:05:06.420> third<00:05:06.750> Channel<00:05:07.140> I<00:05:07.880> have<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:09.120> boss

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
loop or the third Channel I have a boss

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.140 
loop or the third Channel I have a boss
ce-2<00:05:10.530> chorus<00:05:11.250> now<00:05:11.850> if<00:05:11.910> you<00:05:12.000> know<00:05:12.120> anything

ce-2 chorus now if you know anything
about<00:05:12.600> this<00:05:12.960> course<00:05:13.290> as<00:05:13.470> a<00:05:13.500> vintage<00:05:13.860> course<00:05:14.160> is

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
about this course as a vintage course is

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.220 
about this course as a vintage course is
really<00:05:14.940> old<00:05:15.090> this<00:05:15.300> one's<00:05:15.510> about<00:05:15.600> thirty<00:05:15.990> years

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
really old this one's about thirty years

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.760 
really old this one's about thirty years
old<00:05:16.350> older<00:05:16.860> than<00:05:17.010> I<00:05:17.160> am<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.990> this<00:05:18.990> this<00:05:19.470> course

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
old older than I am and this this course

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.570 
old older than I am and this this course
is<00:05:19.920> special<00:05:20.280> because<00:05:20.580> it's<00:05:20.850> not<00:05:21.030> true<00:05:21.210> bypass

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
is special because it's not true bypass

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.950 
is special because it's not true bypass
so<00:05:23.580> this<00:05:23.760> is<00:05:23.910> a<00:05:23.940> pedal<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.270> half<00:05:24.480> of<00:05:24.600> my<00:05:24.720> board

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
so this is a pedal that half of my board

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.470 
so this is a pedal that half of my board
that<00:05:25.110> is<00:05:25.230> naturally<00:05:25.770> not<00:05:26.280> true<00:05:26.490> bypassed<00:05:26.940> so

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
that is naturally not true bypassed so

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.780 
that is naturally not true bypassed so
I'm<00:05:27.780> making<00:05:28.050> this<00:05:28.410> pedal<00:05:28.860> true<00:05:29.040> bypass<00:05:29.430> by

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
I'm making this pedal true bypass by

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.480 
I'm making this pedal true bypass by
leaving<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.300> on<00:05:30.390> and<00:05:30.770> only<00:05:31.770> turning<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.220> pedal

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
leaving it on and only turning the pedal

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.840 
leaving it on and only turning the pedal
on<00:05:32.670> when<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.000> hit<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.360> looper<00:05:34.370> so<00:05:35.370> it's<00:05:35.610> off<00:05:35.820> now

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
on when I hit the looper so it's off now

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.390 
on when I hit the looper so it's off now
and<00:05:36.360> when<00:05:36.540> the<00:05:36.630> light<00:05:36.780> comes<00:05:36.960> on<00:05:37.170> the<00:05:38.010> pedal<00:05:38.310> is

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
and when the light comes on the pedal is

00:05:38.400 --> 00:06:06.880 
and when the light comes on the pedal is
on

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.530 

so<00:06:07.890> the<00:06:08.100> pedal<00:06:08.520> that<00:06:08.670> is<00:06:08.760> not<00:06:08.910> naturally<00:06:09.360> true

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
so the pedal that is not naturally true

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.210 
so the pedal that is not naturally true
bypassed<00:06:10.020> it<00:06:10.290> can<00:06:10.410> kind<00:06:10.590> of<00:06:10.650> suck<00:06:10.890> your<00:06:11.040> tongue

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
bypassed it can kind of suck your tongue

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.850 
bypassed it can kind of suck your tongue
whether<00:06:11.820> it's<00:06:12.060> on<00:06:12.240> or<00:06:12.480> off<00:06:12.630> on<00:06:12.840> your<00:06:12.990> board<00:06:13.230> so

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
whether it's on or off on your board so

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.860 
whether it's on or off on your board so
I<00:06:13.890> don't<00:06:14.400> want<00:06:14.550> this<00:06:14.670> pedal<00:06:15.060> on<00:06:15.210> on<00:06:15.540> my<00:06:15.660> board

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
I don't want this pedal on on my board

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.140 
I don't want this pedal on on my board
at<00:06:16.020> all<00:06:16.170> unless<00:06:16.530> I<00:06:17.010> can<00:06:17.250> turn<00:06:17.490> you<00:06:17.520> turn<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:18.090> on

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
at all unless I can turn you turn it on

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.680 
at all unless I can turn you turn it on
manually<00:06:18.780> with<00:06:19.590> a<00:06:19.620> little<00:06:19.980> looper<00:06:20.450> so<00:06:21.450> I<00:06:21.480> can

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
manually with a little looper so I can

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.510 
manually with a little looper so I can
basically<00:06:21.900> take<00:06:22.410> pedals<00:06:22.860> that<00:06:23.040> are<00:06:23.130> not<00:06:23.280> true

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
basically take pedals that are not true

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.090 
basically take pedals that are not true
bypassed<00:06:24.000> and<00:06:24.240> make<00:06:24.870> them<00:06:25.140> bypassed<00:06:25.680> with

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
bypassed and make them bypassed with

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.830 
bypassed and make them bypassed with
this<00:06:26.250> pedal<00:06:26.610> so<00:06:27.060> this<00:06:27.210> is<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.390> only<00:06:27.480> pedal<00:06:27.780> I

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
this pedal so this is the only pedal I

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.270 
this pedal so this is the only pedal I
really<00:06:28.080> have<00:06:28.260> that<00:06:28.440> need<00:06:28.590> to<00:06:28.710> do<00:06:28.830> that<00:06:28.980> with<00:06:29.130> on

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
really have that need to do that with on

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.430 
really have that need to do that with on
this<00:06:29.430> board<00:06:29.730> but<00:06:30.270> if<00:06:30.390> I<00:06:30.480> had<00:06:30.660> two<00:06:31.290> or<00:06:31.410> three

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
this board but if I had two or three

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.290 
this board but if I had two or three
pedals<00:06:31.950> I<00:06:32.130> might<00:06:32.340> have<00:06:32.550> two<00:06:32.820> of<00:06:32.940> these<00:06:33.030> little

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
pedals I might have two of these little

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.270 
pedals I might have two of these little
loopers<00:06:33.660> and<00:06:33.690> I<00:06:33.840> might<00:06:34.050> assign<00:06:34.530> every<00:06:34.980> single

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
loopers and I might assign every single

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
loopers and I might assign every single
one<00:06:35.400> of<00:06:35.430> the<00:06:35.520> pedals<00:06:35.820> that's<00:06:36.000> not<00:06:36.150> true

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
one of the pedals that's not true

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.120 
one of the pedals that's not true
bypassed<00:06:36.720> so<00:06:37.170> one<00:06:37.320> of<00:06:37.350> these<00:06:37.500> channels<00:06:37.920> on<00:06:38.040> the

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
bypassed so one of these channels on the

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.310 
bypassed so one of these channels on the
looper<00:06:38.460> so<00:06:38.670> that<00:06:38.820> I<00:06:38.850> create<00:06:39.300> the<00:06:39.450> pedal<00:06:39.780> making

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
looper so that I create the pedal making

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.350 
looper so that I create the pedal making
it<00:06:40.470> true<00:06:40.650> bypassed<00:06:41.130> so<00:06:41.880> here's<00:06:42.090> three

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
it true bypassed so here's three

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.760 
it true bypassed so here's three
examples<00:06:42.390> and<00:06:42.990> you<00:06:43.050> can<00:06:43.170> turn<00:06:43.290> all<00:06:43.560> of<00:06:43.590> these

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
examples and you can turn all of these

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.230 
examples and you can turn all of these
on<00:06:43.950> if<00:06:44.070> you<00:06:44.160> want<00:06:44.370> to<00:06:44.520> so<00:06:44.850> you<00:06:44.940> can<00:06:45.030> turn<00:06:45.120> the

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
on if you want to so you can turn the

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:58.580 
on if you want to so you can turn the
course<00:06:45.480> on<00:06:47.900> let's<00:06:48.900> turn<00:06:49.080> the<00:06:49.170> m9<00:06:49.500> on<00:06:57.380> in<00:06:58.380> my

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
course on let's turn the m9 on in my

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:06.440 
course on let's turn the m9 on in my
custom<00:06:59.040> overdrive

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.930 

so<00:07:07.410> that's<00:07:07.590> how<00:07:07.710> your<00:07:07.920> guitar<00:07:08.220> with<00:07:08.370> sound<00:07:08.640> if

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
so that's how your guitar with sound if

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.160 
so that's how your guitar with sound if
you<00:07:09.060> didn't<00:07:09.360> have<00:07:09.450> the<00:07:09.600> little<00:07:09.840> looper<00:07:10.140> and

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.170 
you didn't have the little looper and

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.290 
you didn't have the little looper and
all<00:07:10.410> your<00:07:10.590> fix<00:07:10.860> or<00:07:11.010> just<00:07:11.220> on<00:07:11.340> so<00:07:12.060> then<00:07:12.180> you

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
all your fix or just on so then you

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.870 
all your fix or just on so then you
could<00:07:12.390> turn<00:07:12.570> them<00:07:12.750> off<00:07:12.840> and<00:07:13.670> use<00:07:14.670> any

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 
could turn them off and use any

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.820 
could turn them off and use any
combination<00:07:15.120> that<00:07:15.660> you<00:07:15.780> want<00:07:15.960> so<00:07:16.530> there's<00:07:16.740> a

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
combination that you want so there's a

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.230 
combination that you want so there's a
lot<00:07:17.040> of<00:07:17.070> possibilities<00:07:17.760> that<00:07:17.790> you<00:07:17.940> can<00:07:18.150> do

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
lot of possibilities that you can do

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.550 
lot of possibilities that you can do
with<00:07:18.360> your<00:07:18.420> pedal<00:07:18.720> board<00:07:18.870> by<00:07:19.050> having<00:07:19.410> this

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
with your pedal board by having this

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.400 
with your pedal board by having this
nose<00:07:20.220> little<00:07:20.580> looper<00:07:20.940> pedal<00:07:21.080> it's<00:07:22.080> a<00:07:22.170> great

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
nose little looper pedal it's a great

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.710 
nose little looper pedal it's a great
little<00:07:22.590> pedal<00:07:23.040> it<00:07:23.430> can<00:07:23.640> it<00:07:23.880> can<00:07:23.910> increase<00:07:24.600> your

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 
little pedal it can it can increase your

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.900 
little pedal it can it can increase your
tone<00:07:24.960> with<00:07:25.170> a<00:07:25.230> guitar<00:07:25.350> you<00:07:26.220> can<00:07:26.340> do<00:07:26.430> all<00:07:26.610> kinds

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:26.910 
tone with a guitar you can do all kinds

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.060 
tone with a guitar you can do all kinds
of<00:07:26.970> cool<00:07:27.150> things<00:07:27.450> and<00:07:27.720> this<00:07:28.500> is<00:07:28.560> a<00:07:28.680> must-have

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.070 
of cool things and this is a must-have

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.950 
of cool things and this is a must-have
on<00:07:29.550> a<00:07:29.580> pedal<00:07:29.910> board<00:07:30.090> so<00:07:30.420> I'll<00:07:30.510> see<00:07:30.690> in<00:07:30.780> the<00:07:30.840> next

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
on a pedal board so I'll see in the next

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:39.270 
on a pedal board so I'll see in the next
video

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280
