00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.980 
this red four onto this red five and
then<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:43.950> move<00:02:44.070> this<00:02:44.340> red<00:02:44.730> three<00:02:45.180> onto<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
then I can move this red three onto the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.850 
then I can move this red three onto the
red<00:02:46.170> for<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.720> way<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.110> suit<00:02:49.350> comes<00:02:49.620> into

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
red for the way that suit comes into

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
red for the way that suit comes into
play<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.780> these<00:02:51.780> are<00:02:51.960> diamonds<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.880> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
play is that these are diamonds and the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.910 
play is that these are diamonds and the
five<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.360> heart<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.440> if<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.560> had<00:02:55.770> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
five is a heart so if I had the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.570 
five is a heart so if I had the
opportunity<00:02:56.160> later<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.480> move<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:59.040> sequence

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
opportunity later to move this sequence

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.980 
opportunity later to move this sequence
on<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.750> another<00:03:01.170> card<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:02.030> can<00:03:03.030> only<00:03:03.240> move<00:03:03.570> the

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
on to another card I can only move the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.800 
on to another card I can only move the
suited<00:03:04.740> cards<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.580> 4<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.360> 3

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
suited cards the 4 and the 3

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.900 
suited cards the 4 and the 3
I<00:03:06.840> cannot<00:03:07.680> bring<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.070> 5<00:03:08.310> with<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.700> because

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
I cannot bring the 5 with it because

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.420 
I cannot bring the 5 with it because
it's<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.420> heart<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.530> other<00:03:10.560> two<00:03:10.890> cards<00:03:11.130> are

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
it's a heart and the other two cards are

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.020 
it's a heart and the other two cards are
diamonds

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
diamonds

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.200 
diamonds
that's<00:03:12.900> where<00:03:13.380> suit<00:03:13.800> comes<00:03:14.580> into<00:03:14.790> play<00:03:14.970> with

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
that's where suit comes into play with

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.620 
that's where suit comes into play with
spider<00:03:15.540> rules<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.200> spider<00:03:16.980> at<00:03:17.250> uses<00:03:18.209> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
spider rules and spider at uses the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.860 
spider rules and spider at uses the
spider<00:03:18.959> rules<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.010> klondike<00:03:20.459> board

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
spider rules with the klondike board

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.940 
spider rules with the klondike board
okay<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:23.120> we've<00:03:24.120> got<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.930> eight<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.709> came

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
okay so we've got this eight that came

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.510 
okay so we've got this eight that came
up<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:26.820> move<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.090> seven<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.900> it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
up I can move this seven on to it

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.440 
up I can move this seven on to it
and<00:03:29.520> now<00:03:30.060> here's<00:03:30.570> an<00:03:30.720> ace<00:03:31.880> but<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:32.940> can't<00:03:33.240> move

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
and now here's an ace but I can't move

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.470 
and now here's an ace but I can't move
the<00:03:33.720> ACE<00:03:33.870> up<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.410> one<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.770> four

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
the ACE up to one of the four

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.590 
the ACE up to one of the four
foundations

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
foundations

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.110 
foundations
you<00:03:37.050> know<00:03:37.200> like<00:03:37.440> in<00:03:37.620> Klondike<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.130> have<00:03:38.340> four

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
you know like in Klondike you have four

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.610 
you know like in Klondike you have four
foundations<00:03:39.720> where<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.959> can<00:03:40.110> place<00:03:40.290> an<00:03:40.470> ace

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
foundations where you can place an ace

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.520 
foundations where you can place an ace
one<00:03:41.310> two<00:03:41.670> three<00:03:42.180> four<00:03:42.630> but<00:03:43.610> this<00:03:44.610> is<00:03:45.530> spider

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
one two three four but this is spider

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.090 
one two three four but this is spider
rules<00:03:46.920> so<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:48.150> can't<00:03:48.870> move<00:03:49.080> this<00:03:49.260> up<00:03:49.500> until<00:03:49.830> I

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
rules so I can't move this up until I

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.670 
rules so I can't move this up until I
have<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> full<00:03:50.760> sequence<00:03:51.330> from<00:03:51.930> king<00:03:52.230> queen

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
have a full sequence from king queen

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.750 
have a full sequence from king queen
Jack<00:03:53.250> on<00:03:53.550> down<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.300> ace<00:03:55.040> so<00:03:56.040> let's<00:03:56.490> look<00:03:56.610> around

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
Jack on down to ace so let's look around

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.270 
Jack on down to ace so let's look around
do<00:03:57.450> we<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:57.690> any<00:03:57.840> more<00:03:57.959> plays<00:03:58.260> at<00:03:58.860> this<00:03:59.070> time

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
do we have any more plays at this time

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.260 
do we have any more plays at this time
we<00:03:59.430> do<00:03:59.550> not<00:04:00.320> another<00:04:01.320> difference<00:04:01.830> is<00:04:02.270> that

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
we do not another difference is that

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:13.910 
we do not another difference is that
instead<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:07.100> moving<00:04:08.120> playing<00:04:10.459> like<00:04:11.459> this<00:04:12.920> you

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
instead of moving playing like this you

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.979 
instead of moving playing like this you
can<00:04:14.070> play<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.310> like<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:15.000> would<00:04:15.720> be<00:04:15.780> more

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
can play it like this that would be more

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.030 
can play it like this that would be more
Klondike<00:04:16.500> than<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.770> would<00:04:16.890> be<00:04:16.919> spider<00:04:17.280> or<00:04:19.040> if

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
Klondike than it would be spider or if

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.450 
Klondike than it would be spider or if
you<00:04:20.250> want<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.520> play<00:04:20.730> true<00:04:21.330> spider<00:04:21.630> rules<00:04:22.460> you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
you want to play true spider rules you

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.580 
you want to play true spider rules you
go<00:04:23.580> like<00:04:23.760> this

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
go like this

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.409 
go like this
and<00:04:25.370> now<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:25.669> have<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.180> figure<00:04:26.360> out<00:04:28.419> what

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
and now you have to figure out what

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.610 
and now you have to figure out what
moves<00:04:29.690> where<00:04:29.960> well<00:04:30.880> this<00:04:31.880> Queen<00:04:32.320> can<00:04:33.320> go<00:04:33.470> on

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
moves where well this Queen can go on

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:41.200 
moves where well this Queen can go on
this<00:04:33.740> King<00:04:34.040> got<00:04:36.100> no<00:04:37.100> play<00:04:37.340> for<00:04:37.820> this<00:04:37.940> ten<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:40.210> can

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
this King got no play for this ten I can

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.590 
this King got no play for this ten I can
move<00:04:41.300> this<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.620> over<00:04:42.620> on<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:42.919> this<00:04:43.070> three<00:04:43.460> if<00:04:44.389> I

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
move this to over on to this three if I

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.409 
move this to over on to this three if I
want<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:45.400> if<00:04:46.400> I<00:04:46.520> want<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:46.790> be<00:04:46.850> able<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.120> somehow

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
want to if I want to be able to somehow

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.080 
want to if I want to be able to somehow
use<00:04:48.260> this<00:04:48.620> for<00:04:48.860> in<00:04:48.980> this<00:04:49.130> three<00:04:49.430> instead<00:04:50.030> of

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
use this for in this three instead of

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.200 
use this for in this three instead of
this<00:04:50.270> four<00:04:50.510> in<00:04:50.630> this<00:04:50.750> three<00:04:50.990> and<00:04:51.940> let's<00:04:52.940> see

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
this four in this three and let's see

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.570 
this four in this three and let's see
this<00:04:54.050> six<00:04:54.790> moves<00:04:55.790> here<00:04:56.800> I've<00:04:57.800> exhausted<00:04:58.220> all

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
this six moves here I've exhausted all

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.300 
this six moves here I've exhausted all
my<00:04:58.729> moves<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.860> now<00:05:01.070> I<00:05:01.400> have<00:05:01.729> to<00:05:01.880> deal<00:05:02.060> out<00:05:03.310> seven

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
my moves so now I have to deal out seven

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.520 
my moves so now I have to deal out seven
more<00:05:04.460> cards<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.610> there<00:05:07.760> you<00:05:07.880> go<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:09.020> only<00:05:09.380> way

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
more cards and there you go the only way

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.990 
more cards and there you go the only way
that<00:05:09.560> I<00:05:09.919> can<00:05:10.130> move<00:05:10.220> anything<00:05:10.729> to<00:05:10.910> the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
that I can move anything to the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.620 
that I can move anything to the
foundation<00:05:11.600> is<00:05:12.100> if<00:05:13.100> on<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.550> tableau<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.240> get

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
foundation is if on the tableau I get

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.200 
foundation is if on the tableau I get
