rancid
so<00:02:13.760> here<00:02:13.970> we<00:02:14.090> go<00:02:14.120> these<00:02:14.690> are<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.989> two<00:02:15.140> screens

channel lately and I could do with a
fresh<00:04:50.900> start<00:04:51.229> I<00:04:51.470> mean<00:04:52.659> the<00:04:53.659> channel<00:04:54.020> has<00:04:54.050> been

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
fresh start I mean the channel has been

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.820 
fresh start I mean the channel has been
up<00:04:54.379> three<00:04:54.740> years<00:04:55.419> it<00:04:56.419> was<00:04:56.629> mainly<00:04:56.900> made<00:04:57.259> to<00:04:57.650> be

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
up three years it was mainly made to be

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.219 
up three years it was mainly made to be
a<00:04:58.099> view<00:04:58.610> in<00:04:58.759> channel<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.719> view<00:04:59.750> gameplays<00:05:02.229> but

a view in channel to view gameplays but
I<00:05:03.530> decided<00:05:04.069> I've<00:05:04.789> decided<00:05:05.210> it<00:05:05.539> might<00:05:05.690> be<00:05:05.900> time

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.890 
I decided I've decided it might be time
to<00:05:06.469> make<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.430> new<00:05:07.639> channel<00:05:07.940> try<00:05:08.569> and<00:05:08.690> give<00:05:08.810> it

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629 
section if you think it'd be a good idea

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:22.659 
section if you think it'd be a good idea
to<00:05:20.990> start<00:05:21.379> a<00:05:21.500> new<00:05:21.650> channel<00:05:21.889> because<00:05:22.250> I'm<00:05:22.430> not

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
to start a new channel because I'm not

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.589 
to start a new channel because I'm not
one<00:05:22.969> hundred<00:05:23.060> percent<00:05:23.300> sure<00:05:25.270> I'd<00:05:26.270> lose<00:05:26.539> a

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
one hundred percent sure I'd lose a

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.360 
one hundred percent sure I'd lose a
couple<00:05:26.870> of<00:05:27.110> subscribers<00:05:27.800> of<00:05:27.919> course<00:05:28.159> I'll

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
couple of subscribers of course I'll

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.730 
couple of subscribers of course I'll
probably<00:05:28.550> lose<00:05:29.180> over<00:05:29.659> half<00:05:29.840> my<00:05:29.870> subscriber

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
probably lose over half my subscriber

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.540 
probably lose over half my subscriber
base<00:05:31.210> but<00:05:32.210> it'd<00:05:32.539> be<00:05:32.659> good<00:05:32.960> just<00:05:33.289> to<00:05:33.590> freshen

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
base but it'd be good just to freshen

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.450 
base but it'd be good just to freshen
things<00:05:34.940> up<00:05:35.180> i<00:05:35.330> guess<00:05:35.539> i<00:05:35.810> don't<00:05:36.770> want<00:05:36.949> inactive

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
things up i guess i don't want inactive

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
subs on my channel so maybe it'd be

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.899
