something<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.320> didn't<00:01:07.619> know<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.189> oh<00:01:08.549> well<00:01:09.479> um

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
something we didn't know so oh well um

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.820 
something we didn't know so oh well um
but<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> would<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.420> capped<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.140> probably<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
but I would have capped it probably a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.120 
but I would have capped it probably a
long<00:01:13.979> time<00:01:14.250> ago<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:16.500> testing

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
long time ago I was just I was testing

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.719 
long time ago I was just I was testing
out<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.369> g11<00:01:19.009> kind<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
out this g11 kind of like it it's I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.570 
out this g11 kind of like it it's I
would<00:01:21.030> say<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> ACOG<00:01:22.830> kind<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
would say it's like the ACOG kind of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.640 
would say it's like the ACOG kind of
like<00:01:23.670> an<00:01:23.790> acog<00:01:24.090> scope<00:01:24.119> because<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.380> scope

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
like an acog scope because if you scope

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.140 
like an acog scope because if you scope
it<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.130> more<00:01:26.250> than<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.520> couple<00:01:26.640> seconds

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it in for more than a couple seconds

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
it in for more than a couple seconds
that<00:01:27.689> starts<00:01:27.720> waving<00:01:28.409> all<00:01:28.710> around<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> shit

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that starts waving all around and shit

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
that starts waving all around and shit
and<00:01:29.490> you'll<00:01:29.729> see<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.509> hard<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:30.900> me<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> get<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and you'll see it's hard for me to get a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.080 
and you'll see it's hard for me to get a
shot<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.470> people<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.159> thing<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:33.000> like

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
shot on people with this thing it's like

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.140 
shot on people with this thing it's like
I'm<00:01:33.210> Saul<00:01:33.420> over<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> place<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I'm Saul over the place but it's but the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.190 
I'm Saul over the place but it's but the
thing<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:36.570> change<00:01:36.869> from<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.170> original

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
thing that they change from the original

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
thing that they change from the original
game<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.189> they<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.759> give<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.150> iron

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
game was that they do give you iron

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.649 
game was that they do give you iron
sights<00:01:40.549> and<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> big<00:01:42.090> enough<00:01:42.240> TV

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
sights and if you have a big enough TV

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.710 
sights and if you have a big enough TV
and<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.799> makes<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.850> different

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and then it makes all that different

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.069 
and then it makes all that different
that<00:01:45.960> much<00:01:46.170> difference<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:48.479> always<00:01:48.780> good<00:01:49.049> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that much difference it's always good to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.270 
that much difference it's always good to
your<00:01:50.119> different<00:01:51.119> weapons<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.890> really

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
your different weapons but I really

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.249 
your different weapons but I really
wanted<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.640> try<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.930> kind<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> like

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
wanted to try this out it's kind of like

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.499 
wanted to try this out it's kind of like
a<00:01:55.320> better<00:01:55.590> version<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.250> m16<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.210> it's

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
a better version of the m16 it's it's

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.300 
a better version of the m16 it's it's
like<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.960> m16<00:01:58.560> from<00:01:58.770> call<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:58.979> duty<00:01:59.280> 4

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
like the m16 from call of duty 4

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.620 
like the m16 from call of duty 4
basically<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.299> what<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:03.270> only<00:02:03.450> thing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
basically is what it is the only thing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.540 
basically is what it is the only thing
