00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 good morning mobile formula mates 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.130
 let's see how I did to install 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.570
 the module first we enter the page 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.059
 official let's go to the download section 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.500
 we look for windows downloads and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.660
 we choose the package that we are 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.410
 working that in this case is 2.7 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.410
 point 1 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.530
 redirects us to a page where the 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.060
 After a few seconds, the 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.699
 discharge 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.430
 this download is 112 megabytes going to 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.140
 take between ten minutes and a half hour 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.140
 according to our connection speed 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.940
 when downloading 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.649
 we open our download folder 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.059
 create a folder that we will 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.289
 place the contents of that file if 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.289
 the one that we just downloaded 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.420
 and then decompress 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.820
 the content of our file if in 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.920
 that new folder 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.720
 all these processes take much longer 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.630
 only that the video is running very 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.300
 fast and some were made some 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.840
 cuts for this video to come out a lot 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.840
 faster 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.210
 when unzipping 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.700
 we can do a verification to see if 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.680
 we have all the content that 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.980
 we should have 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.360
 for that we come back we ask 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.900
 properties 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.120
 we see that there are 14 thousand 401 files between 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.880
 340 and 360 megs 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.500
 to start we give star model in 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.480
 my case I do not know if it happens to others 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.880
 but in my case I have to give two or three 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.160
 Sometimes it does not matter if I give it as 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.450
 administrator as he said to someone 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.479
 in the facebook group 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.890
 the important thing is that this 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.840
 console window 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.090
 they will ask us the first time what 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.819
 let's make permits from the firewall 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.770
 so that it runs communication from 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.620
 apache and the database we should 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.220
 accept masters 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.170
 now with this black window open 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.819
 we enter our browser and we go to 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.819
 write localhost 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.290
 must appear 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.160
 a window where they ask us to choose 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.160
 our language 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.410
 we choose international Spanish in the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.670
 most of us 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.860
 then the addresses ask us the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.390
 routes we also accept then we 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.349
 they ask the configuration of the base 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.780
 data we also continue then we do not 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.080
 they talk about the mobile license too 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.680
 we continue then we verify that they are 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.360
 in ok all the requirements they need 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.360
 moodle we also continue 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.250
 then the installation of the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.250
 system this is a process that lasts 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.660
 approximately ten minutes I repeat 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.840
 all this is coming out very fast 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:26.240
 because it accelerates the video and cut 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.240
 many things many you wait 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.430
 in which the installation ends 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.430
 we give the continue button 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.720
 then let's write our name of 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.470
 user 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.390
 our password 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.340
 our name our last name and 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.750
 our email address are the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.720
 data that are asking us in a way 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.580
 mandatory the other data are not 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.860
 necessary we can go placing some 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:11.120
 things as long as we know what it is that 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.550
 we are placing as the name of the 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.680
 city the country in which we are the area 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:21.370
 time and so on if we do not go down and 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.370
 we continue with the installation 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.430
 Now is when we should be asked 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.320
 by the long and short name of the course 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.630
 I 've never been out of this 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.240
 direct way I always have this 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.880
 blank screen and I must press 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.850
 efe 5 or give update the browser and 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.130
 then the profile page appears 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.840
 it could also happen that the browser 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.550
 give an error at this time did not give it to me 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.689
 anyway I will say what is it 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.179
 what would we do if he gives us that error 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:53.190
 we will place as up there 

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:55.290
 localhost admin chrome php 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.180
 a series of processes of 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.200
 maintenance and purification of the 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.990
 platform and when the page tells us 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.620
 that has finished the execution in so many 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.220
 seconds then 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.710
 and we return to our main page 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.160
 and when updating then we should 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.650
 appear normally as I said 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.750
 while we should go administration of the 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.130
 site main page settings of the 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.020
 Homepage 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.630
 if we want to place the long name and 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.030
 short of the site that the last step of 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.030
 our of our installation 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.009
 when we write these names 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.680
 let's just go down 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.220
 we keep 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.840
 and in this case the window that 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.419
 says that the changes were updated 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.470
 and if we give the home page already 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.480
 we have our first task list no 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.360
 it can also happen that in some 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.550
 we do not want to work 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.260
 the page as it is happening right now 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.850
 says there is a loop of 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.710
 redirect in firefox also 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.290
 says something about multiple 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.500
 repetitions for that we need to go to 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.620
 browser menu delete the 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.620
 cookies 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.490
 and in what we delete cookies 

00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:19.349
 then our page appears 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:22.349
 I hope you have been useful 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.349
 Thank you
