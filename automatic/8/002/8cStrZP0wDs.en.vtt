00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.400
 I play no no no I thought I love it 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.330
 for a moment very close to home for me 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.410
 that I am sitting in it now goes naturally 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.640
 about destiny 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.590
 but i thought for the people it 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.820
 playing may be nice to see 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.289
 but always find it interesting 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.200
 I will use it with other people 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.580
 yes and if you don't not play it 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.710
 knows then it might be nice to see 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.879
 so that you understand a little about what there 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.739
 fat then it is of course you have that 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.559
 exactly x that collect those are your weapons 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.440
 that is the highest class of items in the 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.420
 game yes and you that probex like me weapons 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.510
 that you collect 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.269
 that is really a huge drive to 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.889
 play red yellow big blow no no me 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.780
 don't necessarily think mine is you 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:54.699
 good image of what is seen for everyone 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.129
 same from but my top 5 I sat me 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.629
 weapons from destiny ok yes then d'azyr 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.149
 are shortened in action and then you understand one 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.839
 little how cruel it is 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.370
 Grab it there and I think it looked 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.110
 if you like a game, you will too 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.869
 really really nothing else 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.759
 thus the really all the way to busy it 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.700
 really funny meant for disney 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.670
 appdisney really cool but my soul is 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.180
 because like you again dived fight 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.210
 interesting but good and you will x number 5 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.490
 yes i have i have to say i miss there 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.920
 now three years apart from what's next 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.820
 the expension is c has been added 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.340
 so the loft moon and look heart 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.270
 light and save f those three do n't participate 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.740
 because I don't have them there I don't go 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.880
 you have to talk about that you have 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.679
 people you have that place i have 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.179
 personally not ok so all these five 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.990
 you personally have that yes you continue 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.549
 I have every 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.280
 i sat i that an act where dion 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.140
 just put on corner number 5 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.840
 the ant the multi tool that we see and 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.759
 wrap cold and be people 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.409
 shoot her i am we images now 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.939
 van de mie the multi tool undoubtedly via 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.399
 to see us now 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.869
 and it is really a stylus true patje 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.369
 just good kills there then 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.219
 A Matthewth's advantage to respect 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.399
 after it is it is a long range weapon and 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.140
 it just some shots for something god 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.790
 You also have to pull the trigger once 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.640
 coaxing seemed full of brand like it 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.470
 belongs to scouts rival so yes it is 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.790
 just really a whole 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.590
 nice weapon to use something that is not 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.930
 in the rate or would use it is not 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.770
 per se very handy but he is 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.490
 really very fat and the gel ear stands up 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.930
 number 4 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.300
 yes that is probably one of the 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.970
 very best art in the game so rocket 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.520
 launcher and if you seriously do gray then 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.960
 the sweetest you have that with you because the 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.000
 moments when you have to do some damage is 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.650
 nothing more damage than dough does 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.810
 how much damage it 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.070
 lucas damage that is also on culture me 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.660
 am not a keeper my state of the 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.150
 losers and trend that jumps into the picture 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.850
 that cool and he's really a stylus 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.580
 with ornaments on it he is real 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.050
 classic now and he took an oath and one 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.310
 you will all get smaller scarves 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.190
 who will also start pulling again 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.900
 this and you have that thing or get through 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.950
 for two days in a cave on an op 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.020
 a kind of 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.610
 takes water ddg rescue that i have from the 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.959
 got knight full that is one of the 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.730
 that's the hardest thing with three 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.440
 man can do it once a week you can 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.250
 doing that is that he glasses state no 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.740
 no no I know that's because of an okay 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.440
 at number 3 the fix with the kleist 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.150
 ok and that's a rifle review 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.560
 cannot normally use as primer i 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.230
 but this one 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.269
 so that kind of reader beams and shoots 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.650
 it is deary word 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.810
 you have a chance to get it as 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.510
 you drove the that glass thing through 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.340
 heart is playing too and I didn't find him 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.930
 so fat because he says very high technology so 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.810
 really super scifi and I love it more 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.310
 industrial wallpaperers but he was already 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.750
 made a bit with an eye on the rode 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.570
 that news came out and discover it now 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.040
 one do of the dlc percent as 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.390
 you take that thing there then 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.790
 you understand all the way through to exactly that 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.170
 works if you work because it is real 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.940
 insane otherwise nice number 2 because 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.480
 I just have the most 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.330
 used 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.170
 the ice breakers a sniper rifle yes and me 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.940
 I will and who has regenerate fmo 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.070
 And if you are lucca, it's very hard to get around and around 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.739
 sometimes you are in a very sneaky way 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.120
 spot and you do not like you 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.370
 everything can touch from there you can 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.640
 remain seated and never close 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.709
 to come and that is just mainly in PVV 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.959
 So if you play against the computer 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.790
 that one of the best is actually an item 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.380
 keep it that way and everything must go then it is 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.479
 that it is cool but not finished yet 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.650
 number one put there is a weapon what i like 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.600
 a pleasure to use 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.010
 and that is to know him and called 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.260
 porn 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.960
 and he really looks like it is 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.610
 from a metal black metal club 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.890
 is not a very brÃ¼tting 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.450
 and he also has one that is therefore a damage 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.610
 over time effect and poison effect 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.470
 and you need a very difficult bounty 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.050
 occur you are really a very long one 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.480
 range to do this especially your 500 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.220
 Points must redress in PVP 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.150
 the crucible so to multiplayer him with 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.450
 a type 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.750
 damage yes and that is really a challenge 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.820
 and the edge where did you get that 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.750
 no I did that with a void 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.020
 damage 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.600
 future rifle okay and with a void damage 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.830
 a machine gun okay that be met 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.000
 those were the two cars I have after 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.250
 the you just need a lot of jars 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.540
 and every time you die 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.610
 the score goes down again 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.170
 so you need 500 points so if you are bad 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.250
 plays a day yes and you can do everything again 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.070
 lost is now at zero 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.900
 a man of i500 can so I really have 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.740
 I did my best for it and that it is thin 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.310
 just brutal 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.570
 so sees the brute from fat sound 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.580
 facebook at number 1 so if you desessing 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.990
 then you will ever play wraps 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.230
 if you do n't play it you will understand one 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.669
 bit the power of those weapons and the 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.919
