designs for you now recently I featured
a<00:00:16.949> silent<00:00:17.850> drop<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.150> eight<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> had<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> lot

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
a silent drop of eight and I had a lot

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.960 
a silent drop of eight and I had a lot
of<00:00:19.289> response<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.369> lot<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.609> video

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
of response to that a lot of video

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.210 
of response to that a lot of video
response<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.449> lot<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.720> other<00:00:21.869> designs<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.560> I

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
response a lot of other designs and I

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.460 
response a lot of other designs and I
would<00:00:23.460> now<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.000> show<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> think

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
would now like to show you what I think

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.220 
would now like to show you what I think
is<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.010> best<00:00:26.550> silent<00:00:27.480> drop<00:00:27.689> evader

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
is the best silent drop evader

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.730 
is the best silent drop evader
you<00:00:29.010> can<00:00:29.189> make<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.789> my<00:00:29.939> opinion<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:31.320> I'm

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
you can make and it's my opinion and I'm

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.200 
you can make and it's my opinion and I'm
not<00:00:31.800> talking<00:00:32.160> about<00:00:32.189> surface<00:00:32.700> area<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:33.030> just

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
not talking about surface area I'm just

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.389 
not talking about surface area I'm just
like<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.020> drop<00:00:34.230> evader<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.100> so

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
like it's a drop evader that you can so

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.540 
like it's a drop evader that you can so
easily<00:00:35.690> implement<00:00:36.829> anywhere<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.040> think<00:00:38.399> it's

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
easily implement anywhere I think it's

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.090 
easily implement anywhere I think it's
awesome<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.059> designed<00:00:39.420> by<00:00:39.510> some<00:00:39.899> groups<00:00:40.170> he

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
awesome it's designed by some groups he

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.440 
awesome it's designed by some groups he
was<00:00:41.219> nice<00:00:41.430> enough<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> actually<00:00:41.969> come<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.360> my

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
was nice enough to actually come on my

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.510 
was nice enough to actually come on my
server<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.840> show<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> me<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:44.100> always<00:00:44.250> up

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
server and show it to me I'm always up

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.720 
server and show it to me I'm always up
for<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.789> sort<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.059> stuff<00:00:46.610> but<00:00:47.610> basically

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
for that sort of stuff but basically

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
for that sort of stuff but basically
what<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.809> comparator

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
what you have is you have a comparator

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.100 
what you have is you have a comparator
clock<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:50.160> activates<00:00:50.670> by<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.539> moment<00:00:51.930> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
clock which activates by the moment that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.020 
clock which activates by the moment that
there's<00:00:52.440> items<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> bottom<00:00:53.550> dropper<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
there's items in the bottom dropper and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.360 
there's items in the bottom dropper and
that<00:00:54.449> leads<00:00:54.690> into<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.289> torch<00:00:55.890> tower<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
that leads into a torch tower and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
that leads into a torch tower and
emerging<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.059> fixed<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.539> torch<00:00:58.170> tower

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
emerging actually fixed the torch tower

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.069 
emerging actually fixed the torch tower
issue<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.190> not<00:00:59.399> directional<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
issue so it's not directional and the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.779 
issue so it's not directional and the
way<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.320> set<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.829> 100<00:01:02.550> percent

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
way it's set up it's 100 percent

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
way it's set up it's 100 percent
efficient<00:01:03.210> fast<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.899> silent<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.559> clock

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
efficient fast and silent so clock

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.370 
efficient fast and silent so clock
activates<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> signal

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
activates and as you can see the signal

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
activates and as you can see the signal
sort<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.710> travelling<00:01:08.100> upwards<00:01:08.280> which<00:01:09.210> will<00:01:09.420> in

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
sort of travelling upwards which will in

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.320 
sort of travelling upwards which will in
turn<00:01:09.560> move<00:01:10.560> all<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.040> items<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> top<00:01:11.939> chest

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
turn move all the items to the top chest

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
turn move all the items to the top chest
where<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.310> whatever

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
where you can then do with it whatever

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.410 
where you can then do with it whatever
the<00:01:14.700> hell<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.939> want<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.549> it's<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:18.060> always

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the hell you want so it's it's always

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.260 
the hell you want so it's it's always
here<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.560> put<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.040> 16<00:01:20.490> redstone<00:01:20.850> dust<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
here and I put in 16 redstone dust and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.100 
here and I put in 16 redstone dust and
there<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.659> go

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
there we go

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.660 
there we go
16<00:01:22.830> redstone<00:01:23.280> dust<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:25.220> don't<00:01:26.220> think<00:01:26.400> soon

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
16 redstone dust so I don't think soon

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.249 
16 redstone dust so I don't think soon
drops<00:01:26.880> doesn't<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> video<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.720> he<00:01:28.080> does

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
drops doesn't have a video on it he does

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.080 
drops doesn't have a video on it he does
have<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.500> channel<00:01:28.799> I'll<00:01:29.070> actually<00:01:29.280> link<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.060> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
have a channel I'll actually link it I

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.640 
have a channel I'll actually link it I
don't<00:01:30.360> think<00:01:30.390> he<00:01:30.509> has<00:01:30.689> any<00:01:30.840> videos<00:01:31.200> yet<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:31.590> he

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
don't think he has any videos yet but he

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.580 
don't think he has any videos yet but he
might<00:01:31.920> make<00:01:32.549> videos<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> near<00:01:33.329> future<00:01:33.590> but

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
might make videos in the near future but

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.010 
might make videos in the near future but
this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> very<00:01:35.670> very<00:01:35.939> nice<00:01:36.210> design<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.930> think

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
moving on let me actually set the time

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.539 
moving on let me actually set the time
to<00:01:51.619> time<00:01:52.619> where<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:52.979> actually<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.369> what

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to time where we can actually see what

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.530 
to time where we can actually see what
we're<00:01:53.700> doing<00:01:54.079> this<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:56.130> blew<00:01:56.399> my<00:01:56.579> mind<00:01:56.850> quite

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
we're doing this this blew my mind quite

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.679 
we're doing this this blew my mind quite
some<00:01:57.840> time<00:01:58.170> ago<00:01:58.460> this<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.790> not<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.479> not

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
some time ago this it's not it's not

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.600 
some time ago this it's not it's not
completely<00:02:01.229> new<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.740> think<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.340> has<00:02:02.579> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
completely new but I think this has to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.080 
completely new but I think this has to
be<00:02:02.880> shared<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.570> asked<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.110> guy<00:02:04.259> who<00:02:04.320> made<00:02:04.710> it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
be shared so I asked the guy who made it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.630 
be shared so I asked the guy who made it
which<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.240> doc<00:02:06.479> now<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.500> called<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> Redstone

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
which is doc now is called the Redstone

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.960 
which is doc now is called the Redstone
doc<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.959> asked<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.860> could<00:02:11.099> feature<00:02:11.520> it

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
doc I asked if I could feature it

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.870 
doc I asked if I could feature it
and<00:02:13.090> he<00:02:13.630> said<00:02:13.780> yes<00:02:13.960> so<00:02:14.470> here<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.130> am<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.490> wanted<00:02:15.790> to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
and he said yes so here I am I wanted to

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.060 
and he said yes so here I am I wanted to
show<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.270> what<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.170> see<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
show you this what you see here is a

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.330 
show you this what you see here is a
infinite<00:02:19.000> button<00:02:19.810> panel<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.410> I've<00:02:20.860> used<00:02:21.130> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
infinite button panel and I've used the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.100 
infinite button panel and I've used the
mechanics<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:22.030> thing<00:02:22.240> relies<00:02:23.080> on

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
mechanics that this thing relies on

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.370 
mechanics that this thing relies on
already<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:23.950> my<00:02:24.100> slot<00:02:24.430> machine<00:02:25.110> but<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.200> first

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
already in my slot machine but the first

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.500 
already in my slot machine but the first
time<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.590> saw<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:26.920> was<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:27.460> his<00:02:28.090> channel<00:02:28.300> I'm

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
time I saw it was on his channel I'm

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.720 
time I saw it was on his channel I'm
subscribed<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.110> him<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.410> definitely<00:02:30.130> recommend

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
subscribed to him I definitely recommend

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.490 
subscribed to him I definitely recommend
you<00:02:30.940> check<00:02:30.970> him<00:02:31.240> out<00:02:31.300> as<00:02:31.450> well

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
you check him out as well

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.460 
you check him out as well
the<00:02:33.130> way<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.430> works<00:02:33.670> it's<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.360> like<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.290> most

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
the way it works it's it like the most

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.910 
the way it works it's it like the most
genius<00:02:35.800> ideas<00:02:36.490> are<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> most<00:02:36.880> simple<00:02:37.270> so<00:02:37.920> you

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
genius ideas are the most simple so you

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.820 
genius ideas are the most simple so you
know<00:02:39.310> if<00:02:39.700> your<00:02:39.850> normal<00:02:39.970> signal<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.690> then<00:02:41.140> this

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
know if your normal signal and then this

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.640 
know if your normal signal and then this
button<00:02:42.160> actually<00:02:42.930> triggers<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.960> dropper<00:02:44.380> which

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
button actually triggers a dropper which

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.949 
button actually triggers a dropper which
leads<00:02:44.920> into<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.190> hopper<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:46.300> hopper<00:02:46.660> leads

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
leads into a hopper and hopper leads

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.900 
leads into a hopper and hopper leads
back<00:02:47.140> into<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.500> dropper<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:47.980> what<00:02:48.340> happens<00:02:48.670> is

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
back into the dropper so what happens is

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.840 
back into the dropper so what happens is
you<00:02:49.090> click<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.360> button<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.459> block<00:02:51.640> gets

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
you click the button and the block gets

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.340 
you click the button and the block gets
moved<00:02:52.090> there<00:02:52.330> for<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> brief<00:02:52.660> moment<00:02:52.930> which

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
moved there for a brief moment which

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.660 
moved there for a brief moment which
allows<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.010> get<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.160> signal<00:02:54.520> with<00:02:54.610> the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
allows you to get a signal with the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.420 
allows you to get a signal with the
comparator<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.330> then<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.530> yeah<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.400> can

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
comparator and then you yeah you can

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.640 
comparator and then you yeah you can
just<00:02:57.550> do<00:02:58.060> with<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.360> signal<00:02:59.140> whatever<00:02:59.290> you

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
just do with that signal whatever you

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.940 
just do with that signal whatever you
want<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.720> that's<00:03:01.720> another<00:03:01.990> one<00:03:02.170> another<00:03:02.800> one

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
want and that's another one another one

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.420 
want and that's another one another one
and<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.850> is<00:03:04.060> infinite<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.930> it's<00:03:05.560> stackable

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
and this is infinite and it's stackable

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.949 
and this is infinite and it's stackable
as<00:03:06.580> well<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:06.910> can<00:03:07.060> have<00:03:07.150> two<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.480> these<00:03:07.690> rows

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
as well you can have two of these rows

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.050 
as well you can have two of these rows
next<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.380> each<00:03:08.500> other<00:03:08.650> without<00:03:09.280> any<00:03:09.700> sort<00:03:10.030> of

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
next to each other without any sort of

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.410 
next to each other without any sort of
issue<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.830> this<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.820> freaking

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
issue so this is just a freaking

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.620 
issue so this is just a freaking
infinite<00:03:14.170> bottom<00:03:15.100> panel<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.550> I've<00:03:15.760> made<00:03:16.060> very

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
infinite bottom panel and I've made very

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.590 
infinite bottom panel and I've made very
very<00:03:16.900> large<00:03:17.140> button<00:03:17.800> panels<00:03:18.100> in<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.280> past<00:03:18.600> but

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
very large button panels in the past but

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.410 
very large button panels in the past but
they<00:03:19.959> were<00:03:20.019> huge<00:03:20.560> they<00:03:21.130> were<00:03:21.160> gigantic<00:03:21.790> so

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
they were huge they were gigantic so

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.400 
they were huge they were gigantic so
this<00:03:23.350> is<00:03:23.970> extremely<00:03:24.970> useful<00:03:25.120> for<00:03:25.480> any

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
this is extremely useful for any

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.710 
this is extremely useful for any
situation<00:03:27.130> where<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.340> need<00:03:27.610> lots<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.540> lots

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
situation where you need lots and lots

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.840 
situation where you need lots and lots
of<00:03:28.810> buttons<00:03:29.050> next<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.560> each<00:03:29.680> other<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.100> you

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
of buttons next to each other and you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.759 
of buttons next to each other and you
might<00:03:31.000> be<00:03:31.090> wondering<00:03:31.239> like<00:03:31.510> how<00:03:31.720> can<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.019> you

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
might be wondering like how can you you

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.640 
might be wondering like how can you you
know<00:03:32.920> split<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.700> signals<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.239> stuff<00:03:34.450> well<00:03:35.170> I

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
know split the signals and stuff well I

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.870 
know split the signals and stuff well I
mean<00:03:36.070> this<00:03:36.310> will<00:03:36.610> keep<00:03:37.600> going<00:03:38.110> like<00:03:38.920> so<00:03:39.190> but

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
mean this will keep going like so but

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.759 
mean this will keep going like so but
say<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.209> want<00:03:40.570> to<00:03:40.690> get<00:03:40.840> this<00:03:41.019> signal<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.500> can<00:03:41.530> just

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
say I want to get this signal I can just

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.250 
say I want to get this signal I can just
tap<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.130> off<00:03:42.250> here<00:03:42.610> or<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.150> can<00:03:43.360> tap<00:03:43.630> this<00:03:43.840> signal

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
tap it off here or I can tap this signal

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.690 
tap it off here or I can tap this signal
off<00:03:44.350> here<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:44.680> know<00:03:44.799> you<00:03:44.860> can<00:03:45.040> just<00:03:45.070> split<00:03:45.489> it

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
off here you know you can just split it

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.160 
off here you know you can just split it
out<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.120> have<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.390> bottom<00:03:46.690> panel<00:03:46.810> and

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
out so you have the bottom panel and

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.130 
out so you have the bottom panel and
