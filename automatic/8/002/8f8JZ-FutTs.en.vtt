you<00:01:59.729> think<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.360> clicking<00:02:00.659> here

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you think like you know clicking here

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.170 
you think like you know clicking here
would<00:02:00.930> take<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:02.460> track<00:02:02.759> or<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
would take you into that track or the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.789 
would take you into that track or the
track<00:02:03.509> list<00:02:03.750> or<00:02:03.899> something<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.469> doesn't

track list or something but it doesn't

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.100 
track list or something but it doesn't
so<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.210> can't<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> lot<00:02:07.079> of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
so you really can't have to do a lot of

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.719 
so you really can't have to do a lot of
