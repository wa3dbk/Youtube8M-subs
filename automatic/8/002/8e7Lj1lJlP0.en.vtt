00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello to all of you sang this 123 part of the mine 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.250
 craft craft welcome to this 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.769
 the series will show you the mechanism that promised 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.599
 the previous series is another compact 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.220
 dynamite gun however that 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.220
 shoots up today i will show it to you 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.609
 so here it looks like this assembly 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.029
 such a construction in principle with easy 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.790
 very scheme water fence and now i am you 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.000
 I will explain what this is all for 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.590
 I'll even show you how to shoot that gun 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.450
 that's how dynamite appears and that's how 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.120
 dynamite top gun appears 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.129
 shoots and dynamite explodes so 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.309
 way it can do it and not 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.010
 I know from the top down and from the bottom up some 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.660
 some craters in the tunnel I don't even know 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.910
 what can you use this gun but 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.360
 the fact is it shoot up and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.280
 shoots quite well and that means water 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.379
 located here in order to 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.799
 handouts to here's uncharged dynamite 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.260
 and from distributors 100 more coins 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.150
 excluded from the distributors will 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.729
 pop up dynamite as you saw it and 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:19.259
 it is water so the design is not 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.060
 will break further we have some 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.650
 the delay here is the torch 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.509
 there is a delay in admission 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.700
 signal and a new dynamite appears 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.799
 which falls on the fence why exactly 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.229
 fence because dynamite should 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.150
 be on high ground over these 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.250
 speakers that will explode in the water and 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.710
 thereby she shoots up that is 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.720
 if she just falls she is right there 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.329
 water and explode and no shot 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.340
 will also be in this circuit can increase 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.250
 I have this version but I will show you 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.509
 show another version 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.720
 then we dig such a hole 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:59.040
 Here we are 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.159
 we pour water here think this to me 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.689
 enough and take the distributor once we set 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:11.069
 Distributor 2 Distributor 3 Distributor and 4 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.860
 Distributor a second 4 means it is necessary 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.530
 distributor we put the block on top of the torch and 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.130
 we put a distributor on this torch 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.380
 to be 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.330
 spit out exactly that dynamite which 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.380
 will fly into 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.110
 then we just have to connect 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.660
 the signal is like this 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.220
 here we spend before this distributor with 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.780
 the other side naturally we can 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.250
 just hold up to this distributor and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.660
 load all this tintin 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.810
 also we are here now now 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.180
 I will take the fence here 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.120
 in the middle there is a fence that is dynamite 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.600
 which you spat he stayed on 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.590
 the fence 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.290
 but in order to improve the scheme you 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.770
 you can put it here let's say 3 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.140
 distributor I think you on each side 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.910
 enough 3 distributors no longer need in 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.860
 principle you can put something here 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.230
 there will be 2 dynamite in this block 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.570
 appear but not necessarily in essence 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.130
 as it were up to you well that is here 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.620
 so put redstone on 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:21.770
 distributor using the font and now we 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:23.970
 fill the distributors with dynamite so 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.500
 of course yes it takes me at 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.830
 least some time 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.100
 so here and so here so same 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.110
 here we thrust dynamite ariston we 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.480
 held left to put only a button 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.630
 here and activate all this of course us 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.470
 activated activated and blow up 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.940
 dynamite shoots even higher with 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.890
 distributors which is additional 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.450
 set now let's see how far 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.340
 flies away 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.530
 very high meaning we can 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.050
 regulate with distributors 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.769
 the quantity is more precise not the quantity height 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.629
 the shot 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.620
 here we can also put 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.900
 distributors and hold just roadstone 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.069
 Here are the husband that way you generally 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.200
 can also spend here 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.560
 speaker here we already have here 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:21.139
 dynamite in this case dynamite will start 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:24.479
 shoot even higher now we will see it 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.660
 like this 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.300
 dynamite gun can be used as 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.639
 completely trampoline that is a trampoline which you 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.370
 seen before a long time ago in youtube and 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:39.180
 there is such a trampoline myself just here 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:42.030
 block button activation well there too 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.610
 dynamite stand in general about explode 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.410
 flying away see very high half 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.690
 of my mechanical world but really 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.389
 In fact, it is not even half of it is small 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.090
 the part here is 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.010
 use trampoline now i will add more 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.530
 here dynamite and show you how 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.200
 completely dynamite shoots of all 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.260
 distributors well i mean well how do you see 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.110
 very high literally no land 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.150
 great dynamite that 's it 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.490
 here is a diagram that is how you can 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.180
 use few distributors a lot 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:21.180
 Distributors as you want here that is 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:23.370
 such a scheme is all you have 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:29.250
 The scheme therefore showed the construction site in his 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:31.620
 mechanical your worlds in general I you 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.229
 everything has already shown and that's all for it 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.729
 thanks for watching you were singing 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.830
 it was one hundred and twenty third 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.840
 minecraft mechanisms put your fingers 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.550
 up no more than thumbs up 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.550
 the faster new mechanisms come out 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.479
 add to favorites subscribe to 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.870
 my channel everyone thanks for watching everyone 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.870
 until
