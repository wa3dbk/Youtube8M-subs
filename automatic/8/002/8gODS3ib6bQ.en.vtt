00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.609 
roughly like 10 minutes that what it
feels<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.060> those<00:01:30.240> 10<00:01:30.509> minutes<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
feels like in of those 10 minutes the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.179 
feels like in of those 10 minutes the
Dragon<00:01:32.009> has<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:33.380> basically<00:01:34.380> no<00:01:34.680> action<00:01:35.070> in

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
Dragon has like basically no action in

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
Dragon has like basically no action in
there<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.420> was<00:01:36.659> pretty<00:01:37.049> disappointed<00:01:37.140> on

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
there so I was pretty disappointed on

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.230 
there so I was pretty disappointed on
that<00:01:37.740> part<00:01:37.979> already<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.909> rest<00:01:39.090> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that part already but then the rest of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.480 
that part already but then the rest of
the<00:01:39.360> movie<00:01:39.479> continued<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:41.189> they<00:01:41.310> ran

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the movie continued and I think they ran

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.670 
the movie continued and I think they ran
out<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.640> content<00:01:42.210> pretty<00:01:42.509> fast<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
out of content pretty fast like the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.859 
out of content pretty fast like the
original<00:01:44.189> book<00:01:44.460> was<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> only<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.360> book<00:01:45.659> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
original book was the only one book and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
original book was the only one book and
they<00:01:46.110> cut<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.409> into<00:01:46.590> three<00:01:46.829> pieces<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.520> I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
they cut it into three pieces and I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.069 
they cut it into three pieces and I
think<00:01:47.880> when<00:01:48.060> they<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.360> were<00:01:48.540> filming<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
think when they like were filming the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.300 
think when they like were filming the
third<00:01:49.259> part<00:01:49.560> they<00:01:49.710> kind<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.009> ran<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.280> of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
third part they kind of ran out of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.069 
third part they kind of ran out of
content<00:01:50.790> at<00:01:51.149> least<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:51.659> what<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.930> felt

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
content at least that's what it felt

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.660 
content at least that's what it felt
like<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> lot<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> things<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.159> are<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
like a lot of the things that are in the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.100 
like a lot of the things that are in the
story<00:01:53.909> right<00:01:54.090> now<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.479> completely<00:01:54.930> obsolete

nope
the<00:02:13.670> movie<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.150> don't<00:02:14.330> really<00:02:14.450> get<00:02:14.660> why

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
the movie and I don't really get why

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.940
