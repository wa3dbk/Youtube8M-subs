00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.439
 how to behave for a correct one 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.600
 soy intake within the 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.090
 everyday diet but on soy e 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.310
 in fact there is enough confusion there 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.050
 those who claim that it is extremely dangerous 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.599
 there is absolutely no need to avoid anyone 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:33.400
 claims that instead it is a food 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:35.110
 almost prodigious we know it contains 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.900
 of substances that have an action 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.150
 similar to estrogen and therefore for a long time 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.860
 time has thought it would have a 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.720
 negative effect on the tumors that they are 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.460
 estrogen sensitive as some 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.500
 breast cancers actually then are 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.809
 out of the data that they denied 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.960
 this is said almost the opposite that 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.850
 instead it can have a protective effect 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.160
 I believe the truth is a later in the middle 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.879
 as almost always is definitely a 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.530
 important food has a wealth of 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.190
 proteins obviously type proteins 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.320
 high vegetable so can definitely 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.759
 help replace some 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.759
 animal protein intake 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.319
 at the same time, however, it has objectively 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.340
 of biological properties too 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:23.619
 details that may not be what they are 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.000
 useful in everyone is potentially a 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.560
 food allergen enough 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.990
 frequent so there are people who 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.270
 I'm allergic here I believe that everything 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.800
 added must be taken like any other 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.020
 food in particular as any 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.720
 another legume should not become the basis 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.130
 of food but can be 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.899
 introduced as a replacement in 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.009
 particular of a share of proteins 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.009
 animals 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.479
 I believe that often discussions about 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.550
 food and feeding into 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.080
 general take a turn which is a 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.080
 a little extremist on one side 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.149
 on the other hand in the case of soy I repeat one 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.319
 use that is of sometimes to the 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.880
 week to replace one 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.250
 portion of meat proteins of the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.989
 fish is absolutely permissible maybe 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.380
 insist on everyday or 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.729
 a diet almost exclusively 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.989
 based on the threshold as a protein source 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.989
 I think it's a bit excessive
