00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.900
 i 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.450
 welcome to the saints I am blond 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.700
 source and today I 'm going to bring you a tutorial 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.250
 of how to make this super ramp that 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.070
 we have right now I call it the ramp 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.170
 snake because it snakes and is very 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.910
 difficult to keep in it quite 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.820
 difficult if you go very fast though 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.230
 then the car slows down and now 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.730
 you will ask why after these 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.710
 containers we found these 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.260
 blue barriers good is that we're in 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.860
 the creator and this has a very function 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:44.610
 very very important to be able to create 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.230
 this type of ramps I'm going to put on the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.600
 description a video of my friend 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.730
 tiny of your channel for you to see 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.100
 because he explains very well how to do 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.960
 this type of blue ramps I call them 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.910
 of blue barriers and now what 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.220
 we have to look in addition to the barrier 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.989
 blue we have to look for a barrier of 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.970
 long striped concrete or can also 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.860
 be the simple we put it on the ground and 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.420
 if you notice and we are already approaching 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.700
 It puts us in the form of a good ramp. 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.920
 put the camera as I have it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.630
 and on the smooth side always remember 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.880
 the smooth side we get closer we can 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.350
 put horizontally as you see but 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.700
 we are interested in putting them and once 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.219
 that we have it like this we give the X 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.229
 we removed the concrete barrier and now 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.689
 you will see that we can already have a twig 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.909
 if we want to have several ramps followed 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.220
 as I have them up as you have to 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.220
 do and do it in the following way 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.729
 is putting the barrier on the ground 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.030
 and taking it again with the X equis 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.490
 because that way the object will be solid and that 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.439
 irritated or that little iron that 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.380
 excels at any of those we can 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.670
 put a barrier like now you will see 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.179
 I'm going to bring the camera closer so that 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.179
 you see well 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.990
 it's about putting it on the floor 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.210
 the first problem in ghost form 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.530
 As I call it, raise the camera a little 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.940
 you have to be very delicate with the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.440
 mango go up a little bit a little 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.460
 that you have a perfect horizontal 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.990
 now they give you a little to the right 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.630
 little by little 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.060
 left x and there we will be 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.130
 since you can try it also from 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.830
 left to right or top to bottom 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.270
 As you want to see, I always give it to you 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.920
 to the right now I have it 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.600
 gave a little to the left right x 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.030
 and I have it placed 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.770
 well so until you want to create 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.050
 all the quinteras once the 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.270
 have you created like this and you only have 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.980
 to do the same but this time with the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.900
 containers that you want because you can 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.820
 use both types of barriers 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.370
 blue like any type of container 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.410
 as you can see between the holes 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.810
 we can put a container on the ground 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.340
 the gaps between barriers give 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.860
 down up and x 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.239
 as long as we have the solid object 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.129
 we have to put the object on the ground 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.769
 with the X and take it and when 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.349
 let's have solid so we give it below x 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.760
 so this time it's pretty 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.860
 difficult many times I do not get to the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.519
 first but the container is going to 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.930
 to be perfect without any steps 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.170
 you can run all the cars whether they are 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.090
 are environments whether tourism r hope 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.920
 that you like the video and I'll put you in the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.460
 career in the description since 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.440
 I'll post another video 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.140
 give me a like its served something 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.330
 I hope to see these ramps for all 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.160
 holy to subscribe if you are not and 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.520
 as I always tell you, see you in the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.520
