a<00:00:36.440> gallon<00:00:36.469> which<00:00:36.859> is<00:00:37.160> right<00:00:37.850> where<00:00:38.000> I<00:00:38.030> was<00:00:38.210> with

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
a gallon which is right where I was with

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.900 
a gallon which is right where I was with
the<00:00:38.510> CRV<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.260> idea<00:00:39.590> of<00:00:39.680> being<00:00:40.399> a<00:00:40.579> you<00:00:40.879> know

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
the CRV and the idea of being a you know

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.360 
the CRV and the idea of being a you know
a<00:00:41.120> relatively<00:00:41.539> low<00:00:41.750> consumption<00:00:42.370> vehicle

a relatively low consumption vehicle
well<00:00:43.609> we're<00:00:44.239> going<00:00:44.329> to<00:00:44.390> eventually<00:00:44.570> build<00:00:44.929> the

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
well we're going to eventually build the

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.700 
well we're going to eventually build the
FJ<00:00:45.769> into<00:00:46.039> something<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:46.370> can<00:00:46.579> get<00:00:46.789> around<00:00:47.710> 27

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
FJ into something that can get around 27

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.590 
FJ into something that can get around 27
28<00:00:48.920> miles<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.280> gallon<00:00:49.309> is<00:00:49.730> going<00:00:50.090> to<00:00:50.179> be<00:00:50.300> what

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
almost hit me and he said the reason was

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.510

he<00:01:29.869> heard<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.200> horn<00:01:30.469> and<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:30.890> was<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.100> faint<00:01:31.369> he

he heard the horn and it was so faint he

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.499 
he heard the horn and it was so faint he
thought<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.790> was<00:01:31.880> coming<00:01:32.090> from<00:01:32.180> way<00:01:32.360> behind

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
thought it was coming from way behind

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.469 
thought it was coming from way behind
him<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:32.899> he<00:01:32.990> turned<00:01:33.259> around<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:33.890> look<00:01:34.070> and

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
him so he turned around to look and

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.789 
him so he turned around to look and
that's<00:01:35.479> where<00:01:35.750> he<00:01:35.960> fell<00:01:36.200> flat<00:01:36.350> at<00:01:36.729> but<00:01:38.799> they're

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
that's where he fell flat at but they're

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.249 
that's where he fell flat at but they're
a<00:01:39.829> lot<00:01:40.070> of<00:01:40.100> fun<00:01:40.689> they're<00:01:41.689> a<00:01:41.719> little<00:01:41.930> bit<00:01:42.049> louder

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
a lot of fun they're a little bit louder

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.209 
a lot of fun they're a little bit louder
than<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:42.799> would<00:01:43.009> definitely<00:01:43.399> expect<00:01:43.939> and

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
than you would definitely expect and

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.580 
than you would definitely expect and
they<00:01:46.219> actually<00:01:46.759> give<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.689> FJ<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.079> horn<00:01:48.409> which

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
they actually give the FJ a horn which

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.380 
they actually give the FJ a horn which
before<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:48.979> mean<00:01:49.250> that<00:01:49.640> horn<00:01:49.909> was<00:01:50.090> just

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
before I mean that horn was just

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.240 
before I mean that horn was just
pathetic<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.469> that<00:01:51.619> was<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.799> only<00:01:51.860> pathetic

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
pathetic and that was the only pathetic

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.209 
pathetic and that was the only pathetic
thing<00:01:52.430> on<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.700> car<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:52.909> think<00:01:53.329> of<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.130> what<00:01:55.130> we

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
thing on the car I think of and what we

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.590 
thing on the car I think of and what we
did<00:01:55.399> here<00:01:55.579> is<00:01:55.640> we<00:01:55.670> just<00:01:55.909> took<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.180> original

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
did here is we just took the original

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.889 
did here is we just took the original
lead<00:01:56.750> out<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.229> hot<00:01:57.680> lead<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.240> ran<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.570> V

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
lead out the hot lead and ran a V

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.480 
lead out the hot lead and ran a V
splitter<00:02:00.259> as<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:00.770> can<00:02:00.859> see<00:02:01.039> if<00:02:01.100> they're<00:02:01.280> in

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
splitter as you can see if they're in

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.370 
splitter as you can see if they're in
there<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.180> then<00:02:02.630> on<00:02:02.719> the<00:02:02.810> negatives

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
there and then on the negatives

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.770 
there and then on the negatives
we<00:02:03.829> just<00:02:04.070> ran<00:02:04.460> two<00:02:04.729> wires<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:05.119> them<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.479> ran<00:02:05.659> it

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
we just ran two wires to them and ran it

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.899 
we just ran two wires to them and ran it
back<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:06.920> ground<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.609> it<00:02:07.700> was<00:02:07.789> really

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
back to this ground so it was really

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.880 
back to this ground so it was really
good<00:02:08.090> it's<00:02:08.330> like<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.569> split

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
good it's like a split

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.720 
good it's like a split
into<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:11.110> two-in-one<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:12.710> it's<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.980> split<00:02:13.520> and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
into a two-in-one so it's a split and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.630 
into a two-in-one so it's a split and
then<00:02:13.850> two<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.780> one<00:02:15.130> is<00:02:16.130> for<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.460> wiring

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
then two to one is for the wiring

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.520 
then two to one is for the wiring
diagram<00:02:17.090> really<00:02:17.270> easy<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.750> hobble<00:02:18.440> around

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
diagram really easy all a hobble around

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.760 
diagram really easy all a hobble around
here<00:02:19.150> which<00:02:20.150> see<00:02:20.450> how<00:02:20.570> it<00:02:20.630> sounds<00:02:21.110> but<00:02:21.170> uh<00:02:21.320> it's

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
here which see how it sounds but uh it's

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.600 
here which see how it sounds but uh it's
definitely<00:02:21.980> not<00:02:22.340> enough<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.730> hear<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.030> now

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.730 

that's<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.760> lot<00:02:28.910> louder<00:02:29.120> than<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.570> little

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
that's a lot louder than that little

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.060 
that's a lot louder than that little
wimpy<00:02:30.740> thing<00:02:30.950> we<00:02:31.070> had<00:02:31.250> before<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:32.980> keep<00:02:33.980> on

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
wimpy thing we had before so keep on

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.500 
wimpy thing we had before so keep on
watching<00:02:34.280> stay<00:02:34.700> tuned<00:02:34.940> we<00:02:35.120> should<00:02:35.270> be<00:02:35.360> back

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
watching stay tuned we should be back

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.540 
watching stay tuned we should be back
shortly
