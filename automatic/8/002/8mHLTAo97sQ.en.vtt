00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.090
 so said of closed you fall asleep with 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.370
 emotions in your pocket 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:27.430
 who also loses the chance 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.430
 something is changing a hundred satellites 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.210
 moves away 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.250
 Go 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.829
 I spent three years knocking at many 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.160
 record labels that I mean 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.160
 have considered little but I believe it is the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.050
 practice here then in July of a year e 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.610
 half ago I decided to give up 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.199
 when a friend of mine calls me and tells me 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.320
 look what battered he rented one 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.480
 house in donnalucata and so I will be there 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.940
 I am activated of the return you made 30 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.940
 we are 31 and we are stationed there 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.850
 behind a bush for half a day a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.220
 see the master's schedule saw me 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.289
 with this plastic bag there was 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.619
 and plastic because we were on it 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:19.110
 scotch with the cd in it the lyrics and 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:22.080
 a letter concerns me fulminant goes 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.840
 well I will not discount hi then figure rio 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.560
 where the same afternoon practically 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.450
 I found five anonymous calls on the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.479
 cellular a message in the answering machine was 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.610
 he who expressed his wishes to him 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.450
 to follow me as an artistic producer is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.539
 state 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.320
 beautiful an experience and it is still 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.320
 a fabulous experience 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.470
 under 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.630
 all 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.070
 Yup 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.740
 Yup 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.580
 a fact he had decided to follow 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.620
 as a mentor to produce your first 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.570
 disco is luck 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.960
 you also feel the bulk of an artist 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.530
 so important then that in reality 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.870
 what I say is that it is beating me 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.820
 giving a rare thing 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.100
 that is, it is giving me the opportunity to 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.660
 to really be what I am and today 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.560
 a lot of things 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.670
 complex is not the desire to no of 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.950
 deform 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.490
 the project indeed to enhance it for 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.490
 that which is 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.950
 together 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.880
 you are both Sicilians both 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.980
 somehow music migrants I have 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.870
 made yours in the seventies 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.030
 route you're doing it today in a 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.050
 world that burns very quickly too 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.850
 talent but to my answer 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.980
 let's say a little about fu dynamics 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.260
 this is precisely the record of today 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.130
 tour live at home 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.340
 that is, I believe so much in people that is 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:45.870
 in the direct relationship that can be established 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.940
 with with the stories 109 the songwriters 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.140
 we use stories no 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.150
 so what better way to meet 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.650
 stories that come into the house of 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.540
 I'm practically doing what people do 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.000
 I did with batted do of 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.650
 stalking at the home of an audience that 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.420
 maybe one day it could become the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.810
 my audience 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.810
 the thing where 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:20.329
 the chicken to come back 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.100
 john caccamo's simulator is not 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:28.580
 I know anyone who wants to listen in 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.740
 general in my opinion but listen in 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.480
 true sense of the word dubbed said 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.790
 from where I am this present 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.200
 girl represents the future one 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:42.380
 crazy responsibility in fact I don't 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.350
 he thinks that what they ask me 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.600
 when they ask me about emotion stands 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.330
 that is, how you did what you did 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.870
 you felt knowing that after you on 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.500
 the same stage would have been frank 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.990
 battiato 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:03.860
 I told him but saved the unconscious that is 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:07.640
 don't think about it, scan in the instant 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.180
 which disappointed companies abuse and there is colors and 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.180
 ethics
