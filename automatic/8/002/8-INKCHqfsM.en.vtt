every<00:06:37.039> I<00:06:37.069> didn't<00:06:37.520> know<00:06:37.610> what<00:06:37.789> that<00:06:37.909> was<00:06:37.969> like<00:06:38.449> I

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
every I didn't know what that was like I

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:40.149 
every I didn't know what that was like I
said<00:06:38.870> this<00:06:38.990> was<00:06:39.169> my<00:06:39.289> first<00:06:39.499> purchase<00:06:39.800> so<00:06:40.099> I

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
said this was my first purchase so I

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.520 
said this was my first purchase so I
kind<00:06:40.430> of<00:06:40.490> just<00:06:40.669> was<00:06:40.939> so<00:06:41.659> happy<00:06:41.990> that<00:06:42.169> it<00:06:42.439> was

kind of just was so happy that it was
out<00:06:42.770> but<00:06:43.669> I<00:06:43.819> guess<00:06:44.120> what<00:06:44.389> that<00:06:44.419> means<00:06:44.990> is<00:06:45.349> that
