actually much more evident painting that

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.949 
actually much more evident painting that
generally<00:00:12.090> when<00:00:12.209> people<00:00:12.240> paint<00:00:12.719> their<00:00:12.780> own

and<00:00:18.770> self<00:00:19.770> portraiture<00:00:20.130> always<00:00:20.250> has<00:00:20.550> this

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
and self portraiture always has this

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.030 
and self portraiture always has this
element<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:21.750> kind<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.110> it's<00:00:22.530> like<00:00:22.770> one

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
element that it's kind of it's like one

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.040 
element that it's kind of it's like one
looking<00:00:23.790> at<00:00:23.940> once<00:00:24.330> reflection<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.020> mirror

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
looking at once reflection in a mirror

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.930 
looking at once reflection in a mirror
that<00:00:25.290> you're<00:00:25.530> always<00:00:25.680> critical<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.760> that

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
that you're always critical of that

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.800 
that you're always critical of that
which<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.210> see<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:28.730> thus<00:00:29.730> working<00:00:30.600> with

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
which you see and thus working with

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.560 
which you see and thus working with
ourselves<00:00:31.460> also<00:00:32.460> has<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.820> element<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.450> we

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
ourselves also has this element that we

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.759 
ourselves also has this element that we
kind<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.870> push<00:00:34.140> ourselves<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:36.589> probably<00:00:37.589> also

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
kind of push ourselves and probably also

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.790 
kind of push ourselves and probably also
never<00:00:38.129> really<00:00:38.429> appreciate<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.239> see<00:00:39.800> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
never really appreciate what we see so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.439 
never really appreciate what we see so
we<00:00:40.920> end<00:00:41.039> up<00:00:41.219> having<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.819> put<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> lot<00:00:42.269> more

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
we end up having to put a lot more

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.630 
we end up having to put a lot more
effort<00:00:43.079> maybe<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.649> create<00:00:43.859> into<00:00:44.280> creating

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
effort maybe in to create into creating

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790 
effort maybe in to create into creating
other<00:00:44.760> elements<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:45.539> photograph<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.319> we

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
other elements in the photograph that we

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.689 
other elements in the photograph that we
can<00:00:46.980> light<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.609> we<00:00:47.699> like<00:00:47.899> but<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:48.989> often<00:00:49.289> find

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
can light that we like but we often find

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.389 
can light that we like but we often find
still<00:00:50.699> lives<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.059> their<00:00:51.210> own<00:00:51.329> boring<00:00:52.249> so<00:00:53.249> we

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
still lives on their own boring so we

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.700 
still lives on their own boring so we
end<00:00:53.519> up<00:00:53.609> having<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> add<00:00:54.030> our<00:00:54.359> humans<00:00:55.229> are

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
end up having to add our humans are

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.309 
end up having to add our humans are
human<00:00:56.129> asst<00:00:56.309> into<00:00:56.729> them<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:58.019> still

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
human asst into them but it still

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:00.379 
human asst into them but it still
retains<00:00:58.499> this<00:00:58.920> quality<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.609> seeing<00:01:00.269> a

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:00.389 
retains this quality of seeing a

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:01.579 
retains this quality of seeing a
reflection<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.929> the<00:01:01.019> mirror<00:01:01.229> which<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
reflection in the mirror which is

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.700 
reflection in the mirror which is
uncomfortable<00:01:02.870> when<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.199> an<00:01:06.260> an<00:01:07.260> idea<00:01:07.650> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
uncomfortable when we have an an idea of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.020 
uncomfortable when we have an an idea of
what<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.070> want<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.730> image<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.050> convey<00:01:11.030> most

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
what we want the image to convey most

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.620 
what we want the image to convey most
times<00:01:13.220> we<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.460> sort<00:01:14.730> of<00:01:14.820> talk<00:01:15.060> ourselves<00:01:15.270> into

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
times we can sort of talk ourselves into

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.950 
times we can sort of talk ourselves into
that<00:01:15.900> better<00:01:16.590> than<00:01:16.800> someone<00:01:17.040> else<00:01:17.810> Joseph<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that better than someone else Joseph and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.450 
that better than someone else Joseph and
I<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.140> been<00:01:19.260> working<00:01:19.320> together<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.100> several

really take a shape that was

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.480 
really take a shape that was
distinguishable<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.470> recognizable<00:01:56.160> as<00:01:56.280> may

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
misha circus photographic series when I

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.110 
misha circus photographic series when I
was<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:12.730> Italy<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.210> this<00:02:13.780> was<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:13.960> London<00:02:14.170> and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
was in Italy and this was in London and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.840 
was in Italy and this was in London and
and<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:17.380> think<00:02:18.100> we<00:02:18.160> were<00:02:18.250> both<00:02:18.280> quite<00:02:18.610> blown

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
and I think we were both quite blown

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.490 
and I think we were both quite blown
away<00:02:19.060> by<00:02:19.240> them<00:02:19.420> they<00:02:19.600> were<00:02:19.840> very<00:02:20.200> different

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
away by them they were very different

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.120 
away by them they were very different

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
from most of our mom what we had done

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.590 
from most of our mom what we had done

interesting and striking and the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
characters were very complete in a way I

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.200

felt I wanted to suit him take them a

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.000 
felt I wanted to suit him take them a
little<00:02:34.360> bit<00:02:34.510> further<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.990> from<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.620> still

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
little bit further and from the still

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.550 
little bit further and from the still
frozen<00:02:36.430> image<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:37.000> them<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.420> get<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.200> glimpse

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
frozen image of them and get a glimpse

frozen image of them and get a glimpse
of<00:02:38.800> who<00:02:39.760> they<00:02:40.000> were<00:02:40.060> just<00:02:40.720> by<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.410> few<00:02:41.500> moments

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
of who they were just by a few moments

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.190 
of who they were just by a few moments
before<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.910> perhaps<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.510> few<00:02:43.630> months<00:02:43.840> after

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
before and perhaps a few months after

before and perhaps a few months after
that<00:02:44.230> picture<00:02:44.560> was<00:02:44.709> taken<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.870> wouldn't<00:02:47.140> be

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
that picture was taken so it wouldn't be

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.560 
that picture was taken so it wouldn't be
much<00:02:48.370> more<00:02:48.700> than<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.030> get<00:02:49.150> from<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.450> pic

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
much more than you get from the pic

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.780 
much more than you get from the pic
photograph<00:02:50.080> but<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.770> would<00:02:50.950> sort<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.280> give<00:02:51.520> a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
photograph but it would sort of give a

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.430 
photograph but it would sort of give a
little<00:02:51.880> bit<00:02:52.300> more<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.600> an<00:02:52.720> insight<00:02:53.020> into<00:02:53.050> who

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
little bit more of an insight into who

little bit more of an insight into who
these<00:02:53.620> characters<00:02:53.830> were<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.990> fact<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.320> we

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
these characters were the fact that we

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.229 
these characters were the fact that we
shot<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.890> film<00:02:57.040> months<00:02:57.850> after<00:02:58.150> the
