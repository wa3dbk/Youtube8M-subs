00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.269
 he has statistics really 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.550
 impressive since the beginning of his 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.570
 quarry alexandre tremblay saw a pretty 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:18.800
 total of 979 points accumulated and this in 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.570
 only 7,127 games including 510 7 goals 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.859
 some believe he's one of 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.740
 best hockey players in the world 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.840
 without having evolved in the pros 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.789
 in America 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.730
 I 'm fine I hit the mark in Switzerland 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.530
 since 2005 I believe so the mothers are 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.749
 another year of contract so I have 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.579
 make consecutive seasons I t 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:39.530
 in Switzerland since that time so I 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.479
 not I have not in full both Russian 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.629
 among the reasons is consistency and 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:46.969
 water so no rediscussing the caliber 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.350
 game of quazar it difficult bar 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.959
 again by a little bit it's the game that 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.860
 is different very very fast I would say 

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:54.930
 that it sells 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.190
 maybe the digital is a little bit 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.690
 little bit less maybe 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.790
 otherwise it is much stronger this full 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.380
 chaos is the big big difference 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.360
 it's really the artist joe delicious 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.730
 are very fast laurent who evolves 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.380
 constantly in Switzerland it becomes more 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.810
 in addition difficult for the players 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.560
 from the outside could well 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.790
 welcomed we will always be well 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 welcomed know this because they have 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.640
 always need it and then it's 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.290
 key players in their team 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.729
 but the difference yes it's a lot 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.740
 more difficult to go back now they 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.290
 are much more demanding they have 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.610
 always been that young back 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.410
 insists a country what a lot of 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.020
 pressure I feel you have just 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.340
 arrived so I do not perform however of 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.230
 what to look forward to see 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.640
 to take someone else but except that 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.540
 his center and the work connection 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.460
 that you do that a Saturday 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.800
 it deals with the right way then are 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.930
 a lot more a country that is reliable 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.729
 it's a karman country who are who 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.990
 respect the contracts for example it's 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.490
 that's not going of course not the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.570
 way they want they will find themselves 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.070
 agreements they'll also be 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.420
 found another team who are they going 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.450
 want to replace you treat quickly 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.680
 yes it's insecure on one side especially 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.479
 in the first years the first 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.070
 month but me personally that he is 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.140
 there since since now it's my 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.979
 tenth season 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.190
 it's a bit like that in the world is 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.240
 ok I mean when we have indeed had to 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.229
 go out are a lot more patient so 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.060
 I can afford to have a 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.290
 sequence of times of three weeks where 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.030
 it's not so good they know it's going to be 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.729
 replace where there is gaza spa on site and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.480
 in general they know what are you 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.940
 can you bring what you have 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.800
 brought in the past been witnesses - 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.050
 risk cadets new joker and social 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.640
 are the francophone joys and 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.380
 joys of quebec ottawa it was really 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.760
 together always or again you 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.540
 incorporate and not with others 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.209
 players team 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.680
 it's a good question did it's 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.820
 still it's a little crazy how that 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.739
 is happening and that there is not much 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.060
 from foreigners but it's true that if one 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.320
 that's why we know each other because we have 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.090
 played when we are not necessarily 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.040
 people who are who are 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.510
 know personally but we play 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.489
 in account at most ended only on the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.680
 ice cream we speak during christmas 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.150
 a lot of Quebecers who 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.680
 either group c 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.810
 I mean we're going to look for a little 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.060
 little our culture us it's true 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.250
 what you're saying is not hunting too 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.360
 joys 4 knew more me me I 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.799
 know what you had against change 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.640
 the others but then it becomes 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.530
 players a little closer to 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.970
 more people when I have then this is 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.010
 a little normal also in this end of this 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.349
 side there too a rocker career 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.439
 is not infinite one must already think of 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.840
 after the 35-year-old athlete already believes in 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.819
 his dish on his return he became 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.670
 co-owner of the circuit training 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.069
 accompanied by florian bianchi all 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.440
 located at mega fitness it made sense 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.879
 for the native bowsprit to stay in 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.620
 the sport 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.060
 I met floria I 'm in tradition 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.440
 since a long time since 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.769
 a few years I met florieye 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.599
 maybe 4h durrer then he approached me 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.609
 to discuss all I loved her 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.720
 vision his drive vision until 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.939
 may but when was I when 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.139
 same row of 31,31 in the time of which 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.209
 I still had the experience adage 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.290
 had lived a lot on that side as 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.239
 I said I love you kippas sign 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.579
 our guy who loves I trained 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.549
 I loved his vision is good 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.889
 heard right away we discussed 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.250
 I start training with 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.250
 training 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.900
 and human it's not credible so 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.730
 really clicked just as we say done 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.349
 it feels it is one made of 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.819
 european circuit training and we can not 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.530
 to speak as a complex space 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.349
 since we 've made some really good ones 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.750
 friends but beyond his nose because 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.849
 are good companions of 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.219
 the 60- minute formula 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.340
 meets the needs of many it's 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:19.039
 endurance and all these beings the city 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.669
 force it will help you if it is and enduring 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.199
 it'll help you 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.460
 you're going to look for a mix of everything 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.590
 same time it lasts an hour stops 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.750
 not it was tired you take a little 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.849
 pause I continue then a given moment 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.560
 who is becoming more and more fit who 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.550
 is doing more and more people 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.470
 even more of which he sees the results 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.880
 super really fast since it is 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.259
 well if it's not everyone as to 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.430
 come to jeans for two to three years 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.320
 is proven that two three hours of 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.240
 james and paul ideal at a given moment 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.490
 the blood intensity here is quite 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.289
 intensity intensity week maximum 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.460
 all the coaches are the pulse of 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.229
 to touch sometimes it's easy to let go 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.120
 we always say that the head value 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.310
 dear winner so we ask them this 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.840
 side there then has it especially the atmosphere 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.220
 is amazing but the music 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.750
 everyone is in a good mood while 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.300
 the world arises me I think it's great 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.039
 camille of coaching involvement 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.680
 helped to perform better and this in a 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.539
 safe supervision 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.699
 I love this game I realized 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.460
 over the years it's a passion 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.590
 the training as I said then I'm 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.930
 do not really do it in a way that 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.979
 I came here I was, I am here 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.419
 to train I'm for us 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.300
 put to the bottom for the record kg season to 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.770
 1 in europe for me it's a holiday 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.030
 with finesse with Lorient that makes 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.430
 pleasure to return the garlic ch gives a 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.159
 helping hand it's really just either 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.750
 union in t2 we exploded package 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.949
 chinese do nothing i love coming here 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.870
 for people we do not write greece 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.539
 then it also gives me the social side 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.550
 that I need then with another 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.680
 contract still valid all options 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.130
 stay on the table for alexander 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.130
 tremblay
