 Today I finish the assembly is at last 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:46.850
 video you can see that we have 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:52.829
 plate was still under construction . 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:55.079
 used in the Japanese tree house and I 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.680
 I made a measurement right? 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:09.479
 you can see the measurement of the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:17.970
 buttons touch 12 beck command buttons six 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:29.970
 buttons for each player is the credit and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:33.420

 good to show you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:47.180
 the lid that we did a tremendous 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:53.670
 video but for ease of maintenance 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:56.130
 of the controls that I left just to 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.890
 controls demonstrate how we 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.890
 can use usb control of the computer 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.270
 the commands of the eletronorte 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.640
 chic 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.050
 I'm going to do a test with this one, right? 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.330
 a tactic that is the buttons of the theme 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.970
 also in this case here i will use 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:23.180
 black and white buttons pro os 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.060
 two of your buttons is for each control 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.880
 white to the player or play 2 with a 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.630
 red to please him 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.730
 huh 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:38.989
 here has good wire to wire to make 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.980
 connection and welding of buttons which 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.760
 more 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.080
 How are the micros going to continue these 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.489
 Micros with china a little bit 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.750
 noisy right 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.390
 I was thinking of trading for miklos. 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.450
 quieter, right? 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.060
 Let's see as long as you have this good 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.170
 here such a simple hla system is with 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.019
 hinge and you feel l used hardware 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.700
 huh 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.360
 this system here opens and closes to 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:17.120
 make it easier to open and 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:25.700
 bay cover lock to install today 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:29.420
 here in china the finish where you go 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.489
 the 19 inch lcd monitor which 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.380
 I had already leaning on him just to 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:39.920
 we test for this first 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:45.370
 machine and here is the park because here 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:49.900
 will see a glass or acrylic and 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:53.030
 LED lighting with LED tapes in 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.329
 aac ago show that it is lateral like 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.329
 stayed 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.750
 the side is that I 'm going to show part 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.489
 rear can bring people to 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:14.739
 showing the previous video 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:22.419
 he's just here we're actually going 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:30.160
 put put a knob will put 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:33.820
 one a pen is the name plus a hardware 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.590
 You're going to pull that name by hand. 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:41.139
 but it's alright 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.130
 actually fitted here this cap 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.870
 rear 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:50.650
 when we get down that pc cover will 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.449
 down with ease and maintenance 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.210
 also that I'm going to show some of the 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:05:00.910
 internal part as it was mounted on everything 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.479
 that it was decided to put the problem of 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.220
 low 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:08.979
 we chose to put the hardware l 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.110
 solidity you have in the assembly to have 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.440
 people who just glue 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.880
 only that the collage does not have the same 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.930
 firmness even the same support that is 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.240
 this neighbor 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.530
 there too how can you see me? 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.530
 put the festival milk 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.289
 another component that is learning to 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.699
 door 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.079
 It would be more or less, this is it. 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.589
 show one more thing that I remembered 

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:45.719
 now because it 's a bit of state 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:49.709
 joseph materials that now all 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:54.059
 mentions to the squad school plate my 

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:57.979
 server rule that is the following people 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:59.429
 chose to do as I said this cap 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:06.149
 would not hide 

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:08.219
 with that opening and I did it's just that 

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:13.289
 fixed part here 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:20.099
 at the same time that she supports it gives 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:22.139
 light finish is closed and she goes 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.669
 support the tam for a reader 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.259
 It is clear that the hardware and 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.009
 plus it will support both the monitor 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.159
 best 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:32.459
 Actually, I thought I'd change that. 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:34.559
 15mm plywood cover 

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:36.539
 I think it's a bit thick I think we 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:39.269
 will exchange this material for 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.769
 acrylic to give better finishing each 

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:43.079
 clinician with that black 

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:45.779
 The staff for the moment is what 

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:48.599
 thank the people who are enjoying 

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:51.400
