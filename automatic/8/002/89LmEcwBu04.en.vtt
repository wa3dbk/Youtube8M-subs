00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:10.250
 The second version of the camper van delivered by Indiana rv 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:17.900
 We introduce the indie 927 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:22.500
 The base uses Nissan's nv 200. 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.880
 The driver's seat and the passenger seat 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.800
 in this way 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.800
 White error leather- like sheet 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.309
 Seat 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.600
 Will be part of 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:49.320
 Then I would like to introduce the space behind 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:57.480
 The back one is a seat of the bench like this 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:01:00.290
 The room was calm-in a white sheet of white color 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.290
 Wood's 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.780
 Such a combination of real and lower 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:17.280
 We now have 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:22.690
 This bench seat is an excellent one that can expand the bed with one touch 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.830
 If you can see the operating status at the exhibition hall 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.730
 I think it is interesting 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.740
 It's like this is a refrigerator 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.960
 Pop-up 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:42.200
 It has become a roof and above is like this 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.190
 I write big Now I can make space for hoping up Ueno Osamu 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.150
 On three sides 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.150
 The screen door can be hung like this 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.320
 Of development 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.729
 The concept is 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.880
 Adult 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.259
 Luxury soulful 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.259
 With a concept like saying 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.060
 I did production 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.060
 I would like to see it by all means
