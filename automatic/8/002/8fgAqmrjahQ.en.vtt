redstone signal turning on this one and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.430 
redstone signal turning on this one and
passing<00:00:50.190> things<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:51.690> particular<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.289> is

passing things on this particular one is
set<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> cold<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.309> way<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> could<00:00:53.940> put<00:00:54.090> coal

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
set to cold so that way I could put coal

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.420 
set to cold so that way I could put coal
orch<00:00:54.780> or<00:00:55.399> ore<00:00:56.399> into<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.629> chest<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.469> too<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
orch or ore into this chest here too and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.970 
orch or ore into this chest here too and
it<00:00:59.640> will<00:00:59.820> distribute<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.539> accordingly<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.859> it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it will distribute it accordingly and it

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
it will distribute it accordingly and it
just<00:01:02.160> passes<00:01:02.370> around<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> big<00:01:03.239> ole<00:01:03.449> loop<00:01:03.719> in

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
just passes around in a big ole loop in

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
just passes around in a big ole loop in
whenever<00:01:04.229> there's<00:01:04.589> space<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.369> them<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
whenever there's space in one of them it

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.940 
whenever there's space in one of them it
will<00:01:06.090> send<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.540> through<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.590> coal<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
will send it through and the coal is

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.429 
will send it through and the coal is
doing<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> same<00:01:08.580> thing<00:01:09.030> again<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.409> is

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
doing the same thing again this one is

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.750 
doing the same thing again this one is
just<00:01:10.890> dumb<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:12.090> was<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.760> seeing

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
just dumb and it was just kind of seeing

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.690 
just dumb and it was just kind of seeing
why<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.659> things<00:01:15.960> now

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
why I can do with these things now

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.670 
why I can do with these things now
moving<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.119> some<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> interesting

tanks it will not pass in the chain like
they<00:02:08.630> do<00:02:08.780> with<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.410> BuildCraft<00:02:09.920> tanks<00:02:10.750> it

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
they do with the BuildCraft tanks it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.080 
they do with the BuildCraft tanks it
just<00:02:11.990> passes<00:02:12.230> off<00:02:12.560> into<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.220> one<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:16.090> be

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
just passes off into that one so be

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.030 
just passes off into that one so be
careful<00:02:17.660> when<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.960> comes<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.380> running<00:02:18.590> pipes

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
careful when it comes to running pipes

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.060 
careful when it comes to running pipes
alongside<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.970> because<00:02:20.240> then<00:02:21.140> you're<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:23.810> your

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
alongside it because then you're in your

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.830 
alongside it because then you're in your
liquid<00:02:25.070> whatever<00:02:25.490> will<00:02:25.940> get<00:02:26.120> stuck<00:02:26.570> in<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
liquid whatever will get stuck in the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.010 
liquid whatever will get stuck in the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
walls of your smeltery I have not found

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.070 
walls of your smeltery I have not found
any<00:02:30.350> way<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.620> get<00:02:31.430> deeper<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:34.450> have<00:02:35.450> not<00:02:35.690> found

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
any way to get deeper I have not found

any way to get deeper I have not found
any<00:02:36.530> way<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.300> feed<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:39.490> liquid<00:02:40.490> directly<00:02:40.730> into

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
any way to feed the liquid directly into

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.180 
any way to feed the liquid directly into
the<00:02:41.390> tank<00:02:41.630> just<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.380> walls<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.920> tank

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
the tank just the walls of the tank

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.050 
the tank just the walls of the tank
which<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.640> does<00:02:43.850> nobody<00:02:44.300> any<00:02:44.750> good<00:02:44.900> over<00:02:45.380> there

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
which it does nobody any good over there

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.449 
which it does nobody any good over there
now<00:02:47.060> over<00:02:47.750> here<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.110> found<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.830> can<00:02:49.010> feed

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
now over here I found that you can feed

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.510 
now over here I found that you can feed
the<00:02:49.910> gold<00:02:50.420> or<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.380> liquid<00:02:51.560> metal<00:02:51.860> into<00:02:52.490> a

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
the gold or the liquid metal into a

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.790 
the gold or the liquid metal into a
casting<00:02:53.450> basin<00:02:53.959> using<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:56.320> using<00:02:57.320> liquid

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
casting basin using a using liquid

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.210 
casting basin using a using liquid
doctrine<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:58.700> way<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:58.970> can<00:02:59.269> auto<00:03:00.230> smelt

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
doctrine so this way you can auto smelt

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.910 
doctrine so this way you can auto smelt
your<00:03:01.880> block<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.810> also<00:03:02.959> feed<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.560> in<00:03:03.709> there

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
your block we also feed it in there

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.970 
your block we also feed it in there
using<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:07.000> liquid<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.209> translocator<00:03:09.200> there

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
using the liquid and translocator there

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.550 
using the liquid and translocator there
to<00:03:11.080> major<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:16.060> gold<00:03:17.060> going<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.690> are<00:03:18.019> your<00:03:18.230> gold

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
to major the gold going in are your gold

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.670 
to major the gold going in are your gold
going<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.400> way<00:03:19.610> as<00:03:19.790> well<00:03:20.470> or<00:03:21.470> whatever

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
going in that way as well or whatever

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.470 
going in that way as well or whatever
metal<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:22.580> you're<00:03:22.730> doing<00:03:22.940> at<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.330> moment

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
metal that you're doing at the moment

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.500 
metal that you're doing at the moment
now<00:03:24.410> this<00:03:24.830> is<00:03:25.040> where<00:03:25.220> it's<00:03:25.580> interesting<00:03:26.000> for

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
now this is where it's interesting for

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.540 
now this is where it's interesting for
mask<00:03:26.989> ass<00:03:27.680> use<00:03:28.130> on<00:03:28.459> here<00:03:28.790> what<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.510> discovered

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
mask ass use on here what I discovered

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.000 
mask ass use on here what I discovered
go<00:03:31.550> ahead

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
go ahead

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.210 
go ahead
so<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.040> miss<00:03:34.280> out<00:03:34.490> into<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.800> dope<00:03:36.800> going<00:03:37.040> there

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
so I miss out into the dope going there

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
so I miss out into the dope going there
in<00:03:38.120> true<00:03:38.390> here<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:40.040> when<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:40.460> discovered<00:03:41.060> is

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
in true here and when I discovered is

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.190 
in true here and when I discovered is
that<00:03:41.630> by<00:03:42.050> chaining<00:03:42.920> them<00:03:43.070> together<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:44.200> create

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
that by chaining them together I create

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.380 
that by chaining them together I create
a<00:03:45.230> little<00:03:45.590> system<00:03:46.100> here<00:03:46.400> with<00:03:46.640> an<00:03:46.850> overflow

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
a little system here with an overflow

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.840 
a little system here with an overflow
and<00:03:48.050> what<00:03:48.260> happens<00:03:48.740> is<00:03:49.010> with<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.490> liquid

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
and what happens is with the liquid

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.890 
and what happens is with the liquid
basins<00:03:50.390> is<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:51.140> they<00:03:51.350> chain<00:03:51.650> down<00:03:51.920> and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
basins is that they chain down and

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.780 
basins is that they chain down and
they'll<00:03:53.900> first<00:03:54.230> fill<00:03:54.590> up<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:54.980> overflow<00:03:55.310> pipe

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
they'll first fill up the overflow pipe

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.810 
they'll first fill up the overflow pipe
and<00:03:56.390> once<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.230> overflow<00:03:57.860> pipe<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.400> filled<00:03:58.640> up

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
and once the overflow pipe is filled up

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.880 
and once the overflow pipe is filled up
it<00:03:58.970> all<00:03:59.120> comes<00:03:59.420> down<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.020> sand<00:04:00.290> one<00:04:00.560> here

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
it all comes down to the sand one here

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.770 
it all comes down to the sand one here
they<00:04:01.880> will<00:04:02.090> start<00:04:02.420> making<00:04:02.780> gold<00:04:03.050> blocks<00:04:03.730> then

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
they will start making gold blocks then

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.449 
they will start making gold blocks then
it<00:04:05.780> will<00:04:06.220> come<00:04:07.220> down<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:08.740> into<00:04:09.740> the<00:04:09.770> hoppers

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
it will come down and into the hoppers

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.640 
it will come down and into the hoppers
underneath<00:04:10.970> into<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.600> chest<00:04:11.870> as<00:04:12.050> in<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.410> back

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
underneath into the chest as in the back

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.550 
underneath into the chest as in the back
now<00:04:13.640> I<00:04:13.670> set<00:04:14.120> up<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.360> liquid<00:04:14.750> translocator

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
now I set up a liquid translocator

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.210 
now I set up a liquid translocator
connecting<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.370> casting<00:04:16.910> Basin<00:04:17.450> to<00:04:18.109> a

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
connecting the casting Basin to a

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.790 
connecting the casting Basin to a
casting<00:04:19.220> table<00:04:19.840> with<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:21.170> ingot<00:04:23.470> inside<00:04:24.470> there

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
casting table with a ingot inside there

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.870 
casting table with a ingot inside there
and<00:04:25.210> now<00:04:26.210> what's<00:04:26.540> happening<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:28.490> side<00:04:28.700> is

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
and now what's happening on this side is

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.240 
and now what's happening on this side is
the<00:04:28.940> same<00:04:29.360> exact<00:04:29.810> same<00:04:29.840> except<00:04:30.710> all<00:04:30.919> these<00:04:31.100> are

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
the same exact same except all these are

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.770 
the same exact same except all these are
set<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:31.610> ingots<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.180> this<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:32.390> all<00:04:32.570> going<00:04:32.720> to

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
set to ingots and this is all going to

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.710 
set to ingots and this is all going to
make<00:04:32.900> ingots<00:04:33.380> now<00:04:34.340> but<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:35.120> big<00:04:35.300> difference

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
make ingots now but the big difference

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.530 
make ingots now but the big difference
between<00:04:36.280> what's<00:04:37.280> going<00:04:37.490> on<00:04:37.730> here<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.120> when<00:04:38.360> you

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
between what's going on here is when you

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.630 
between what's going on here is when you
run<00:04:39.169> out<00:04:41.169> whatever<00:04:42.169> liquid<00:04:42.500> metal<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.310> you

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
run out whatever liquid metal that you

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.120 
run out whatever liquid metal that you
are<00:04:43.910> using<00:04:44.510> in<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.960> smeltery<00:04:45.470> at<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.770> moment

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
are using in the smeltery at the moment

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.780 
are using in the smeltery at the moment
it's<00:04:46.850> going<00:04:47.390> to<00:04:47.600> all<00:04:47.870> feed<00:04:48.200> down<00:04:48.470> into<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.610> end

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
it's going to all feed down into the end

run for smelting metals again I've just

problem<00:05:29.870> I<00:05:29.960> did<00:05:30.320> find<00:05:30.830> with<00:05:31.160> it<00:05:31.400> is<00:05:31.760> that

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
problem I did find with it is that

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.590 
problem I did find with it is that
you're<00:05:32.990> going<00:05:33.380> to<00:05:33.610> encounter<00:05:34.610> an<00:05:34.940> issue<00:05:35.210> if

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
you're going to encounter an issue if

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.510 
you're going to encounter an issue if
you<00:05:35.810> start<00:05:36.230> running

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
you start running

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.300 
you start running
if<00:05:39.060> you<00:05:39.240> start<00:05:39.569> running<00:05:40.350> different<00:05:40.919> types<00:05:41.130> of

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
if you start running different types of

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.200 
if you start running different types of
metals<00:05:41.669> through<00:05:41.910> a<00:05:41.970> single<00:05:42.389> smeltery<00:05:44.210> because

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
metals through a single smeltery because

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.390 
metals through a single smeltery because
when<00:05:45.419> that<00:05:45.569> happens<00:05:46.110> you

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
when that happens you

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.120 
when that happens you
hit<00:05:48.000> a<00:05:48.030> snag<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.350> you'll<00:05:49.949> no<00:05:50.280> longer<00:05:50.310> have

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
hit a snag and you'll no longer have

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.850 
hit a snag and you'll no longer have
an<00:05:52.520> overflow<00:05:52.970> system<00:05:53.720> because<00:05:54.290> the<00:05:54.530> rest<00:05:54.740> of

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
an overflow system because the rest of

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
an overflow system because the rest of
them<00:05:55.010> are<00:05:55.190> going<00:05:55.310> to<00:05:55.370> be<00:05:55.460> stuck<00:05:55.850> with

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
them are going to be stuck with

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.000 
them are going to be stuck with
whatever's<00:05:56.480> in<00:05:56.660> there<00:05:56.870> and<00:05:57.170> then<00:05:57.530> one's<00:05:57.770> gonna

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
whatever's in there and then one's gonna

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.800 
whatever's in there and then one's gonna
suck<00:05:58.400> be<00:05:58.610> stuck<00:05:58.880> with<00:05:59.060> a<00:05:59.180> different<00:05:59.510> metal

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
suck be stuck with a different metal

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.650 
suck be stuck with a different metal
planet<00:06:00.110> so<00:06:00.920> either<00:06:01.790> you'll<00:06:02.120> have<00:06:02.360> to<00:06:02.510> run

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
planet so either you'll have to run

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.600 
planet so either you'll have to run
separate<00:06:03.500> smelter<00:06:04.010> ease<00:06:04.160> or<00:06:04.690> pipe<00:06:05.690> out<00:06:05.930> the

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
separate smelter ease or pipe out the

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.730 
separate smelter ease or pipe out the
last<00:06:07.610> of<00:06:07.970> whatever<00:06:08.420> remaining<00:06:08.840> stuff<00:06:09.320> is<00:06:09.560> in

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
last of whatever remaining stuff is in

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.470 
last of whatever remaining stuff is in
here<00:06:10.130> to<00:06:10.430> a<00:06:10.790> separate<00:06:11.860> tank<00:06:12.860> to<00:06:13.520> get<00:06:14.000> to<00:06:14.150> later

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
here to a separate tank to get to later

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.240 
here to a separate tank to get to later
maybe<00:06:14.750> a<00:06:14.870> portable<00:06:15.410> tank<00:06:15.620> or<00:06:15.860> something<00:06:16.040> like

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
maybe a portable tank or something like

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.540 
maybe a portable tank or something like
that

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
that

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.150 
that
but<00:06:17.180> anyway<00:06:17.420> so<00:06:17.450> I'm<00:06:18.020> sure<00:06:18.230> somebody<00:06:18.710> come<00:06:19.040> up

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
but anyway so I'm sure somebody come up

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.640 
but anyway so I'm sure somebody come up
with<00:06:19.310> something<00:06:19.670> a<00:06:19.700> little<00:06:19.850> more<00:06:20.650> elegant

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
with something a little more elegant

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.310 
with something a little more elegant
than<00:06:22.070> what<00:06:22.520> I<00:06:22.550> did<00:06:22.670> on<00:06:23.060> here<00:06:23.360> but<00:06:23.540> this<00:06:23.720> is<00:06:23.930> just

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
than what I did on here but this is just

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.200 
than what I did on here but this is just
an<00:06:24.440> idea<00:06:24.560> I<00:06:24.800> haven't<00:06:25.130> seen<00:06:25.370> anyone<00:06:25.820> really

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
an idea I haven't seen anyone really

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.300 
an idea I haven't seen anyone really
engage<00:06:26.600> in<00:06:26.630> so<00:06:27.380> maybes

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
engage in so maybes

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.660 
engage in so maybes
inspire<00:06:29.000> somebody<00:06:29.360> on<00:06:29.780> there<00:06:30.110> to<00:06:30.470> see<00:06:31.430> what

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
inspire somebody on there to see what

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.010 
inspire somebody on there to see what
you<00:06:31.880> could<00:06:32.060> really<00:06:32.420> push<00:06:33.170> out<00:06:33.410> with<00:06:33.770> this

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
you could really push out with this

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.890 
you could really push out with this
hopefully<00:06:36.020> you<00:06:36.230> all<00:06:36.350> enjoyed<00:06:36.770> this<00:06:37.720> if<00:06:38.720> you

hopefully you all enjoyed this if you

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.680 
hopefully you all enjoyed this if you
