that hair curled I'm going to go ahead

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.830 
that hair curled I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:16.619> put<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.130> onto<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.580> very<00:01:17.850> large<00:01:18.299> velcro

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and put it onto a very large velcro

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.469 
and put it onto a very large velcro
roller<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.979> does<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.700> extends<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
roller what that does is it extends the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.899 
roller what that does is it extends the
size<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> curl<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.799> much<00:01:22.950> looser<00:01:23.430> but

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
size of the curl to be much looser but

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.730 
size of the curl to be much looser but
it<00:01:24.000> also<00:01:24.210> helps<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> curl<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> set<00:01:25.290> better<00:01:25.500> so

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
it also helps the curl to set better so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
it also helps the curl to set better so
that<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.979> lasts<00:01:26.549> longer<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.270> bouncy<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that it lasts longer and it's bouncy and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.530 
that it lasts longer and it's bouncy and
looks<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.200> little<00:01:28.290> bit<00:01:28.530> better<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> really

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
looks a little bit better so I really

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.700 
looks a little bit better so I really
recommend<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.439> good<00:01:31.530> way<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
recommend that and it's a good way to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.260 
recommend that and it's a good way to
cheat<00:01:32.009> having<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.460> bigger<00:01:32.670> iron<00:01:33.030> than<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
cheat having a bigger iron than you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.120 
cheat having a bigger iron than you
actually<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.170> own<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.619> size<00:01:34.829> iron

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
actually do so you can own one size iron

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.530 
actually do so you can own one size iron
but<00:01:35.280> make<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> lot<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> different<00:01:36.060> size<00:01:36.210> curls

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
but make a lot of different size curls

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.450 
but make a lot of different size curls
so<00:01:37.320> basically<00:01:37.619> what<00:01:37.799> I'm<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.070> do<00:01:38.220> is

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so basically what I'm going to do is

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.249 
so basically what I'm going to do is
separate<00:01:38.909> my<00:01:39.030> hair<00:01:39.270> from<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> ears<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
separate my hair from the ears up and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.780 
separate my hair from the ears up and
curl<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.680> hair<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> bottom<00:01:41.369> away

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
curl all the hair on the bottom away

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.850 
curl all the hair on the bottom away
from<00:01:41.970> my<00:01:42.060> face<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:43.110> curl<00:01:43.380> all<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> hair

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
from my face and then curl all the hair

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.069 
from my face and then curl all the hair
on<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> top<00:01:44.100> away<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:44.850> face<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.810> just

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
on the top away from my face and I just

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.230 
on the top away from my face and I just
use<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.220> two<00:01:47.250> curls<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:47.909> each<00:01:48.030> section

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
use on one or two curls for each section

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.310 
use on one or two curls for each section
because<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.600> hair<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.899> little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.170> more

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
because my hair is a little bit more

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.920 
because my hair is a little bit more
fine<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.220> always<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.579> more<00:01:50.850> curls<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
fine we can always do more curls if you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.600 
fine we can always do more curls if you
need<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.590> then<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.159> went<00:01:53.310> ahead<00:01:53.369> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
need to and then I went ahead and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.410 
need to and then I went ahead and
repeated<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.060> same

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
repeated the same

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.660 
repeated the same
on<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.810> other<00:01:54.900> side<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.500> curled<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.310> one

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
on the other side I curled that one

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
on the other side I curled that one
piece<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.150> kind<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.390> frames<00:01:57.600> my<00:01:57.810> face<00:01:57.840> and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
piece that kind of frames my face and

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.780 
piece that kind of frames my face and
then<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.860> went<00:01:58.979> ahead<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.340> did<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.580> ones

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
then I went ahead and did the ones

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.999 
then I went ahead and did the ones
beneath<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.630> ears<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.080> then<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.409> ones<00:02:01.590> over

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
beneath my ears and then the ones over

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.889 
beneath my ears and then the ones over
my<00:02:02.130> ears<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.299> suction<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.689> hair

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
my ears and I like to suction the hair

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.330 
my ears and I like to suction the hair
like<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.080> just<00:02:04.439> because<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.830> helps<00:02:04.920> me<00:02:05.189> to

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
like that just because it helps me to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.520 
like that just because it helps me to
get<00:02:05.490> every<00:02:06.240> single<00:02:06.540> piece<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.689> hair<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.170> tend<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
get every single piece of hair I tend to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.900 
get every single piece of hair I tend to
kind<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.860> forget<00:02:08.190> something<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.880> don't

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
kind of forget something if I don't

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.910 
kind of forget something if I don't
suction<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.050> sectioning<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.709> makes

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
suction it so sectioning it just makes

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.590 
suction it so sectioning it just makes
it<00:02:11.069> neater<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> little<00:02:11.819> bit<00:02:11.910> easier<00:02:12.360> and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
it neater and a little bit easier and

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.390 
it neater and a little bit easier and
then<00:02:12.660> at<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.470> back<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.680> had<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> little<00:02:14.190> bit<00:02:14.370> of

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
then at the back I had a little bit of

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.830 
then at the back I had a little bit of
hair<00:02:14.610> left<00:02:14.760> over<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.360> went<00:02:15.540> ahead<00:02:15.600> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
hair left over so I went ahead and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.330 
hair left over so I went ahead and
curled<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.170> straight<00:02:16.440> down<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:16.980> made<00:02:17.160> kind

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
curled it straight down so I made kind

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.460 
curled it straight down so I made kind
of<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.489> bump<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.970> shape<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.450> added<00:02:18.989> some<00:02:19.170> volume

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
of a bump to shape and added some volume

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.350 
of a bump to shape and added some volume
to<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> top<00:02:19.739> for<00:02:20.190> me<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.000> kind<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.209> do

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
to the top for me you can kind of do

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.670 
to the top for me you can kind of do
whatever<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.840> want<00:02:22.019> with<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.290> one<00:02:22.440> just

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
whatever you want with that one just

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.309 
whatever you want with that one just
depending<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.700> how<00:02:24.030> much<00:02:24.180> hair<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.510> have<00:02:24.690> and

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
depending on how much hair you have and

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.420 
depending on how much hair you have and
then<00:02:25.440> basically<00:02:25.769> you're<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.010> going<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.250> wait

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
then basically you're just going to wait

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.009 
then basically you're just going to wait
for<00:02:26.459> your<00:02:26.730> hair<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.060> cool<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.569> make<00:02:27.750> sure<00:02:27.780> that

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
for your hair to cool and make sure that

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.840 
for your hair to cool and make sure that
once<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:28.319> completely<00:02:28.709> cooled<00:02:29.069> then<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.730> can

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
once it's completely cooled then you can

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.809 
once it's completely cooled then you can
go<00:02:29.970> ahead<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.330> take<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.720> down<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.549> then<00:02:32.549> once

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
go ahead and take it down and then once

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.309 
go ahead and take it down and then once
it's<00:02:33.000> down<00:02:33.269> you're<00:02:33.540> pretty<00:02:33.780> much<00:02:33.959> done<00:02:34.200> you

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
it's down you're pretty much done you

it's down you're pretty much done you
can<00:02:34.470> add<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> little<00:02:34.799> bit<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:34.980> hairspray<00:02:35.160> to

can add a little bit of hairspray to

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.130 
can add a little bit of hairspray to
make<00:02:35.640> sure<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:35.880> going<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.090> last<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.569> then

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
make sure it's going to last and then

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.520 
make sure it's going to last and then
