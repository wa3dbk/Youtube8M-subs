lower ride height gets you a little

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.690 
lower ride height gets you a little
lower<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.929> the<00:01:20.049> ground<00:01:20.319> so<00:01:20.709> pushing<00:01:20.979> is<00:01:21.249> easier

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
lower to the ground so pushing is easier

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.819 
lower to the ground so pushing is easier
it's<00:01:21.909> going<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.090> make<00:01:22.209> it<00:01:22.329> more<00:01:22.479> stable<00:01:22.840> again

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
it's going to make it more stable again

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.770 
it's going to make it more stable again
so<00:01:24.310> it's<00:01:24.429> gonna<00:01:24.520> be<00:01:24.639> a<00:01:24.670> little<00:01:24.819> less<00:01:25.090> tiring

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
so it's gonna be a little less tiring

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.249 
so it's gonna be a little less tiring
for<00:01:26.409> pushing<00:01:26.920> around<00:01:27.039> town<00:01:27.579> it<00:01:28.359> has<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.780> going
