00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
other than the fact that because they're

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.399 
other than the fact that because they're
called<00:01:47.240> collectibles<00:01:47.810> but<00:01:47.960> also<00:01:48.139> because

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
called collectibles but also because

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.319

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
missions so its pretty important

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.940 
missions so its pretty important
actually<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:53.090> almost<00:01:53.780> think<00:01:53.959> it'd<00:01:54.139> be<00:01:54.259> wise<00:01:54.619> to

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
actually I almost think it'd be wise to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.379 
actually I almost think it'd be wise to
just<00:01:54.979> purchase<00:01:55.310> an<00:01:55.579> Intel<00:01:55.880> pack<00:01:56.090> every

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
just purchase an Intel pack every

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:57.639 
just purchase an Intel pack every
mission<00:01:56.689> because<00:01:56.899> you'll<00:01:57.020> probably<00:01:57.200> get<00:01:57.439> back

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
mission because you'll probably get back

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.399 
mission because you'll probably get back
at<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.310> very<00:01:58.429> least<00:01:58.639> which<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.030> spent<00:01:59.409> now

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
upcoming mission there that much

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.730 
upcoming mission there that much
stronger<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.750> if<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.110> make<00:02:43.410> your<00:02:43.590> way<00:02:43.620> through

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
casualties then you'll have these

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.310 
casualties then you'll have these
characters<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.570> are<00:02:51.720> much<00:02:51.840> stronger<00:02:52.110> than

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
characters that are much stronger than

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.710 
characters that are much stronger than
they<00:02:52.530> could<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.920> otherwise<00:02:53.360> because<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> fact

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
they could be otherwise because the fact

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.390 
they could be otherwise because the fact
that<00:02:54.870> they've<00:02:55.230> consistently<00:02:55.710> been<00:02:56.100> leveling

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
advantage or it can be used to a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.310 
advantage or it can be used to a
disadvantage<00:03:11.910> because<00:03:12.180> OCAD<00:03:12.750> skating<00:03:13.110> plus
