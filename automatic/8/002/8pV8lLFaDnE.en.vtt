point out between the Otonashi and the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.080 
point out between the Otonashi and the
hey-ho<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> fact<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.920> down<00:01:50.820> here<00:01:50.970> low

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
hey-ho is the fact that down here low

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
hey-ho is the fact that down here low
blade<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.659> flat<00:01:51.960> bit<00:01:52.229> right<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
blade see this flat bit right here you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.469 
blade see this flat bit right here you
see<00:01:53.399> they're<00:01:53.549> pretty<00:01:53.909> much<00:01:54.090> exactly

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
see they're pretty much exactly

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.719 
see they're pretty much exactly
identical<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.380> terms<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> length<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.250> both<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
identical in terms of length on both the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.700 
identical in terms of length on both the
knives<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.719> main<00:01:57.930> difference<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.320> course<00:01:58.469> is

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
knives the main difference of course is

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.870 
knives the main difference of course is
the<00:01:59.310> upswept

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
the upswept

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.240 
the upswept
edge<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.390> he's<00:02:00.570> tell<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.170> Otonashi<00:02:01.890> has

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
edge and he's tell that the Otonashi has

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.670 
edge and he's tell that the Otonashi has
this<00:02:02.430> extremely<00:02:03.329> elongated<00:02:03.719> upswept<00:02:04.469> edge

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
this extremely elongated upswept edge

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.880 
this extremely elongated upswept edge
now<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:06.210> knife<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.810> pretty<00:02:07.500> much<00:02:07.560> designed

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
now this knife is pretty much designed

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.589 
now this knife is pretty much designed
for<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.429> purpose<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.940> that's<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.360> stabbing

for one purpose and that's for stabbing
and<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:10.979> tell<00:02:11.160> by<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:12.209> slim<00:02:12.480> profile

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
and you can tell by the the slim profile

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.699 
and you can tell by the the slim profile
and<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
or the locking side is as well so I'm

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.979 
or the locking side is as well so I'm
gonna<00:02:46.319> miss<00:02:46.560> aluminum<00:02:47.299> you<00:02:48.299> do<00:02:48.419> do<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:48.959> a

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
gonna miss aluminum you do do have a

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.349 
gonna miss aluminum you do do have a
little<00:02:49.200> bit<00:02:49.319> of<00:02:49.349> chipping<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.639> top<00:02:50.819> now

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
little bit of chipping on the top now

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.970 
little bit of chipping on the top now
also<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.750> jimping<00:02:52.079> on<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.200> g10<00:02:52.500> side<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.799> way

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
also the jimping on the g10 side is way

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.379 
also the jimping on the g10 side is way
better<00:02:53.189> than<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.639> chipping<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> locking

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
better than the chipping on the locking

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.559 
better than the chipping on the locking
side<00:02:55.189> adjustable<00:02:56.189> pivot<00:02:56.370> screw<00:02:56.579> as<00:02:57.329> well<00:02:57.510> as

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
side adjustable pivot screw as well as

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.479 
side adjustable pivot screw as well as
the<00:02:57.629> generous<00:02:58.049> cut<00:02:58.290> out<00:02:58.409> for<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.799> fundus<00:02:59.189> here

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
the generous cut out for the fundus here

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.959 
the generous cut out for the fundus here
so<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.209> completely<00:03:00.419> ambidextrous<00:03:01.969> going

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
so it is completely ambidextrous going

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:04.670 
so it is completely ambidextrous going
on<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.329> reverse<00:03:03.870> side<00:03:04.049> this<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.409> lock

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
on to the reverse side this is the lock

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.750 
on to the reverse side this is the lock
side<00:03:04.919> you<00:03:05.909> also<00:03:06.060> notice<00:03:06.389> if<00:03:06.480> there's<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:06.719> locks

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
side you also notice if there's a locks

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.670 
side you also notice if there's a locks
feature<00:03:08.760> on<00:03:09.030> here<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:10.200> know<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:10.530> there's

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
feature on here and you know so there's

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.619 
feature on here and you know so there's
on<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:11.040> hey-ho<00:03:11.489> as<00:03:11.639> well<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.120> as<00:03:12.299> well<00:03:12.450> as<00:03:12.540> the

on the hey-ho as well and as well as the

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.559 
on the hey-ho as well and as well as the
hissatsu<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:14.519> lock<00:03:14.760> system<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.299> actually

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
hissatsu the lock system is actually

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.899 
hissatsu the lock system is actually
exposed<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.379> see<00:03:16.530> here<00:03:16.769> also<00:03:17.760> has<00:03:17.849> this

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
exposed I can see here also has this

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.050 
exposed I can see here also has this
nice<00:03:18.090> round<00:03:18.359> washer<00:03:19.159> which<00:03:20.159> is<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.400> pivot<00:03:20.609> but

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
nice round washer which is the pivot but

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.110 
nice round washer which is the pivot but
also<00:03:21.180> doubles<00:03:21.599> as<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.229> lock<00:03:23.010> bar<00:03:23.220> stop<00:03:23.519> very

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
also doubles as the lock bar stop very

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.610 
also doubles as the lock bar stop very

material<00:05:08.970> and<00:05:09.150> it<00:05:09.420> is<00:05:09.570> a<00:05:09.600> fully<00:05:10.050> ambidextrous

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
material and it is a fully ambidextrous

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.890 
material and it is a fully ambidextrous
and<00:05:11.360> very<00:05:12.360> easy<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:13.020> deploy<00:05:13.670> and<00:05:14.670> for<00:05:15.600> righties

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
and very easy to deploy and for righties

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.030 
and very easy to deploy and for righties
and<00:05:16.020> lefties<00:05:17.240> now<00:05:18.240> one<00:05:18.480> thing<00:05:18.660> to<00:05:18.720> note<00:05:18.840> on<00:05:19.350> the

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
and lefties now one thing to note on the

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.230 
and lefties now one thing to note on the
back<00:05:20.220> here<00:05:20.460> you<00:05:20.550> notice<00:05:20.790> that<00:05:20.850> the<00:05:20.970> lock

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
back here you notice that the lock

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.900 
back here you notice that the lock
system<00:05:21.510> is<00:05:21.750> actually<00:05:22.050> exposed<00:05:22.470> and<00:05:22.920> for<00:05:23.730> some

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
system is actually exposed and for some

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.360 
system is actually exposed and for some
reason<00:05:24.270> maybe<00:05:24.720> it's<00:05:24.900> just<00:05:24.990> me<00:05:25.230> but<00:05:25.530> when<00:05:26.130> I<00:05:26.220> go

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
reason maybe it's just me but when I go

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.760 
reason maybe it's just me but when I go
to<00:05:26.430> disengage<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.420> locking<00:05:27.630> bar<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.590> see

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
to disengage the locking bar you see

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.380 
to disengage the locking bar you see
where<00:05:28.920> my<00:05:28.950> middle<00:05:29.310> finger<00:05:29.610> falls<00:05:29.880> because<00:05:30.210> I

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
where my middle finger falls because I

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.390 
where my middle finger falls because I
need<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.780> my<00:05:31.410> index<00:05:31.770> finger<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.100> push<00:05:32.250> the

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
need the my index finger to push the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.890 
need the my index finger to push the
blade<00:05:32.580> back<00:05:32.760> and<00:05:33.090> then<00:05:33.240> my<00:05:33.360> middle<00:05:33.630> finger

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
blade back and then my middle finger

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.120 
blade back and then my middle finger
falls<00:05:34.110> right<00:05:34.290> here<00:05:34.530> what<00:05:34.680> happens<00:05:35.010> when<00:05:35.100> I

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
falls right here what happens when I

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.390 
falls right here what happens when I
push<00:05:35.340> against<00:05:35.730> it<00:05:35.820> I<00:05:36.000> can<00:05:36.420> fully<00:05:36.570> feel<00:05:37.400> this

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
push against it I can fully feel this

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.220 
push against it I can fully feel this
round<00:05:38.790> bit<00:05:39.060> here<00:05:39.270> that<00:05:39.300> it's<00:05:39.780> actually<00:05:40.050> quite

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
round bit here that it's actually quite

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.570 
round bit here that it's actually quite
sharp<00:05:40.530> because<00:05:40.770> pushing<00:05:41.130> right<00:05:41.280> into<00:05:41.490> my

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
sharp because pushing right into my

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.930 
sharp because pushing right into my
middle<00:05:41.850> finger<00:05:42.150> so<00:05:42.840> other<00:05:43.350> than<00:05:43.410> that<00:05:43.730> it's<00:05:44.730> a

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
middle finger so other than that it's a

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.020 
middle finger so other than that it's a
very<00:05:45.270> smooth<00:05:45.540> knife<00:05:45.750> and<00:05:46.110> it<00:05:46.980> locks<00:05:47.550> up<00:05:47.730> really

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
very smooth knife and it locks up really

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.640 
very smooth knife and it locks up really
really<00:05:48.180> tight<00:05:48.480> there's<00:05:48.720> like<00:05:48.840> no<00:05:49.050> blade<00:05:49.410> play

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
really tight there's like no blade play

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.250 
really tight there's like no blade play
on<00:05:49.800> this<00:05:49.920> one<00:05:50.240> whatsoever<00:05:51.240> now<00:05:51.840> in<00:05:51.960> terms<00:05:52.140> of

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.600 
on this one whatsoever now in terms of
ergonomics<00:05:52.410> this<00:05:52.950> is<00:05:53.100> pretty<00:05:53.340> much<00:05:53.430> exactly

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
ergonomics this is pretty much exactly

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.310

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
comfortable I do feel like I could like

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.110 
comfortable I do feel like I could like
slip<00:06:01.170> up<00:06:01.320> on<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:01.920> blade<00:06:02.190> if<00:06:02.490> I<00:06:02.670> was<00:06:02.790> a<00:06:02.820> stab

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
slip up on to the blade if I was a stab

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.000 
slip up on to the blade if I was a stab
into<00:06:03.300> something<00:06:03.690> hard<00:06:03.960> or<00:06:04.500> meet<00:06:04.710> with<00:06:04.740> more

resistance<00:06:05.520> I<00:06:05.640> mean<00:06:05.760> there<00:06:05.880> really<00:06:05.910> isn't

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
resistance I mean there really isn't

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.240 
resistance I mean there really isn't
much<00:06:06.360> holding<00:06:06.900> me<00:06:07.080> in<00:06:07.440> here

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
much holding me in here

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.920 
much holding me in here
the<00:06:08.580> the<00:06:08.940> locking<00:06:09.270> bar<00:06:09.390> does<00:06:09.570> have<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.750> little

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
the the locking bar does have a little

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.720 
the the locking bar does have a little
bit<00:06:10.050> jimping<00:06:10.350> on<00:06:10.440> there<00:06:10.650> but<00:06:10.830> I<00:06:11.070> don't<00:06:11.580> think

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
bit jimping on there but I don't think

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.220 
bit jimping on there but I don't think
it's<00:06:11.820> gonna<00:06:11.940> do<00:06:12.120> too<00:06:12.300> much<00:06:12.450> to<00:06:12.690> hold<00:06:12.840> my<00:06:12.960> finger

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
it's gonna do too much to hold my finger

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.620 
it's gonna do too much to hold my finger
on<00:06:13.380> here<00:06:13.590> so<00:06:13.860> but<00:06:14.670> other<00:06:14.940> than<00:06:15.000> that<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.390> locks

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
on here so but other than that the locks

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.350 
on here so but other than that the locks
is<00:06:16.170> easy<00:06:16.470> to<00:06:16.770> engage<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:17.640> disengage<00:06:17.730> if<00:06:18.240> you

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
is easy to engage and disengage if you

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.560 
is easy to engage and disengage if you
need<00:06:18.930> it<00:06:19.430> in<00:06:20.430> the<00:06:20.580> reverse<00:06:20.880> grip<00:06:21.150> we<00:06:21.390> got<00:06:21.540> a

now with that being said I'll have to

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.530 
now with that being said I'll have to

is<00:07:02.840> a<00:07:02.870> really<00:07:03.680> large<00:07:04.010> knife<00:07:04.250> and<00:07:04.490> it's<00:07:04.580> kind<00:07:04.700> of

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.730 
is a really large knife and it's kind of

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.400 
is a really large knife and it's kind of
impractical<00:07:05.390> for<00:07:05.420> me<00:07:05.690> personally<00:07:05.900> to<00:07:06.140> carry

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
impractical for me personally to carry

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.680 
impractical for me personally to carry
on<00:07:06.590> a<00:07:06.620> daily<00:07:06.920> basis<00:07:07.340> maybe<00:07:08.030> if<00:07:08.210> I<00:07:08.300> was<00:07:08.480> going<00:07:08.660> to

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690 
on a daily basis maybe if I was going to

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.390 
on a daily basis maybe if I was going to
combat<00:07:09.200> but<00:07:09.500> I<00:07:09.650> don't<00:07:09.800> really<00:07:09.920> foresee<00:07:10.160> that

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
combat but I don't really foresee that

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.450 
combat but I don't really foresee that
in<00:07:10.520> my<00:07:10.610> future<00:07:10.850> at<00:07:11.240> any<00:07:11.390> time<00:07:11.630> at<00:07:11.810> all<00:07:11.980> I<00:07:12.980> would

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
in my future at any time at all I would

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.210 
in my future at any time at all I would
probably<00:07:13.760> carry<00:07:14.150> the<00:07:14.300> hey-ho<00:07:14.600> or<00:07:14.870> the

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
probably carry the hey-ho or the

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.820 
probably carry the hey-ho or the
hissatsu<00:07:16.220> instead<00:07:17.030> of<00:07:17.150> the<00:07:17.300> Otonashi<00:07:17.830> but

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830 
hissatsu instead of the Otonashi but

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.740 
hissatsu instead of the Otonashi but
don't<00:07:19.280> let<00:07:19.370> that<00:07:19.400> to<00:07:20.000> let<00:07:20.120> the<00:07:20.210> discourage<00:07:20.600> you

don't let that to let the discourage you

is still a great knife in my in my

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.980 
is still a great knife in my in my
opinion<00:07:22.670> this<00:07:22.940> is<00:07:23.120> a<00:07:23.150> you<00:07:23.660> know<00:07:23.780> there's

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
opinion this is a you know there's

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.410 
opinion this is a you know there's
really<00:07:24.110> no<00:07:24.260> no<00:07:24.620> use<00:07:24.860> for<00:07:24.980> me<00:07:25.070> to<00:07:25.100> carry<00:07:25.370> it<00:07:25.460> but

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:26.420 
really no no use for me to carry it but

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.940 
really no no use for me to carry it but
I<00:07:26.480> do<00:07:26.600> love<00:07:26.900> it<00:07:27.020> in<00:07:27.110> my<00:07:27.200> collection<00:07:27.380> and<00:07:27.830> I

I do love it in my collection and I
think<00:07:28.190> it<00:07:28.280> looked<00:07:28.490> great<00:07:28.580> next<00:07:28.940> to<00:07:29.000> my<00:07:29.090> hey-ho

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 
think it looked great next to my hey-ho

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.320 
think it looked great next to my hey-ho
and<00:07:29.570> all<00:07:29.630> my<00:07:29.750> other<00:07:29.780> japanese-style<00:07:30.590> blades

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:31.330 
and all my other japanese-style blades

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.000 
and all my other japanese-style blades
and<00:07:32.330> if<00:07:32.960> I<00:07:33.080> was<00:07:33.200> to<00:07:33.230> say<00:07:33.470> if<00:07:33.560> there's<00:07:33.710> any<00:07:33.830> kind

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 
of down points to this knife it'd

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.240 
of down points to this knife it'd
probably<00:07:35.510> be<00:07:35.720> the<00:07:36.080> really<00:07:36.350> slippery<00:07:36.680> locking

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.250 
probably be the really slippery locking
