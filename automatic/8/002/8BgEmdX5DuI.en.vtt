 coriander oil 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.649
 we still mix 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.889
 well directed 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.939
 guacamole reached the desired consistency 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.009
 at this point my name is a pinch of salt 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.549
 and after that we look 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.039
 with a history of fresh coriander 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:31.289

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:54.079
 Meanwhile 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.469

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:01.159
 the stars totò for so called malice cysts 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.629
