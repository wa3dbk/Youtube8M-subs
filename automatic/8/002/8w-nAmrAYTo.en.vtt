hey guys and here's another tutorial

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.160 
hey guys and here's another tutorial
this<00:00:02.879> one<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.449> be<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:03.659> how<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.899> make

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
this one is going to be on how to make

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.710 
this one is going to be on how to make
dubstep<00:00:04.500> with<00:00:04.950> FL<00:00:05.220> Studio<00:00:05.490> mobile<00:00:05.850> stepping

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
dubstep with FL Studio mobile stepping

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.040 
dubstep with FL Studio mobile stepping
up<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.960> app<00:00:07.080> here<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.700> I<00:00:08.700> already<00:00:09.450> have<00:00:09.570> some

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
up the app here and I already have some

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.509 
up the app here and I already have some
of<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.230> stuff<00:00:10.969> pre-loaded<00:00:11.969> hold<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:13.519> we'll

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
of the stuff pre-loaded hold on we'll

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
of the stuff pre-loaded hold on we'll
start<00:00:14.820> off<00:00:14.969> with<00:00:15.240> how<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> get<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.719> baseline

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
start off with how to get the baseline

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.990 
start off with how to get the baseline
now<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> baseline<00:00:17.310> i'm<00:00:17.430> just<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.699> snag

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
now the baseline i'm just going to snag

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.640 
now the baseline i'm just going to snag
from<00:00:18.330> one<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:18.630> other<00:00:18.779> dubstep<00:00:19.260> songs<00:00:19.470> i'll

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
from one of my other dubstep songs i'll

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.109 
from one of my other dubstep songs i'll
show<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.890> how<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> sounds<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> song<00:00:20.789> first

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
show you how it sounds in the song first

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.730 
show you how it sounds in the song first
and<00:00:21.660> then<00:00:23.990> after<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.080> hear<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.529> song

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
and then after you hear it in the song

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.050 
and then after you hear it in the song
i'll<00:00:26.039> show<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.250> how<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.519> create<00:00:26.820> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
i'll show you how to create that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.150 
i'll show you how to create that
baseline<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.230> effects<00:00:28.619> i<00:00:28.710> threw<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
baseline and the effects i threw on to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.209 
baseline and the effects i threw on to
it<00:00:29.519> how<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.090> got<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> modulation<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.439> all<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
it how I got the modulation and all of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:49.340 
it how I got the modulation and all of
that

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.979 

you

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
you

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.900 
you
so<00:00:51.989> there's<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:52.289> baseline<00:00:52.800> there<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.340> we'll

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
so there's the baseline there and we'll

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.049 
so there's the baseline there and we'll
go<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.449> already<00:00:55.140> separated<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:56.160> no<00:00:56.760> point

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
go I already separated this no point

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.720 
go I already separated this no point
hold<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.879> here<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.120> already<00:01:01.079> went

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
hold on here we go already went

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.230 
hold on here we go already went
separated<00:01:02.730> hit<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.729> here's<00:01:06.060> going

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
separated hit here and so here's going

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.270 
separated hit here and so here's going
to<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.750> baseline<00:01:07.140> without<00:01:07.530> any<00:01:07.830> effects

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to be the baseline without any effects

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:24.060 
to be the baseline without any effects
and<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.479> what<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.690> sounds<00:01:09.840> like

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.530 

we<00:01:25.070> can<00:01:25.220> hear<00:01:25.400> that<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.760> just<00:01:25.790> doesn't<00:01:26.210> sound

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
we can hear that it just doesn't sound

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.530 
we can hear that it just doesn't sound
as<00:01:26.990> good<00:01:27.230> so<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.340> first<00:01:28.520> effect<00:01:28.910> I<00:01:29.150> did<00:01:29.420> on

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
as good so the first effect I did on

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.690 
as good so the first effect I did on
this<00:01:29.720> one<00:01:29.990> this<00:01:30.320> particular<00:01:30.680> song<00:01:31.100> well<00:01:31.610> I

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
this one this particular song well I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.850 
this one this particular song well I
went<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.060> EQ<00:01:32.480> and<00:01:32.660> i<00:01:32.840> boosted<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.380> base<00:01:33.560> I

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
went to the EQ and i boosted the base I

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.770 
went to the EQ and i boosted the base I
also<00:01:34.190> drop<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.760> trouble<00:01:35.150> a<00:01:35.210> little<00:01:35.480> bit<00:01:35.600> in

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
also drop the trouble a little bit in

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:44.140 
also drop the trouble a little bit in
the<00:01:36.380> middle<00:01:36.820> there<00:01:37.820> we<00:01:37.940> go<00:01:38.030> like<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:44.030> can

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
the middle there we go like that you can

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.490 
the middle there we go like that you can
already<00:01:44.270> tell<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.750> difference<00:01:45.110> in<00:01:45.230> the<00:01:45.320> sound

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
already tell the difference in the sound

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.770 
already tell the difference in the sound
this<00:01:45.710> is<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:45.920> more<00:01:46.100> deep<00:01:46.370> bass<00:01:46.760> and<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.570> just

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
this is a more deep bass and I just

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.200 
this is a more deep bass and I just
prefer<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.290> type<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.530> base<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.910> other<00:01:50.060> thing

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
prefer this type of base the other thing

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.150 
prefer this type of base the other thing
I<00:01:50.300> did<00:01:50.450> was<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.660> went<00:01:50.690> into<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.020> app<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.890> amp

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
I did was I went into the app to the amp

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.120 
I did was I went into the app to the amp
and<00:01:52.430> I<00:01:53.330> switch<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.050> type<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.590> amplifier

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
and I switch to the type to amplifier

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:06.380 
and I switch to the type to amplifier
and<00:01:55.370> I<00:01:56.030> just<00:01:56.330> dropped<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.900> just<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.200> little<00:01:57.230> bit

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.419 

so<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.380> hear<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.620> difference<00:02:07.650> there<00:02:08.250> I

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
so you can hear the difference there I

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.669 
so you can hear the difference there I
didn't<00:02:09.060> mess<00:02:09.210> too<00:02:09.420> much<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.840> root<00:02:10.050> verb

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
didn't mess too much with the root verb

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.830 
didn't mess too much with the root verb
and<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.950> delay<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> did<00:02:12.660> mess

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
and the delay on this one but I did mess

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.390 
and the delay on this one but I did mess
with<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.110> filter<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.740> what<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> did<00:02:14.130> with<00:02:14.280> this

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
with the filter and what I did with this

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.180 
with the filter and what I did with this
one<00:02:14.459> was<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.690> put<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.410> there<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.890> i<00:02:16.920> put<00:02:17.100> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
one was a I put it there and i put the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:38.190 
one was a I put it there and i put the
snap<00:02:17.430> back<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.060> what<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.240> did<00:02:18.360> was

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.780 

for<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.320> it's<00:02:39.500> pretty<00:02:39.710> simple<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.220> mean<00:02:40.550> if

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
for that it's pretty simple I mean if

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.600 
for that it's pretty simple I mean if
you're<00:02:41.270> on<00:02:41.450> FL<00:02:42.020> studio<00:02:42.050> mobile<00:02:42.740> how<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.490> get

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
you're on FL studio mobile how to get

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.890 
you're on FL studio mobile how to get
the<00:02:43.760> modulation<00:02:44.210> you're<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.630> going<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.810> go

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
the modulation you're just going to go

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.450 
the modulation you're just going to go
to<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.110> filter<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.710> you're<00:02:46.130> going<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.280> play

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
to this filter and you're going to play

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.920 
to this filter and you're going to play
with<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.820> little<00:02:46.970> bit<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.420> if<00:02:47.570> I<00:02:47.660> wanted

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
with this a little bit so if I wanted

with this a little bit so if I wanted
usually<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:48.830> do<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.160> modulation<00:02:49.520> like<00:02:49.790> this

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
usually I do the modulation like this

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.480

that<00:02:50.270> snapback<00:02:50.810> was<00:02:51.080> something<00:02:52.010> i<00:02:52.100> was<00:02:52.190> trying

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
that snapback was something i was trying

out<00:02:52.670> i<00:02:52.700> think<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.120> works<00:02:53.270> pretty<00:02:53.450> well<00:02:53.570> but<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
out i think it works pretty well but the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:19.990 
out i think it works pretty well but the
other<00:02:54.440> way<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.680> can<00:02:54.770> do<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.040> like<00:02:55.190> this

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.730 

each<00:03:21.000> one<00:03:21.300> works<00:03:21.599> well<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.170> they<00:03:22.590> all<00:03:22.709> have

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
each one works well and they all have

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.190 
each one works well and they all have
their<00:03:23.099> different<00:03:23.459> styles<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.720> know<00:03:24.840> for

I'll<00:06:17.650> just<00:06:17.800> get<00:06:17.920> the<00:06:18.100> metronome<00:06:18.700> so<00:06:18.820> you<00:06:18.910> know

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
I'll just get the metronome so you know

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:34.710 
I'll just get the metronome so you know
where<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.300> beats<00:06:19.480> are<00:06:19.630> so<00:06:19.840> count

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.820 

that's<00:06:35.720> going<00:06:35.870> to<00:06:35.930> be<00:06:35.990> generally<00:06:36.590> the

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
that's going to be generally the

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.950 
that's going to be generally the
standard<00:06:37.280> like<00:06:37.520> drums<00:06:38.270> on<00:06:38.449> you<00:06:38.569> can<00:06:38.690> get<00:06:38.840> that

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
standard like drums on you can get that

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.110 
standard like drums on you can get that
feel<00:06:39.349> where<00:06:40.039> you<00:06:40.160> have<00:06:40.310> the<00:06:40.580> cake<00:06:40.819> and<00:06:41.030> then

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
feel where you have the cake and then

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.990 
feel where you have the cake and then
every<00:06:41.509> I<00:06:41.840> think<00:06:42.440> it's<00:06:42.560> two<00:06:42.889> beats<00:06:43.220> you<00:06:43.610> get<00:06:43.789> the

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
every I think it's two beats you get the

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.409 
every I think it's two beats you get the
snare<00:06:44.630> and<00:06:44.900> the<00:06:45.699> snare<00:06:46.699> in<00:06:46.849> there<00:06:47.000> so<00:06:47.180> you<00:06:47.240> know

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
snare and the snare in there so you know

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.350 
snare and the snare in there so you know
you'd<00:06:47.569> kick<00:06:47.810> snare<00:06:48.460> this<00:06:49.460> is<00:06:49.639> like<00:06:49.789> kick<00:06:50.060> the

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
you'd kick snare this is like kick the

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.430 
you'd kick snare this is like kick the
snare<00:06:51.190> kick<00:06:52.190> and<00:06:52.460> then<00:06:53.449> the<00:06:53.660> hi-hats<00:06:54.110> you<00:06:54.319> can

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
snare kick and then the hi-hats you can

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.339 
snare kick and then the hi-hats you can
experiment<00:06:54.770> with<00:06:54.979> those<00:06:55.810> and<00:06:56.810> that's<00:06:57.020> pretty
