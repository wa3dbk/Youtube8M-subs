00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
the whole overview of the map and it's
looking<00:00:47.010> pretty<00:00:47.430> busy<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:48.210> there's<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
looking pretty busy because there's a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.920

match<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.550> drain<00:00:57.180> or<00:00:57.390> any<00:00:57.660> other

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.319 
match get on to drain or any other
places<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.760> think<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.030> bristling

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
places but I think you're bristling

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.139 
places but I think you're bristling
pretty<00:01:00.660> good<00:01:01.430> imesh<00:01:02.430> go<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.850> windmill

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
pretty good imesh go up to windmill

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.429 
pretty good imesh go up to windmill
which<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.480> don't<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.019> saw<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
which I don't think I saw you in the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.280 
which I don't think I saw you in the
last<00:01:04.619> video<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.180> there<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.330> looking<00:01:07.140> good

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
last video but there it is looking good

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.460 
last video but there it is looking good
I<00:01:07.409> think<00:01:08.210> over<00:01:09.210> here<00:01:09.390> we've<00:01:09.510> got<00:01:09.540> few<00:01:09.780> fields

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
I think over here we've got few fields

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.260 
I think over here we've got few fields
got<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> grass<00:01:12.530> yeah<00:01:13.909> that's<00:01:14.909> pretty<00:01:15.030> much<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
got a grass yeah that's pretty much it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.560 
got a grass yeah that's pretty much it
this<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.670> wasn't<00:01:17.670> sure<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.509> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
this way I wasn't sure if I was going to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.060 
this way I wasn't sure if I was going to
work<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:20.369> rest<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.799> this

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
work on the rest of it but I got to this

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.700 
work on the rest of it but I got to this
field<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.549> way<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:25.110> did<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> bit<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
field this way and I did a bit of the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.550 
field this way and I did a bit of the
land<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:28.020> take<00:01:28.200> quite<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> long

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
land up here but to take quite a long

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.929 
land up here but to take quite a long
while<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.130> I'm<00:01:29.220> not<00:01:29.340> sure<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.549> I'm<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
while so I'm not sure if I'm going to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.300 
while so I'm not sure if I'm going to
continue<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:31.049> my<00:01:31.229> server<00:01:31.590> open<00:01:31.860> at

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
continue it as I have my server open at

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.940 
continue it as I have my server open at
the<00:01:32.460> moment<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.409> that's<00:01:34.409> going<00:01:34.619> pretty<00:01:34.860> well

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the moment and that's going pretty well

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.030 
the moment and that's going pretty well
so<00:01:35.280> I'm<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.549> continue<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
so I'm going to continue with that and
