00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.170
 hi to all from devils technique do 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 puntoit quest today we see the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.369
 video review of a particular 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.010
 bluetooth really very interesting 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.730
 very different we say from the usual the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.480
 product is called lg hbs 730 a name 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.670
 let's say a little hard to remember 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.130
 however you can also find them say 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.720
 on the internet writing lg ton class that 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.579
 a common would be a feature of 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.950
 these earphones 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.730
 I'm going to get quickly 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.370
 packaging as you see earphones are 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.929
 earphones definitely with a design 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.890
 particular have the headphones are 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.320
 send them aside for a moment 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.039
 the 9 after in the post that now 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.050
 with broken we find men from 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.280
 clearly change everyone has a 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.990
 ear maybe the biggest at most 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.290
 small so you will surely find the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.510
 its size this is the micro usb cable 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.220
 usb for charging and here we have the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.380
 manual with all the instructions 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.390
 if you want to use them in the center for a hundred vi 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.120
 I absolutely recommend reading 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.030
 let's put everything away and let's see 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.390
 earphones as you see 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.040
 earphones is definitely different 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.800
 however lg has found a solution 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.450
 really or actively regarding the 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.980
 portability and above all for how much 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.990
 it's about the functions because as you see 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.770
 this is a bow that must be inserted 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.990
 practically worn we say at the neck 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.480
 and what allows us further allows us 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.710
 to insert the earphones into ours 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.020
 ears to have access to the controls 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.910
 commands that we find in the part 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.170
 let's say front of our neck 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.780
 so when we wore it 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.660
 this is an example here we will find i 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.570
 our commands are the classic commands 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.010
 commands that are used for 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.020
 earphones we have first and foremost 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.000
 the ability to turn them on you see on 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.930
 off sorry but there is a light really 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.379
 bad today the sun has become 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.209
 utopia 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.930
 now it goes a little better maybe they are 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.180
 some reflections on off to turn them on 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.830
 we have the key to answer one 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.090
 call button you see a 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.580
 a circular led that we say lights up 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.190
 when we turned them on and connected 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.860
 to our smartphone the volume key 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.700
 more and less while on the other side 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.770
 we find the key to pause and 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.480
 will restart a call and the button 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.600
 to send tracks back and forth 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.970
 as you see the controls are the classics is 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.930
 really very simple to use 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.700
 but let's see how now 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:59.580
 they work we go to first of all 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:02.750
 turn on you heard that said yes 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.150
 are on and the battery is charged 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.730
 we take a smartphone or used 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.010
 this smartphone let 's say let 's say 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.840
 iphone 6 plus because these earphones 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.920
 support ptx sound is a species 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.709
 equalization that it really is 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.350
 fantastic there is a difference i have it 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.870
 found abysmal soil quality 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.600
 let 's say these earphones with one 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.459
 smartphone compatible with apt hicks is 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.459
 a smartphone not compatible with apt 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.380
 for example on the iPhone these tend a 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.200
 little to distort while on galaxy 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.640
 4 up notes or devices such as the lg ad 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.610
 example that are still compatible 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.220
 with apt hicks they really sound a lot 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.410
 much better the weight of this particular 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.850
 of only 32 grams then not worn 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.489
 they don't even feel they are available 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.440
 white and black allow us beyond 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.870
 listen to the music also to manage the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.850
 calls to a standby time of 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.100
 up to fifteen days then really 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.769
 very much while regarding 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.470
 talk time is 15 hours 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.989
 listening to music arrives more or less 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.120
 at about ten hours when a battery 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.290
 is unloaded recharge through the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.400
 micro usb port that is positioned 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.570
 exactly 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.570
 now I find it 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.950
 sorry but ok, here it is 4 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.690
 another really smart solution 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:40.510
 of lg is first of all the possibility of 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:43.360
 having this as you see is magnetic 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.430
 then our earphones in a single 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.410
 they will never tell you and will never go in 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.900
 I go to prisons for our necks 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.540
 but what happens maybe we have it in 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.860
 standby and we have the earphones on 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.560
 out of our ears if you get there 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.090
 a call what happens happens 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.770
 headphones will start spinning you will hear 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.680
 just vibrate because there are two 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.530
 scooters that this is a community 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.510
 really amazing because it allows us 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.490
 not to lose any kind at all 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.290
 of call 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:16.800
 we now see clearly in the limit 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.800
 of the possible as sound start spotify 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.760
 starting a playlist on the fly to do the 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.740
 good morning let 's see what it offers us 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.810
 proposes some terrible songs no 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:37.090
 could have been worse by then 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:39.430
 volume as you can hear right now is 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.770
 really very strong but if it is hostile either 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.540
 with the physical key of our phone 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:51.660
 but also with the physical keys of the 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:54.850
 earphones and headphones to pause 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.220
 we touch the little key and see them like that 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.020
 let's start so it's really all 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.760
 very simple but you have to understand that 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.040
 even easier because this is it 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.300
 you will find at your neck then we say 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.400
 seen in perspective you will find the 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.450
 earphones so we also have the 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.610
 possibility of using a 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.980
 equalizer that tore ePolizza yes yes 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.550
 re-enable by holding for a second 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:21.760
 the up and down key of the volume together 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.040
 this does not work if we have one 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.270
 smartphone that supports ptx like vi 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.640
 I said earlier why an equalization 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.169
 already pre-set that does everything by itself 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.080
 instead if we have a smartphone with ad 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.460
 example the iphone 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.830
 by clicking on the two buttons 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.320
 at the same time switch I love between 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.950
 various modes that are low boost 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:45.110
 and with huge 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:48.250
 this increase is another function 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:51.340
 very interesting is the possibility of 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.510
 have messages and notifications read 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.170
 of our social networks directly 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:59.090
 from the lg earphones plus toner as yes 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.670
 just go to the play store e 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.820
 download the bt leader plus application 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:07.490
 in Italian this allows you to read 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.930
 as I said before, let's say 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.300
 of text messages 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.730
 if you have a day smartphone 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.470
 quality lollipop crashava 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.730
 however I must say that it really works 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.070
 very well and the interface is a lot 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:23.270
 simple and allows us to choose that 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:25.850
 what we say receive a voice alert 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.100
 we say every time we get one 

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.830
 notifies the price of these earphones 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.050
 and 59.99 euros 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.740
 however they are on amazon to a 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:39.650
 lower price of around 49.99 euros 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.210
 under 50 euros a cent 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.000
 you find it really very good a lot 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:47.390
 convenient for those who want to do fitness 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.160
 we do n't say there's no problem it's not 

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.590
 that bounce hévíz beat with 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.930
 torment remain absolutely still 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:57.650
 but we know why in making a home wall 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:00.800
 because maybe if we want to keep at home 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.450
 we always want to keep the phone 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.860
 in hand and in this case we have 

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.940
 always free ears because when 

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.320
 you get the call they will be at 

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.690
 vibrate and we will notice the 

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.800
 call for the moment is everything 

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.800
 hi but i have to
