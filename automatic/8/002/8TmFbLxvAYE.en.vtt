00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi I am all tele nas today I want 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.610
 to begin a series of videos in which 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.139
 I'm talking about how a game closes is 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.599
 normal of the thousand municipalities league of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.610
 legends discussions in which we talk about 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.830
 how a game should be closed when 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.490
 is winning and the usual arguments that 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.289
 I'm 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.400
 what should i do when we are when i 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.449
 enemies defend themselves under tower or 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.730
 chetry is not that it continues to discourage 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.240
 top and there are 4 against 5 thing 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.670
 let's make 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.929
 or my top jammer doesn't want to 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.340
 engage because they are afraid mind the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.550
 enemy to die 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.559
 what we do all these discussions 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.620
 end up having vague suggestions 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.360
 usually you were retired and didn't wear 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.510
 a real solution or one 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.399
 sort of guidelines where you get 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.890
 the suggestion is the solution 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.480
 wants the first over the suggestion 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.090
 that I give to all the people who are 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.030
 winning in only care and the three phases 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.190
 grow a couple of balls because you are 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.559
 winning is not afraid of a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.329
 enemy that is losing is back 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.909
 at least levels of you have less money than you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.740
 to everything but you, below, but 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.960
 heels because knowing like shit e 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.619
 he was holding his team like a 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.210
 I do n't understand why not not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 you should try engaging or doing them 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.009
 something you do something christ with 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.070
 something now this something there 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.950
 he called no I am eight ways to close 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.680
 a gaming just more than they are to bring the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.049
 barum a tower d'hiv group areas takes 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.570
 a person out of position to give the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.659
 bar split bouchard and denies review 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 camperare a book like a nag in the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.240
 rotation siege the towers then me 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.310
 I will speak the saint of the first three perhaps 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.110
 le baron tower diver group areas for l 1 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.729
 out of position because they are one to 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.860
 two methods more efficient than most 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.409
 simple that should be explained to each 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.270
 level are easier to apply and 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.939
 they are the ones that give more results 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.130
 perhaps a diamond the third is what 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.009
 it works less but it's worth it 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.439
 however try these methods then 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.149
 as I said they are perhaps of the baron tower 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.369
 d'hiv and group takes a person 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.770
 out of position 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.630
 to these three methods then group areas 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.300
 takes a person out of position a 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.000
 bronze silver and gold people are incapable 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.910
 to make smart choices, he goes to knock 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.550
 take and take to do just one does 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.040
 find alone in the jungle and move on to 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.350
 case of wired front that do not know how to be gay 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.150
 why not howard himself does not know where 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.459
 are the enemies go to hit farmar and when 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.410
 they are all tops when there are these 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.180
 Stupid choices people just like groups 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.250
 and start taking people stars 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.880
 out of position because ielli then i 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.530
 I kill 5 against 1 killed a person 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.570
 if you want to use a flag maybe even two 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.000
 take it and take it from paula to 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.910
 similar that is stating bot or rihanna 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.200
 what kind pushato to the second mid tower 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.840
 someone alone that you take that one 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.970
 important target you take it 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.250
 went to do it in a tower goal 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.940
 you can make it easy against one if it is missing 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.190
 a very simple person without problems 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.110
 you should n't be afraid of this thing 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.870
 just say the former group is new in 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.090
 someone simple is not even telling a 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.070
 coordinate says with the pad is continued 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.989
 go to the various in piss until 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.370
 you don't find one that was just idiot like 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.370
 the pitt like few 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.610
 bring the team fight alma shore note 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.010
 well not elected do the nose said 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.860
 to force the feud team is born because it seems 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.500
 the born silver bronze does not come to an end 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.680
 unless there is an ace and its own 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.459
 perfect you are 5 alive you and they are 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.000
 all dead 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.070
 do not do it is an unnecessary risk then lost once 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.840
 the game the baron of the rubano 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.340
 they start to make the team file immediately 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.970
 after dancing nemo directly to life 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.410
 or half people who decide to turn around 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.600
 and the other half continues to do the 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.200
 baron so you do 3 against 5 while e 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.390
 two with three barons too complicated not 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.700
 you can't coordinate them don't do not 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.920
 you risk is waste of waste of time 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.140
 do not learn your elo 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.150
 nothing learned when you are in government 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.560
 when you are in a bit more coordinated 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.150
 pine is small 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.849
 unnecessary risk don't do it but you can 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.280
 do you see you do it surely when 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:28.400
 like there is the gender bot 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.539
 or type one of the enemies born in xvi da 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.819
 assholes but you do it anyway or vi 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.009
 practical approach what you do there 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.229
 clean the sea ​​with new ones 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.669
 I look and everything 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.740
 if the enemy team has local fear 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.349
 it could also begin the balon as well 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.169
 who try to pull them to come to you if 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.639
 enemies are engaged if they do not come 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.030
 you go whale you go home 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.440
 because there is so much but if not, I want to 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.699
 engage first will not engage later 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.949
 but you have to sell clearly that if 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.199
 arrive supervised DIY everyone is not 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.590
 that continued to make the bar de te caro 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:09.560
 the conduit is not pin and if you like 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:15.620
 said in English more italiota than not 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.629
 there is a tower diving situation 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.669
 I looked in the third method and the third 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:24.800
 method and the simplest is the most 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:28.969
 stupid you are 34 11 your nose to 4k 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.840
 at 4k of life in a run duina a warm gun 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:34.880
 speed discomforts high all that 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.219
 he needs them to stand there under the tower of gods 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.099
 enemies watching each other league and hello how it goes 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:44.000
 I'm nasus and I put you in the head with one 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.770
 gloomy armed at 600 if you fuck the fuck 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.520
 a tower tank 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:52.900
 take you see a similar one with the right one 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:57.219
 submit chissenefrega bambi thrown 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.270
 45 pt frigates you are ahead 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.930
 pass back rules on your friends do not 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.699
 you are scared 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.430
 if you don't have or even if you have an adagio 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.020
 huge 7 type 24 18 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.630
 but you have more lives to make more money 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.000
 more targets more tower if they send us 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.880
 a life you don't have to be afraid of 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.639
 enemy that has nothing but you 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.590
 if you have a tank challenged sticazzi franca 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.639
 that is, he goes first 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:25.460
 he hires him all over 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.259
 everyone happy at home, take the 23rd 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.430
 enemies and they all die if you are 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:31.340
 lucky 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.340
 landed you get inhibited andate bank e 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.560
 you will say and after an inhibitor you go to 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.350
 knock another social wool topa of the 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.540
 remote peace of pain invites me now 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.220
 sees pulled down not pushed to the 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.110
 lane to which you pulled up 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.210
 inhibited is useless because it is so 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.520
 imposed the only way to go to 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.610
 piss one of the two the one of the wool 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.530
 in which there is no limit from that dates 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.050
 to the regio once of mitoraj before or 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.110
 then you will arrive will arrive in base with 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.030
 all the minions then managed to win 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:06.470
 inevitably you ca n't lose a 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:08.960
 that point is very simple very easy 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.960
 they are in 90 percent of the cases it works 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.040
 you did n't have to first you must not be afraid 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.310
 to do this thing 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.490
 second you don't have to risk things he does 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.290
 at other levels the solutions 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.950
 you will find in the videos of tomorrow and 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.970
 day after tomorrow 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.970
 thank you all
