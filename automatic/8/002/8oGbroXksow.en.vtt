00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.950
 So, guys, I'm going to teach one today. 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.830
 music, right? 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.870
 parents and children of the urban legion are 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.840
 I'll pass the agreements to you later. 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.189
 I'll start to get along then the chords 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.720
 of this song 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:39.059
 they will be like this, the greater is greater 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:41.220
 the larger sun greater F will get smaller there 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:48.110
 smaller 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:51.510
 the smaller the greater factor and the smaller 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.640
 as already shown in other videos, 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.559
 can not make the eyelash of the far 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.550
 It can be done here for now. 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.710
 from the fourth rope down and the smaller 100 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.960
 You can do this here too by tapping the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.240
 fourth down rope will give a sound 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.450
 goodbye but the tip I give 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.259
 continue training the eyelashes at this 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.340
 the fan is e chelsea - now I'm going to go 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.340
 take you to yourselves 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.110
 so it's taken from that song more 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.060
 Traditional possible is that they're 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.240
 of rock'n'roll only that the people 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.580
 will play slowly but there is a 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.740
 Palette movement is the same're so 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.450
 you so 'abafa' quinine you 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.990
 feel the sound and it will be two down 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.680
 two to up one down and one to 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:54.100
 top 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:57.540
 then there is a rhythm so I will do 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.540
 a sequence is for you to see 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.690
 Okay so I'll make it not only bigger 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.870
 here is an entire one that would be taken 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.870
 on here 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.470
 now I'll do two sequenced 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.730
 so when the chord is struck 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.860
 whole you know now in this 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.579
 music has a division is not between a 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.650
 wake up another is extracts and with freeze 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:36.260
 paint walls 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:40.019
 nobody knows what happened to him 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.560
 usually occurs when you make the right 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.859
 the king then the basic of this song she is 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.639
 doi the defendant will be divided right in 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:53.340
 divided from the beat so we'll do 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:56.010
 This style is where it 's supposed to be. 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.680
 You divide the math right then 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.569
 so when you have it, you touch it 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.379
 down to top to bottom up 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:08.189
 stay like this 1 2 3 4 and there goes to the king 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:11.329
 in 234 there the division stays upright 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.329
 What am I going to do here? 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.879
 of 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:24.760
 hence the next court is already taken 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:27.620
 It's just the original song, so it's just 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.080
 pay close attention to splitting the video 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.410
 that you can divide, remember that 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.280
 so I'll stay like this one more time 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:40.280
 in 2 3 4 1 2 3 priest is usually then 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.670
 This in music is going to happen in 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.310
 straight 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.310
 Ok, let's go to the song now 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.980
 is almost done with painted walls 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.910
 nobody knows what happened to him 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:19.840
 she threw herself from the window of the fifth floor 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:19.840
 nothing is easy to understand now 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.470
 it's just the wind out there ' 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:40.810
 fall or fall away from home 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:45.640
 Can I sleep with you? 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:51.820
 I'm scared, I had a nightmare only. 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.820
 back after training 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:05:00.850
 My son will have his name said 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:15.630
 I want the most beautiful name, I have to love 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:20.639
 for people as if there was no 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:30.060
 Mom, why should you stop? 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:33.749
 To think the truth does not tell me what 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:39.529
 that the sky is blue 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:39.529
 explain to me the world's great fury 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:55.550
 my children that I take care of me 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:58.550
 I live with my mother but my father me 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.550
 visit 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:08.450
 I live on the street, I do not have anyone. 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:12.990
 I live in any 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.250
 I already lived in such a house that I do not even remember. 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.050
 more 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.050
 I live with my 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.190
 O 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.190
 or nera 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.110
 anything 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:40.310
 we need to love 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:46.740
 people as if there were no mother 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:49.490
 because if you stop to think of 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.730
 there is no truth 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:59.410
 I'm at the doctor's office. 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:02.380
 I'm big sand you tell me your 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:06.970
 parents do not understand me 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:14.310
 but you do not understand me your flights and 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:21.069
 curves and parents is absurd 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:23.510
 it's children who are not you and you 're going to be 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:25.510
 when you grow up 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.510
