00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
around boom it's basically the same sort

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.200 
around boom it's basically the same sort
of<00:00:59.680> thing<00:00:59.739> as<00:00:59.950> the<00:01:00.100> redstone<00:01:00.670> lighting<00:01:00.970> system

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
of thing as the redstone lighting system

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.210 
of thing as the redstone lighting system
not<00:01:01.300> sure<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:01.540> be<00:01:01.600> fun<00:01:01.780> i'll<00:01:01.960> show<00:01:02.170> you<00:01:02.230> behind

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
not sure to be fun i'll show you behind

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.390 
not sure to be fun i'll show you behind
this<00:01:03.340> so<00:01:04.030> he<00:01:04.210> got<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.390> daylight<00:01:04.720> sensor

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
this so he got the daylight sensor

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.219 
this so he got the daylight sensor
reverse<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.520> signal<00:01:06.880> goes<00:01:07.780> down<00:01:07.990> there<00:01:08.140> to

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
reverse the signal goes down there to

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.540 
reverse the signal goes down there to
power<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.440> Pistons<00:01:08.800> and<00:01:09.040> i'll<00:01:09.190> show<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.520> a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
power the Pistons and i'll show you a

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.670 
power the Pistons and i'll show you a
glass<00:01:09.820> version<00:01:10.300> of<00:01:10.390> it<00:01:10.479> around<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.750> corner<00:01:11.170> so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
glass version of it around the corner so

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.500 
glass version of it around the corner so
you<00:01:11.770> can<00:01:11.860> see<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.010> little<00:01:12.190> bit<00:01:12.340> of<00:01:12.400> clarity<00:01:13.300> as

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
you can see a little bit of clarity as

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.930 
you can see a little bit of clarity as
to<00:01:13.570> how<00:01:13.750> this<00:01:13.930> actually<00:01:14.140> works<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.850> i'll<00:01:15.909> just

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
to how this actually works so i'll just

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.640 
to how this actually works so i'll just
like<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.270> same<00:01:16.450> side<00:01:16.659> difference<00:01:17.049> this<00:01:17.500> is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
like the same side difference this is

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.440 
like the same side difference this is
reversing<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.280> signals<00:01:18.430> obviously<00:01:19.030> when<00:01:19.150> day

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
reversing the signals obviously when day

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.920 
reversing the signals obviously when day
comes<00:01:19.690> around<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.200> switches<00:01:21.040> back<00:01:21.930> redstone

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
comes around it switches back redstone

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.680 
comes around it switches back redstone
goes<00:01:23.170> up<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.740> fire<00:01:23.950> these<00:01:24.220> little<00:01:24.760> puppies<00:01:25.090> and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
goes up to fire these little puppies and

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.039 
goes up to fire these little puppies and
redstone<00:01:26.200> goes<00:01:26.500> down<00:01:26.740> there<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.250> fire<00:01:27.430> those

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
redstone goes down there to fire those

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.870 
redstone goes down there to fire those
then<00:01:29.049> if<00:01:29.200> we<00:01:29.290> do<00:01:29.409> x<00:01:30.190> sit<00:01:30.700> day<00:01:32.640> when<00:01:33.640> i<00:01:33.670> can

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
then if we do x sit day when i can

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.090 
then if we do x sit day when i can
actually<00:01:34.650> type<00:01:35.650> there<00:01:35.979> we<00:01:36.070> go<00:01:37.830> this<00:01:38.830> one's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
actually type there we go this one's

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.880 
actually type there we go this one's
being<00:01:39.369> weird<00:01:39.720> there<00:01:40.720> we<00:01:40.810> go<00:01:40.990> selling<00:01:41.590> me<00:01:41.680> when

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
being weird there we go selling me when

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.719 
being weird there we go selling me when
I<00:01:41.920> was<00:01:42.070> setting<00:01:42.220> this<00:01:42.310> up<00:01:42.369> I<00:01:42.490> didn't<00:01:42.640> actually

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
I was setting this up I didn't actually

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.910 
I was setting this up I didn't actually
think<00:01:42.970> about<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.360> I<00:01:43.990> didn't<00:01:44.500> leave<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.650> space

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
think about it I didn't leave a space

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.120 
think about it I didn't leave a space
that's<00:01:45.880> where<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.119> goofed<00:01:46.390> but<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:47.860> as<00:01:47.950> simple

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
that's where I goofed but it's as simple

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.399 
that's where I goofed but it's as simple
as<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.369> even<00:01:49.000> I<00:01:49.060> make<00:01:49.210> mistakes<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.810> I'm

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
as that even I make mistakes and I'm

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.140 
as that even I make mistakes and I'm
definitely<00:01:50.770> no<00:01:51.159> gloves<00:01:51.520> being<00:01:51.670> perfect<00:01:52.000> but

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
definitely no gloves being perfect but

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.289 
definitely no gloves being perfect but
yeah<00:01:52.830> so<00:01:53.830> it's<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.010> nice<00:01:54.130> simple<00:01:54.610> way<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:54.909> doing

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
yeah so it's a nice simple way of doing

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.179 
yeah so it's a nice simple way of doing
things<00:01:55.510> it's<00:01:56.409> just<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.650> nice<00:01:56.770> little<00:01:56.830> way<00:01:57.159> of

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
things it's just a nice little way of

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.710 
things it's just a nice little way of
obviously<00:01:57.580> closing<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.119> shop<00:01:58.330> because<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.600> can

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
obviously closing a shop because you can

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.010 
obviously closing a shop because you can
make<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:58.990> out<00:01:59.080> of<00:01:59.490> say<00:02:00.490> obsidian<00:02:01.180> or<00:02:01.420> if<00:02:01.900> you

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
make it out of say obsidian or if you

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.270 
make it out of say obsidian or if you
can<00:02:02.110> create<00:02:02.229> if<00:02:02.439> you<00:02:02.530> can<00:02:02.650> make<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.799> cool<00:02:02.979> shop

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
can create if you can make a cool shop

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.330 
can create if you can make a cool shop
for<00:02:03.549> a<00:02:03.580> like<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:04.320> SNP<00:02:05.320> where<00:02:05.710> basicly<00:02:05.920> make<00:02:06.130> our

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
for a like a SNP where basicly make our

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.089 
for a like a SNP where basicly make our
bedrock<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:07.030> then<00:02:07.709> although<00:02:08.709> obviously<00:02:08.829> you

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
bedrock and then although obviously you

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.409 
bedrock and then although obviously you
can<00:02:09.219> make<00:02:09.340> in<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.519> majority<00:02:09.729> out<00:02:09.999> of<00:02:10.119> bed<00:02:10.269> rock

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:10.419 
can make in the majority out of bed rock

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.759 
can make in the majority out of bed rock
and<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.569> noticed<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.929> dogs<00:02:11.109> I<00:02:11.169> obsidian<00:02:11.590> either

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
and I noticed the dogs I obsidian either

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.440 
and I noticed the dogs I obsidian either
way<00:02:11.859> you<00:02:11.919> can<00:02:12.010> just<00:02:12.129> make<00:02:12.249> it<00:02:12.279> a<00:02:12.430> little<00:02:12.549> bit

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
way you can just make it a little bit

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.210 
way you can just make it a little bit
so<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.260> have<00:02:14.349> it<00:02:14.379> for<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.650> house<00:02:14.830> you

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
so you can just have it for a house you

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.050 
so you can just have it for a house you
think<00:02:15.430> earner<00:02:15.720> numbers<00:02:16.720> are<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> bit<00:02:17.050> too<00:02:17.200> Kim

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
think earner numbers are a bit too Kim

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.790 
think earner numbers are a bit too Kim
obviously<00:02:19.060> time<00:02:19.540> turns<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.110> you're<00:02:20.470> in<00:02:20.620> there

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
obviously time turns in you're in there

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.470 
obviously time turns in you're in there
overnight<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.489> locked<00:02:21.760> nothing's<00:02:22.390> gonna

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
overnight it's locked nothing's gonna

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.880 
overnight it's locked nothing's gonna
get<00:02:22.629> through<00:02:22.810> there<00:02:22.989> creepers<00:02:23.379> katsuya

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
get through there creepers katsuya

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.710 
get through there creepers katsuya
SuperSave<00:02:24.849> there's<00:02:25.090> no<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.209> indoors<00:02:25.599> Oh

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
SuperSave there's no I indoors Oh

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.690 
SuperSave there's no I indoors Oh
nonsense<00:02:25.989> like<00:02:26.379> that<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.489> can<00:02:27.580> get

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
nonsense like that and you can get

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.670 
nonsense like that and you can get
through<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.750> nice<00:02:28.930> simple<00:02:28.959> we're<00:02:29.440> basically

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
through so nice simple we're basically

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.800 
through so nice simple we're basically
looking<00:02:29.800> down<00:02:30.250> your<00:02:30.280> house<00:02:30.519> for<00:02:31.330> night<00:02:31.540> time

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
looking down your house for night time

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.750 
looking down your house for night time
there's<00:02:32.590> obviously<00:02:32.920> plenty<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.340> other<00:02:33.459> uses

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
there's obviously plenty of other uses

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.040 
there's obviously plenty of other uses
you<00:02:33.819> can<00:02:33.880> use<00:02:34.090> for<00:02:34.209> this<00:02:34.300> whole<00:02:34.480> daylight

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
you can use for this whole daylight

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.479 
you can use for this whole daylight
reversal<00:02:35.530> system<00:02:35.830> but<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.069> is<00:02:36.190> one<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
reversal system but this is one of the

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.030 
reversal system but this is one of the
ones<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.760> wanted<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.090> show<00:02:37.269> you<00:02:37.920> one<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
ones I wanted to show you one of the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.559 
ones I wanted to show you one of the
other<00:02:39.160> ones<00:02:39.310> obviously<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.670> could<00:02:39.880> do<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.209> for

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
other ones obviously you could do is for

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.970 
other ones obviously you could do is for
when<00:02:40.599> you're<00:02:40.870> planting<00:02:41.170> crops<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.860> stuff

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
when you're planting crops and stuff

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.170 
when you're planting crops and stuff
like<00:02:42.099> that<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.370> have<00:02:42.459> at<00:02:42.549> nighttime<00:02:42.970> so

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
like that you have at nighttime so

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.960 
like that you have at nighttime so
basically<00:02:43.680> every<00:02:44.680> time<00:02:44.830> I<00:02:44.860> turns<00:02:45.069> night<00:02:45.489> it

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
basically every time I turns night it

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.580 
basically every time I turns night it
wipes<00:02:46.209> out<00:02:46.390> obviously<00:02:46.750> crops<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.170> always<00:02:47.410> grow

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
wipes out obviously crops to always grow

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.170 
wipes out obviously crops to always grow
that<00:02:47.680> fast<00:02:47.739> enough<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.370> replant<00:02:48.760> as<00:02:48.940> it

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
that fast enough to replant as it

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.460 
that fast enough to replant as it
happens<00:02:49.540> it's<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.750> lot<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.989> messing<00:02:50.290> about

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
happens it's a lot of messing about

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.900 
happens it's a lot of messing about
basically<00:02:51.010> but<00:02:51.069> it's<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.250> cool<00:02:51.430> way<00:02:51.579> of<00:02:51.610> doing

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
basically but it's a cool way of doing

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.030 
basically but it's a cool way of doing
it<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.360> this<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.049> an<00:02:53.110> excess<00:02:53.500> way<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.829> doing

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
it is it this is an excess way of doing

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.160 
it is it this is an excess way of doing
things<00:02:54.450> also<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.630> wrap<00:02:55.810> up<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.019> video

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
things also just to wrap up this video

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.780 
things also just to wrap up this video
if<00:02:56.349> you<00:02:56.560> happen<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.860> see<00:02:56.980> my<00:02:57.010> chicken<00:02:57.549> farm

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
if you happen to see my chicken farm

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.229 
if you happen to see my chicken farm
video<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.530> reason<00:02:59.799> you<00:03:00.549> can<00:03:00.670> kind<00:03:00.849> of<00:03:00.910> see<00:03:01.030> why

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
video the reason you can kind of see why

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.559 
video the reason you can kind of see why
now<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.349> why<00:03:03.060> this<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.120> why<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.360> have

now this is why this is why you have

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.390 
now this is why this is why you have
water<00:03:04.810> in<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.620> people<00:03:05.860> say<00:03:05.950> it's<00:03:06.190> what<00:03:06.370> a

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
water in the people say it's what a

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.490 
water in the people say it's what a
really<00:03:06.730> necessary<00:03:07.150> what<00:03:07.810> r<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.049> necessary

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
really necessary what r is necessary

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.750 
really necessary what r is necessary
because<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.769> see<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.099> that's<00:03:09.370> happening

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
because you see there that's happening

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.970 
because you see there that's happening
this<00:03:10.120> way<00:03:10.329> you've<00:03:10.450> got<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.660> water<00:03:11.290> doesn't

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
this way you've got the water doesn't

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.890 
this way you've got the water doesn't
happen<00:03:12.190> don't<00:03:13.060> know<00:03:13.150> how<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:13.599> they<00:03:13.690> kind<00:03:13.870> of

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
happen don't know how but they kind of

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.830 
happen don't know how but they kind of
work<00:03:14.079> away<00:03:14.290> through<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:15.670> that's<00:03:16.269> why<00:03:16.510> but
