00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 Hi guys, who do not know me about 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.400
 movies and today I'm going to make a video of 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.670
 how to make grape juice 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.509
 It looks like a doll and the other is in your fair 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.710
 as well as the things that you will 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.410
 need 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:39.290
 so it's the first plant you are 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:44.610
 then you will get what you let me 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:48.300
 I love you, you'll need ink too. 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.579
 purple and dark there is no one there because 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.020
 from my own experience I have taken more 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.570
 did not get any good 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.719
 This is ink. 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.079
 was the stronger craft I 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.079
 I want 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.610
 ink today he had a knowledge 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.630
 You can move like that and so it is 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:15.080
 Since it's very small here, I got the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.080
 my wife same day when the good 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.720
 so you go on your farm 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:41.820
 so you'll reap what you will 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:51.030
 to be able to fiddle with the attack with certainty 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:53.540
 so much blood - the amount you 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.229
 do you think you need 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.229
 I think it 's good 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880
 cech 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:24.590
 milk 30 here is doing five times is fine 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:32.680
 simple and accurate for 15 years too 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.680
 before kim kuk and cellulose is here 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:49.310
 he has to try you see he did not stay 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:57.110
 use agreement was very rosy 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:03:00.980
 a little different from you can not 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:04.060
 put other colors you will have goes 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.060
 laying to stay 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.019
 I have mine too full so I already 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.470
 I'm going to take a little 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.209
 Good, I took a little bit then. 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.180
 because it stayed in DM 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.359
 so people, that's how we people 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.840
 You can make it sure you and 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:27.470
 You do with milk everything I paint. 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.200
 always make juice of things in ink 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.290
 and do not use other things because 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.600
 does not work that he says that the 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.780
 other things do not get good 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.989
 certainly looking for is to have evidence 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.989
 and the experience and is not good 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:53.680
 mishin if you want to stay with 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:58.750
 thorns but if you want it to stay 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.750
 with foam you close here 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:11.500
 who already has this tango as well as holder 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:16.230
 and Edinho prefers that Spanish is 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:21.700
 sorry if I did not work like that 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:37.150
 in addition to being very similar to 5 with 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:43.780
 Rain is the same to take turns changing 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:49.360
 Maybe dolls will also do an extra 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:51.610
 between quotation marks showing all my 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.780
 novels with his 500 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.240
 well I have here so there is some 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.780
 Way said the milk you use for coffee 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.440
 the morning of my 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.050
 I think I liked it if video I go 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.530
 like not 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:16.360
 It's good, there's milk in here. 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:22.990
 It's a joke with water and a break. 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:28.120
 my heat and this one is to protect the 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:30.430
 morning that I take is another which is what uses 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:37.560
 lunch as well and is even what 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:41.050
 strawberry to me it says that mourinho 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.940
 I liked funk and I feel good and this 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.490
 here I make you here that the 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:50.140
 juice sachet 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.840
 So these are my three flags. 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.720
 that I know I do not really like 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.680
 you here very little taste last one 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.080
 instrument 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.390
 I think it's very cute and I know it has 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.260
 very happy here but it's even nicer 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.640
 and well then this is it people hope 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.770

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.460
