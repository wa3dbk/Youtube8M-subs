00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.949
 - I have many stories about the Greek philosopher Socrates she talks about 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.739
 loss of quality in amount of silence 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.630
 in the first three 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.630
 this distribution of dark 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.730
 the man who adored with the knife 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.660
 Rosinha tries but with the focus to walk by dissing the marmosets 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.200
 together 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.500
 I should 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 We do not know what people are talking about. 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.240
 21 min 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.150
 in the first race to start counting on other types of stories 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.710
 I stopped 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.710
 so if the stadium alfafa quito 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.510
 vander already started cutting anything until January 16 in Istanbul 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.580
 I do not believe 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.650
 andreis pendrives 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 who wants 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.380
 the first occurrences filter what each word 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 pissarides of his return 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.600
 the first 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 was the first of truth 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.460
 but for what 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.809
 meeting service 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:10.529
 I do not want them to know that 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.719
 lots of stories hanging around 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.789
 but many of them are residents you have already tried to find out if the stories 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:23.709
 counted are not true or not the true sifted divide 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.709
 none of the opponents 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.429
 this resolution 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.149
 ends 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.869
 to amir 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.980
 in the first leg of the 2nd phase 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.980
 after having accepted to do a good job 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.120
 in the second half 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.120
 is the first adult of 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.469
 a teaching throw it here 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:04.889
 I came to the crisis 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.889
 at the end of the exam 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.379
 every day we talk 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.559
 both about various things 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:16.159
 but many of them are bad things about other people 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.650
 that few times I liked the south good things about the river 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.650
 sure what you were going to find me 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.459
 it was a good thing 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.639
 it was a thing 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.639
 as a result 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.209
 muir 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:49.639
 here I do not know no but I can not really say we were shrunk 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.549
 the river animation 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.549
 What is the third row? 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:07.989
 the third is the first to use this 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.509
 yes to create your 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:19.439
 people talk every day but not all talk about subjects 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.639
 have a good afternoon 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.129
 I syndicate something 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.370
 help others 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.680
 something before 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.550
 be good to share with myself 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.550
 It's just love the songs. 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.300
 the alarm 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.300
 club 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.560
 You do not think that sometimes. 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.560
 I said some things including the last program 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.120
 Basque lamb appeared on television 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.120
 everything had run 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:06.069
 All right then 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:11.279
 now that I've talked about the pms let's hear what you have to say 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.719
 state agency 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.939
 but it's because I still can not say if I want the Pope 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.360
 it's a walk through the garden of philosophy 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.580
 one of these days we talked about differences are minimal 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:06:00.069
 even though we only said bad things about a person when he was in his 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.669
 boom 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.979
 sometimes we do not use condoms any more than the Finnish 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:10.809
 pieces with children are nothing more than gossip 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:23.389
 completely borderless and can hurt the person we are talking about. 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.089
 in engineering 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:31.089
 one of the highlights of this conversation 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.659
 'I do not have to thank our thoughts and our 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:44.300
 stay line 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.300
 when the last days begin 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.770
 Can I guarantee what would happen? 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.199
 you do not know if you will use enem as a unique proof 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.099
 I had not everything is possible 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.099
 so last Friday 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:01.529
 - If you have something uncertain 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.589
 remember to sift consensus but is under study 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.939
 with this performance the team with cicinho 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:09.499
 will be halved
