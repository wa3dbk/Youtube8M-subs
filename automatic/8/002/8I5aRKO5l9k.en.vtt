it was in the trench just east of the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.170 
it was in the trench just east of the
March<00:02:38.480> marsh<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.740> found<00:02:40.460> it<00:02:40.610> somewhere<00:02:40.940> else

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
March marsh it I found it somewhere else

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.670 
March marsh it I found it somewhere else
but<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.230> where<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.650> here<00:02:44.320> and<00:02:45.320> we<00:02:45.470> go

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
but this is where it is here and we go

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.449 
but this is where it is here and we go
into<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.010> battle

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.940 

now<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.569> want<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.989> set<00:02:53.319> up<00:02:53.500> just<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.859> little<00:02:53.890> bit

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
now you want to set up just a little bit

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.130 
now you want to set up just a little bit
then<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.040> gotta<00:02:57.219> be<00:02:57.370> quick<00:02:57.609> I<00:02:57.930> mean<00:02:58.930> we're

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
then you gotta be quick I mean we're

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.589 
then you gotta be quick I mean we're
talking<00:02:59.319> fast<00:02:59.739> because<00:03:00.280> he<00:03:01.120> starts<00:03:01.390> counting

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
talking fast because he starts counting

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.530 
talking fast because he starts counting
now<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.829> I<00:03:03.340> don't<00:03:03.670> know<00:03:03.849> what<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> countdown

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
now and I don't know what the countdown

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.349 
now and I don't know what the countdown
seems<00:03:04.989> I'm<00:03:05.290> yeah<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.010> it's<00:03:06.219> a<00:03:06.280> quick<00:03:06.489> counting

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.830 

I'm<00:03:10.359> assuming<00:03:10.780> it's<00:03:11.230> ten<00:03:11.530> thousand<00:03:11.980> needles

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
I'm assuming it's ten thousand needles

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.899 
I'm assuming it's ten thousand needles
hopefully<00:03:13.840> we<00:03:13.989> don't<00:03:14.109> have<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.349> see<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:17.909> but

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
hopefully we don't have to see it but

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.059 
hopefully we don't have to see it but
what<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.900> might<00:03:20.079> do<00:03:20.230> just<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.590> see<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:20.859> if<00:03:20.950> he

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
what I might do just to see it if he

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.129 
what I might do just to see it if he
pops<00:03:21.250> up<00:03:21.430> again<00:03:21.579> I'll<00:03:21.909> start<00:03:22.090> recording<00:03:22.359> and

just so we can see it okay I found them

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.770 
just so we can see it okay I found them
again<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:27.549> time<00:03:27.819> unless<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.269> was<00:03:28.389> attack
