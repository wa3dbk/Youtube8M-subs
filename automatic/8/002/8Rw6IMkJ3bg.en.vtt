00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.390
 well this is a small workshop 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.160
 artisanal luthier 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.340
 and we are dedicated to the construction of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.440
 instruments in the electrical field more 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.599
 than nothing 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.029
 both guitar and bass and some 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:23.119
 little things a little more chiquitas as 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.250
 It can be a Brazilian horse but 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.509
 within the electrical instrument category 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.890
 of rope and in the middle we started 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.890
 I started out of curiosity let's say 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.210
 curiosity about when he had a guitar 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.790
 of disarmament and I saw that there was 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.320
 and then one thing leads to the other 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.820
 I always liked carpentry 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.820
 and I found in this let's say 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:57.200
 my way to the expression as it 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.750
 wants you want to say then I started to 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.330
 build instruments and I started 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.910
 totally self- taught self- taught form 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.240
 snooping first and good after 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.280
 reading a lot of internet 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.080
 looking in forums that there are a lot 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.690
 information 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.730
 and well basically that has been all my 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.690
 learning and I 'm still learning 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.170
 Of course 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.530
 we build electric guitars 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.920
 solid if you hollow me equal under what 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.320
 same 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:36.330
 the basic element would be the wood 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.850
 and good after all the hardware and 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.040
 that is already bought in stores 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.920
 specialized in the raw material of the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.640
 wood 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.060
 and well we make clones of 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.759
 famous brands let's say or develop 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.840
 own designs or the customer that comes 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.670
 with an idea 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.789
 we try to translate it into an instrument 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.710
 what I'm looking for I say serra was the 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.359
 that started in the activity and starting 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.219
 of the knowledge that was acquiring 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.719
 and demand was coming he was 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.429
 they incorporated their two brothers who are 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.190
 who today are among the three 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.170
 working but how long it takes to 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.580
 be a guitar starting from 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.580
 zero until it is ready to deliver 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.180
 the time out there 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.370
 it's hard to measure but 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.150
 approximately it takes us between 2 and 3 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.250
 months an instrument is started with the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.790
 original idea that the client has with 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.819
 what the client wants 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.420
 and from there we go we started 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.060
 work already we take the raw wood 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.200
 after a selection let's say the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.200
 wood that is needed 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.630
 and begin to work until the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.750
 instrument finished the process 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.750
 painting 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.370
 there is a little more 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.810
 complications even that the armed by 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.959
 the theme of time 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.940
 and good another factor is that to impact 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.810
 but more or less three months and for 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.569
 finish an instrument 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.379
 and good the clients arrive 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.780
 through our internet pages 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.680
 or good word of mouth also from 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.950
 someone who already has an instrument 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.480
 our and 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.799
 and comment and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.659
 they do not eat they do not contact us and from 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.290
 there establishes a relationship and you see that 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:37.030
 what the customer is looking for 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.030
 mostly musician of course 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.099
 from all sides argentine musicians 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.650
 we have violas in almost all Argentina 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:48.420
 of the vineyard manager we have built 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.420
 about 80 instrument approximately 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.730
 and already starting in 2007 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.209
 and my brothers were added they came to 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.170
 work with me from 2008 to 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.860
 mid -2008 so it's 15 years already 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.420
 working environment 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.230
 engaged in work we have 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.180
 about a year of laburo today 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.019
 be more 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.019
 well beyond 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.019
 the expectations are to try to follow 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.070
 growing to achieve the instrument of each 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.030
 better quality 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.030
 and good to be able if everything is good to conquer 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.670
 the world as a cartoon said 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.860
 famous internet allows absolutely 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.510
 all this from learning to make a 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.860
 guitar found resources 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.810
 find the suppliers the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.150
 different materials and until after 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.490
 market and be one of the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.470
 recognized at the national level that 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.960
 they make replicas but that also 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.210
 they are starting to put each one of their 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.370
 products or your product talking lysis 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.560
 the first guitar designed and 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.330
 manufactured according to what he wants 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.850
 do and that's where you have the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.590
 expectations to be able to grow and even 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.190
 do not stop dreaming about the possibility of 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.190
 an export 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.490
 The theme of the craft instrument is 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.569
 It is difficult if I go to put machinery 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.569
 a little more sophisticated 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:21.719
 already loses the artisanal character 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.830
 the way to accelerate the processes 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:27.360
 training more people and adding more 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.120
 people to the company let's say but 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.030
 and we will try never to lose the 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.819
 issue of artisanal've crafted 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.159
 because it is what distinguishes us from a 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:41.810
 standard instrument manufactured with 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:45.389
 industrial machine and let's say with 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.590
 cnc cutter and good a lot of 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.139
 technology that we do not want 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.289
 incorporate part that face technology 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.840
 but that takes away from you it takes away your courage 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.270
 added out there the craft product 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.270
 has good added value to achieve 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.310
 produce own models with low 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.820
 our own classification in our 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.160
 own color catalog 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.500
 our own design let's say that what 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.330
 more basically everything that starts 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.880
 in this he starts cloning and then he goes 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.580
 a little bit goes a little bit away from 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.590
 the clones for already acquire identity 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:25.470
 own in our first own model 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.470
 on this guitar called isis 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.830
 and we designed it two years ago 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:37.129
 and we are already building the eighth isis 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:41.110
 so it has had enough acceptance 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.110
 and with possible with perspective d 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.810
 make another combination and hardware 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.350
 another combination of wood 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.200
 but it's good 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.800
 good to keep growing in this follow 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.800
 working 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.900
 and that basically being able to live 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:07.550
 imported too 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:10.610
 the idea that is one of the ideas in the future 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.639
 try to send a guitar out to 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.710
 some specialized place and good to know 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:18.129
 if you can start working for the 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.129
 Exterior 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.960
 so so 

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:33.229
 ah 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.440
 3 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.220
 good
