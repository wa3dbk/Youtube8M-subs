00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:09.470
 what you can use the home boarding was 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.470
 the hero by school 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.490
 Hello 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.120
 and it used to be good things 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.300
 I am here today not need you 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.040
 Very happy, I'll talk to you. 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.670
 because I tried to make a good rally and 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.500
 now it did not work because it's the internet 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.660
 it was not working very well as I 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.969
 I hoped I tried to do the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.019
 live and it did not work and I just ran out of cannon 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.239
 a snack 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.050
 will it be a green thing in the tooth I think 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.789
 that does not 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.489
 well anyway I think you are 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.249
 frustrated as much as me because it's light 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.949
 did not work 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:01:00.149
 but calm staff is not going to stay this way 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.219
 I'm not worried because 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.620
 The same proposal that I made for live I 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.040
 I will not do well there saw how well 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.370
 on earth, I made the knife for you 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.650
 the pancake having coffee with the subscribers 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.880
 I'll do the same thing but instead of 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.670
 be with subscribers 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.340
 I'm going to do with youtube is then 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.890
 Do you want to see something youtube here in my 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.530
 channel leave the yuan 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.230
 down here who you want and with the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.500
 ask what you have to do b 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.440
 So, whoever has more questions will 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.490
 call to join in for coffee 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.340
 with the pancake 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.960
 I think it's cool because it's a way of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.530
 approach you 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 Souto Beers and the subscribers and I think 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.900
 That I'm funny as an interviewer. 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.460
 at least I think so is for example 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.190
 You want a nut in the morsel? 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.650
 is here on the channel then put a 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.119
 crazy in the piece and then your 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.009
 I asked what the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.590
 samuca is on the channel put the samuca 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.810
 and ask the question you have 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.569
 do it for him so I go back reviewing 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.310
 all things for youtube and so on 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.239
 possible bringing them forth the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.090
 channel 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.810

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.880
 follow on facebook and twitter by 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.850
 onlive that did not work for you 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.760

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.069
 to make a live me frustrated the internet did not 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.150
 It worked, I did not even go 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.470

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.720
 because he is capable of blanc 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.790
 It's up to you to follow all the 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.360
 new things that are happening in the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.410

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.640
 One other thing I stayed two weeks out. 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.330
 I know 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.250

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.640
 and only when sugar big and stay a month 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.459
 without talking to him because I have to 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.350

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.380

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.200

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.720
