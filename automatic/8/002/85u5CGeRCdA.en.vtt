infrastructural development that would

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.940 
infrastructural development that would

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
and of course transportation and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.620 
and of course transportation and
integrate<00:04:03.980> Latin<00:04:04.340> American<00:04:04.760> economy<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:05.600> that

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
integrate Latin American economy so that

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.099 
integrate Latin American economy so that
they're<00:04:05.989> not<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:06.890> oriented<00:04:07.489> towards<00:04:08.329> the

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
they're not so oriented towards the

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.680 
they're not so oriented towards the
United<00:04:09.530> States<00:04:09.739> or<00:04:10.100> Europe<00:04:10.130> or<00:04:10.670> up<00:04:11.269> in<00:04:11.480> Russia

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
United States or Europe or up in Russia

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.470 
United States or Europe or up in Russia
so<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:13.010> think<00:04:13.130> that's<00:04:13.609> also<00:04:13.970> part<00:04:14.329> of<00:04:14.420> the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
so I think that's also part of the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.289 
so I think that's also part of the
background<00:04:15.109> to<00:04:15.829> the<00:04:16.160> play<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.459> Russia<00:04:17.030> has

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
background to the play that Russia has

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.789 
background to the play that Russia has
made<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:17.780> think<00:04:18.229> another<00:04:18.380> part<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.739> the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
made I think another part of the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.920 
made I think another part of the
background<00:04:19.039> is<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.700> war<00:04:19.880> in<00:04:20.030> Georgia<00:04:20.419> Russia

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
background is the war in Georgia Russia

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.350 
background is the war in Georgia Russia
came<00:04:21.260> out<00:04:21.410> ahead<00:04:21.560> very<00:04:22.520> clearly<00:04:22.970> and

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
came out ahead very clearly and

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.899 
came out ahead very clearly and
demonstrated<00:04:24.200> to<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.410> world<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:25.039> you<00:04:25.760> know

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
demonstrated to the world that you know

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.490 
demonstrated to the world that you know
there<00:04:26.270> is<00:04:26.300> no<00:04:26.630> way<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.140> United<00:04:27.470> States

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
there is no way that the United States

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.000 
there is no way that the United States
could<00:04:27.860> simply<00:04:28.159> just<00:04:28.430> dictate<00:04:28.970> outcomes<00:04:29.570> are

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
could simply just dictate outcomes are

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.060 
could simply just dictate outcomes are
given

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070

local forces at play and Russia clearly

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.650

Venezuela is open to investment but more
importantly<00:05:15.650> I<00:05:15.740> think<00:05:16.040> it's<00:05:16.190> the

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
importantly I think it's the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.340 
importantly I think it's the
strengthening<00:05:17.300> of<00:05:17.330> regional<00:05:17.870> institutions

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
strengthening of regional institutions

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.920 
strengthening of regional institutions

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
like the bank of the south which these

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.480 
like the bank of the south which these
four<00:05:21.200> countries<00:05:21.380> who've<00:05:21.680> met<00:05:21.830> my<00:05:22.070> nails<00:05:22.280> are

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
four countries who've met my nails are

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.690 
four countries who've met my nails are

touched by this in Latin America so it's

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.470 
touched by this in Latin America so it's
interesting<00:05:33.710> to<00:05:34.070> see<00:05:34.220> them<00:05:34.430> trying<00:05:34.760> to<00:05:35.000> look

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
interesting to see them trying to look

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.120 
interesting to see them trying to look
to<00:05:35.630> foreign<00:05:35.990> powers<00:05:36.320> like<00:05:36.530> Russia<00:05:36.770> and<00:05:36.920> China

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
and more of a practical level because

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.370 
and more of a practical level because
it's<00:05:44.270> always<00:05:44.540> been<00:05:44.720> announced<00:05:45.020> sort<00:05:45.290> of

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
it's always been announced sort of

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.160 
it's always been announced sort of
rhetorically<00:05:46.070> as<00:05:46.250> a<00:05:46.310> bowl<00:05:46.940> and<00:05:47.390> a<00:05:47.480> dream<00:05:47.780> and

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
rhetorically as a bowl and a dream and

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.950 
rhetorically as a bowl and a dream and
an<00:05:48.920> ideal<00:05:49.370> but<00:05:49.820> now<00:05:50.030> it<00:05:50.330> really<00:05:50.480> does<00:05:50.720> seem<00:05:50.840> to

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
an ideal but now it really does seem to

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.800 
an ideal but now it really does seem to
be<00:05:51.020> being<00:05:51.980> realized<00:05:52.430> in<00:05:52.760> practice<00:05:53.570> but<00:05:53.750> i

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
be being realized in practice but i

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.720 
be being realized in practice but i
think<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.170> condition<00:05:54.710> for<00:05:54.890> that<00:05:55.460> is

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
think the condition for that is

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.320 
think the condition for that is
precisely<00:05:55.940> emergence<00:05:56.870> of<00:05:57.050> russia<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:57.800> china

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
precisely emergence of russia and china

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.839 
precisely emergence of russia and china
on<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.570> world<00:05:59.780> stage

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849
