00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.590
 how pathetic sympathetic i am traction and 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.440
 we are in a new video to talk about 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.140
 the new expansion of Europeans 64 that 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.460
 called the conquest of the new world between 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.800
 a lot of news let's go 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.330
 talking little by little and explaining in 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.400
 the images below right on the 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.199
 mini map because it 's one one appears 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.340
 the most important news is that 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.800
 the unexplored areas are going to stop 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.180
 appear on the map that is not the new one 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.640
 world until it is discovered by 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.890
 the Europeans will not appear in the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.250
 same for these expansions we're going 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.860
 there 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.530
 focuses on the new world in 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.220
 North America and good North America sorry 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.870
 in america in general and you achieve more 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.100
 European managers when you get there is 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.500
 what is going to be random what is 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.360
 happened there as it usually happens in 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.699
 japan for example that we arrived and solar 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.400
 and taxes a country more or less then what 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.710
 same in colonization mechanics 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.930
 the undiscovered earth will not appear the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.579
 fear for as I said at the beginning 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.820
 they will have indigenous cultures 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.490
 new events ideas buildings and the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.130
 huge colonies like for example usually 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.130
 be argentina for spain are going to be 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.250
 independent colonies but they are not going to 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.540
 be limited controlled independents 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.300
 for the dominating colony 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.720
 these limited colonies are going to win 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.110
 money will you make me money you with 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.250
 them as domineering power and power 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.930
 trade but they will operate individually 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.910
 they will be able to colonize they will fight against 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.620
 the natives and eventually you can 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.570
 revolt being able to reach 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.310
 total independence 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.800
 you can fight against these nations 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.440
 colonial but may have important 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.810
 consequences in the future therefore 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.689
 It is still highly recommended 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.899
 you can also play as a colony is 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.640
 say you for example you get to colonize 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.740
 Serving the example of Spain with 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.770
 argentina that you get to colonize what 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.930
 It would be with Argentina and it is automatically 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.940
 I suppose you will spend in a colony 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.030
 limited to dominated by tyc between 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.319
 quote this what does it mean that a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.090
 once you have that 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.829
 that the event appears I suppose it is in 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.319
 an event can allow you to switch to 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.969
 play with argentina I do not know if you can 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.030
 invest or you can play again with 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:28.170
 Spain but I do not think it can be done 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.170
 even so there it is 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.680
 also with the launch of this 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.690
 expansion is going to be a patch for the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.970
 base game that will include some of the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.490
 changes of this expansion and so many 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.120
 that what they are going to be in new ways of 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.310
 map I do not know if it refers to the minimap or 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.790
 when you are in the country selection or 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.490
 of nation what would be the time for 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.010
 example the war of functions is 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.630
 Spanish succession the rise of 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.630
 ottomans etcetera more playable nations 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.720
 we will be more native colonies 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.960
 american 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.090
 and of course this of the nations 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.000
 Colonial paints the truth very well 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.610
 very brutal pint did not expect all these 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.319
 changes when they have announced it I thought 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.620
 that it would be something more focused on the 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.930
 countries in the American continent would be 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.879
 what chairs for Europeans but you are 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.700
 seeing that what they are going to do is that you 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:34.480
 force one force like you cheer up 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.790
 to play with the indigenous countries is going to 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.880
 paint pretty well to see how they 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.940
 I have stopped extends a life 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.090
 we were arguing for the right of the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.430
 mp how much this expansion can cost or 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.350
 of the circle you want to call as we are 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.260
 placing around 10 or 15 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.540
 euros in case you're curious 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.100
 anyway, the launch day is 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.640
 on December 11 , 2013 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.640
 Y 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.549
 let's hope it brings some series but 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.110
 will bring a series with an indigenous country or 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.019
 we'll see is with a European because 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.819
 both for both and for the indigenous 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.439
 buy Europeans paint very well 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.049
 this is what you are going to get in your 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:20.280
 games like for example let's put in 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.810
 denmark you arrive in america and there 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.910
 past anything as it happened 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.699
 always in japan because it seems very very 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.060
 very brutal and that you discover the 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.940
 mini map as you discover if good 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.130
 they are great but you understand me is very very 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.650
 very brutal so nothing guys I hope 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.970
 that you liked the video or us 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.970
 you feel goodbye
