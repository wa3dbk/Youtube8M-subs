00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
all right we're back with another repair

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.730 
all right we're back with another repair
this<00:00:06.089> fridge<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.390> not<00:00:06.569> getting<00:00:07.170> cold

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
this fridge is not getting cold

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.009 
this fridge is not getting cold
first<00:00:07.980> we<00:00:08.189> noticed<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.019> refrigerator

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
first we noticed it in the refrigerator

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.959 
first we noticed it in the refrigerator
side<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.530> milk<00:00:10.740> wasn't<00:00:11.070> tasting<00:00:11.820> right

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
side the milk wasn't tasting right

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.299 
side the milk wasn't tasting right
seemed<00:00:12.269> kind<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.540> warm<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.349> ice<00:00:13.559> cube<00:00:14.009> trays

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
seemed kind of warm the ice cube trays

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.950 
seemed kind of warm the ice cube trays
weren't<00:00:14.670> freezing<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> ice<00:00:15.570> cream<00:00:15.839> was

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
weren't freezing and the ice cream was

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.849 
weren't freezing and the ice cream was
soft<00:00:16.310> this<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> GE<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.720> there's<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.619> model

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
soft this is a GE and there's a model

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.490 
soft this is a GE and there's a model
number<00:00:20.220> right<00:00:20.430> there<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:22.080> already<00:00:22.350> know

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
number right there and we already know

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.230 
number right there and we already know
the<00:00:22.740> problem<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.550> hopefully<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.210> is

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the problem here so hopefully this is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.470 
the problem here so hopefully this is
going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.019> help<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.910> if<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> same

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
going to help you if you have the same

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.029 
going to help you if you have the same
problem<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.080> took<00:00:28.230> these<00:00:28.380> two<00:00:28.619> screws<00:00:28.890> out

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
problem so we took these two screws out

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.529 
problem so we took these two screws out
on<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> top<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.670> take<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.029> panel<00:00:30.420> out

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
on the top you can take this panel out

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.190 
on the top you can take this panel out
and<00:00:30.720> that's<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> show<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.219> these<00:00:33.200> coils

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and that's going to show you these coils

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.440 
and that's going to show you these coils
here<00:00:34.559> now<00:00:34.860> if<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:35.910> big<00:00:35.940> block<00:00:36.420> of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
here now if this is all one big block of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.970 
here now if this is all one big block of
ice<00:00:36.890> which<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.219> was<00:00:38.780> then<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.710> know<00:00:40.739> you're

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
ice which this was then you know you're

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.350 
ice which this was then you know you're
going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> same<00:00:41.489> problem<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.090> we

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
going to have the same problem that we

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.500 
going to have the same problem that we
did<00:00:42.710> down<00:00:43.710> here<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> heating<00:00:44.850> element<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
did down here is a heating element and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.100 
did down here is a heating element and
that<00:00:46.070> helps<00:00:47.070> defrost<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.789> ice<00:00:47.969> now<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.899> can

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
that helps defrost the ice now this can

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.619 
that helps defrost the ice now this can
turn<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> block<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.950> ice<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.270> by<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> couple

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
turn to a block of ice for by a couple

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.400 
turn to a block of ice for by a couple
reasons<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.780> break<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> seal

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
reasons if you have a break in the seal

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.689 
reasons if you have a break in the seal
here<00:00:55.969> let's<00:00:56.969> say<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:58.079> close<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.620> freezer<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
here let's say you close the freezer and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.510 
here let's say you close the freezer and
there<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.210> some<00:01:01.140> wrapper<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.710> something<00:01:02.129> or

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
there was some wrapper or something or

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.579 
there was some wrapper or something or
you<00:01:02.550> left<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.030> open<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> little<00:01:04.350> bit<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you left it open like a little bit of a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.670 
you left it open like a little bit of a
gap<00:01:04.769> not<00:01:05.010> fully<00:01:05.280> closed<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:06.689> air<00:01:06.900> flow<00:01:07.290> can

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
gap not fully closed the air flow can

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.210 
gap not fully closed the air flow can
cause<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:09.420> freeze<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:11.010> fridge

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
cause this to freeze up and the fridge

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.830 
cause this to freeze up and the fridge
can<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> hard<00:01:11.939> time<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.479> makes<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
can have a hard time and just makes it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.109 
can have a hard time and just makes it
one<00:01:13.020> big<00:01:13.170> block<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.409> ice<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.369> what<00:01:14.520> happens<00:01:14.909> is

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
one big block of ice and what happens is

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.570 
one big block of ice and what happens is
the<00:01:15.360> air<00:01:15.390> can't<00:01:15.930> flow<00:01:16.439> around<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.549> just

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the air can't flow around and it just

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.870 
the air can't flow around and it just
gets<00:01:17.880> worse<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.390> worse<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
gets worse and worse and so the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.969 
gets worse and worse and so the
refrigerator<00:01:20.880> side<00:01:21.090> won't<00:01:21.330> work<00:01:21.509> either

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
refrigerator side won't work either

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.469 
refrigerator side won't work either
anyway<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.310> took<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.490> blow<00:01:23.729> dryer<00:01:24.090> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
anyway so we took a blow dryer and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.060 
anyway so we took a blow dryer and
melted<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.470> down<00:01:25.650> you're<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
melted this all down you're going to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.679 
melted this all down you're going to
need<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> put<00:01:26.430> some<00:01:26.610> towels<00:01:26.880> down<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.570> as

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
need to put some towels down here as

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.649 
need to put some towels down here as
well<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.670> there's<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> couple<00:01:29.970> ways<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.270> can

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
well and there's a couple ways you can

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.219 
well and there's a couple ways you can
tell<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:32.700> check<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.390> heating<00:01:33.720> element

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
tell if to check your heating element

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.240 
tell if to check your heating element
I'll<00:01:34.470> show<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.369> back

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.350 

this<00:01:38.610> fridge<00:01:38.880> had<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> bad<00:01:39.390> heating<00:01:39.780> element<00:01:41.360> so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
this fridge had a bad heating element so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
this fridge had a bad heating element so
in<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> back<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.200> your<00:01:43.290> fridge<00:01:43.619> let<00:01:43.979> me<00:01:44.070> pull

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
in the back of your fridge let me pull

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.580 
in the back of your fridge let me pull
this<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:51.320> you're<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
this out and get the you're going to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.410 
this out and get the you're going to
need<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> voltmeter<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.820> will<00:01:54.090> test

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
need a voltmeter that will test

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.190 
need a voltmeter that will test
continuity

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.449 

so<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:02.310> set<00:02:02.700> mine<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:06.390> test

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
so I can set mine here to test

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:14.449 
so I can set mine here to test
resistance<00:02:08.990> for<00:02:09.990> continuity<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:13.190> let<00:02:14.190> me<00:02:14.250> go

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
resistance for continuity so let me go

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:21.040 
resistance for continuity so let me go
down<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:16.640> there<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.170> put<00:02:19.920> these<00:02:20.100> together

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
down to there so if I put these together

work you can tell it if it's making a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.040 
work you can tell it if it's making a
connection<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:30.030> right<00:02:30.270> back<00:02:30.540> here<00:02:30.870> if<00:02:30.989> you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
wiggle this one down and it'll come off

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.280 
wiggle this one down and it'll come off
will<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.310> one<00:02:41.520> back<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:42.060> way<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.450> you're

going<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.530> put<00:02:43.739> one<00:02:44.040> lead<00:02:44.370> doesn't<00:02:45.270> matter

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
going to put one lead doesn't matter

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.770 
going to put one lead doesn't matter
which<00:02:45.630> one<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.140> there<00:02:47.330> okay<00:02:48.330> that's<00:02:48.570> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
which one in there okay that's the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.100 
which one in there okay that's the
middle<00:02:49.050> one<00:02:49.290> right<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.780> then<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> other

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
middle one right here and then the other

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.900 
middle one right here and then the other
one<00:02:52.470> on<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:54.120> orange<00:02:54.600> wire<00:02:55.550> wherever<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.730> can

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
one on this orange wire wherever you can

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.479 
one on this orange wire wherever you can
make<00:02:57.209> sure<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.630> have<00:02:58.220> connection<00:02:59.220> with<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
make sure you have connection with the

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.940 
make sure you have connection with the
metal<00:02:59.790> and<00:02:59.940> if<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.720> hear<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.290> beeping<00:03:01.890> noise

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
metal and if you hear a beeping noise

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.180 
metal and if you hear a beeping noise
it's<00:03:02.310> good<00:03:02.549> if<00:03:02.790> not<00:03:03.500> then<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:04.680> probably<00:03:05.160> a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
it's good if not then it's probably a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.060 
it's good if not then it's probably a
bad<00:03:05.400> eating<00:03:05.670> element<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:07.560> let<00:03:07.739> me<00:03:07.860> show<00:03:08.010> you

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
bad eating element so let me show you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:17.979 
bad eating element so let me show you
the<00:03:08.280> heating<00:03:08.610> element<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:10.019> how<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.040> test<00:03:11.370> that

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.390 

all<00:03:18.989> right<00:03:19.200> here<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.769> already<00:03:19.950> took<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.160> off

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
all right here we already took it off

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.789 
all right here we already took it off
but<00:03:20.700> there's<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:20.970> screw<00:03:21.329> here<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.230> screw<00:03:22.560> here

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
but there's a screw here the screw here

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.430 
but there's a screw here the screw here
you<00:03:22.950> undo<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.450> then<00:03:24.660> it's<00:03:25.079> going<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.290> be

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
you undo that and then it's going to be

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.680 
you undo that and then it's going to be
attached<00:03:25.980> with<00:03:26.190> these<00:03:26.489> wires<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.299> blue<00:03:27.510> one

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
attached with these wires the blue one

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.470 
attached with these wires the blue one
on<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:27.989> side<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.980> wiggle<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.459> out<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:30.180> pink

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
on this side you wiggle it out the pink

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.819 
on this side you wiggle it out the pink
one<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:30.989> side<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.400> wiggle<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.880> out

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.740 

then<00:03:37.829> you<00:03:38.070> bend<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.610> well<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:39.450> don't<00:03:39.540> have

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
then you bend this well you don't have

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.470 
then you bend this well you don't have
to<00:03:39.890> if<00:03:40.890> it's<00:03:41.100> good<00:03:41.400> but<00:03:41.700> if<00:03:41.820> it's<00:03:41.970> bad<00:03:42.209> you're

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
to if it's good but if it's bad you're

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.660 
to if it's good but if it's bad you're
going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.720> need<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.959> take<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.320> out<00:03:43.470> by<00:03:44.280> bending

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
going to need to take it out by bending

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.050 
going to need to take it out by bending
these<00:03:44.820> little<00:03:45.060> tabs<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.540> slowing<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:45.989> up

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
these little tabs and slowing this up

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.310 
these little tabs and slowing this up
but<00:03:48.060> because<00:03:48.299> it's<00:03:48.600> hard<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> do<00:03:48.930> one-handed

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
but because it's hard to do one-handed

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.009 
but because it's hard to do one-handed
holding<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.860> camera<00:03:50.100> I'm<00:03:50.310> not<00:03:50.519> going<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:51.019> do

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
holding the camera I'm not going to do

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.759 
holding the camera I'm not going to do
that<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.630> element<00:03:55.049> is<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:57.230> real<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:58.590> a

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
that so this element is a real it's a

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.910 
that so this element is a real it's a
real<00:03:58.950> simple<00:03:59.160> piece<00:03:59.959> so<00:04:00.959> again<00:04:01.230> we<00:04:01.440> have<00:04:01.709> this

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
real simple piece so again we have this

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.229 
real simple piece so again we have this
set<00:04:03.079> there<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.350> test<00:04:04.680> continuity<00:04:05.400> meaning<00:04:05.760> to

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
set there to test continuity meaning to

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.629 
set there to test continuity meaning to
test<00:04:06.449> if<00:04:06.600> there's<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.900> connection<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:08.310> if<00:04:08.519> I

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
test if there's a connection so if I

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.030 
test if there's a connection so if I
connect<00:04:08.970> these<00:04:09.120> wires<00:04:09.329> you

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
connect these wires you

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.949 
connect these wires you
the<00:04:10.159> bead<00:04:10.510> so<00:04:11.510> if<00:04:11.569> I<00:04:11.659> put<00:04:11.900> this<00:04:12.049> one<00:04:12.290> in<00:04:12.469> here

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
the bead so if I put this one in here

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.270 
the bead so if I put this one in here
and<00:04:15.699> this<00:04:16.699> one<00:04:17.739> touch<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:18.919> middle<00:04:19.130> there

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
and this one touch in the middle there

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.840 
and this one touch in the middle there
you<00:04:19.459> hear<00:04:19.699> nothing<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:22.100> that<00:04:22.250> means<00:04:22.490> this

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
you hear nothing so that means this

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.990 
you hear nothing so that means this
there's<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.270> break<00:04:23.690> in<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:24.050> wire<00:04:24.650> here<00:04:25.130> now

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
there's a break in the wire here now

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.040 
there's a break in the wire here now
what's<00:04:26.300> inside<00:04:26.750> here<00:04:27.199> is<00:04:28.360> just<00:04:29.360> like<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.870> can

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
what's inside here is just like you can

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.920 
what's inside here is just like you can
kind<00:04:30.289> of<00:04:30.320> see<00:04:30.470> coiling<00:04:30.949> around<00:04:31.310> in<00:04:31.550> there<00:04:31.930> it's

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
kind of see coiling around in there it's

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.439 
kind of see coiling around in there it's
just<00:04:33.169> like<00:04:33.289> a<00:04:33.320> light<00:04:33.620> bulb<00:04:33.860> or<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:35.330> know

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
just like a light bulb or a you know

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.550 
just like a light bulb or a you know
like<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.840> toaster<00:04:36.410> that<00:04:38.199> you<00:04:39.199> know<00:04:39.320> when<00:04:39.470> you

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
like a toaster that you know when you

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.290 
like a toaster that you know when you
push<00:04:39.710> it<00:04:39.830> down<00:04:39.949> it<00:04:40.100> gets<00:04:40.220> red<00:04:40.400> hot<00:04:40.430> well<00:04:41.150> if

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
push it down it gets red hot well if

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.550 
push it down it gets red hot well if
there's<00:04:41.479> a<00:04:41.570> break<00:04:41.870> in<00:04:42.110> there

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
there's a break in there

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.870 
there's a break in there
you're<00:04:42.800> not<00:04:42.979> going<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.190> see<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.430> get<00:04:43.580> red-hot

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
you're not going to see it get red-hot

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.390 
you're not going to see it get red-hot
this<00:04:44.180> is<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.810> same<00:04:45.020> thing<00:04:45.289> this<00:04:45.889> gets<00:04:46.190> real

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
this is the same thing this gets real

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.060 
this is the same thing this gets real
hot<00:04:46.639> and<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:46.970> melts<00:04:47.509> to<00:04:47.930> self<00:04:48.320> defrost<00:04:48.740> all<00:04:48.949> the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
hot and it melts to self defrost all the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.120 
hot and it melts to self defrost all the
ice<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:50.360> anyway<00:04:50.990> that's<00:04:51.169> it<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:51.620> we<00:04:51.740> had<00:04:51.889> to<00:04:51.979> get

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
ice so anyway that's it so we had to get

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.120 
ice so anyway that's it so we had to get
a<00:04:52.340> new<00:04:52.449> one<00:04:53.449> of<00:04:53.570> these<00:04:53.690> which<00:04:54.020> was<00:04:54.259> actually<00:04:54.680> I

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
a new one of these which was actually I

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.089 
a new one of these which was actually I
think<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.610> tea<00:04:55.669> box<00:04:55.940> from<00:04:56.599> a<00:04:56.720> local<00:04:57.050> guy<00:04:57.259> but<00:04:58.009> you

think a tea box from a local guy but you

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.270
