and decided to replace the rods and main
bearings<00:00:18.910> everything<00:00:19.450> looked<00:00:19.630> fine<00:00:19.690> there

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
bearings everything looked fine there

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.340 
bearings everything looked fine there
but<00:00:20.320> still<00:00:20.770> had<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.010> knock<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:22.330> a<00:00:22.840> buddy<00:00:23.260> of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
but still had the knock and a buddy of

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.810 
but still had the knock and a buddy of
mine<00:00:23.410> was<00:00:23.680> telling<00:00:23.920> me<00:00:23.980> that<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.340> wrist<00:00:24.580> pins

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
mine was telling me that the wrist pins

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.460 
mine was telling me that the wrist pins
are<00:00:25.060> a<00:00:25.620> weak<00:00:26.620> link<00:00:26.860> in<00:00:27.160> turbo<00:00:28.000> engines<00:00:28.600> and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
are a weak link in turbo engines and

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.690 
are a weak link in turbo engines and
what<00:00:29.590> I<00:00:29.620> found<00:00:29.800> out<00:00:30.039> is<00:00:30.220> when<00:00:30.370> I<00:00:30.400> pulled<00:00:30.640> the

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
what I found out is when I pulled the

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.739 
what I found out is when I pulled the
pistons<00:00:31.119> is<00:00:31.330> every<00:00:32.230> one<00:00:32.500> of<00:00:32.590> my<00:00:32.680> pistons<00:00:33.129> are

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:33.749 
pistons is every one of my pistons are

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:37.079 
pistons is every one of my pistons are
well<00:00:34.749> cracked<00:00:35.109> no<00:00:35.440> I<00:00:35.469> say<00:00:35.710> broke<00:00:36.640> or<00:00:36.820> whatever

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.089 
well cracked no I say broke or whatever

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:37.979 
well cracked no I say broke or whatever
but<00:00:37.210> anyway<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:37.539> can<00:00:37.659> see<00:00:37.780> right<00:00:37.929> through

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
but anyway you can see right through

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.729 
but anyway you can see right through
there<00:00:38.409> this<00:00:39.159> is<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.429> worst<00:00:39.609> one<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:41.530> was

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
there this is the worst one this was

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.649 
there this is the worst one this was
number<00:00:42.030> four<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:43.870> you<00:00:44.469> got<00:00:44.999> crack<00:00:45.999> going<00:00:46.269> from

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
number four and you got crack going from

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:47.219 
number four and you got crack going from
the<00:00:46.809> oil

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:47.229 
the oil

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.219 
the oil
groove<00:00:48.010> all<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.309> way<00:00:48.429> down<00:00:48.699> to<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.839> wrist<00:00:50.019> pin

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:50.229 
groove all the way down to the wrist pin

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:59.119 
groove all the way down to the wrist pin
area<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:53.609> the<00:00:54.609> remainder<00:00:55.440> Pistons<00:00:56.440> all<00:00:57.370> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
area and the remainder Pistons all the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.729 
area and the remainder Pistons all the
there<00:01:00.129> was<00:01:00.249> a<00:01:00.280> hairline<00:01:00.639> crack<00:01:01.440> down<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:02.649> the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
there was a hairline crack down in the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.640 
there was a hairline crack down in the
bottom<00:01:03.100> of<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.399> wrist<00:01:04.239> pin<00:01:04.590> actually<00:01:05.590> the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
bottom of the wrist pin actually the

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.250 
bottom of the wrist pin actually the
topside<00:01:06.420> bottom<00:01:07.420> looking<00:01:07.630> down<00:01:07.870> here<00:01:08.050> but<00:01:08.200> you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
topside bottom looking down here but you

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.540 
topside bottom looking down here but you
can<00:01:08.410> see<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.680> down<00:01:08.800> there<00:01:08.950> at<00:01:09.040> like<00:01:09.280> six

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
can see it down there at like six

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.940 
can see it down there at like six
o'clock<00:01:10.980> that's<00:01:11.980> cracked<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.990> this<00:01:14.590> one<00:01:14.770> was

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
o'clock that's cracked and this one was

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.150 
o'clock that's cracked and this one was
actually<00:01:15.100> broken<00:01:15.460> on<00:01:15.610> both<00:01:15.850> both<00:01:16.510> sides<00:01:17.160> about

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
actually broken on both both sides about

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.740 
actually broken on both both sides about
5:30<00:01:18.970> there<00:01:19.300> you<00:01:19.450> can<00:01:19.600> see<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:20.820> small<00:01:21.820> crack

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
5:30 there you can see a small crack

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.280 
5:30 there you can see a small crack
going<00:01:23.410> through<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.740> bore<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:24.460> wristband<00:01:24.850> so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
going through the bore that wristband so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.230 
going through the bore that wristband so
anyway<00:01:26.290> what<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.620> have<00:01:26.920> is<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:29.430> had<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.460> rotating

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
anyway what I have is I had a rotating

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.640 
anyway what I have is I had a rotating
block<00:01:31.420> her<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.870> short<00:01:32.680> block<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.100> e<00:01:33.490> 21<00:01:33.910> and<00:01:34.690> you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
block her a short block of e 21 and you

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.770 
block her a short block of e 21 and you
got<00:01:35.800> a<00:01:36.010> 30<00:01:36.310> here<00:01:37.530> 1984<00:01:38.790> with<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.940> wrist<00:01:40.540> pin

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
got a 30 here 1984 with the wrist pin

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.340 
got a 30 here 1984 with the wrist pin
here<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:42.220> this<00:01:42.490> is<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.850> e21<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.110> tell

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
here and this is the e21 and you tell

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.260 
here and this is the e21 and you tell
see<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.460> wrist<00:01:45.850> pins<00:01:46.120> are<00:01:47.050> a<00:01:47.320> lot<00:01:48.270> taller

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
see that the wrist pins are a lot taller

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.640 
see that the wrist pins are a lot taller
or<00:01:49.630> longer<00:01:49.660> on<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:51.040> e21<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:53.110> pistons<00:01:53.500> are

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
or longer on the e21 the pistons are

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.610 
or longer on the e21 the pistons are
designed<00:01:54.040> a<00:01:54.130> little<00:01:54.340> bit<00:01:54.430> different<00:01:54.820> where<00:01:55.620> it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
designed a little bit different where it

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.000 
designed a little bit different where it
has<00:01:56.800> a<00:01:56.830> wider<00:01:57.960> boss<00:01:58.960> area<00:01:59.760> for<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.880> wrist<00:02:01.659> pin

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
has a wider boss area for the wrist pin

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.149 
has a wider boss area for the wrist pin
so<00:02:03.010> I<00:02:04.380> believe<00:02:05.380> these<00:02:05.650> are<00:02:05.710> going<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:05.980> be<00:02:06.130> a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
so I believe these are going to be a

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.469 
so I believe these are going to be a
little<00:02:06.310> bit<00:02:06.520> stronger<00:02:06.940> than<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.530> e30<00:02:08.979> pins<00:02:09.880> or

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
little bit stronger than the e30 pins or

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.160 
little bit stronger than the e30 pins or
pistons<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.170> should<00:02:11.319> say

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
pistons I should say

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.340 
pistons I should say
the<00:02:14.070> wrist<00:02:14.280> pens<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.880> mean<00:02:15.570> they<00:02:15.690> were<00:02:15.750> there's

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
the wrist pens I mean they were there's

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.940 
the wrist pens I mean they were there's
nothing<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:17.580> was<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> tight<00:02:18.000> fit<00:02:18.030> still<00:02:18.950> no

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
nothing it was a tight fit still no

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.790 
nothing it was a tight fit still no
damage<00:02:20.340> there<00:02:20.480> we<00:02:21.480> have<00:02:21.630> forged<00:02:21.930> rods<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.590> both

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
damage there we have forged rods in both

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.470 
damage there we have forged rods in both
engines<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.950> 30<00:02:26.340> on<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.700> e21<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
engines and the 30 on the e21 so the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.930 
engines and the 30 on the e21 so the
rods<00:02:30.870> are<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.050> little<00:02:31.140> bit<00:02:31.290> different<00:02:31.940> we'll

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
rods are a little bit different we'll

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.260 
rods are a little bit different we'll
see<00:02:33.090> here<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.690> there's<00:02:34.380> an<00:02:34.530> oil<00:02:34.620> hole

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
see here that the there's an oil hole

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.110 
see here that the there's an oil hole
the<00:02:36.270> e21<00:02:36.690> where<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.350> e30<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.100> doesn't<00:02:38.880> have

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
the e21 where the e30 is doesn't have

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.230 
the e21 where the e30 is doesn't have
one<00:02:39.390> for<00:02:39.840> some<00:02:39.990> reason<00:02:40.380> just<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.850> one<00:02:42.000> up<00:02:42.120> on

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
one for some reason just the one up on

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.140 
one for some reason just the one up on
top<00:02:42.510> anyway<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.530> think<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.950> e30<00:02:44.520> rod<00:02:44.820> looks<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
top anyway I think the e30 rod looks a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.060 
top anyway I think the e30 rod looks a
lot<00:02:45.330> better<00:02:45.990> even<00:02:46.560> though<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.800> little<00:02:46.980> bit

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
lot better even though it's a little bit

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.020 
lot better even though it's a little bit
smaller<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.840> anyway<00:02:49.410> we'll<00:02:49.740> get<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.850> thing

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
smaller but anyway we'll get this thing

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.460 
smaller but anyway we'll get this thing
back<00:02:51.180> up<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.570> running<00:02:52.580> with<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.760> e21<00:02:54.470> pistons

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
back up and running with the e21 pistons

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.620 
back up and running with the e21 pistons
and<00:02:55.680> see<00:02:56.459> what<00:02:56.580> happens<00:02:57.440> later<00:02:58.440> guys
