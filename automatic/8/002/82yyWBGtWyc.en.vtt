 I am you in this video wants 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.759
 I show you today like you 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.039
 cool paint works out how much it 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.949
 is dark and now it's getting light 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.410
 I think the paint really cool 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.990
 I have it so I have the paint on 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.960
 my cars and now I want to show 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:37.950
 as he gets to you as a conclusion the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:43.680
 tuning workshop purely then she opens 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.649
 After that, painting also great fabra 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.710
 secunda color depending on 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.719
 then it goes on metallic very much 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.129
 important so it's only metallic 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.719
 then she goes on graphit that 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:04.769
 third and then it goes with circle 1 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.860
 back then will appear below here 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.860
 perfect so i'll give you one now 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.600
 say if it is normal so if the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.850
 For example, often goes then stands around 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.920
 not perfect if I make him now 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.080
 for example black looks down here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.509
 no project is that last 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.060
 However metals climb on metallic goes 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.060
 it then appears on graphite below 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.909
 perfect and that is the specific one 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.950
 I really like the paint and the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.680
 So there's a lot of paint 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.270

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.640
 I like it very much too 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.610
 how does her look dark and so bright 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.439
 really cool the color more like most 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.280
