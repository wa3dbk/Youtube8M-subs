00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
because if you think about it they're

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.300 
because if you think about it they're
all<00:01:40.750> four<00:01:41.170> doors<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:41.710> four<00:01:41.920> doors<00:01:42.100> are

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
all four doors so four doors are

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.100 
all four doors so four doors are
unlimited<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:43.420> this<00:01:43.570> happens<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.930> be<00:01:43.990> a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
unlimited so this happens to be a

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.460

wrangler<00:01:44.650> unlimited<00:01:45.299> altitude<00:01:46.299> and<00:01:46.570> we<00:01:47.350> hope

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
wrangler unlimited altitude and we hope

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.800 
wrangler unlimited altitude and we hope
it's<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.770> same<00:01:47.950> sort<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.450> altitude<00:01:49.450> we<00:01:49.630> get
