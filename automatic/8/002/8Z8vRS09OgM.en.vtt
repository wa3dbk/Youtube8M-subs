yo this is mattv2099 and today I'm going to show you how your AK (ak-47, akm) might fire when you actuate the safety lever

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:27.053
a month or two ago one of my subscribers shared a video with me where he tells a tale about how with his centurion c39

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.560
he basically flipped the safety lever up and his gun fired. however, his safety lever actually went above the dust cover

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.120
lets see if I can make it happen.. it went above the dust cover like this

00:00:40.134 --> 00:00:41.734
even further than that.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.960
like that. OK

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.640
so he flipped it up like that and his rifle discharged.

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:54.494
I'm going to show you why that may be. a lot of you already know

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:57.656
some of you don't. I'm going to demonstrate it.

00:00:57.688 --> 00:00:59.608
with this rifle. that's a c39

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.340
basically there's two types of ak47 safety levers

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.083
there's the original full auto. they call it the full auto. it's just the original style.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.760
and then this is what's called a semi auto safety lever. basically they chopped a notch out of the full auto lever

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.040
if you chop it about right there.

00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:33.125
leave that much left

00:01:36.372 --> 00:01:43.372
so, basically when you flip this up with the full auto safety. it will actuate your disconnect. disconnect the hammer and fire the rifle.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.300
now when you flip this one up, since it's notched, it will bypass your disconnect.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.140
so what happened. the dude had a round chamberd. he flipped his safety up. his safety went above the dust cover. triggered the disconnect. released the hammer.

00:02:02.268 --> 00:02:03.468
and fired a round.

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:11.397
if you do it properly. something is probably wrong with his dust cover. it shouldn't go above the dust cover.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.120
I've never experienced that. except just now when I did it on purpose. all of mine work as intended.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.820
that's something you need to know about if you have a full auto safety in your rifle. that's something that can happen.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.740
if you have the dust cover off. in order to remove the safety

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.240
lets demonstrate this

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:43.988
lets say we want to take this safety lever out. pull up like this and it comes right out.

00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:48.034
if that was a full auto one it would release the hammer.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:52.293
you can't do that without releasing the hammer. I'll show you.

00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:54.320
right here on this centurion c39,

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:59.915
I have my c39. I've upgraded my remote firing rig.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:01.772
it's nicer than it used to be.

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:06.393
c39 comes with a full auto safety

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.100
you lift it and bam

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.100
I have a flashlight in there now. lets cock the hammer

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.620
pull up the safety

00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:29.651
so now what I'm going to do is load the rifle. and we are going to fire a round that way.

00:03:29.768 --> 00:03:35.288
it's not that dangerous. we are contained here. it's just going to fire like normal

00:03:35.288 --> 00:03:36.729
into our targets and our earthen backstop

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.420
I pretend a lot of the stuff I do is dangerous to piss people off. but this really isn't dangerous.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.280
we have one live cartridge here.

00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:56.076
lets put it in the chamber.

00:03:56.377 --> 00:03:57.417
it's in the bolt

00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:00.487
we have a round chambered

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.900
have my operator gloves on and my ear protection on

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.200
ok let's do this.

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:33.248
I hope that made sense. actuating a full auto safety.

00:04:33.248 --> 00:04:38.094
al ot of people will do a modification to their safeties where they cut that little groove

00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:40.320
however if you cut it wrong. you'll need a new safety.

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:45.489
you can order one anywhere.

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:47.600
it's a good upgrade or replacement

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.840
I should make a video on my second channel. best ak47 upgrade. full auto to semi auto safety

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.650
select lever

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.460
why is this safety bent

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.220
I think that's the one that came with the c39

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.335
hopefully that can save somebody from a seriously terrible situation

00:05:03.216 --> 00:05:08.336
that's one thing you must know about an ak47 akm. if you have a full auto safety

00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:16.615
don't lift this unless you are 100 percent certain the gun is empty

00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:18.272
thanks for watching. mattv2099 out
