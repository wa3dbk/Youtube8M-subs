the<00:00:18.210> drum<00:00:18.420> module<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.869> 16<00:00:19.350> step<00:00:19.680> sequencer

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
the drum module is a 16 step sequencer

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.200 
the drum module is a 16 step sequencer
with<00:00:20.580> five<00:00:20.880> channels<00:00:21.380> including<00:00:22.380> kick<00:00:22.710> snare

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
with five channels including kick snare

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.169 
with five channels including kick snare
closed<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.510> open<00:00:24.810> hats<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.320> extras<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:29.179> can

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
closed and open hats and extras you can

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.640 
closed and open hats and extras you can
independently<00:00:30.420> adjust<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> pitch<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.529> each

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
independently adjust the pitch of each

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.850 
independently adjust the pitch of each
channel<00:00:33.079> you<00:00:34.079> also<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> number<00:00:34.710> of

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
channel you also have a number of

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.920 
channel you also have a number of
samples<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> choose<00:00:35.640> from<00:00:35.820> which<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.780> can

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
samples to choose from which you can

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.069 
samples to choose from which you can
toggle<00:00:37.170> by<00:00:37.469> clicking<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.920> sample<00:00:38.219> window

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.510 

so<00:00:43.079> toggle<00:00:43.530> through<00:00:43.649> those<00:00:43.829> channels<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
so toggle through those channels and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.100 
so toggle through those channels and
light<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.910> those<00:00:45.059> steps<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.660> you'll<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
light up those steps and you'll have a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:01:00.790 
light up those steps and you'll have a
beat<00:00:46.350> going<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.710> no<00:00:46.829> time<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.879> reverse<00:01:00.180> switch

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
beat going in no time the reverse switch

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.799 
beat going in no time the reverse switch
you<00:01:01.800> guessed<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.699> reverses<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.390> sample

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you guessed it it reverses the sample

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.440 
you guessed it it reverses the sample
the<00:01:04.739> volume<00:01:05.100> fader<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.460> also<00:01:05.820> independent<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the volume fader is also independent to

the volume fader is also independent to
each<00:01:06.540> channel<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> might<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.010> wondering

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
each channel so you might be wondering

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130 
each channel so you might be wondering

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.919 

it's<00:01:58.490> fun<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.850> just<00:01:59.030> experiment<00:01:59.359> and<00:01:59.719> draw

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
it's fun to just experiment and draw

the<00:02:15.840> Volks<00:02:16.140> filter<00:02:16.530> or<00:02:16.740> Foreman<00:02:17.310> filter<00:02:17.700> is

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
the Volks filter or Foreman filter is

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.930 
the Volks filter or Foreman filter is
becoming<00:02:18.210> increasingly<00:02:18.660> popular

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.670 

combined<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.840> with<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.960> bit<00:02:25.140> crusher<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.590> you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
combined it with a bit crusher and you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.990 
combined it with a bit crusher and you
get<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.920> Skrillex<00:02:26.370> sound

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.080 

you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.709 

Oh

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:34.719 
Oh

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.119 
Oh
the<00:02:35.719> symp<00:02:35.959> section<00:02:36.349> is<00:02:36.439> quite<00:02:36.650> similar<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
the symp section is quite similar to the

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.309 
the symp section is quite similar to the
base<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.819> modulate<00:02:38.239> your<00:02:38.269> gate<00:02:38.569> pitch<00:02:39.019> and

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
base just modulate your gate pitch and

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.140 
base just modulate your gate pitch and
choose<00:02:40.099> your<00:02:40.129> sound<00:02:40.489> by<00:02:40.700> clicking<00:02:41.030> in<00:02:41.120> the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.670 
module you can make six patterns or
parts<00:02:59.480> for<00:02:59.900> both<00:03:00.049> base<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.680> sim<00:03:02.409> this<00:03:03.409> will<00:03:03.590> be

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
parts for both base and sim this will be

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.020 
parts for both base and sim this will be
useful<00:03:03.829> in<00:03:04.129> the<00:03:04.189> next<00:03:04.459> section<00:03:04.760> when<00:03:04.909> we

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
useful in the next section when we

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.990 
useful in the next section when we
