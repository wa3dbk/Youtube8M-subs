Jaso<00:00:21.050> there's<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.170> valve<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:23.250> shuts<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
Jaso there's a valve here that shuts the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.340 
Jaso there's a valve here that shuts the
gasoline<00:00:24.300> off<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.720> doesn't<00:00:24.750> come<00:00:25.170> into

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
gasoline off so it doesn't come into

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.599 
gasoline off so it doesn't come into
here<00:00:25.680> from<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:27.060> tank<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.920> then<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.160> loosen

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
here from the tank and then you loosen

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.370 
here from the tank and then you loosen
this<00:00:30.349> to<00:00:31.349> drop<00:00:31.590> these<00:00:32.930> arms<00:00:33.930> off<00:00:34.140> whatever

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
this to drop these arms off whatever

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.350 
this to drop these arms off whatever
they're<00:00:34.680> called<00:00:35.360> they<00:00:36.360> fit<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.690> right<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.260> on

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
they're called they fit in right here on

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.119 
they're called they fit in right here on
both<00:00:39.360> sides<00:00:40.760> come<00:00:41.760> on

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
both sides come on

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.440 
both sides come on
so<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.430> holds<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> glass<00:00:45.000> bowl<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
so that's what holds the glass bowl and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.670 
so that's what holds the glass bowl and
place<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.690> sediment<00:00:46.289> bowl<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.570> then<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.899> just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
