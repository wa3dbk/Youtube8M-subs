reason behind this design and this idea

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.810 
reason behind this design and this idea
was<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:15.710> we<00:01:15.979> really<00:01:16.280> wanted<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.610> push

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
was that we really wanted to push

was that we really wanted to push
forward<00:01:17.150> in<00:01:17.710> getting<00:01:18.710> an<00:01:18.830> idea<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.310> weapon<00:01:20.210> that

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
forward in getting an idea a weapon that

what all the guys are using out in the
field<00:02:36.230> we<00:02:36.380> don't<00:02:36.530> want<00:02:36.680> special<00:02:36.920> calibers<00:02:37.460> we

field we don't want special calibers we

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.530 
field we don't want special calibers we
don't<00:02:37.820> think<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.060> that's<00:02:38.150> going<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.420> be

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
don't think that that's going to be

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.240 
don't think that that's going to be
something<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:38.930> resources<00:02:39.830> are<00:02:39.980> going<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.130> be

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
something that resources are going to be

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.190 
something that resources are going to be
available<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.760> steadily<00:02:41.540> replenish<00:02:42.050> those

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
supplies sticking with this design is

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.150 
supplies sticking with this design is
going<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.750> be<00:02:44.810> able<00:02:44.960> to<00:02:45.110> allow<00:02:45.290> soldier<00:02:46.040> to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
going to be able to allow soldier to

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.650 
going to be able to allow soldier to
soldier<00:02:46.310> be<00:02:46.640> able<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.820> trade<00:02:47.030> magazines<00:02:47.510> in

soldier be able to trade magazines in

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.980 
soldier be able to trade magazines in
and<00:02:47.840> out<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.050> have<00:02:48.140> ready<00:02:48.500> available<00:02:49.010> ammo

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
and out and have ready available ammo

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.300 
and out and have ready available ammo
again<00:02:50.990> this<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.260> just<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.500> prototype<00:02:51.710> design

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
again this is just a prototype design

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.950 
again this is just a prototype design
that<00:02:52.520> Magpul<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:52.970> working<00:02:53.300> on<00:02:53.420> this<00:02:53.660> isn't

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
that Magpul is working on this isn't

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.420 
that Magpul is working on this isn't
something<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.290> we're<00:02:54.530> we're<00:02:55.100> coming<00:02:55.370> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
something that we're we're coming to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.550 
something that we're we're coming to
production<00:02:55.760> with<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:56.570> just<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.810> concept<00:02:57.200> idea

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
production with it's just a concept idea

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.990 
production with it's just a concept idea
right<00:02:57.800> now<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.190> we<00:02:58.280> think<00:02:58.490> is<00:02:58.580> going<00:02:58.790> places

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
right now that we think is going places

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.040 
right now that we think is going places
and<00:02:59.330> we're<00:02:59.420> spending<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.750> lot<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.930> time

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
and we're spending a lot of time

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.600 
and we're spending a lot of time
researching<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.860> doing<00:03:00.980> what<00:03:01.250> we<00:03:01.370> can<00:03:01.550> to

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
researching and doing what we can to

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.940 
researching and doing what we can to
come<00:03:01.970> up<00:03:02.120> with<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.540> new<00:03:02.900> innovative<00:03:03.230> ideas<00:03:03.680> and

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
come up with a new innovative ideas and

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.260 
come up with a new innovative ideas and
we<00:03:04.010> think<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.490> going<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.700> be<00:03:04.820> take<00:03:05.000> some

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
we think this is going to be take some

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.620 
we think this is going to be take some
ideas<00:03:06.020> that<00:03:06.140> we<00:03:06.230> have<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.590> next<00:03:06.620> level<00:03:07.160> so

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
ideas that we have to the next level so

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.380 
ideas that we have to the next level so
that's<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.810> PDR
