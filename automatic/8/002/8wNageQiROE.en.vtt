there<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.800> think<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:36.030> could<00:00:36.300> win<00:00:36.570> if<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.930> get<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
there I think we could win if we get the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.869 
there I think we could win if we get the
first<00:00:37.350> gone<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.100> if<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.309> don't<00:00:38.489> create<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
first gone but if we don't create the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.430 
first gone but if we don't create the
first<00:00:39.090> gone<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.480> can't<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.079> think<00:00:40.290> they'll

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
first gone we can't see I think they'll

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.619 
first gone we can't see I think they'll
win<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:41.250> when<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.239> heads<00:00:42.480> go

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
win that's when we can see that heads go

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.990 
win that's when we can see that heads go
down<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.649> yeah<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.430> massive<00:00:44.820> game
