00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
got a great texture here so we're going

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.830 
got a great texture here so we're going
to<00:00:44.460> start<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> satin<00:00:45.059> design<00:00:45.329> normally<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
to start with a satin design normally I

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
to start with a satin design normally I
would<00:00:46.079> blow-dry<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.370> love<00:00:47.670> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
would blow-dry that in but I love this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.860 
would blow-dry that in but I love this
texture<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.329> think<00:00:48.480> we're<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> keep

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
texture so I think we're going to keep

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.720 
texture so I think we're going to keep
it<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.200> start<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.710> sounds<00:00:50.219> awesome

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.399 

we<00:00:56.730> put<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.089> set<00:00:57.629> design<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.289> to

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
we put the set design and I'm going to

00:00:58.409 --> 00:00:59.930 
we put the set design and I'm going to
divide<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> nerves<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> divide<00:00:59.519> into<00:00:59.670> three

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
divide the nerves and divide into three

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.509 
divide the nerves and divide into three
sections<00:01:00.589> we're<00:01:01.589> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.769> go<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> slight

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
sections we're going to go on the slight

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.969 
sections we're going to go on the slight
diagonal<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.179> everything<00:01:03.570> looks<00:01:03.979> together

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
diagonal so everything looks together

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.310 
diagonal so everything looks together
spin<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:06.180> don't<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.509> be<00:01:06.630> too<00:01:06.840> too<00:01:07.020> picky

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
spin you don't have to be too too picky

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.280 
spin you don't have to be too too picky
about<00:01:07.350> your<00:01:08.509> sectioning<00:01:09.509> it's<00:01:09.659> nice<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> have

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
we're going to put a little bit of the

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.260 
we're going to put a little bit of the
essence<00:01:13.710> absolute<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> give<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.759> hair<00:01:15.000> a
