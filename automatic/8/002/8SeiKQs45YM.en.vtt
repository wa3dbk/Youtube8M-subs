don't<00:01:54.500> have<00:01:54.590> enough<00:01:54.799> port<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:55.340> constantly

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
don't have enough port so you constantly

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.070 
don't have enough port so you constantly
have<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:55.909> tweak<00:01:56.120> the<00:01:56.210> settings<00:01:56.390> or<00:01:56.690> reposition

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
have to tweak the settings or reposition

life is hard it is alright it's kind of
a<00:02:03.290> first<00:02:03.470> world<00:02:03.740> problem<00:02:03.940> very<00:02:04.940> much<00:02:05.150> so<00:02:05.390> oh<00:02:05.570> so

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
a first world problem very much so oh so

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.630 
a first world problem very much so oh so
it's<00:02:06.110> not<00:02:06.170> easy<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.500> set<00:02:06.740> up<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.040> get<00:02:07.340> working

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
it's not easy to set up and get working

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.609 
it's not easy to set up and get working
damn<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.060> purified<00:02:08.629> water<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.049> amazing

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
damn you purified water and amazing

damn you purified water and amazing
projection<00:02:10.099> devices<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:11.420> very<00:02:11.629> easy<00:02:11.900> there

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
projection devices it's very easy there

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.559 
projection devices it's very easy there
are<00:02:12.439> only<00:02:12.560> three<00:02:12.860> inputs<00:02:13.280> including<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:13.879> HDMI

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
are only three inputs including one HDMI

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.149 
are only three inputs including one HDMI
which<00:02:15.019> they<00:02:15.170> did<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.379> conserve<00:02:15.650> space<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.129> I

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
which they did to conserve space and I

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.830 
which they did to conserve space and I
think<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.340> was<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> wise<00:02:16.610> choice<00:02:16.670> now<00:02:17.510> some<00:02:17.720> will

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
think it was a wise choice now some will

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.839 
think it was a wise choice now some will
say<00:02:17.870> switching<00:02:18.290> from<00:02:18.409> a<00:02:18.470> ps3<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.069> 360<00:02:19.640> will

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
say switching from a ps3 to a 360 will

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.039 
say switching from a ps3 to a 360 will
require<00:02:20.209> swapping<00:02:20.689> wires

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
require swapping wires

I<00:02:21.200> say<00:02:21.769> get<00:02:22.129> a<00:02:22.189> multi<00:02:22.610> input<00:02:22.819> HDMI<00:02:23.510> box<00:02:23.750> but

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
I say get a multi input HDMI box but

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.780 
I say get a multi input HDMI box but
like<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.319> lot<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.620> people<00:02:24.800> have<00:02:24.920> those<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.670> know

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
like a lot of people have those you know

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.430 
like a lot of people have those you know
yeah<00:02:26.060> or<00:02:26.240> you'll<00:02:26.390> run<00:02:26.569> a<00:02:26.599> run<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.170> all<00:02:27.260> through

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
yeah or you'll run a run it all through

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.020 
yeah or you'll run a run it all through
receiver<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:27.980> then<00:02:28.069> run<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.310> receiver<00:02:28.640> to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
receiver and then run the receiver to

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.360 
receiver and then run the receiver to
the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
factor the offspring menus aren't pretty

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.720 
factor the offspring menus aren't pretty
but<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.650> shouldn't<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.129> staring<00:02:32.549> at<00:02:32.640> the

they'll<00:02:34.739> get<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.950> job<00:02:35.129> done<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.610> set<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
they'll get the job done you can set the

mercury<00:02:51.450> lamps<00:02:51.810> which<00:02:52.170> are<00:02:52.260> not<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.590> course

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
mercury lamps which are not of course

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.259 
mercury lamps which are not of course
environmentally<00:02:53.340> friendly<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.000> said<00:02:54.150> this

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
environmentally friendly and said this

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.750

projector<00:02:54.659> uses<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> hybrid<00:02:55.319> laser<00:02:55.920> LED<00:02:56.549> light

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
projector uses a hybrid laser LED light

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.000 
projector uses a hybrid laser LED light
which<00:02:57.239> is<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.510> course<00:02:57.840> way<00:02:58.290> better<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
which is of course way better for the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.259 
which is of course way better for the
environment<00:02:59.129> for<00:02:59.790> those<00:02:59.909> who<00:03:00.030> don't<00:03:00.180> know

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
environment for those who don't know

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.520 
environment for those who don't know
that<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.480> make<00:03:00.659> mercury<00:03:01.019> by<00:03:01.140> choking<00:03:01.349> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
that you make mercury by choking a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.530 
that you make mercury by choking a
dolphin<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.700> much<00:03:02.910> better<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.239> go<00:03:03.329> this

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
dolphin so it's much better to go this

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.210 
dolphin so it's much better to go this
way<00:03:03.690> also<00:03:03.959> if<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.230> mercury<00:03:04.560> bulb<00:03:04.709> breaks<00:03:04.980> and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
way also if the mercury bulb breaks and

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.740 
way also if the mercury bulb breaks and
it<00:03:05.280> gets<00:03:05.430> out<00:03:05.609> it's<00:03:05.819> really<00:03:05.940> toxic<00:03:06.180> or<00:03:06.510> gets<00:03:06.660> in

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
it gets out it's really toxic or gets in

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.330 
it gets out it's really toxic or gets in
the<00:03:06.810> landfill<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.319> did<00:03:07.470> not<00:03:07.620> know<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:07.829> I<00:03:08.160> did

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the landfill I did not know that I did

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.190 
the landfill I did not know that I did
not<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.519> was<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.120> off<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.450> much<00:03:09.540> mercury<00:03:10.079> in

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
not I was just it off so much mercury in

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.710 
not I was just it off so much mercury in
them<00:03:10.379> anyway<00:03:10.920> alright<00:03:11.760> picture<00:03:12.120> quality<00:03:12.510> here

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
them anyway alright picture quality here

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.849 
them anyway alright picture quality here
we<00:03:12.810> could<00:03:12.930> talk<00:03:13.109> about<00:03:13.379> dolphin

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
we could talk about dolphin

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:14.809 
we could talk about dolphin
oh<00:03:13.890> no<00:03:14.159> let's<00:03:14.340> talk<00:03:14.400> about<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.640> picture

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
oh no let's talk about the picture

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.490 
oh no let's talk about the picture
quality<00:03:14.909> it<00:03:15.540> actually<00:03:15.810> depends<00:03:16.079> on<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.379> room

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
quality it actually depends on the room

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.160 
quality it actually depends on the room
itself<00:03:16.799> 2000<00:03:17.700> lumens<00:03:17.790> for<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.510> bulb<00:03:18.780> which

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
itself 2000 lumens for this bulb which

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.839 
itself 2000 lumens for this bulb which
is<00:03:19.200> average<00:03:19.859> but<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:20.159> is<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.430> brightest

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
is average but it is the brightest
