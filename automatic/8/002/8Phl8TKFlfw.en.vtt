was<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.039> research<00:01:48.520> study<00:01:48.789> whereas<00:01:49.719> Body<00:01:49.960> Works

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
was a research study whereas Body Works

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.499 
was a research study whereas Body Works
is<00:01:50.380> not<00:01:50.649> about<00:01:50.920> research<00:01:51.399> at<00:01:51.579> all<00:01:51.729> it's<00:01:52.149> more

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
is not about research at all it's more

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.389 
is not about research at all it's more
about<00:01:52.689> prevention<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.740> families<00:01:54.100> learning

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399

activity<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.289> nutrition<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.979> so<00:01:57.850> we<00:01:58.030> had<00:01:58.179> to

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
activity and nutrition and so we had to

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.059 
activity and nutrition and so we had to
really<00:01:58.569> do<00:01:58.749> a<00:01:58.780> little<00:01:58.990> bit<00:01:59.139> of<00:01:59.170> education<00:01:59.859> as

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
really do a little bit of education as

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.720 
really do a little bit of education as
we<00:02:00.520> recruited<00:02:01.060> they<00:02:02.049> have<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:02.740> much<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.310> do

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
we recruited they have so much to do

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.970 
we recruited they have so much to do
and<00:02:03.910> they<00:02:04.090> have<00:02:04.300> so<00:02:04.720> many<00:02:04.750> other<00:02:05.140> priorities

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
and they have so many other priorities
