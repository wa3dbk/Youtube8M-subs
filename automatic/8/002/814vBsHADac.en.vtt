00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 all as they are very good I'm going to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.319
 teach how to make these hairstyles that 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.940
 I hope you like it and if you want 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.940
 learn to make them keep looking 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.440
 here we will make a normal braid 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:29.849
 but doing it like backwards so that 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.849
 that way that we take to after 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 i 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.000
 this way 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.720
 and good if you like it if you leave it loose 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.400
 as well as I show you there or if not for the 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.700
 school ark does not leave color 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.700
 loose hair is brown and ready 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.740
 all right 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.729
 yes 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.590
 here we tied our hair 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.710
 as I'm seeing there and this hairstyle 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:49.170
 to make it a bit difficult but let's 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.170
 see what is easier than what I think 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.290
 we make a hole 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.030
 and we passed the whole queue in the middle of 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.030
 all that space we get 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.910
 we pull everything and take the pigtail and 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.910
 we squeeze 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.180
 and this one seemed difficult but it's easier 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.180
 about you think 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.370
 all right 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.379
 yes 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.760
 Now we need to walk all the hair 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.860
 well well well above once you 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.910
 well up or as far as you think 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.600
 convenient we tighten and take out a 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.690
 Tuft quoted from the bottom once 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.620
 that you already have your tuft quoted we make a 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.620
 braid in normal 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.590
 two 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:07.590
 once your braid is tied 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.080
 we're going to wrap all that pigtail with 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.310
 the braid 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.700
 as we see 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.700
 and to ensure we take some pins 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.260
 and we put it until we have the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.260
 precision as we want 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.490
 but it's one of the easiest hairstyles 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.790
 as we see we throw ourselves well all the 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.790
 hair 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.129
 and until now 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.499
 yes 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:04.090
 once well braided the cambas bouquets and 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:04.090
 we wrap it as we see there 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:17.260
 and we are adjusting it with some bobby pips 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.260
 how are we seeing there 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.500
 and also 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.610
 look 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.689
 great 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.750
 this is a braid that you could say 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:40.330
 a little weird or normal but it's on 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.889
 make a normal catch a hair of 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.479
 outside with a milk and continue with the 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.240
 that we took the same 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.200
 we take the one we're going to take 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.430
 return 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.250
 and we put it normal and we continue 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:01.470
 doing a normal braid here or if 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:05.280
 we take back 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.940
 same as the previous one if we do not have the 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:13.060
 loose hair you tie it and ready 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.690
 I hope you have searched for them 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.690
 and not 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.529
 and I hope they do or have some video 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:22.629
 let me leave it down as a video
