00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
we're for reaching different sections

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.040 
we're for reaching different sections
and<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:41.940> building<00:02:42.239> different<00:02:42.450> sections<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
and for building different sections and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.440 
and for building different sections and
then<00:02:43.110> game<00:02:43.920> scoring<00:02:44.250> certain<00:02:44.849> games<00:02:45.030> going<00:02:45.300> is

then game scoring certain games going is

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.120 
then game scoring certain games going is
these<00:02:45.959> influence<00:02:46.440> markers<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:46.890> every<00:02:47.099> time

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
these influence markers so every time

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.890 
these influence markers so every time
you<00:02:47.280> build<00:02:47.610> one<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.030> stones<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.450> take<00:02:48.690> one

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
you build one of the stones to take one

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.020 
you build one of the stones to take one
behind<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.319> screen<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.010> don't<00:02:50.190> know<00:02:50.310> why

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
behind the screen so you don't know why

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.120 
behind the screen so you don't know why
how<00:02:51.180> many<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.780> contributed<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.950> first

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
how many you contributed and the first

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.949 
how many you contributed and the first
place<00:02:53.340> gets<00:02:53.549> some<00:02:53.880> bonus<00:02:54.090> points<00:02:54.120> sacrifices

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
place gets some bonus points sacrifices

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.489 
place gets some bonus points sacrifices
thanks<00:02:55.890> very<00:02:56.040> much<00:02:56.099> for<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.310> interview
