as long as I needed it to during the day
I<00:04:29.750> do<00:04:30.110> have<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.500> charge<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:30.830> every<00:04:30.950> night<00:04:31.220> but

I do have to charge it every night but

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.370 
I do have to charge it every night but
that's<00:04:31.610> kind<00:04:31.850> of<00:04:31.910> a<00:04:32.030> go<00:04:32.390> figure<00:04:32.720> type<00:04:32.930> thing<00:04:33.170> I

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
that's kind of a go figure type thing I

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.740

love<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.160> feel<00:04:34.610> in<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.910> wait<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:35.330> think<00:04:35.420> the

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
love the feel in the wait I think the

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.060 
love the feel in the wait I think the
screen<00:04:36.050> could<00:04:36.320> be<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.530> little<00:04:36.800> bit<00:04:36.920> better

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
screen could be a little bit better

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.460 
screen could be a little bit better
since<00:04:37.640> it<00:04:37.790> is<00:04:37.910> kind<00:04:38.150> of<00:04:38.270> low<00:04:38.390> low<00:04:38.780> res<00:04:38.990> as<00:04:39.230> far

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
since it is kind of low low res as far

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.900 
since it is kind of low low res as far
as<00:04:39.560> I'm<00:04:39.710> concerned<00:04:40.130> but<00:04:40.340> it's<00:04:40.580> good<00:04:40.880> enough

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
as I'm concerned but it's good enough

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.880
