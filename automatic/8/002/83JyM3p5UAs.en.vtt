 go five more packs to 25000 in 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.259
 in fact all credits 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.509
 we get used to rally real madrid and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.799
 philipp lahm and philipp lahm four years 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.380
 is of general it is a pleasure 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.490
 between 2000 and 22000 credit to that makes 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.740
 fun to have little players like 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.229
 that then it does not necessarily cost either 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.689
 extremely expensive but it allows me 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.070
 to have some credit this fight that 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.460
 is completely at the level picks 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.720
 credit 1 since that since ben voila 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.549
 since I was able to credit on this 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.810
 account it's a little hot for the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.710
 series text drop but hey we go there 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.710

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.909
 scrambled it's a keeper who is at 77.2 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.280
 general but it's still a 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.020
 shape and it's nice that we do not have 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.030
 stats either disgusting but 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.789

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.330
 a little set up for now we're a 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.989
 little bit saved because I wanted 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.910
 really have a shape it was 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.629
 last pack at 25000 clears out hope 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.010
 hit heavy 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.110
 the credits that we have left 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.040
 to open with twenty fifteen ac packs 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.220
 a thousand I'm going to get there 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.370
 So we had to have azpilicueta duhaime who told you 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.030
 nothing or mick terrien michael essien 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.760

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.860
 has still typed the philippe lavoué of 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.519
 rooney and a shape so that's when 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.829
 same pleasure 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.090
 I would have liked to have a more 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.060
 big a shape but hey it's like that 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.340
 we are going to finish with Easter Island 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.500
 fifteen thousand it is possible that I had 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.450
 heavy again this time we 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.180
 will look on the other hand and we go for it 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.950
 so due emenike for the first pack 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.780
 ok guys listened to me I could have 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.940
 some credits on the take account 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.340
 the best I will sell all that beats 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.709
 wayne rooney philipp lahm and then well 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.959
 sure the inform for me it's a little bit of 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.150
 credit to buy me so players 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.590
 for the Belgian text what will it be 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.850
 very complicated that's why it's me 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.620
 takes a little longer than 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.660
 usually go out the text the beast 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.940
 number 8 if I'm wrong it's because 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.079
 that this is going to be complicated of the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.790
 do it but I will try to do it 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.799
 do not worry what we are going to do 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.150
 is that I had planned the coup we go 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.250
 so go to my main account 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.930
 to open so tell them that to 25 who 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.940
 is hoping this time to have a 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.290
 little luck in the test by tiga and 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.970
 so we end up on my account 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.849
 main this time where i opened 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.220
