let's get right into it we starting off
with<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> certain<00:00:26.550> depth<00:00:26.760> which<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.090> fret<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
with the certain depth which is fret to

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.690 
with the certain depth which is fret to
one<00:00:29.570> down<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.840> two<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.320> front<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.189> down

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
one down and two so front to one down

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000 
one down and two so front to one down
and<00:00:32.969> two<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.140> my<00:00:34.290> screen<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.649> see<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.890> is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and two so on my screen you see it is

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.600 
and two so on my screen you see it is
front<00:00:35.309> Y<00:00:35.489> its<00:00:36.090> then<00:00:37.079> down<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.559> way<00:00:37.710> looks<00:00:38.399> like

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
front Y its then down the way looks like

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.639 
front Y its then down the way looks like
this<00:00:39.770> fare<00:00:40.770> very<00:00:40.800> easy<00:00:41.660> through<00:00:42.660> hit<00:00:42.870> move

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.229 

you're<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.920> practice<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.340> until<00:00:47.730> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you're going to practice that until you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.560 
you're going to practice that until you
can<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> flawlessly<00:00:49.910> easily<00:00:50.910> without<00:00:51.210> even

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
can do a flawlessly easily without even

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.619 
can do a flawlessly easily without even
thinking<00:00:51.930> about<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.210> then<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.360> want<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
thinking about it and then we want to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.430 
thinking about it and then we want to
move<00:00:54.840> up<00:00:55.969> now<00:00:56.969> after<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> certain<00:00:57.870> depth<00:00:58.079> we

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
move up now after the certain depth we

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.959 
move up now after the certain depth we
don't<00:00:58.620> hit<00:00:58.829> him<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> inner<00:00:59.399> struggles

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
don't hit him with the inner struggles

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.020 
don't hit him with the inner struggles
which<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.949> basically<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
which is basically it's just the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.200 
which is basically it's just the
beginning<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.719> certain<00:01:04.080> depth<00:01:05.000> that's<00:01:06.000> all

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
beginning of a certain depth that's all

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.260 
beginning of a certain depth that's all
it<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:07.430> there's<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.640> same<00:01:08.939> thing<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it is there's that same thing and you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.600 
it is there's that same thing and you
see<00:01:12.450> how<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> let<00:01:12.869> him<00:01:12.960> drop<00:01:13.260> don't<00:01:14.010> try<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> hit

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
see how I let him drop don't try to hit

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.510 
see how I let him drop don't try to hit
them<00:01:14.729> don't<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.509> into<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> inner<00:01:15.960> struggles

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
them don't go into the inner struggles

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.499 
them don't go into the inner struggles
immediately<00:01:17.520> after<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> certain<00:01:18.330> depth

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
immediately after the certain depth

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.649 
immediately after the certain depth
because<00:01:19.290> you'll<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.390> you'll<00:01:21.390> miss

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
because you'll do this and you'll miss

you want to let them drop a little bit
and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.970> then<00:01:26.970> hit<00:01:27.270> them<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.570> so

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and then and then hit them with it so

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.429 
and then and then hit them with it so
practice<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.560> couple<00:01:28.650> times<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:30.439> now

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
practice that a couple times and now

practice that a couple times and now
let's<00:01:31.710> move<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:33.350> now<00:01:34.350> after<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> inner

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
let's move on now after the inner

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.789 
let's move on now after the inner
struggles<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.180> only<00:01:36.299> hit<00:01:36.509> them<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> soul

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
struggles we only hit them with a soul

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.730 
struggles we only hit them with a soul
ball<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:39.479> know<00:01:39.659> exactly<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.380> looks<00:01:40.590> like

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
ball you know exactly what it looks like

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.350 
ball you know exactly what it looks like
you've<00:01:41.009> seen<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.400> million<00:01:41.610> times

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
you've seen it a million times

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.090 
you've seen it a million times
well<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.259> maybe<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.950> your

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
well I don't know maybe you have in your

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.030 
well I don't know maybe you have in your
head<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:45.780> let<00:01:46.259> me<00:01:46.380> hit<00:01:46.500> them<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.829> right

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
head but let me hit them with that right

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.219 
head but let me hit them with that right
there

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
there

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.510 
there
so<00:01:49.229> practice<00:01:50.570> doing<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:52.490> building<00:01:53.490> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so practice doing that building that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.039 
so practice doing that building that
muscle<00:01:54.000> memory<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:56.210> mean<00:01:57.210> by<00:01:57.509> practicing<00:01:57.990> is

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
muscle memory I mean by practicing is

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.230 
muscle memory I mean by practicing is
coming<00:01:58.350> from<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> beginning<00:01:58.920> anyway<00:01:59.240> you're

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
coming from the beginning anyway you're

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.600 
coming from the beginning anyway you're
going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.509> building<00:02:00.719> their<00:02:00.930> muscle<00:02:01.229> memory

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
going to be building their muscle memory

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.459 
going to be building their muscle memory
that's<00:02:02.610> why<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> do<00:02:03.180> combos<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.630> have

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
that's why I like to do combos that have

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.520 
that's why I like to do combos that have
like<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.799> same<00:02:05.130> moves<00:02:05.460> inside<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.630> combo<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
like the same moves inside of combo to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.160 
like the same moves inside of combo to
know<00:02:07.680> let's<00:02:07.920> practice<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.369> from<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> top

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.910 

being<00:02:14.170> very<00:02:14.349> user<00:02:14.680> already<00:02:14.950> at<00:02:15.370> 21%<00:02:19.920> they're

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
being very user already at 21% they're

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.300 
being very user already at 21% they're
very<00:02:21.580> easy<00:02:22.319> let's<00:02:23.319> keep<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.739> moving

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
very easy let's keep it moving

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.479 
very easy let's keep it moving
now<00:02:25.209> after<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:26.170> jump<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.769> mean<00:02:27.069> after<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
now after the jump I mean after the

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.160 
now after the jump I mean after the
syllabi<00:02:27.910> long<00:02:28.239> hit<00:02:28.420> them<00:02:28.510> with<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> jump<00:02:28.989> up

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
syllabi long hit them with a jump up

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.540 
syllabi long hit them with a jump up
lunch<00:02:29.470> but<00:02:30.280> not<00:02:30.459> one<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.700> those<00:02:31.680> were<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.860> come
