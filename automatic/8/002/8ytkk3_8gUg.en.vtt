00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.220 
like to see how I make my hammocks and
since<00:00:12.090> I'm<00:00:12.210> still<00:00:12.420> having<00:00:12.630> computer<00:00:13.200> problems

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
since I'm still having computer problems

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.530 
since I'm still having computer problems
it's<00:00:13.860> kind<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.610> fixed<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.059> kind<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.360> not

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
it's kind of fixed it's kind of not

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.630 
it's kind of fixed it's kind of not
fixed<00:00:15.990> there's<00:00:16.199> something<00:00:16.529> with<00:00:16.680> something

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
fixed there's something with something

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.000 
fixed there's something with something
wrong<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.300> trackpad<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:19.140> my<00:00:19.529> computer

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
wrong with the trackpad on my computer

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.370 
wrong with the trackpad on my computer
so<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.880> little<00:00:21.060> harder<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.689> edit<00:00:22.050> videos

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
so it's a little harder to edit videos

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.529 
so it's a little harder to edit videos
since<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.160> have<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.430> click<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.060> trackpad

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
since I have to click the trackpad

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.939 
since I have to click the trackpad
really<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.230> hard<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.830> work

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
really really hard for it to work

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
really really hard for it to work
properly<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.599> decided<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.960> could<00:00:28.109> just<00:00:28.289> go

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
properly so I decided I could just go

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.779 
properly so I decided I could just go
ahead<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.859> since<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> site

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
need to have the right sides together

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.330 
need to have the right sides together
you<00:01:57.210> remember<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.979> inside

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
you remember that and when it's inside

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
out and stuff like that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.889 
out and stuff like that
but<00:02:01.439> she<00:02:01.560> does<00:02:01.710> usually<00:02:01.950> specify<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.060> have

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
noticed that she has UPenn a lot of time

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.559 
noticed that she has UPenn a lot of time
when<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.590> don't<00:02:07.799> really<00:02:07.979> need<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.369> pin<00:02:08.819> so

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
when you don't really need to pin so

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.750 
when you don't really need to pin so

go on you can kind of tell where you're
not<00:02:20.530> really<00:02:20.800> needing<00:02:21.069> them<00:02:21.190> at<00:02:21.310> all<00:02:21.459> but<00:02:22.420> um<00:02:22.599> so

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
not really needing them at all but um so

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.290 
not really needing them at all but um so
this<00:02:23.140> one<00:02:23.319> here<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.709> just<00:02:23.830> go<00:02:24.280> ahead<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.700> seam

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
this one here you just go ahead and seam

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.140 
this one here you just go ahead and seam
it<00:02:25.450> while<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.989> right<00:02:26.170> side<00:02:26.470> out<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:27.099> then<00:02:27.700> you

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
it while the right side out and then you

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.430 
it while the right side out and then you
flip<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.569> out<00:02:29.130> or<00:02:30.130> inside<00:02:30.489> out<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.970> then<00:02:31.660> she

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
flip it out or inside out and then she

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.699 
flip it out or inside out and then she
wants<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.120> top<00:02:34.120> stitch<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.080> top<00:02:35.110> here

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
wants you to top stitch on the top here

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.199 
wants you to top stitch on the top here
and<00:02:35.739> this<00:02:36.160> definitely<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.730> needed<00:02:37.090> because

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
and this definitely is needed because

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.030 
and this definitely is needed because
makes<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.660> hammock<00:02:37.900> look<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> lot<00:02:38.410> better<00:02:38.650> when

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
makes the hammock look a lot better when

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.490 
makes the hammock look a lot better when
it's<00:02:39.220> finished<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.849> then<00:02:40.630> just<00:02:40.959> fold<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.380> over

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
it's finished and then just fold it over

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.150 
it's finished and then just fold it over
like<00:02:41.799> she<00:02:41.980> has<00:02:42.129> here<00:02:42.549> so<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.330> cotton<00:02:43.780> or<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
like she has here so the cotton or the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.970 
like she has here so the cotton or the
fleece<00:02:45.670> sides<00:02:46.090> are<00:02:46.510> touching<00:02:47.440> each<00:02:47.650> other<00:02:47.830> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
fleece sides are touching each other the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.670 
fleece sides are touching each other the
one<00:02:48.099> with<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.459> print<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.299> then<00:02:50.230> you're

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
one with the print on it and then you're

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.680 
one with the print on it and then you're
going<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.099> this<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.760> where<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:51.910> didn't<00:02:52.269> pin<00:02:52.480> I

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
going to this is where I didn't pin I

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.360 
going to this is where I didn't pin I
didn't<00:02:53.049> pin<00:02:53.200> here<00:02:53.410> on<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.650> one<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.069> just<00:02:54.099> went

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
didn't pin here on this one I just went

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.350 
didn't pin here on this one I just went
ahead<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:55.019> sew<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.079> line<00:02:56.470> right<00:02:56.739> there<00:02:57.040> and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
ahead and sew to line right there and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.920 
ahead and sew to line right there and
then<00:02:58.360> you'll<00:02:59.049> flatten<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.590> out<00:03:00.599> like<00:03:01.599> it<00:03:01.720> says

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
then you'll flatten it out like it says

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.030 
then you'll flatten it out like it says
here<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:03.329> then<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:04.930> will<00:03:05.079> end<00:03:05.290> up<00:03:08.040> sewing

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
here and then you will end up sewing

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.390 
here and then you will end up sewing
again

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.940 

and<00:03:16.569> then<00:03:17.569> keep<00:03:17.930> going<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.409> one<00:03:18.530> has<00:03:18.680> quite<00:03:18.920> a

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
and then keep going this one has quite a

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.680 
and then keep going this one has quite a
few<00:03:19.129> steps<00:03:19.310> because<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:19.819> a<00:03:19.849> little<00:03:20.060> bit<00:03:20.540> of

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
few steps because it is a little bit of

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.770 
few steps because it is a little bit of
a<00:03:20.780> complicated<00:03:21.230> hammock<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.450> then<00:03:23.569> you<00:03:23.629> just

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
a complicated hammock so then you just

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.680 
a complicated hammock so then you just
fold<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.110> over<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.680> then<00:03:25.010> you're<00:03:25.280> going<00:03:25.459> to

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
fold it over and then you're going to

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.070 
fold it over and then you're going to
sew<00:03:26.690> along<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.200> line<00:03:27.500> here<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.480> then<00:03:29.480> you're

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
sew along this line here and then you're

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.339 
sew along this line here and then you're
done<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:31.129> it<00:03:31.819> should<00:03:32.209> end<00:03:32.420> up<00:03:32.659> looking<00:03:33.110> like

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
done so it should end up looking like

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.520 
done so it should end up looking like
this<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:35.329> just<00:03:35.510> go<00:03:35.599> ahead<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.200> put<00:03:36.440> the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
this and I just go ahead and put the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.990 
this and I just go ahead and put the
grommets<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.250> sides<00:03:37.459> there<00:03:37.700> like<00:03:37.849> she's

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
grommets and the sides there like she's

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.569 
grommets and the sides there like she's
got<00:03:38.180> there<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.810> hang<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:40.099> this<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.430> the

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
got there and hang it so this is the

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.750 
got there and hang it so this is the
Reddy's<00:03:40.909> favorite<00:03:41.510> one<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.489> she<00:03:43.489> even<00:03:43.549> has
