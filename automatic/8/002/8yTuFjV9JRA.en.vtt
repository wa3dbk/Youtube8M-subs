00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.939
 we do not have this iphone 4 that we want 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.540
 use to explain when not 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.640
 load what we are going to do and what we can do 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.269
 review to be able to give you solution 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.310
 Then the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.730
 connecting the charger to know if it is 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.310
 he the load flex that is failing 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.869
 then we must review 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:32.379
 and here on line 8 and 9 of the 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:36.489
 flex the freight driver line 8 and 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:41.170
 9 2 4 6 8 and 9 must have 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.660
 approximately 5.1 volts we go to all 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.260
 we put one track land and the other 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.060
 in the foot we put our multimeter 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.030
 placed in continuous voltage 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:58.450
 on the scale of 20 and let's measure we're going 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.450
 to count the finite 24 68 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.960
 there we see the pine 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.960
 how to make good contact 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.830
 with a little better 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.460
 let's count 2 4 6 and 8 in our 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.580
 first they just approached 5.1 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.510
 volts that the voltage is line 8 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.230
 there's the line 9 and that voltage 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.990
 towards continuity here is urine that 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.700
 we see here the coils here are the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.710
 who receive that voltage to do 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.200
 load the other negative line and it goes 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.330
 always land this page here in 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.079
 of having continuity in the same pin in 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:51.460
 the 89 2 4 6 and 8 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.470
 continue with this circular towards there 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.619
 towards the devices to the regulators 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.380
 of voltage to then go to the pin of the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.700
 battery that connector is four of 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.500
 four points 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.720
 the first is land has to have 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.820
 contains a land here 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.460
 has the earth and the second one 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.520
 then the positive and will not have then 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.140
 continuity but to circuits and 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.270
 related to it in google 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.550
 we found this the scheme of these 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.250
 pins because in some case I'm 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.090
 explaining when it does not load then 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.010
 when I do not charge to not be this one 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.230
 soon giving the flex and the strap is 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.360
 sending that voltage would not be failure of 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.610
 flex and not already of the time and some other 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.870
 circuit can be these coils that are 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.830
 damage and others or the battery itself 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.110
 so 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.220
 after explaining that if it's coming 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.600
 voltage we're going to test the battery and the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.430
 We are going to try the battery 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.020
 following way already knowing that the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:57.080
 positive is the pin that is towards this 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.000
 side inward is this one from here towards 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.800
 inside the battery more towards the middle 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.320
 and that the negative would be the first 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.170
 so I'm going to test how high it is 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.390
 this battery because if you do not have the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.900
 adequate voltage will never turn on here 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.590
 has 351 normal for it to light 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.050
 at least it would be 3.7 does not have it but at 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.090
 less when you connect the charger goes to 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.590
 have to show that you are loading 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.590
 let's say that's true 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.890
 at least he would have to show that he is 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.090
 loading 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.090
 which seems 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.610
 and we see it affirmatively we are 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.030
 showing that they are loading this they 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.860
 because the voltage is 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.130
 what's in the battery reached 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.990
 response to the circuit that has to do 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.440
 with the charge it will not turn on until 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.990
 have enough charge 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.820
 but at least establishing charges but 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.970
 what are we going to do when we meet 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.370
 with a battery that feels nothing 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.590
 I wanted it to serve us because it is 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.470
 totally dead and that the phone 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.490
 wants to turn on then let's do 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.980
 the next we have the battery 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.400
 in 0 let's test the voltage of that 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.419
 battery here we see what 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.419
 that the battery 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.810
 0.1 is a voltage 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.990
 so to speak, it's totally kills 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.139
 the battery and what is watching the 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.490
 polarity 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.819
 let's solder the two wires 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.669
 one positive and one negative we already know 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:49.340
 that the positive is inward in 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.180
 negative that this stay towards the 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.180
 edge of matter 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.370
 and we do that to revive the battery 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.249
 because if we do not laugh it the phone does not go 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.589
 to be able to 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.009
 paste it and it's going to touch us buy another 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:04.009
 drums 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.789
 of what 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.410
 already joel of the positive cable we are going to 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.410
 drop on the whole negative cable 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.080
 remember the polarity and this is going to 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.270
 serve to make the first review 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.670
 when i'm left with an iphone 4 iphone 5 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.500
 dead the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.240
 test the battery voltage since 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.740
 these phones are complicated in 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.500
 Regarding the load if you do not have the 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.600
 original charger will never charge if 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.820
 the battery is completely dead 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.150
 will load then here we see already the 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.100
 soldiers here at the end of the track 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.770
 positive and to the outside on the track 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.780
 negative and now I'm going to put it to charge 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.420
 this same upload your use for rules 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.450
 such the chargers of the salts with 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.760
 which are of this charger is 1200 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.190
 milliamps ago 2000 amperes missile 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.180
 mini amps to be able to relive the 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.040
 so what am I going to do 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.300
 let's try here quickly what is 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.300
 what happens 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.300
 here now on the battery pin 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.900
 Oh 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.960
 0.0 volts and when you connect it 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.960
 directly with a charger then 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.560
 look what you have marked 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.560
 will mark me 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.300
 3 volts and it's going up slowly and I 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.770
 I'm going to be regulating the battery 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.919
 be performing until it 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.050
 3.7 as soon as it reaches 3.7 I'm going to 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.630
 disconnect I'm going to connect it to 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.530
 iphone to the cell phone this serves for iphone 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.509
 4 iphone 5 to be able to give solution of 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.120
 soon if the battery died if 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:50.560
 we managed to download totally or if not 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.120
 we have the charger and at the same time the 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.610
 original charger is not capable of 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.320
 give life back to the battery and we were 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.240
 will download to the point that it's not going 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.880
 to turn this on would be the first 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.010
 review and a short explanation of what 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.960
 do when we got an iphone from 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.090
 those that do not turn on at least the first 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.560
 helpful step arauca technical service
