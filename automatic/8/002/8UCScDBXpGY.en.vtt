00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
 ah 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.000
 first of all congratulations for the 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.150
 season that you are doing and my 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.279
 question would be what do you prepare the 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.810
 matches like in the warm up if 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.390
 you have some ritual to motivate you and 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.430
 come out one hundred percent concentrated 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.189
 usual before the game I do not have 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.250
 many like seeing one 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.980
 and then undaunted in an hour and a half 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.160
 before party and I have enough 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.960
 time to prepare me shot a little 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.890
 before sending and 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.320
 then I stretch a little more after 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.110
 the high stretch my laces a 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.119
 last time and it's already not ready 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 for the good match the question was 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:57.630
 rodeo we have adapted to the team as yes 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.070
 if he has taken it well from the city of 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.380
 Saragossa 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.480
 so good to see what you think about 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.640
 about the topic 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.940
 my colleagues have accepted me very 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.550
 well sometimes they are very good people and 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.890
 very positive kids and I knew as 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.440
 lovers my arrival from here 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.400
 Well, we are a very good group 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:27.130
 very positive and everything is fine 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.470
 people have welcomed me amazing and the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.080
 I like city very much, I like it a lot 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.400
 live here I like to go to the cinema in 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.790
 aragonia and I live here with my girlfriend and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.580
 we spent a little bit and everything is already there 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.590
 perfect for me you've also noticed 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.100
 much difference between the daughter league 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 Croatian and the Spanish acb there is great 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.170
 difference of course between the league 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.990
 Croatian League of Endesa from my point of 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.830
 view force to become stronger in 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.050
 all of europe but also in croatia and 34 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.810
 teams that play in europe and that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.690
 They carry great tradition and great tradition 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.869
 of basketball but you can not compare 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.380
 with league endesa is played good we go 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.300
 this because they are going to do this thanks 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.959
 there is a great television and with equipment 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.420
 nationally many years ago and everything and the 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.310
 people like basketball and play 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.120
 sure there are many good players 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.590
 but here in ligando this is another 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.400
 or talked about it as you would like 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.750
 play it as a forward or as a pivot for me 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.599
 it's the same I think when you play in 4 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.590
 you can get more advantage because you 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:47.049
 defend slower players than you 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.150
 but it does not matter when I play 3 I can 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.670
 help with my releases of three and 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.459
 for me it's more important is more 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.209
 important to be on track and 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.620
 coach 17 for me is equal now me 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.720
 I would like to know what you feel 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.250
 when is when are you going to have a shot and 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.610
 you see all the pavilion roaring looking 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.890
 caicay 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.900
 it's an incredible feeling for me 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.170
 because I 've never played in a pavilion 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.040
 as nice as this one and when it's full 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:20.150
 and people scream is magnificent and me 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.100
 I like it very much, I feel very comfortable and 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.120
 very happy and it is precisely that is a 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.910
 good shot that also how is office 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.360
 is basketball I started when I was very 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:36.290
 7 years old because I wanted to be 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:41.120
 with my brother and if my brother had 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.840
 played in football or safe handball 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.760
 Me too but 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.939
 I will start started in a very team 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:54.190
 inzaghi small maximum and then when 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:57.210
 I have improved in a bigger team and 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.210
 I'm here now 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.220
 I hope you expect another very important thing 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.800

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.800
