00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
100 frames per second running and then

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.190 
100 frames per second running and then
it<00:00:32.189> suddenly<00:00:32.369> drops<00:00:32.790> all<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.940> way<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.120> 40<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
it suddenly drops all the way to 40 and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.620 
it suddenly drops all the way to 40 and
a<00:00:34.710> slowly<00:00:35.070> gains<00:00:35.340> back<00:00:35.550> up<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> 100<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.390> then<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
a slowly gains back up to 100 and then a

battery the power icon yeah let's go two

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.690 
battery the power icon yeah let's go two
more<00:01:33.360> power<00:01:33.780> options<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.400> done<00:01:35.640> by

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
more power options this can be done by

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.240 
more power options this can be done by
any<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.540> plane<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.500> power<00:01:37.650> plants<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.220> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
any of the plane the power plants but I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.130 
any of the plane the power plants but I
recommend<00:01:38.970> doing<00:01:39.150> unbalanced<00:01:39.780> or<00:01:39.930> high

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
recommend doing unbalanced or high

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.350 
recommend doing unbalanced or high
performance<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.549> i<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.210> demonstrating

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
performance so i will be demonstrating

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.630 
performance so i will be demonstrating
it<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> no<00:01:45.229> actually<00:01:46.229> both<00:01:46.409> also<00:01:47.369> go

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
it on there is no actually both also go

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.910 
it on there is no actually both also go
to<00:01:47.700> your<00:01:48.030> your<00:01:48.869> power<00:01:49.170> plants<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> go<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
to your your power plants to go to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
to your your power plants to go to
change<00:01:50.220> pen<00:01:50.460> settings<00:01:50.729> go<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.420> change

change pen settings go to change
advanced<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.740> settings<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.490> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
advanced all settings and then you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.929 
advanced all settings and then you
scroll<00:01:53.939> down<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.770> should<00:01:56.399> see<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> proof

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
scroll down and you should see a proof

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.590 
scroll down and you should see a proof

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.859 
maximize it and let's just open both of
them<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:05.189> yeah<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.750> you

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
them so yeah as you can if you if you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.499 
them so yeah as you can if you if you
guys<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.729> maximum<00:02:08.729> processor<00:02:09.119> state<00:02:09.390> is

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
guys can see maximum processor state is

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.710 
guys can see maximum processor state is
one<00:02:09.869> hundred<00:02:09.929> percent<00:02:10.340> because<00:02:11.340> um

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
one hundred percent because um

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.340 
one hundred percent because um
I've<00:02:13.720> learned<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.320> if<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.340> possessor<00:02:15.700> me

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
I've learned that if the possessor me

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.100 
I've learned that if the possessor me
meets<00:02:17.350> are<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.830> one<00:02:17.950> hundred<00:02:18.190> percent

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
meets are like one hundred percent

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.500 
meets are like one hundred percent
processors<00:02:20.110> date<00:02:20.410> right<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.850> was<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.330> like

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
processors date right it was it's like

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.990 
processors date right it was it's like
soco<00:02:22.900> overheat<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.800> then<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.220> like<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
soco overheat and then a like the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.690 
soco overheat and then a like the
performance<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:26.050> drops<00:02:26.380> like<00:02:26.500> any<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.220> slow

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
performance just drops like any a slow

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.720 
performance just drops like any a slow
leak<00:02:27.850> gains<00:02:28.600> back<00:02:28.810> up<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.890> mean<00:02:30.160> like<00:02:30.310> you

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
leak gains back up so I mean like you

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.700 
leak gains back up so I mean like you
guys<00:02:30.910> don't<00:02:31.120> want<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.570> but<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.290> rather<00:02:32.470> one

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
guys don't want that but you rather one

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.280 
guys don't want that but you rather one
constant<00:02:33.310> constant<00:02:34.120> frame<00:02:34.600> rate<00:02:34.810> right<00:02:35.020> like

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
constant constant frame rate right like

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.010 
constant constant frame rate right like
no<00:02:35.470> drop<00:02:35.740> nothing<00:02:35.890> just<00:02:36.310> play<00:02:36.550> on<00:02:36.760> smooth<00:02:37.240> so

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
no drop nothing just play on smooth so

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.600 
no drop nothing just play on smooth so
yeah<00:02:38.200> um<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.860> got<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.070> change<00:02:39.340> this

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
yeah um you got to change this

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.980 
yeah um you got to change this
percentage<00:02:40.210> on<00:02:40.720> plugged<00:02:41.350> in<00:02:41.500> um<00:02:42.540> on<00:02:43.540> battery<00:02:43.960> I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
percentage on plugged in um on battery I

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.690 
percentage on plugged in um on battery I
mean<00:02:44.320> like<00:02:44.440> who<00:02:44.860> gives<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.130> shit<00:02:45.370> right<00:02:45.550> who

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
mean like who gives a shit right who

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.020 
mean like who gives a shit right who
plays<00:02:45.910> on<00:02:46.060> battery<00:02:46.420> I'm<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:47.710> unless<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.000> are

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
plays on battery I'm so unless you are

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.120 
plays on battery I'm so unless you are
some<00:02:49.360> weird<00:02:49.540> guy<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.260> plugged<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:50.890> put<00:02:51.040> it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
some weird guy so plugged in just put it

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.240 
some weird guy so plugged in just put it
to<00:02:51.370> like<00:02:51.580> 95<00:02:52.300> night<00:02:52.780> off<00:02:53.530> arranged<00:02:53.830> through<00:02:54.040> 80

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
to like 95 night off arranged through 80

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.340 
to like 95 night off arranged through 80
to<00:02:54.640> 100<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.330> would<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.480> good<00:02:55.630> for<00:02:56.080> me<00:02:56.110> I'll

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
to 100 that would be good for me I'll

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.310 
to 100 that would be good for me I'll
put<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.770> on<00:02:56.920> 95<00:02:57.640> okay<00:02:58.240> just<00:02:58.720> for<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.050> tutorial

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
put it on 95 okay just for this tutorial

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.160 
put it on 95 okay just for this tutorial
and<00:02:59.890> just<00:03:00.160> click<00:03:00.280> apply<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.850> then<00:03:00.960> okay<00:03:01.960> and
