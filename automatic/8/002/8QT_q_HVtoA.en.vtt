and in this tutorial I'll show you how
to<00:00:05.879> create<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:07.220> cobblestone<00:00:08.220> farmer<00:00:08.880> using

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
to create a cobblestone farmer using

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.190 
to create a cobblestone farmer using
build<00:00:09.510> craft<00:00:09.800> which<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:10.980> fully<00:00:11.219> automatic<00:00:11.610> and

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
build craft which is fully automatic and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.959 
build craft which is fully automatic and
pretty<00:00:13.200> much<00:00:13.410> 100%<00:00:14.009> efficient

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
pretty much 100% efficient

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.930 
pretty much 100% efficient
so<00:00:15.900> first<00:00:16.289> let's<00:00:16.529> find<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.980> flat<00:00:17.220> plane<00:00:17.490> that

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
so first let's find a flat plane that

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
do it and then you get that frame next

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.760 
do it and then you get that frame next
you<00:03:50.770> want<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:51.010> create<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.670> redstone<00:03:52.270> clock<00:03:52.770> made

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
you want to create a redstone clock made

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.100 
you want to create a redstone clock made
from<00:03:54.100> at<00:03:54.520> least<00:03:54.760> four<00:03:55.090> fitters<00:03:55.510> I'm<00:03:55.840> going<00:03:56.020> to

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
from at least four fitters I'm going to

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.400 
from at least four fitters I'm going to
use<00:03:56.200> five<00:03:57.000> because<00:03:58.000> I'm<00:03:58.180> like<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:58.990> like<00:03:59.200> going

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
use five because I'm like and like going

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:23.210 
use five because I'm like and like going
safe<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:01.150> make<00:04:03.420> Viper<00:04:04.420> Peters

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:34.610 

place<00:04:23.820> them<00:04:24.000> in<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.240> following<00:04:24.420> fashion<00:04:33.620> make

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
place them in the following fashion make

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.100 
place them in the following fashion make
sure<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:35.010> every<00:04:35.700> at<00:04:35.910> least<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.360> four<00:04:36.990> of

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
them o'clock to the maximum delay this

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.250 
them o'clock to the maximum delay this
one<00:04:41.910> doesn't<00:04:42.150> have<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.300> be<00:04:42.450> maximum<00:04:42.840> like

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
one doesn't have to be maximum like

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.880 
one doesn't have to be maximum like
putting<00:04:43.590> it<00:04:43.710> 12<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.670> 4<00:04:45.470> then<00:04:46.470> connect

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
putting it 12 to 4 then connect

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.570 
putting it 12 to 4 then connect
everything<00:04:47.250> with<00:04:47.640> redstone<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:52.550> place<00:04:53.550> a

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
everything with redstone and place a

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.890 
everything with redstone and place a
lever<00:04:54.680> neurotic<00:04:55.680> red<00:04:55.860> o'clock<00:04:56.510> tablet<00:04:57.510> enough

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
lever neurotic red o'clock tablet enough

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.590 
lever neurotic red o'clock tablet enough
real<00:04:58.350> fast

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
real fast

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.460 
real fast
next<00:05:00.620> connect<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.710> clock<00:05:02.420> to<00:05:03.420> a<00:05:03.630> block<00:05:03.990> under

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
next connect the clock to a block under

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.170 
next connect the clock to a block under
the<00:05:04.650> core<00:05:04.890> you<00:05:05.040> can<00:05:05.250> connect<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.640> directly<00:05:05.850> to

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
the core you can connect it directly to

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.480 
the core you can connect it directly to
the<00:05:06.300> quarry<00:05:06.630> but<00:05:06.950> it<00:05:07.950> may<00:05:08.130> cause<00:05:08.460> some

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
the quarry but it may cause some

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.870 
the quarry but it may cause some
problems<00:05:08.700> so<00:05:09.540> we<00:05:09.660> just<00:05:09.810> don't<00:05:10.080> do<00:05:10.200> it<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:11.730> then

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
problems so we just don't do it and then

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.909 
problems so we just don't do it and then
the<00:05:12.000> chorus<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.540> building<00:05:12.930> itself<00:05:15.770> well<00:05:16.770> it

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
the chorus of building itself well it

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.020 
the chorus of building itself well it
does<00:05:17.190> it<00:05:19.070> let's<00:05:20.070> connect<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.490> quarry<00:05:20.760> to

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
does it let's connect the quarry to

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.360 
does it let's connect the quarry to
chest

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
chest

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.850 
chest
so<00:05:24.050> everything<00:05:25.050> that<00:05:25.169> comes<00:05:25.410> out<00:05:25.620> of<00:05:25.650> the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
so everything that comes out of the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.440 
so everything that comes out of the
quarry<00:05:26.100> will<00:05:26.400> go<00:05:26.550> directly<00:05:26.700> into<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.180> chest

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
quarry will go directly into a chest

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:43.760 
quarry will go directly into a chest
that<00:05:27.540> we<00:05:27.750> can<00:05:27.960> collect<00:05:28.290> from<00:05:30.530> this

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.300 

let's<00:05:44.400> speed<00:05:44.700> things<00:05:44.730> up<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:45.420> bit<00:05:45.680> okay<00:05:46.680> so<00:05:46.860> now

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
let's speed things up a bit okay so now

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.860 
let's speed things up a bit okay so now
the<00:05:47.610> core<00:05:47.820> is<00:05:47.910> completely<00:05:48.390> it<00:05:48.450> will<00:05:48.630> stop

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
the core is completely it will stop

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.450 
the core is completely it will stop
working<00:05:50.480> what<00:05:51.480> will<00:05:51.660> happen<00:05:51.990> it<00:05:52.290> go<00:05:52.590> because

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
working what will happen it go because

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.270 
working what will happen it go because
we've<00:05:53.610> created<00:05:53.730> a<00:05:54.410> 3x3<00:05:55.410> grid

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
we've created a 3x3 grid

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.510 
we've created a 3x3 grid
it<00:05:56.490> will<00:05:56.700> only<00:05:56.880> dig<00:05:57.240> straight<00:05:58.110> down<00:06:00.080> and

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
it will only dig straight down and

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.650 
it will only dig straight down and
because<00:06:02.520> our<00:06:02.730> clock<00:06:03.060> is<00:06:03.810> slow<00:06:04.350> enough<00:06:05.480> it<00:06:06.480> will

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
because our clock is slow enough it will

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.530 
because our clock is slow enough it will
never<00:06:06.840> get<00:06:07.140> below<00:06:07.590> that<00:06:07.920> the<00:06:08.820> block<00:06:09.150> that<00:06:09.360> is

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
never get below that the block that is

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.500 
never get below that the block that is
being<00:06:09.780> recreated<00:06:10.350> over<00:06:10.590> and<00:06:10.830> over<00:06:11.040> again<00:06:11.510> so

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
being recreated over and over again so

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.030 
being recreated over and over again so
what<00:06:13.020> we<00:06:13.170> get<00:06:13.350> is<00:06:14.360> infinite<00:06:15.920> source<00:06:16.920> of

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
what we get is infinite source of

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:26.890 
what we get is infinite source of
cobblestone<00:06:23.810> now<00:06:24.810> just<00:06:25.080> for<00:06:25.230> good<00:06:25.350> measure

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
cobblestone now just for good measure

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.300 
cobblestone now just for good measure
take<00:06:27.900> a<00:06:27.930> look<00:06:28.140> what<00:06:28.260> happens<00:06:28.320> if<00:06:28.740> I<00:06:28.890> make<00:06:29.160> the

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
take a look what happens if I make the

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:48.869 
take a look what happens if I make the
clock<00:06:29.580> faster

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:48.879 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:52.839 

the<00:06:49.879> drill<00:06:50.300> goes<00:06:50.569> through<00:06:51.229> it<00:06:51.520> now<00:06:52.520> as<00:06:52.699> you

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
the drill goes through it now as you

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.330 
the drill goes through it now as you
might<00:06:53.270> have<00:06:53.360> seen<00:06:53.569> it<00:06:54.199> doesn't<00:06:54.590> it<00:06:54.949> doesn't<00:06:55.280> do

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
might have seen it doesn't it doesn't do

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.249 
might have seen it doesn't it doesn't do
it<00:06:55.430> every<00:06:55.759> time<00:06:55.970> but<00:06:56.330> yeah<00:06:56.569> here<00:06:56.810> we<00:06:56.840> go<00:06:56.930> again

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
it every time but yeah here we go again

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:58.899 
it every time but yeah here we go again
so<00:06:58.099> it's<00:06:58.250> not<00:06:58.370> ideal

00:06:58.899 --> 00:06:58.909 
so it's not ideal

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:03.159 
so it's not ideal
just<00:06:59.389> stay<00:06:59.659> with<00:07:00.250> three<00:07:01.250> four<00:07:01.729> Peters<00:07:02.120> set<00:07:03.050> to

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:03.169 
just stay with three four Peters set to

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:09.909 
just stay with three four Peters set to
max<00:07:06.370> there<00:07:07.370> you<00:07:07.520> go<00:07:07.629> that's<00:07:08.629> perfect<00:07:09.259> opal

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
max there you go that's perfect opal

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.879 
max there you go that's perfect opal
stone<00:07:10.099> factory<00:07:10.520> for<00:07:10.759> you
