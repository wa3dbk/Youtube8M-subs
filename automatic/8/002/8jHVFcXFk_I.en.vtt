NU CHEN - Unending Tears

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:12.124
I washed my hair and my eyes burn

00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:16.837
I couldn't open them

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:25.780
Along the sound of unending tears

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.252
I washed my hair again and again

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:39.188
Memories with you flowing down

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:45.092
They keep flowing, no matter how much I wash off

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:51.980
Your warm touches flow down

00:00:52.492 --> 00:00:58.805
Your sweet lips flow down

00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:03.366
I try to grasp, but I can't

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:09.812
So I shut my eyes and let you flow away

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.884
I'm washing my hair

00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:28.726
Along the shampoo bubbles

00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:34.727
I keep wiping your face away

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:42.862
To scatter the memories with you

00:01:42.862 --> 00:01:48.903
I keep washing and wiping, but they remain

00:01:48.903 --> 00:01:55.951
Your glittering eyes remain

00:01:55.951 --> 00:02:02.446
Your whispering breath remains

00:02:02.647 --> 00:02:06.839
I try to wash them away, but I can't

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:13.118
So I shut my eyes and wipe your face off

00:02:13.118 --> 00:02:16.482
I'm washing my hair

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:50.570
Your warm touches flow down

00:02:51.194 --> 00:02:57.226
Your sweet lips flow down

00:02:57.426 --> 00:03:01.722
I try to grasp, but I can't

00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:07.889
So I shut my eyes and let you flow away

00:03:08.114 --> 00:03:12.946
I'm washing my hair

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.106
