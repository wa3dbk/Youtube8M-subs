00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
is the installer file slash s and that's

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.410 
is the installer file slash s and that's
after<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.280> file<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.520> actually<00:02:08.910> copied<00:02:09.270> there

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
after the file is actually copied there

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.270 
after the file is actually copied there
so

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
so

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.760 
so
go<00:02:11.310> ahead<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.550> click<00:02:11.670> okay<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.560> shows<00:02:13.560> our

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
go ahead and click okay it shows our

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.370 
go ahead and click okay it shows our
command<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.459> deployment<00:02:15.110> field<00:02:16.110> here

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
command in this deployment field here

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.170 
command in this deployment field here
and<00:02:16.550> then<00:02:17.550> we<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:17.730> go<00:02:17.819> ahead<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.000> actually

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
and then we can go ahead and actually

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.000 
and then we can go ahead and actually
just<00:02:18.480> execute<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.110> I'm<00:02:19.620> gonna<00:02:19.740> right-click

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
just execute it I'm gonna right-click

again and I'm gonna choose execute

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.320 
again and I'm gonna choose execute
deployment<00:02:22.319> before<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.770> do<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.130> though<00:02:23.550> let

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
deployment before I do that though let

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.059 
deployment before I do that though let
me<00:02:24.360> just<00:02:24.600> show<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.350> can<00:02:25.590> see<00:02:25.950> I'm

this<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.180> one<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.480> computers<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:33.900> we're

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
this is one of the computers that we're

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.930 
this is one of the computers that we're
going<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.260> deploy<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.770> we'll<00:02:35.430> notice<00:02:35.700> here<00:02:35.850> we

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
going to deploy to we'll notice here we

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.820 
going to deploy to we'll notice here we
don't<00:02:36.030> have<00:02:36.150> no<00:02:36.390> pad<00:02:36.600> +<00:02:36.840> +<00:02:39.230> if<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.410> go<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
don't have no pad + + if we go to the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.400 
don't have no pad + + if we go to the
app<00:02:40.950> wiz<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.569> see<00:02:42.690> there's<00:02:42.840> no<00:02:42.989> programs

app wiz we can see there's no programs
on<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.680> computer<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.489> fresh<00:02:44.820> VM

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
on this computer this is just a fresh VM

for this demonstration so what we'll do

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.090 
for this demonstration so what we'll do
is<00:02:50.340> we'll<00:02:50.760> go<00:02:50.940> ahead<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.570> we<00:02:51.959> will<00:02:51.989> again<00:02:52.830> like

is we'll go ahead and we will again like

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.000 
is we'll go ahead and we will again like
I<00:02:53.190> said<00:02:53.250> we'll<00:02:53.610> execute<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.510> deployment<00:02:55.050> on

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
I said we'll execute the deployment on

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.309 
I said we'll execute the deployment on
these<00:02:56.190> machines<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.300> what<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:57.870> see<00:02:57.989> happening

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
these machines and what we see happening

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.540 
these machines and what we see happening
here<00:02:58.380> deploying<00:02:58.950> we're<00:02:59.040> executing<00:02:59.250> we've

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
here deploying we're executing we've

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.820 
here deploying we're executing we've

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
over to each of the machines and now

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.320 
over to each of the machines and now
we're<00:03:04.620> executing<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.880> actually<00:03:06.209> already

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
we're executing it's actually already

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.630 
we're executing it's actually already
finished<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:07.110> our<00:03:07.410> member<00:03:07.739> 3<00:03:08.010> machine<00:03:08.400> it

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
finished on our member 3 machine it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.740 
finished on our member 3 machine it
looks<00:03:08.819> like<00:03:08.880> it's<00:03:09.060> finished<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.390> all<00:03:09.510> them<00:03:09.660> so

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
looks like it's finished on all them so

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.270 
looks like it's finished on all them so
let<00:03:09.870> me<00:03:09.930> bring<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.200> back<00:03:10.470> into<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.920> view

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
let me bring this back into the view

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.030 
let me bring this back into the view

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
if i refresh the list of programs now we

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.810 
if i refresh the list of programs now we
can<00:03:18.690> see<00:03:18.840> notepad<00:03:19.200> plus<00:03:19.440> plus<00:03:19.470> we<00:03:20.280> see<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.610> up

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
can see notepad plus plus we see it up

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.600 
can see notepad plus plus we see it up
here<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.360> programs<00:03:21.810> group<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:23.280> here<00:03:23.519> we

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
here in the programs group and here we

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.080 
here in the programs group and here we
go<00:03:24.739> that's<00:03:25.739> all<00:03:25.860> there<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:26.579> now<00:03:27.000> if

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
go that's all there is to it so now if

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.789 
go that's all there is to it so now if
we<00:03:27.239> wanted<00:03:27.660> we<00:03:27.780> can<00:03:27.959> run<00:03:28.140> notepad<00:03:28.530> plus<00:03:28.769> plus

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
we wanted we can run notepad plus plus

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.750 
we wanted we can run notepad plus plus
for<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.370> first<00:03:29.579> time<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.090> computer<00:03:30.420> and

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
for the first time on this computer and

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
for the first time on this computer and
it's<00:03:32.760> telling<00:03:32.970> us<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.180> there's<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.420> plugin

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
it's telling us that there's a plugin

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.270 
it's telling us that there's a plugin
update<00:03:34.170> interesting<00:03:34.650> since<00:03:35.010> it's<00:03:35.190> a

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
update interesting since it's a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.090 
update interesting since it's a
brand-new<00:03:36.500> installation<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.590> second<00:03:37.890> ago<00:03:38.070> but

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
brand-new installation a second ago but

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.330 
brand-new installation a second ago but
that's<00:03:38.370> ok

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
that's ok

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.430 
that's ok
so<00:03:40.910> that's<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.180> that's<00:03:41.780> how<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.050> deploy

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
so that's it that's how you deploy

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.070 
so that's it that's how you deploy
software<00:03:43.310> remotely<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.180> multiple<00:03:44.690> computers

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
software remotely to multiple computers

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.680 
software remotely to multiple computers
at<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.230> same<00:03:45.290> time
