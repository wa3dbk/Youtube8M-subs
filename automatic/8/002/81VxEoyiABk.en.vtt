00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.240
 Stone is a kid and then he 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.909

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.099
 is there suffering and don win goes and the 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.109
 Uncle the little guy shoots again 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:39.369
 because his father had told him that with 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.349
 a wound in the stomach would die 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.599

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.579

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.689
 father and it seems that has happened and I do not 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.819
 index I will tell you what has happened 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.489
 burning you a kid do the 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.860
 a man's job and he fell asleep 

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:56.860
 you told your son that a wound 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.719
 in the womb was mortal so 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.060
 you are also responsible for your 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.379
 death add two bullets in the stomach of 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.869
 his only one son is mine 

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:11.370
 a couple of movie roger moore 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.000
 and the blank spock 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.799
 in 007 there are obviously only three 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.409
 people in the world who are left 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.860
 well the white tuxedo with cayetano 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.299
 martÃ­nez de irujo roger moore and a 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.670
 third who wants to stay in the 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.040
 anonymous but who lives in nepal 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.840
 this is so then roger moore and his 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.819
 white tuxedo are for me one of the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.810
 great couples of cinema but the most 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.959
 important in the movie popcorn or 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.840
 little hands in popcorn 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.900
 always popcorn because the little hands are 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.459
 already for an age that is already overcome with 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.650
 the time for when you are younger 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.709
 when you are already in a couple as in my 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.329
 case and a couple that for years 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.239
 he was coexisting with her the little hands 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:01.290
 they are a way to fuck you the movie 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.879
 she was making me nervous and I get 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.060
 likewise if she is concerned is the murderer 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.609
 let me not put more my glasses are of 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.409
 increase look now I see it make face what 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.319
 I see the baby away or close I see it far away 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.490
 but yours are prepared for the 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.440
 3d 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.110
 they are not ready for 3d because 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.150
 they do not even have crystals but what 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.150
 of the 3d I have already expressed my opinion 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.810
 On many occasions I think it's a 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.810
 little a scam 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:36.620
 a little bit last is a cutting-edge technology 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:39.980
 that was already used in the 60s and in the 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.870
 70 and in the 80s and we're always going to get 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.760
 again we are going to put again the 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:49.120
 3-d movies look dark 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.220
 they look dark and makes fornillos is not 3d 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.640
 it really does for them it's like a 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.269
 manger knows how a bird when I said is 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.620
 Christmas let's see some cribs and here 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.810
 is san jose 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.290
 here are the sheep and here is one 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.440
 mountain and nobody says my mother this 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.349
 manger in the pump we will charge you a 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.359
 third more than it would be worth entering a 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.230
 manger painted so you can see this in 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.849
 3-d 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.470
 let's go the thing should have 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.970
 as a court that decided that 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.389
 movies can be made in 3-d which 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.360
 do not 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.889
 Gravity is good 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.010
