they used microcurrent in order to get

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.450 
they used microcurrent in order to get
the<00:00:41.969> products<00:00:42.390> into<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:42.809> skin<00:00:43.500> microcurrent

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
into the skin it uses basically a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.439 
into the skin it uses basically a
current<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.590> products<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.129> travel<00:00:50.789> into

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
have a microcurrent that will help put

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
have a microcurrent that will help put
the<00:00:57.170> products<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.289> are<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.829> patch

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the products that are in the patch

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.770

results that much faster

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.700 
results that much faster
the<00:01:05.430> idea<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.119> patch<00:01:06.570> would<00:01:07.290> somehow

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the idea that a patch would somehow

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.770 
the idea that a patch would somehow
contain<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.640> ability<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
contain the ability to have a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.560 
contain the ability to have a
microcurrent<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.950> crazily<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:11.970> shrinking

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
microcurrent in it crazily and shrinking

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.359 
microcurrent in it crazily and shrinking
so<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> definitely<00:01:13.229> want<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.560> try<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:14.070> I

it<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.910> pretty<00:03:24.269> like<00:03:24.570> thick<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.650> probably

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
it is pretty like thick this is probably

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.400 
it is pretty like thick this is probably
the<00:03:26.400> thickest<00:03:26.910> eyepatch<00:03:27.480> I've<00:03:27.720> ever<00:03:28.019> had<00:03:28.230> Matt

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
the thickest eyepatch I've ever had Matt

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.280 
the thickest eyepatch I've ever had Matt
I<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:28.799> give<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.430> close-up<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.940> what<00:03:30.290> good

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
I just give you a close-up of what good

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.229 
I just give you a close-up of what good
but<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.560> looks<00:03:31.739> like<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:32.640> see<00:03:32.820> it's<00:03:32.940> pretty

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
but it looks like you see it's pretty

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.240 
but it looks like you see it's pretty
thick<00:03:34.110> full<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:36.320> it's<00:03:37.320> pretty<00:03:37.620> secure<00:03:37.829> on<00:03:38.160> my

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
thick full and it's pretty secure on my

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.039 
thick full and it's pretty secure on my
eyes<00:03:38.430> as<00:03:38.670> well<00:03:38.880> but<00:03:39.090> again<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.660> can<00:03:39.780> see<00:03:39.959> this

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
eyes as well but again you can see this

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.930 
eyes as well but again you can see this
kind<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.320> area<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.890> think<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.549> is<00:03:41.640> where<00:03:41.820> the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
kind of area I think this is where the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.110 
kind of area I think this is where the
battery<00:03:42.299> is<00:03:43.220> powdery<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.519> don't<00:03:44.820> know<00:03:44.910> if<00:03:45.000> it's

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
battery is powdery I don't know if it's

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.210 
battery is powdery I don't know if it's
a<00:03:45.209> battery<00:03:45.570> but<00:03:45.930> some<00:03:46.230> type<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.440> wave<00:03:46.620> causing

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
a battery but some type of wave causing

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.039 
a battery but some type of wave causing
the<00:03:47.310> current<00:03:47.459> but<00:03:48.120> they<00:03:48.239> said<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.810> can

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
the current but they said that you can

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.400 
the current but they said that you can
keep<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:50.040> eye<00:03:50.250> patch<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.730> for<00:03:51.030> 30<00:03:51.840> minutes<00:03:52.230> up

just for this demonstration I'm gonna do
probably<00:03:57.690> around<00:03:57.950> 30<00:03:58.950> minutes<00:03:59.370> anyways<00:03:59.880> just

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
causing the microcurrent my eyes that

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.810 
causing the microcurrent my eyes that
you<00:05:40.550> don't<00:05:40.730> feel<00:05:40.940> to<00:05:41.240> like<00:05:42.190> like<00:05:43.190> really<00:05:43.520> like

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
you don't feel to like like really like

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.700 
you don't feel to like like really like
I<00:05:44.290> guess<00:05:45.290> you'd<00:05:45.560> say<00:05:45.620> like<00:05:45.890> really<00:05:47.320> like<00:05:48.320> I

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
I guess you'd say like really like I

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.250 
I guess you'd say like really like I
don't<00:05:49.550> think<00:05:49.970> they<00:05:50.240> don't<00:05:50.330> feel<00:05:50.540> hydrated<00:05:50.750> but

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
don't think they don't feel hydrated but

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.050 
don't think they don't feel hydrated but
they<00:05:51.410> just<00:05:51.560> don't<00:05:51.710> feel<00:05:51.920> like<00:05:51.980> really<00:05:52.340> has

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
they just don't feel like really has

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.390 
they just don't feel like really has
like<00:05:53.330> the<00:05:53.570> comb<00:05:53.720> used<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.250> but<00:05:55.250> I<00:05:56.980> think<00:05:57.980> the

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
like the comb used to but I think the

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.460 
like the comb used to but I think the
results<00:05:59.210> are<00:05:59.300> actually<00:05:59.360> pretty<00:05:59.780> nice<00:05:59.900> I'm

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
results are actually pretty nice I'm

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.040 
results are actually pretty nice I'm
gonna<00:06:00.590> go<00:06:00.740> ahead<00:06:00.800> and<00:06:00.890> apply<00:06:01.010> some<00:06:01.130> of<00:06:01.460> this

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
gonna go ahead and apply some of this

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:09.070 
gonna go ahead and apply some of this
serum<00:06:06.550> that<00:06:07.550> is<00:06:07.610> it<00:06:07.970> it's<00:06:08.270> really<00:06:08.450> simple<00:06:08.570> it's

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
serum that is it it's really simple it's

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.750 
serum that is it it's really simple it's
really<00:06:09.290> easy<00:06:09.620> I<00:06:10.010> think<00:06:10.340> doesn't<00:06:10.490> want<00:06:10.700> to

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760
