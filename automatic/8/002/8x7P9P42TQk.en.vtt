home if you have some old books that are
falling<00:00:16.109> apart<00:00:16.250> those<00:00:17.250> are<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.820> bets<00:00:18.090> because

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
falling apart those are the bets because

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.670 
falling apart those are the bets because
the<00:00:19.289> paper<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.949> already<00:00:20.630> aged<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:22.380> got<00:00:22.529> that

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the paper is already aged just got that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.420 
the paper is already aged just got that
yellowed<00:00:23.189> look<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.560> basically<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.650> here<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
yellowed look so basically just here the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.259 
yellowed look so basically just here the
the<00:00:26.820> page<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.420> out<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.960> book<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.939> down<00:00:29.939> we

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the page is out of that book and down we

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.420 
the page is out of that book and down we
make<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> wreath<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.650> first<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.219> your

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
make a wreath of this so first in your

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.299 
make a wreath of this so first in your
book<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.050> then<00:00:34.050> find<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> piece<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.040> cardboard

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
book and then find a piece of cardboard

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.670 
book and then find a piece of cardboard
that<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.850> may<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.690> found<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.140> cardboard

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
that you may have I found a cardboard

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.310 
that you may have I found a cardboard
box<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.670> opened<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.690> just

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
box that I just opened up and I just

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.010 
box that I just opened up and I just
kind<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> random<00:00:41.040> size<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.640> took<00:00:41.790> a

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
kind of got a random size and took a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.049 
kind of got a random size and took a
round<00:00:43.020> object<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.829> drew<00:00:44.100> two<00:00:44.370> circles<00:00:44.820> one

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
round object and drew two circles one

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.410 
round object and drew two circles one
for<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.570> outer<00:00:46.520> ring<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
for the outer ring and then one for the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.459 
for the outer ring and then one for the
inner<00:00:48.629> ring<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.190> take<00:00:50.460> my<00:00:50.730> torn<00:00:51.510> pages

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
inner ring so then I take my torn pages

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.310 
inner ring so then I take my torn pages
from<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> book<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.000> roll<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
from the book and I roll them up now the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.279 
from the book and I roll them up now the
first<00:00:55.829> layer<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:57.289> rounder

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
first layer is going to be rounder

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.750 
first layer is going to be rounder
you're<00:00:58.559> not<00:00:58.680> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:58.980> points<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you're not going to have points so I

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.270 
you're not going to have points so I
want<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.930> ahead<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.170> roll<00:01:01.800> those<00:01:02.039> like

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
want to go ahead and roll those like

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.440 
want to go ahead and roll those like
this<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.989> then<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.680> inner<00:01:05.250> crown<00:01:06.090> which

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
this and then the inner crown which

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.880 
this and then the inner crown which
would<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> inner<00:01:06.930> part<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.680> wreath

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
would be the inner part of the wreath

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.969 
would be the inner part of the wreath
I'm<00:01:08.610> gonna<00:01:08.790> roll<00:01:09.600> them<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> where<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I'm gonna roll them up and where the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.000 
I'm gonna roll them up and where the
point<00:01:11.580> it'll<00:01:12.150> will<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:12.990> bold<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.650> gives<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
point it'll will not bold it it gives it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.160 
point it'll will not bold it it gives it
like<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.159> triangle<00:01:14.729> point<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.810> that'll<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
like a triangle point so that'll be the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.580 
like a triangle point so that'll be the
for<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> inner<00:01:16.650> ring<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.450> how<00:01:18.600> folded

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
for the inner ring so you see how folded

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.510 
for the inner ring so you see how folded
these<00:01:20.810> rolled<00:01:21.810> them<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
these rolled them up just like that the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.899 
these rolled them up just like that the
next<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.270> your<00:01:25.280> pages<00:01:26.280> need<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.759> be

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
next all of your pages need to be

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.620 
next all of your pages need to be
stapled<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:28.049> like<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.630> then

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
stapled just like you see here and then

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
stapled just like you see here and then
just<00:01:30.900> get<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> hot<00:01:31.380> glue<00:01:31.560> gun<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.040> start

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
just get you a hot glue gun and start

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.359 
just get you a hot glue gun and start
gluing<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.720> outer<00:01:33.900> ring<00:01:34.290> first<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.189> ones

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
gluing the outer ring first the ones

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.130 
gluing the outer ring first the ones
that<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.820> round<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.930> just

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
that are going to be round and you just

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.719 
that are going to be round and you just
kind<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.590> line<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:37.920> around<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.430> circle

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
kind of line them up around that circle

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.960 
kind of line them up around that circle
that<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.210> drew<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.799> just<00:01:40.799> fill<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.909> as

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
that we drew and just fill in as much as

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.899 
that we drew and just fill in as much as
possible<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.780> started<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.909> twelve

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
possible I started with like twelve

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.980 
possible I started with like twelve
o'clock<00:01:45.180> six<00:01:45.540> o'clock<00:01:47.090> nine<00:01:48.090> o'clock<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
o'clock six o'clock nine o'clock and

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.110 
o'clock six o'clock nine o'clock and
and<00:01:50.990> three<00:01:51.650> o'clock<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.130> then<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.820> just<00:01:52.970> fill

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
and three o'clock and then you just fill

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.300 
and three o'clock and then you just fill
it<00:01:53.270> in<00:01:53.360> from<00:01:53.480> there<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:54.050> then<00:01:54.650> once<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.040> have

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
it in from there and then once you have

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.270 
it in from there and then once you have
gotten<00:01:55.790> this<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.540> first<00:01:56.810> layer<00:01:57.080> then<00:01:57.980> take

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
gotten this the first layer then take

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.100 
gotten this the first layer then take
the<00:01:58.580> second<00:01:59.000> layer<00:01:59.120> with<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.450> points<00:01:59.900> and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
the second layer with the points and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.740 
the second layer with the points and
film<00:02:00.500> in<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.310> exact<00:02:01.700> same<00:02:01.940> way<00:02:02.000> just<00:02:02.450> using

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
film in the exact same way just using

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.670 
film in the exact same way just using
hot<00:02:03.050> glue<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.670> then<00:02:04.670> after<00:02:05.540> you<00:02:05.660> fill<00:02:06.020> both

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
hot glue and then after you fill both

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.820 
hot glue and then after you fill both
rings<00:02:07.070> up<00:02:07.400> with<00:02:07.880> your<00:02:08.450> roll<00:02:09.850> paper<00:02:10.850> pages<00:02:11.830> take

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
rings up with your roll paper pages take
