00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:04.709
I'm Dara.

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:08.250
I'm a busy mom of three and have a husband
who is a vegetarian.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:24.950
For us, eating healthy sometimes is left on
the back burner, Dara, weeknight dinners can

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.950
be really tricky.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.720
So tell me about some of your challenges.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.259
I am not thinking about planning a meal until
it's dinnertime, and I feel like it's not

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.259
a complete meal.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:36.989
The best strategy is to plan your entire week
of meals on the weekend.

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.850
We're going to say Monday night is going to
be pasta night.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.230
What are you going to serve with that pasta?

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.860
What we're suggesting is, you make a really
big salad.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.510
Not just for Monday night, but also for another
night later in the week.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.629
Make it all at once.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.769
Tuesday night's going to be pizza night and,
again, in the morning you're going to shred

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.410
your cheese, you're going to chop up all of
your toppings.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.789
And then, when dinnertime comes around, all
you need to do is preheat the oven, roll out

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.020
the dough, top it and in it goes and you cook
it.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.020
VoilÃ , dinner.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.610
Sounds great, and my daughter loves to help
make the pizza, so that'll be a fun night.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.610
Excellent.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.670
Wednesday night, maybe that's a night where
you don't have time to cook at all.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.390
So, you want to choose a recipe that can essentially
cook itself.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.430
And your slow cooker is the tool to use for
that.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.479
Chop everything up in the morning.

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.590
Throw it in.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.100
Your meal will cook throughout the day.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.409
And then you come home: dinner's done, ready
to go.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.500
So, we talked before about how breakfast for
dinner is a really big hit in your family.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.500
Try a frittata.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.979
You are going get some protein from the eggs
and then, on the side, serve it with sweet

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.450
potato fries.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.310
So Friday night is going to be taco night.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.360
Put out all the toppings and the kids can
put together whatever type of taco it is that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.360
they want.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.729
My daughter and I will be enjoying having
beef tacos, and my husband can have the bean

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.390
tacos since he's a vegetarian.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.390
Excellent.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.950
So now you can see that planning ahead and
prepping in advance makes eating well really

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.259
simple.
