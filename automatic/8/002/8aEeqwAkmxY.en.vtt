00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.760
 good kids today we go for it and 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.380
 we are today again in a gameplay 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.349
 commented this time with a guest 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.629
 special with the star hello everyone 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.129
 tap are you here some kids first 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.440
 that explain the gameplay and then 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:18.070
 talk about a topic that we wanted 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.109
 clarify and one this is a weapons game 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.150
 Good thing I got a good pill 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.410
 especially at the beginning and that and well what 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.849
 we will leave background to explain it the 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.429
 topic we wanted to talk about that good 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.439
 is the theme that good lately 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.689
 he's talking a lot and he's 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.690
 speculating about whether or not there will be 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.000
 there will be love in white 2 and good the truth 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.350
 is that lately a lot in many 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.970
 channels and a lot of people are 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.120
 taking advantage of it and it's going up 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.050
 edited video and others to youtube with the 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.180
 issue of ensuring that we open blank 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.910
 2 and good we what we wanted 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.560
 tell you that basically they are everything 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.050
 speculations that there is nothing sure 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.210
 that is surely false information 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.960
 What are you thinking about that? 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.280
 It's a lie but we cheekily if 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.220
 I'm going to say kids what good 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.060
 basically it's supposed to be a lie that 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.850
 good 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.990
 they may be hiding it or what 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.030
 but basically it is not you 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.310
 you create nothing of what people say 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.250
 until they confirm someone nothing 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.950
 that are not the creators of the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.979
 game and well that there is no case that 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.409
 let us take for by such 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.630
 video deception that 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.299
 what are false speculations seems to be 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.909
 and good but the truth is that I think 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.130
 it would be pretty good if we had 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.979
 I do not know what you think of me man 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.200
 seeing the targets what will be 2025 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.030
 create if I'm not wrong I think that a 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.280
 woman would hit since it is such a future 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.619
 more advanced is not everything more elaborate 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.590
 and a fashion to employ futuristic would be 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.420
 very handsome yeah yeah that's what I think I 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.849
 also that love should not 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.599
 remove why good it is black ops 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:02.200
 I think the fashion as more 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:05.259
 attracts to play the dissolved broth yes yes it has 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.360
 played a lot and if he knows how to handle himself 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.369
 in the game what brings you the most 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.810
 to play is to get you out of fashion or be some 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.459
 high streak because for example in black 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.250
 ops it was very short what of the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.959
 dogs that was the maximum streak as far 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.099
 to wÃ¡n polla de la sacaba y bueno 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.530
 basically I did not have anything 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.359
 get I think a high drag already 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.269
 be a fashion or any other kind of 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:28.349
 Something similar should be 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.349
 blank 2 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.710
 Well, man, the truth is that the truth 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.030
 is that without water but in plan I know that 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.280
 the specialist in killing the cow goes 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.870
 until the streak of assault can that at 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.940
 better get it out there without looking 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.860
 for those who are trying to put the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.950
 truth is that I do not know if we'll see 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.850
 when it comes out but come on, I think 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.520
 do not 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.750
 once more the fashion of the streak that 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.090
 the maximum streak that I think are 14 yes 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.770
 but hey , you'll see everything if 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.720
 you will see kids now there is no 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.090
 fashion although in our opinion it should 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.920
 have it or something similar with more streaks 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.360
 high but do not appear now moral no 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.250
 there will be gusts of specialists that good 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.470
 also for me it is an advance that came out 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.750
 in modern warfare what little trade 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.700
 I liked it and they have taken it for me 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.930
 all of those advances should not 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.989
 remove it even if the game is different 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.870
 and one nothing more nothing to say or 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.689
 about everything that creates us and nothing until 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.189
 that whoever has to say it says that 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.319
 are those of activision and the creators 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:35.489
 of the game so all are rumors of 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:38.730
 moments speculations and the game already 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.819
 is looking to end up as always 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.349
 I'll put the channel of atreju that with 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.430
 who am I commenting this example and in 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.560
 the description and all that so that you 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.840
 go through your channel and a basic guide 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.760
 magnum and others and good here the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.359
 starting something more than contributing to the gameplay 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.470
 dare nothing that here continue to see 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.329
 the videos and tanks 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.840
 I think that cures them and happens if you want 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:04.440
 see part of my channel that is create 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.870
 Well, none of that is favorite and even 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.400
 the next one have kids and subscribe if 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.400
 it's not good bye bye
