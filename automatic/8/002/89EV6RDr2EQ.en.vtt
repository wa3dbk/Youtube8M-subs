00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
as well but their only reason she's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.510 
as well but their only reason she's
standing<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.450> now<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> kind<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.490> because<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
standing right now is kind of because I

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.670 
standing right now is kind of because I
have<00:01:26.909> her<00:01:27.060> leaned<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:27.840> against<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> wall<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
have her leaned up against the wall a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.240 
have her leaned up against the wall a
little<00:01:28.920> bit

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
little bit

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.760 
little bit
she<00:01:29.790> doesn't<00:01:29.970> really<00:01:30.329> stabilize<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.409> her<00:01:31.530> own

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
she doesn't really stabilize on her own

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.190 
she doesn't really stabilize on her own
because<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.430> hip<00:01:32.610> joints<00:01:33.030> move<00:01:33.329> very

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
because the hip joints move very

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.460 
because the hip joints move very
flexible<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.610> she<00:01:35.670> kind<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.180> falls<00:01:36.390> over<00:01:36.810> but

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
flexible so she kind of falls over but

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.850 
flexible so she kind of falls over but
um

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
um

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.940
