running in and try and get any any clues

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.610 
running in and try and get any any clues
that<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.390> can<00:00:34.570> see<00:00:34.780> if<00:00:34.930> you<00:00:35.020> can<00:00:35.170> see<00:00:35.289> a<00:00:35.320> shiny

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
that you can see if you can see a shiny

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.729 
that you can see if you can see a shiny
side<00:00:35.890> early<00:00:36.250> on<00:00:36.370> and<00:00:36.609> once<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.510> luck<00:00:37.659> is<00:00:37.809> worn

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
side early on and once the luck is worn

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.770 
side early on and once the luck is worn
off<00:00:38.829> so<00:00:39.129> just<00:00:39.760> try<00:00:40.210> and<00:00:40.269> give<00:00:40.390> yourself<00:00:40.659> as

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
off so just try and give yourself as

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.209 
off so just try and give yourself as
much<00:00:40.929> chance<00:00:41.170> as<00:00:41.289> possible<00:00:41.710> when<00:00:41.800> it<00:00:41.920> when<00:00:42.129> it

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
much chance as possible when it when it

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.830 
much chance as possible when it when it
comes<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.489> release

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.630 

I<00:00:45.870> think<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> key<00:00:46.530> element<00:00:46.769> of<00:00:47.070> opening<00:00:47.399> back<00:00:47.519> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
I think a key element of opening back is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.189 
I think a key element of opening back is
looking<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.269> leave<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> ball<00:00:48.719> well<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:48.960> not

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
looking to leave the ball well and not

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.689 
looking to leave the ball well and not
getting<00:00:49.500> yourself<00:00:49.800> drawn<00:00:50.039> into<00:00:50.280> shots<00:00:50.519> that

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
getting yourself drawn into shots that

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.160 
getting yourself drawn into shots that
you<00:00:50.760> don't<00:00:50.940> need<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> play<00:00:51.300> picking<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> line

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you don't need to play picking the line

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.579 
you don't need to play picking the line
outside<00:00:52.589> off<00:00:52.710> stump<00:00:52.739> maybe<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.879> stump<00:00:54.269> sir

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
outside off stump maybe for stump sir

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.630 
outside off stump maybe for stump sir
say<00:00:55.589> if<00:00:55.649> you're<00:00:55.800> taking<00:00:56.129> middle<00:00:56.339> stump

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
say if you're taking middle stump

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.819 
say if you're taking middle stump
I<00:00:56.730> personally<00:00:57.089> give<00:00:58.019> myself<00:00:58.170> an<00:00:58.500> inch<00:00:58.620> outside

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
I personally give myself an inch outside

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.670 
I personally give myself an inch outside
off<00:00:59.190> stump<00:00:59.300> throw<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> nice<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.839> iron<00:01:01.079> here

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680

try and get a good stride and cover my

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.440 
try and get a good stride and cover my
stumps<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.190> then<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.549> look<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> floor

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
stumps and then I look down at the floor

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.260 
stumps and then I look down at the floor
I<00:01:12.690> can<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.380> no<00:01:14.009> my<00:01:14.159> foots<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.700> line<00:01:15.090> with

I can see that no my foots on line with
this<00:01:15.360> mark<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.750> me<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:16.649> I'm<00:01:16.770> covering<00:01:17.070> my

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280

this mark of me and now I'm covering my
stone<00:01:17.759> sometimes<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:18.630> by<00:01:19.470> playing<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.860> good

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
stone sometimes and by playing a good

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.260 
stone sometimes and by playing a good
forward<00:01:20.250> defensive<00:01:20.729> way<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.909> don't<00:01:21.090> follow

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
forward defensive way you don't follow

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.940

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
inside it but and that's more because

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.430 
inside it but and that's more because
I've<00:01:41.369> tried<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.759> line<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.149> up<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.569> I've<00:01:43.170> got<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
I've tried to line it up and I've got it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.630 
I've tried to line it up and I've got it
slightly<00:01:43.619> wrong<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.039> I<00:01:44.069> just<00:01:44.190> want<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.399> try<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
slightly wrong so I just want to try and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.880 
slightly wrong so I just want to try and
get<00:01:44.789> about<00:01:45.330> how<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> line<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.740> people

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
get about how the line of it some people

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.289 
get about how the line of it some people
like<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.190> do<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.429> because<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> line<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.210> it

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
like to do that because the line and it

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.300 
like to do that because the line and it
openly<00:01:48.569> thing<00:01:48.780> honor<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.289> there<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
openly thing honor that's not there and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.940 
openly thing honor that's not there and
but<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.030> me<00:01:51.179> I<00:01:51.209> feel<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.539> I'm<00:01:52.440> quite<00:01:52.709> clumsy

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
but for me I feel like I'm quite clumsy

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.850 
but for me I feel like I'm quite clumsy
and<00:01:53.520> I'll<00:01:54.000> probably<00:01:54.239> leave<00:01:54.629> it<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.140> place<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and I'll probably leave it in place and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.589 
and I'll probably leave it in place and
Nick<00:01:56.009> off<00:01:56.160> so<00:01:56.399> write<00:01:56.940> me<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.149> want<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.390> try<00:01:57.509> and

Nick off so write me I want to try and

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.059 
Nick off so write me I want to try and
make<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:57.750> song<00:01:58.020> statement<00:01:58.500> get<00:01:58.679> my<00:01:58.739> hands<00:01:58.890> right

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
make a song statement get my hands right

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.100 
make a song statement get my hands right
out<00:01:59.129> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> way<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.940> eliminate<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:00.989> much

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
out of the way and eliminate as much

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.290 
out of the way and eliminate as much
danger<00:02:01.349> as<00:02:01.500> possible<00:02:02.039> as<00:02:02.310> he<00:02:02.459> fenced<00:02:02.700> maybe<00:02:03.090> at

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
danger as possible as he fenced maybe at

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.150 
danger as possible as he fenced maybe at
that<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.450> little<00:02:03.690> bit<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:03.810> mine<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.410> full<00:02:04.619> choir

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
that a little bit so mine is full choir

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.190 
that a little bit so mine is full choir
but<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.819> other<00:02:06.030> day<00:02:06.209> it<00:02:06.450> got<00:02:06.660> quite<00:02:06.869> big<00:02:07.080> on

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
but the other day it got quite big on

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
but the other day it got quite big on
him<00:02:07.319> and<00:02:07.410> he<00:02:07.470> he<00:02:07.679> could<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:07.950> probably

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
him and he he could have probably

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.770 
him and he he could have probably
dropped<00:02:08.429> his<00:02:08.550> hands<00:02:08.879> back<00:02:09.060> out<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> way

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
dropped his hands back out of the way

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.510 
dropped his hands back out of the way
that<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.349> there<00:02:10.530> that's<00:02:10.800> that's<00:02:11.190> an<00:02:11.310> area

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that I think there that's that's an area

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.070 
that I think there that's that's an area
where<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> lot<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:11.940> fast<00:02:12.239> bowlers<00:02:12.599> get<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> lot<00:02:12.989> of

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
where a lot of fast bowlers get a lot of

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.180 
where a lot of fast bowlers get a lot of
wickets<00:02:13.349> with<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.560> extra<00:02:13.800> bit<00:02:13.920> bounce

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
wickets with that extra bit bounce

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.640 
wickets with that extra bit bounce
really<00:02:14.459> on<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.000> harder<00:02:15.690> ball<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.530> it's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
really on with the harder ball so it's

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.600 
really on with the harder ball so it's
one<00:02:16.769> of<00:02:16.800> those<00:02:16.920> where<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.160> want<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> try<00:02:17.519> and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
one of those where you want to try and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.240 
one of those where you want to try and
get<00:02:17.700> gloves<00:02:17.910> out<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.239> way

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.340 

look<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.880> play<00:02:21.970> as<00:02:22.150> late<00:02:22.330> as<00:02:22.360> possible<00:02:23.080> let<00:02:23.260> it

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
look to play as late as possible let it

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.440 
look to play as late as possible let it
come<00:02:23.470> right<00:02:23.710> into<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.070> okay<00:02:24.940> looking<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.330> make

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
come right into you okay looking to make

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.180 
come right into you okay looking to make
contact<00:02:25.870> right<00:02:26.020> under<00:02:26.260> your<00:02:26.350> eyes<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.890> then

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
contact right under your eyes and then

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.240 
contact right under your eyes and then
get<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.090> good<00:02:28.270> strong<00:02:28.480> position<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:30.130> know

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
get in good strong position so you know

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.640 
get in good strong position so you know
getting<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.520> good<00:02:30.670> stride<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:32.380> look<00:02:32.500> into

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
getting a good stride in and look into

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.590 
getting a good stride in and look into
still<00:02:32.920> playing<00:02:33.190> around<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.700> know<00:02:33.850> so<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.450> get

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
still playing around you know so you get

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.420 
still playing around you know so you get
your<00:02:34.690> weight<00:02:34.870> into<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.140> shop<00:02:35.440> will<00:02:36.070> be<00:02:36.250> from

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
your weight into the shop will be from

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.850 
your weight into the shop will be from
poor<00:02:36.670> back<00:02:36.880> foot<00:02:37.090> also<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.470> means<00:02:38.710> that

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
poor back foot also and it means that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.900 
poor back foot also and it means that
you're<00:02:38.980> playing<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.310> right<00:02:39.490> under<00:02:39.670> your<00:02:39.730> eyes

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
you're playing it right under your eyes

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.270 
you're playing it right under your eyes
so<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.210> contact<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.020> ball<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:42.160> know

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
so you contact of the ball is you know

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.950 
so you contact of the ball is you know
in<00:02:42.430> much<00:02:42.610> more<00:02:42.880> control<00:02:43.240> because<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.870> know

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
in much more control because you know

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.480 
in much more control because you know
it's<00:02:44.110> right<00:02:44.290> under<00:02:44.470> your<00:02:44.530> body<00:02:44.710> and<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.460> have

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
it's right under your body and you have

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.390 
it's right under your body and you have
full<00:02:45.730> aware<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.060> what's<00:02:46.240> happening

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.330 

do<00:02:49.819> you<00:02:49.970> have<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.330> mind<00:02:50.569> a<00:02:51.019> handful<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.830> shots<00:02:52.069> a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
do you have in mind a handful of shots a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.880 
do you have in mind a handful of shots a
three<00:02:52.610> shots<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.150> focus<00:02:53.510> on<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.900> think<00:02:54.560> so

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
three shots that you focus on I think so

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.500 
three shots that you focus on I think so
I<00:02:54.920> think<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.280> also<00:02:55.370> depends<00:02:55.819> on<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:55.970> bowler<00:02:56.239> I

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
I think it also depends on the bowler I

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.300 
I think it also depends on the bowler I
mean<00:02:56.720> there's<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.410> taller<00:02:57.650> guy<00:02:57.890> getting<00:02:58.129> a<00:02:58.160> bit

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
mean there's a taller guy getting a bit

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.770 
mean there's a taller guy getting a bit
of<00:02:58.340> extra<00:02:58.489> bounce<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:58.970> probably<00:02:59.239> scoring

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
of extra bounce you probably scoring
