00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:10.669
Okay, so you're telling me that my garden gnomes have not only come to life, but 
 they've also started making out with each other?! This is crazy! This is “Movie Night”!

00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:23.228
*theme song plays*

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:30.870
Hello, and welcome to “Movie Night.” I'm your host, once again battling a cold, 
 but having finally gotten that haircut I was talking about. I'm Jonathan Paula.

00:00:30.658 --> 00:00:39.658
Tonight, we'll be reviewing just one film but it's a brand-new release that came 
 out nationwide yesterday, February 11th. It's the animated film, "Gnomeo and Juliet."

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:43.986
As you'd expect, the title of this movie conveys 
 almost the entire plot in three words. 

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:50.064
This 84-minute family film that is also presented in disappointing 3D 
 opens with a brief introduction explaining that "Gnomeo and Juliet"...

00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:56.387
is yet another contemporary adaptation of the Shakespearean classic, 
 this time with a garden-gnome twist. 

00:00:56.107 --> 00:01:00.107
Similar to the devices employed in other animated classics, like "Toy Story"... 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.750
these lovable gnomes and other garden ornaments only come to 
 life when their human owners are away. 

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:09.946
But, as with the source material, the two neighboring groups 
 of gnomes are at war with each other. 

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:14.282
The gnomes race on lawnmowers in a nearby alley, for sport 
 and spectacle, with the alpha male of the "Reds"... 

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:23.606
Tybalt, voiced hilariously by action star Jason Statham, going up against our 
 protagonist, Gnomeo, a member of the "Blues," voiced by James McAvoy.

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:28.993
Of course, you know the rest of the story: Gnomeo meets Juliet, 
 voiced by Emily Blunt, a beautiful member of the "Reds"... 

00:01:28.308 --> 00:01:35.308
on neutral territory, wearing neutral colors, and they quickly fall in love, 
 just moments before they realize each others' true allegiances. 

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:44.667
It's a delightfully cute and reasonably faithful re-telling of the 16th-Century play, all 
 reenacted by your typical cast of animated characters and goofy stereotypes. 

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:49.120
There are plenty of sight gags, witty references to other 
 Shakespearean works, and lots of exciting action scenes...

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.910
that take on an entirely new perspective when viewed 
 from a gnome's point of view. 

00:01:53.197 --> 00:02:01.200
When Gnomeo's trusted ally, Benny, has to call in some reinforcements against the Reds, 
 he heads inside his owner's house to buy a super-beefed-up lawnmower online...

00:02:01.478 --> 00:02:07.480
and his attempts to navigate the computer's touch pad by dancing on it is 
 a great use of the environment, leading to some good laughs. 

00:02:07.132 --> 00:02:13.130
At the center of this simplified story is your basic star-crossed-lover’s romance 
 that unfortunately doesn't get much time to really develop. 

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:20.720
But in a short, basic kids' movie, it is certainly acceptable. The 
 supporting cast is littered with familiar voices, like Michael Caine...

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:28.570
Maggie Smith, Ozzy Osbourne, Hulk Hogan, and Patrick Stewart, all of whom bring 
 a little bit of personality to their short and, unfortunately, one-dimensional roles.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.840
My strongest complaint about this film unfortunately requires spoiling the ending, 
 which I realize is an ironic thing to announce... 

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:39.350
when we're discussing perhaps the most popular story ever written. 
 But therein lies the issue I have. 

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:45.370
"Gnomeo and Juliet" diverges from the classic tragedy, having both of 
 the title characters survive to a happy ending. 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.280
Granted, in a family-friendly film, having a one-foot-tall gnome 
 commit suicide might be a bit dark...

00:02:50.364 --> 00:02:54.360
but it's that classically tragic ending that makes the 
 Shakespearean story so timeless and memorable. 

00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:59.680
Self-aware of this at least, the film artfully incorporates 
 some deliberate mentions of the original story...

00:02:59.444 --> 00:03:03.440
before Gnomeo quite literally announces that his story will have a happier ending.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.540
It's a clever play by the filmmakers, who are able 
 to have their cake and eat it, too. 

00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:13.010
In a film that is great for kids under 12, parents will be entertained, but 
 there unfortunately isn't much hidden adult humor here for them to laugh at. 

00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:21.840
Elton John, who also serves as the movie's executive producer, lends his music to the film, 
 creating a snappy atmosphere that really sets the mood for the rest of the movie...

00:03:21.662 --> 00:03:27.660
from the opening establishing scene scored to "Crocodile Rock," all the way 
 to the end credits duet he sings with Lady Gaga. 

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:31.940
"Gnomeo and Juliet" is by no means a classic, or even particularly memorable...

00:03:31.596 --> 00:03:37.600
but it is a fun, lighthearted, and familiar love story that children 
 and families will definitely be able to enjoy together. 

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.380
"A cute adventure for everyone." 

00:03:39.127 --> 00:03:44.130
Well, that's what I thought about "Gnomeo and Juliet.” Now, let's 
 see what you had to say in the YouTube comments.

00:03:53.593 --> 00:03:57.590
Okay, now, let’s bring in the Rate-o-Matic, to see 
 how we both scored "Gnomeo and Juliet.” 

00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:07.220
A double “6”! While this film is nothing amazing, or even really memorable, it is still a 
 fun movie, especially to see with the family, or perhaps with a date this Valentine's. 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:16.340
I thought it was "good." You agreed with me, praising the film for its jokes and its appeal to a younger 
 audience, but you complained that it was a bit too derivative.  You also scored it a "good." 

00:04:16.929 --> 00:04:22.930
Well, that does it for tonight's review. Now, let's take a look at 
 what else is currently playing in theaters, with some Tweet Critiques.

00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:39.220
Remember, if you're going to the movies this weekend, make sure to submit your Twitter review, 
 using the #JPMN hashtag, to have it featured on an upcoming episode of "Movie Night."

00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:47.660
Next week, we'll be taking a look at two documentaries that have a lot to 
 do with the Internet: a favorite from the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, "Catfish"...

00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:54.320
which was just released on DVD last month. It explores a very 
 unique and interesting online relationship built entirely through social networks.

00:04:54.962 --> 00:05:00.960
Also next week, we'll be reviewing "Looking For Ms. Locklear," a feature-length 
 film by my friends and fellow YouTubers Rhett and Link.

00:05:00.373 --> 00:05:07.370
It's a story about their quest to track down and find their first-grade teacher, who 
 was responsible for introducing them to one another so many years ago. 

00:05:07.804 --> 00:05:11.800
As always, I encourage you to buy, rent, or 
 download these films before next week's episode... 

00:05:11.714 --> 00:05:16.710
and then let me know what you think about them, by voting in 
 the polls below, or by leaving me a comment review. 

00:05:16.627 --> 00:05:22.630
Once again, my name is Jonathan Paula. Thank you for watching “Movie 
 Night.” I hope to see you right back here next Friday!

00:05:22.678 --> 00:05:36.680
*end credits play*

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:43.690
*Don't forget to tune in to the season 10 
 premiere of the microwave show on April 1st!*
