00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Greetings I am seeing boxes and many times 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 when you come to buy a shoe 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.920
 to a store you can ask yourself this 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.570
 shoe is formal or informal well in this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.030
 video I'll leave the keys 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.920
 fundamental for you to know if a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.869
 shoe is considered formal or 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.680
 informal I hope you like it and go 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.680
 forwards 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.829
 I'm wearing 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.830
 just like when you are going to buy a 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.950
 certain garment a dress a suit or 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.380
 any any complement always 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.750
 think about what situation is going to put you 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.000
 if you 're going to put on a party for 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.250
 go to work or for your moments of 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.620
 leisure a shoe has those same 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.190
 features as a complement that is 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.370
 of your styling you know we have a 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.890
 full playlist a list 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.960
 where are we uploading all the videos 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.070
 or we have gathered together all the best 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.810
 videos that we are going up on the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.720
 shoe in the description of this video 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.660
 I'll leave that link that link or 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.310
 league towards asia this list of 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.740
 special reproduction because it is 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.979
 important to understand all 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.470
 concepts of shoes and when it is 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.720
 better or not to use them of all the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.000
 ways do not worry because we're going to 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.610
 record a video in which we will place 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.090
 perfectly shoes when and in 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.679
 what chance are you going to have to dress 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.200
 all this content that we are 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:45.189
 preparing and that we are recording for 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.079
 you are the ones we went up on monday wednesday and 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.119
 Friday with what I recommend you 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.219
 subscribe to this channel at the moment 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.719
 in which you are subscribed they give you a notice 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.149
 that there is already new content and 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.009
 you can constantly have all the 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.289
 updated videos of the new ones that 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.819
 We are going up well so you know 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.750
 distinguish when a shoe is more 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:09.280
 formal or more informal I'll leave you a 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:13.510
 vital maxim important the more 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.590
 ornaments wear a more casual shoe the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.079
 shoe yes yes the more you adorn more 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.480
 Progress more holes plus seams 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.060
 has a shoe is considered more 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.940
 informal or rather we're going to 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.959
 invest the simpler the more flat 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.599
 smoother is a shoe is much more 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.090
 elegant well if we follow the maxim that 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.090
 I've told you, let's give an example 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.120
 very graphic so you can see it 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.640
 look at the photo that accompanies this image 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.440
 we have a black oxford shoe 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.590
 completely smooth it only has one 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.470
 cut on the instep and this is a shoe 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.230
 which is considered formal normally 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.349
 usually used for morning or morning 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.900
 drive and especially in very events 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.450
 important or attention gala events 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.209
 You can also dress to go to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.280
 work but it already takes you to develop 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.079
 a little more that topic so you can see that 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.110
 you have to get out a little outside of those 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.750
 schemas and we take this second image 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.780
 which is the same model an oxford model 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.920
 the shoe we have put color we have 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.329
 put suede or suede or suede leather and 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.819
 we have completely filled with ornaments 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.920
 as you can see in the image observe 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.769
 well the detail both an image as 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.620
 others are oxford shoes are models 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.060
 equal and yet the black is 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.510
 consider completely formal 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.720
 and in the second image the shoe 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.510
 oxford that I have shown is a shoe 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.700
 informal another element in which we can 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.970
 know if a shoe is formal or a shoe 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.599
 it is informal is in the size of the sole 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.700
 well observe the next maxim that you 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.690
 I'm going to give for the size of the sole 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.620
 the finer the more formal sole 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.650
 is the shoe and the wider the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.440
 sole is more informal and also soles 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.040
 rubber filled with stretch marks etc. and so on 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.530
 all right 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.780
 the finer the more formal sole 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.910
 is the shoe except in the case of 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.400
 boats with a very thin sole 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.669
 and obviously we know that a very shoe 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.510
 informal but fundamentally in 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.940
 Dress Shoes 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.370
 the more finite on the sole in the 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.180
 more formal sole is considered and how much 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.280
 wider is the sole me less formal or 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.500
 it is considered more casual I by 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.140
 example we can have a shoe in black 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.860
 very elegant with a very large sole 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.050
 with rubber bands and me 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.330
 and I would not dream of putting on a shoe 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.849
 that to attend a ceremony with 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.800
 these two maxims you will know perfectly to 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.860
 When to get closer to buying a shoe 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.020
 if that shoe is really being 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.060
 suitable for what you want, let's go 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.580
 to quickly remember how many more 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.430
 ornaments you see a shoe you know it is 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.310
 more informal and the more you plan and 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.669
 less courteous and less seams have that 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.319
 shoe is more formal and let's do it 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.430
 also with the size of the sole 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:20.159
 I just take a shoe if you see that 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.009
 the size of the size of the sole is 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.379
 very small the soles you practically go 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.599
 completely smooth in leather as much 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:30.750
 some skid you know a shoe 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.069
 very formal and vice versa in terms of 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.349
 idea any detail you know that the 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:36.509
 shoe you already have to discard it if 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.699
 you want a ceremony for a wedding 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.189
 official act some very meeting 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.110
 possibly this important business 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:45.259
 video has caused you any kind of 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.550
 doubt you need to ask him a question 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.680
 you want us to expand a lot more 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.040
 theme well use the drawer of the 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.140
 comments 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.320
 and everything you want to transmit to us and 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.250
 automatically very likely from there 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.980
 can leave an interesting video and 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:06.420
 really be curious for others 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:10.030
 people and if you think well we are going to 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.100
 enter it with the trick in the council 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.080
 with which I always like to leave 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.330
 anything of our video more than 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.880
 a council this time knows what 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.490
 I'm going to leave you a curiosity you know that 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.560
 I love sharing with you 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.410
 curiosities or things that I think can 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.570
 be interesting to you well some 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.760
 shoe manufacturers instead of 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.400
 use what they call the flower of the 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.700
 skin the clean part where it does not appear 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.480
 no 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.420
 No penalty no flaw and are 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.640
 using the best quality skin 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:47.510
 some manufacturers as I said 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:49.670
 they use pieces or they save pieces of 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.190
 that skin 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.350
 that offer shoes with a lot of 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.750
 cuts on all sides apparently 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.960
 it seems that they are offering a shoe 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.930
 impressive design and yet what 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.849
 that they have behind is camouflaged low 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.279
 quality on the skin 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:10.169
 in short it is a detail that seemed to me 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:12.599
 Flirty enough to be able 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.889
 comment it and I also think that the 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:16.229
 next is to go buy a shoe 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:19.409
 and see those details will examine very well 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:22.439
 the streaks of the skin and that the shoe 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:25.699
 really live up to the money 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:28.619
 that you want to invest and invest in it 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:31.169
 to close I always tell you that if the 

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:33.899
 video you liked and has covered all 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:36.839
 your expectations give a like to give a 

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:39.029
 I like it because with that we 

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:42.119
 we will know if this content we have 

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:44.429
 elaborated for you is at the height of what 

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:46.740
 what they expected from us because he thinks 

00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:49.289
 that all the work we always do 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:53.629
 we do it trying to add each video 

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:53.629
 more elegance to your style 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.090
 do not
