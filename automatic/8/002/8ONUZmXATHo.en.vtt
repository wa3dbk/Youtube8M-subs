00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.660
 good afternoon dear subscribers and those 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.880
 who are just watching my videos wrong 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.889
 I bought a computer in Denis long ago 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.700
 will be perfect for the game world 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.460
 of tanks 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.650
 it costs inexpensive 25 thousand rubles 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.510
 There technical characteristics this intel 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.510
 latest generation core i5 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:35.790
 card some office nvidia geforce 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:41.239
 600 some there either 20 or 30 4 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.430
 hyperactive memory 1 terabyte of memory 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.989
 hard drive bios some 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.170
 fancy trendy now i'm taking off 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.550
 back cover to show what exactly 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:01.820
 I added this computer does not make noise at all 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.820
 that is, he works quietly husband for a new and 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:13.920
 so we have a hard disk drive here 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 disk one hard disk 2 i added two 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.060
 hard drives one terabyte then 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.710
 there is one show already included and one i 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.189
 added from his old peak 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.520
 what we see here is a big fan 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.060
 on the motherboard which is well when 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.159
 its size is very quiet 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.000
 second fan and 3 fan for 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.770
 cooling power this card i 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.460
 put from his previous 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.460
 my computer is 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.399
 radeon hd 7700 series 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:04.049
 so i added the RAM even before 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.270
 8 gigabyte I have 12 now 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.229
 gigabytes of ram it 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.229
 much better 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.139
 cons are inconvenient to get 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.709
 beat that is the very battery for 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:23.060
 BIOS to reset settings 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.450
 because I already tried it there 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.000
 overclocking it well we assign overclocking 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.310
 maximum it is at maximum 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.359
 settings in world of tanks showed 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:46.519
 I have about a hundred fps minimum without 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:48.319
 overclocking shows 140 150 fps also on 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.389
 maximum settings without overclocking 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.669
 just standard it all costs with 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:59.180
 another card it shows 60 fps 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:02.659
 so not this whole thing did not like me 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.569
 I love when I have a lot of FPS and I added 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:10.930
 RAM and changed 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:13.699
 Video card drive is fast 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.709
 the processor is also a motherboard 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.269
 kind of so weak just 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.780
 two slots there it is myself 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.449
 and how much flight is there a desk for resumes 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.419
 suddenly i want all 2 poster drive 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:30.680
 or a scientist five ports on this is not enough 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:33.069
 I had a computer of my own assembly 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.680
 there was an intel core i5 too 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:40.040
 penultimate generation card there 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.419
 was b75 gigabyte so she was up 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.739
 game tricked out there damn I think 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.349
 what is cooling 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.609
 there is no water required 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.169
 powerful computer and why to play 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.569
 world of tanks some super 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.859
 I'm talking about the perfect 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:05.569
 a computer that does not require there 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:07.819
 some strong additions vat there well 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.430
 can not say that he played he 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.509
 universal he can all is good so far 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.579
 show and in games and in work for there 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:18.910
 photoshop and the like 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.060
 of programs 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.550
 once again I say computers it costs 25 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.440
 thousand rubles that is, its amount is inexpensive 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.250
 but nevertheless its technical 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.680
 characteristics more than normal 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:37.210
 except for the video card and RAM 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:41.470
 it certainly needs to be changed to add everything 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:45.540
 thanks for the video, I will continue to do 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.720
 Reviews on this computer 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:55.860
 I will show it to the maximum acceleration 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.860
 to the author of Bern and catalyst control center 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.190
 Thank you all for watching this video. 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.190
 goodbye
