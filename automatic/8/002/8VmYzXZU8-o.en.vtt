completed every collection in this game

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.259 
completed every collection in this game
that<00:02:08.319> had<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.530> collection<00:02:08.860> bonus<00:02:09.489> on<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.849> so<00:02:10.060> I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
that had a collection bonus on it so I

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.229 
that had a collection bonus on it so I
mean<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.500> free<00:02:11.709> agents<00:02:12.129> are<00:02:12.430> hard<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:13.000> gather

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
mean the free agents are hard to gather

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.710 
mean the free agents are hard to gather
up<00:02:13.599> as<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.080> anyway<00:02:14.319> so

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
up as it is anyway so

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.540 
up as it is anyway so
that's<00:02:16.200> why<00:02:16.350> these<00:02:16.800> packs<00:02:17.100> are<00:02:17.310> actually

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
that's why these packs are actually

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.580 
that's why these packs are actually
going<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.850> pretty<00:02:18.150> useful<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.930> me<00:02:19.140> if<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.410> can

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
