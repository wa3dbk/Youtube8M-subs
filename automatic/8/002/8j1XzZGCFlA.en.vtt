00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.800
 front 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.609
 kilometer and a half say yes tanka and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:30.500
 From behind 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:30.500
 let's go what we see at all 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 Yes 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.579
 observers on their heights on these 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.579
 may be on high ground 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.770
 I do not understand where they have a tank he has 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.400
 direct fire work is still a half 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.400
 kilometers away 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.550
 I understand how a tank can work straight 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.140
 aiming likely just works on 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.200
 hardly anything can even make out 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.640
 his 10 brief is somewhat his 12 or 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.290
 10 times maxim people here will not see 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.290
 if not a mob of cache 10 won't cling 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.080
 either observers somewhere closer we are 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.840
 must be iron eggs so they 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.220
 somewhere lay to field tony too 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 do not be surprised they will fall 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:34.290
 Well, what kind of wind just would not be under them 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:41.190
 case bespontovaya tree kinky collect 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:43.320
 people leave on the sly if they need 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.580
 Andrew is not a fact that he needs my 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.580
 they are all well nourished
