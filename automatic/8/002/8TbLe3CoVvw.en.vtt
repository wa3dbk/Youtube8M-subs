00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you can't judge it because you see it's

magnetic presence about him all of it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.530 
magnetic presence about him all of it

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
for the hunt to tell him that but I do

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.170 
for the hunt to tell him that but I do
think<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:19.020> do<00:02:19.950> think<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.489> this<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.849> not<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
think I do think that this is not the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.550 
think I do think that this is not the
film<00:02:21.390> where<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.599> can<00:02:21.780> now<00:02:22.020> really<00:02:22.290> talk<00:02:22.530> about

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
film where you can now really talk about

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.640 
film where you can now really talk about
anybody's<00:02:23.190> performance<00:02:23.849> because<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:25.260> doesn't

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
anybody's performance because it doesn't

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.920 
anybody's performance because it doesn't
come<00:02:25.860> through<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.580> mean<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.120> comes<00:02:27.599> seems

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
come through I mean it just comes seems

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.809 
come through I mean it just comes seems
so<00:02:28.110> unreal<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.920> whole<00:02:29.099> thing<00:02:29.370> because<00:02:29.670> the

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
so unreal the whole thing because the

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.660 
so unreal the whole thing because the
animation<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.260> know<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.800> think<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
animation that you know I think the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.130 
animation that you know I think the
flesh<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.030> blood<00:02:33.420> characters<00:02:33.900> would<00:02:34.019> have

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
flesh and blood characters would have

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.050 
flesh and blood characters would have
worked<00:02:34.319> better<00:02:34.440> all<00:02:34.950> right<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.580> was<00:02:35.819> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
worked better all right so it was the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.150 
worked better all right so it was the
because<00:02:36.360> big<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.349> also<00:02:37.620> opposite

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
because big this also opposite

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.650 
because big this also opposite

much of an impact nobody does actually

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.210 
much of an impact nobody does actually
because<00:03:09.629> I<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:10.170> think<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.470> technology<00:03:11.069> was

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
because I just think the technology was

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.540 
because I just think the technology was
not<00:03:11.250> very<00:03:12.030> right<00:03:12.360> for<00:03:12.629> this<00:03:12.720> kind<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.110> subject

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
not very right for this kind of subject

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.970 
not very right for this kind of subject
it<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:15.180> obviously<00:03:15.569> sound<00:03:16.230> areas<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.860> areas

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
it is obviously sound areas and areas

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.369 
it is obviously sound areas and areas

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.250 
about it also she claimed you know she
liked<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.599> she<00:03:21.659> was<00:03:21.780> really<00:03:21.959> looking<00:03:22.230> forward

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
liked it she was really looking forward

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.470 
liked it she was really looking forward
to<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> movie<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.010> being<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.700> big<00:03:23.909> head<00:03:24.150> because

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
to the movie to being a big head because

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.360 
to the movie to being a big head because
it<00:03:24.629> obviously<00:03:24.750> had<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.200> rajinikanth<00:03:25.830> factor

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
it obviously had the rajinikanth factor

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.460 
it obviously had the rajinikanth factor
in<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.360> does<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.629> work<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:28.049> saundarya

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
in it so it does it work for saundarya

really cannot pinpoint and tell you that
this<00:03:58.860> particular<00:03:59.099> scene<00:03:59.670> was<00:03:59.879> nice<00:04:00.090> or<00:04:00.390> that's

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
this particular scene was nice or that's

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.550 
this particular scene was nice or that's
going<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.110> get<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.890> ct's<00:04:02.360> no<00:04:03.360> it's<00:04:03.720> false<00:04:04.379> a

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
going to get the ct's no it's false a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.050 
going to get the ct's no it's false a
little<00:04:04.799> flat<00:04:05.189> so<00:04:05.459> it's<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.610> little<00:04:05.760> difficult

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
little flat so it's a little difficult

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.610 
little flat so it's a little difficult
to<00:04:06.330> tell<00:04:06.569> just<00:04:06.720> what<00:04:06.959> people<00:04:07.319> are<00:04:07.379> going<00:04:07.530> to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
to tell just what people are going to

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.559 
to tell just what people are going to
like<00:04:07.769> about<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.129> I<00:04:08.430> would<00:04:09.030> think<00:04:09.269> maybe

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
like about it I would think maybe

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.899 
like about it I would think maybe
hardcore<00:04:10.379> drogyny<00:04:10.830> fans<00:04:11.069> especially<00:04:11.340> those

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
hardcore drogyny fans especially those

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.550 
hardcore drogyny fans especially those
who<00:04:12.120> are<00:04:12.150> going<00:04:12.689> to<00:04:12.750> see<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:12.959> original

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
who are going to see the original

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.099 
who are going to see the original
version<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:14.430> Tamil<00:04:14.819> version<00:04:14.849> perhaps<00:04:15.780> they

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
version the Tamil version perhaps they

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.199 
version the Tamil version perhaps they
would<00:04:16.320> be<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.530> little<00:04:16.739> more<00:04:17.100> raw<00:04:17.459> sympathetic

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
would be a little more raw sympathetic

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.390 
would be a little more raw sympathetic
with<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:18.720> think<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:19.350> Hindi<00:04:19.769> audience<00:04:20.160> and

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
with this I think the Hindi audience and

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.879 
with this I think the Hindi audience and
since<00:04:20.549> we<00:04:20.669> are<00:04:20.699> talking<00:04:20.790> predominantly<00:04:21.600> about

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
since we are talking predominantly about

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.860 
since we are talking predominantly about
the<00:04:21.949> hindi<00:04:22.249> dubbed<00:04:22.490> version<00:04:22.909> I<00:04:23.060> think<00:04:23.780> the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
the hindi dubbed version I think the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.540 
the hindi dubbed version I think the
Hindi<00:04:24.199> audience<00:04:24.530> is<00:04:24.650> going<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.919> be<00:04:25.009> left<00:04:25.219> left

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
Hindi audience is going to be left left

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.040 
Hindi audience is going to be left left
a<00:04:25.669> little<00:04:25.789> cold<00:04:26.150> they're<00:04:26.449> not<00:04:26.569> going<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.840> warm

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
a little cold they're not going to warm

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.040 
a little cold they're not going to warm
up<00:04:27.199> to<00:04:27.229> this<00:04:27.469> simply<00:04:28.099> because<00:04:28.810> also<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:29.900> see

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
up to this simply because also you see

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.379 
up to this simply because also you see
the<00:04:30.169> lip<00:04:30.349> sync<00:04:30.590> etc<00:04:31.159> is<00:04:31.249> not<00:04:31.460> very<00:04:31.699> perfect<00:04:32.180> and

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
the lip sync etc is not very perfect and

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.629 
the lip sync etc is not very perfect and
I<00:04:32.900> think<00:04:33.199> it's<00:04:33.349> win<00:04:33.590> lips<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.159> lip<00:04:34.310> syncing

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
I think it's win lips the lip syncing

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.610 
I think it's win lips the lip syncing
has<00:04:34.789> been<00:04:34.969> done<00:04:35.120> for<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.389> Tamil<00:04:35.719> version<00:04:35.749> so

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
has been done for the Tamil version so

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.709 
has been done for the Tamil version so
it<00:04:36.650> doesn't<00:04:37.310> work<00:04:37.460> very<00:04:37.490> well<00:04:37.759> with<00:04:38.120> them<00:04:38.389> so

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:38.719 
it doesn't work very well with them so

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:39.999 
it doesn't work very well with them so
you<00:04:38.779> really<00:04:39.050> think<00:04:39.199> you're<00:04:39.529> not<00:04:39.800> watching

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
you really think you're not watching

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.100 
you really think you're not watching
rajnikant<00:04:40.729> you're<00:04:40.879> watching<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.360> min<00:04:41.870> and

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
rajnikant you're watching a min and

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.839 
rajnikant you're watching a min and
animation<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:44.240> don't<00:04:44.539> feel<00:04:44.749> the<00:04:44.930> same

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
animation so you don't feel the same

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.339
