00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
think about it like that's kind of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.229 
think about it like that's kind of
impossible<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.710> nothing<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.579> impossible<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
impossible but nothing is impossible and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
that's what it basically teaches you
that<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.789> anything<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.840> put

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that you can do anything that you put

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.050 
that you can do anything that you put
your<00:01:04.140> mind<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:05.820> do
