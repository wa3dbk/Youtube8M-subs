is Microsoft Surface 1.0 and we've seen
these<00:00:14.070> demos<00:00:14.400> before<00:00:14.519> but<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.030> have<00:00:15.210> something

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
so this is the attract application and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.730 
so this is the attract application and
when<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.619> go<00:00:22.800> into<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:24.350> application<00:00:25.350> launcher

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
when we go into the application launcher

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.980 
when we go into the application launcher
we<00:00:26.369> can<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.689> different

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
we can see all the different

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.540 
we can see all the different
applications<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:31.550> Microsoft

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
applications we have here and Microsoft

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.940 
applications we have here and Microsoft
Surface<00:00:32.730> 1.0<00:00:33.450> runs<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.930> Windows<00:00:34.230> Vista<00:00:34.410> behind

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
Surface 1.0 runs on Windows Vista behind

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.850 
Surface 1.0 runs on Windows Vista behind
the<00:00:35.070> scenes<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.600> it<00:00:36.600> uses<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> vision<00:00:37.559> input

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the scenes and it uses a vision input

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.490 
the scenes and it uses a vision input
system<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> show<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.140> just

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
system so I'm going to show you just

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.250 
system so I'm going to show you just
real<00:00:40.860> quick<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.280> shows<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.850> raw<00:00:42.260> camera

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
real quick this shows the raw camera

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.770 
real quick this shows the raw camera
image<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.550> gets<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.149> reflecting<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
image that it gets so it's reflecting it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.880 
image that it gets so it's reflecting it
so<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.200> see<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.629> it<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.110> whatever

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
so we can see it and it can see whatever

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.819 
so we can see it and it can see whatever
you<00:00:50.070> put<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.030> surface<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.350> now<00:00:52.770> that

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you put on to the surface so now that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.700 
you put on to the surface so now that
I've<00:00:53.039> shown<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.550> I'm<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.530> back

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
I've shown you that I'm going to go back

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.290 
I've shown you that I'm going to go back
to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.190> application<00:00:56.879> launcher

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.470

screen we see on Microsoft Surface and

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.670 
screen we see on Microsoft Surface and
not<00:01:22.940> only<00:01:23.180> is<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.330> running<00:01:23.660> this<00:01:24.229> operating

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
not only is it running this operating

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
system I got the touch input to work

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.130 
system I got the touch input to work
more<00:01:27.650> or<00:01:27.740> less<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.660> it's<00:01:29.660> a<00:01:29.750> little<00:01:29.990> bit

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
more or less and it's a little bit

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.750 
more or less and it's a little bit
finicky<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.610> shell<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:33.229> Start<00:01:33.470> screen

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
finicky in the shell in the Start screen

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.249 
finicky in the shell in the Start screen
but<00:01:34.760> I<00:01:35.090> just<00:01:35.479> want<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.690> show<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.080> one<00:01:36.170> of

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
but I just want to show you so one of

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.130 
but I just want to show you so one of
the<00:01:36.320> cool<00:01:36.500> things<00:01:36.530> I<00:01:37.330> can<00:01:38.330> switch<00:01:38.540> back<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.810> the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
the cool things I can switch back to the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.580 
the cool things I can switch back to the
there<00:01:42.140> we<00:01:42.229> go<00:01:43.119> switch<00:01:44.119> back<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.660> Microsoft

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
there we go switch back to the Microsoft

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.070 
there we go switch back to the Microsoft
Surface<00:01:45.800> show<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:49.149> show<00:01:50.149> you<00:01:50.210> one<00:01:50.930> of<00:01:51.020> the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
Surface show and show you one of the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.740 
Surface show and show you one of the
other<00:01:51.170> applications<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:52.009> data<00:01:52.190> visualizer

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
other applications the data visualizer

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.820 
other applications the data visualizer
so<00:01:53.750> instead<00:01:54.050> of<00:01:54.110> launching<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.560> from<00:01:54.649> this

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
so instead of launching it from this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.760 
so instead of launching it from this
shell<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:55.280> have<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.479> pinned<00:01:56.750> as<00:01:56.990> one<00:01:57.470> of<00:01:57.590> my

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
shell I have that pinned as one of my

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.280 
shell I have that pinned as one of my
tiles<00:01:58.670> here<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.780> I'm<00:01:59.840> just<00:01:59.960> going<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.170> launch

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
tiles here so I'm just going to launch

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.609 
tiles here so I'm just going to launch
it<00:02:00.440> from<00:02:00.560> there<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.869> this<00:02:02.869> lets<00:02:03.170> us<00:02:03.320> see

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
it from there and this lets us see

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.430 
it from there and this lets us see
debugging<00:02:04.580> information<00:02:04.869> about<00:02:05.869> individual

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
debugging information about individual

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.859 
debugging information about individual
fingers<00:02:06.800> we<00:02:06.950> can<00:02:06.979> see<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.790> can<00:02:08.090> detect<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:08.720> a

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
fingers we can see it can detect it's a

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.539 
fingers we can see it can detect it's a
finger<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.549> it<00:02:10.549> has<00:02:10.670> an<00:02:10.850> orientation<00:02:11.060> and

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
finger and it has an orientation and

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.130 
finger and it has an orientation and
that's<00:02:13.549> different<00:02:13.850> from<00:02:14.030> deflecting<00:02:14.810> things

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
that's different from deflecting things

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.560 
that's different from deflecting things
as<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.440> blob<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:16.070> beside<00:02:16.430> my<00:02:16.580> hands<00:02:16.940> or

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
as a blob like beside my hands or

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.259 
as a blob like beside my hands or
detecting<00:02:18.410> objects<00:02:19.010> they<00:02:19.610> have<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.790> special

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
detecting objects they have a special

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.350 
detecting objects they have a special
tag<00:02:20.540> as<00:02:22.209> bite<00:02:23.209> by<00:02:24.200> tags<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.769> it<00:02:25.670> can<00:02:25.790> see<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
tag as bite by tags and it can see the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.140 
tag as bite by tags and it can see the
value<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.049> the<00:02:27.260> orientation<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.799> that<00:02:27.950> and
