00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
kind of that clay color so let's try to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.560 
kind of that clay color so let's try to
put<00:01:41.579> some<00:01:41.700> interesting<00:01:42.030> texture<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.479> make

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
put some interesting texture and make

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.030 
put some interesting texture and make
our<00:01:42.689> mouth<00:01:42.840> look<00:01:43.049> more<00:01:43.350> interesting<00:01:43.560> before

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
our mouth look more interesting before

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.340 
our mouth look more interesting before
we<00:01:44.130> bring<00:01:44.250> him<00:01:44.399> into<00:01:44.549> our<00:01:44.700> 3d<00:01:45.090> design<00:01:45.420> tool<00:01:45.659> so

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
we bring him into our 3d design tool so

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.249 
we bring him into our 3d design tool so
we'll<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.649> Toto<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.390> photoshop<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.869> we've

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
we'll go up Toto to photoshop and we've

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.100 
we'll go up Toto to photoshop and we've
got<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.490> green<00:01:50.490> snakeskin<00:01:51.149> image<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:51.930> I

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
got a green snakeskin image here but I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.210 
got a green snakeskin image here but I
think<00:01:52.350> I'll<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.649> something<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.070> little

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
think I'll go something a little

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.800 
think I'll go something a little
different<00:01:53.490> color<00:01:53.700> from<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:54.000> dinosaurs<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.720> I'm

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
different color from my dinosaurs so I'm

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.100 
different color from my dinosaurs so I'm
going<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.079> ahead<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:56.899> do<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> quick

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
going to go ahead and just do a quick

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.660 
going to go ahead and just do a quick
add<00:01:58.350> here<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> new<00:01:58.920> layer<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.189> put<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> little

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
add here of a new layer and put a little

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.930 
add here of a new layer and put a little
color<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.000> it

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.400 

then<00:02:06.940> I'll<00:02:07.060> set<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.360> opacity<00:02:07.540> now<00:02:07.840> on<00:02:08.170> Nats

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
then I'll set the opacity now on Nats

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.810 
then I'll set the opacity now on Nats
like<00:02:08.740> it's<00:02:08.890> mean<00:02:09.040> kind<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.369> nice<00:02:09.550> orange

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
like it's mean kind of a nice orange

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.670 
like it's mean kind of a nice orange
texture<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:10.420> like<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.440> I'll<00:02:11.530> go<00:02:11.650> ahead

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
texture so like that so I'll go ahead

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.110 
texture so like that so I'll go ahead
and<00:02:11.860> use<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:11.980> from<00:02:12.340> my<00:02:12.460> dinosaur<00:02:12.910> I'll<00:02:13.030> go

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and use that from my dinosaur I'll go

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.980 
and use that from my dinosaur I'll go
ahead<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:15.000> slide<00:02:16.000> my<00:02:16.210> file<00:02:16.450> out<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.900> I'll

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
ahead and slide my file out and I'll

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.630 
ahead and slide my file out and I'll
just<00:02:17.200> save<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.380> as<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.590> JPEG<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.220> can<00:02:18.370> bring<00:02:18.520> it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
just save it as a JPEG so I can bring it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.220 
just save it as a JPEG so I can bring it
in<00:02:18.730> easily<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.210> my<00:02:21.690> okay<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:22.990> I've<00:02:23.080> saved

in easily to my okay so now I've saved
out<00:02:23.410> Mike<00:02:23.590> snakeskin<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:24.400> I'll<00:02:24.490> go<00:02:24.640> back<00:02:24.880> over

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
out Mike snakeskin so I'll go back over

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.220
