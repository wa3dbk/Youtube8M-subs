00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
rock I mean when he ran over stone cold

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.620 
rock I mean when he ran over stone cold
and<00:02:31.300> he<00:02:31.480> was<00:02:31.630> like<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.960> did<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.440> for<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.130> rock<00:02:33.630> so
