other night when I went out with my
boyfriend<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.350> just<00:03:55.709> wore<00:03:55.920> some<00:03:56.280> like<00:03:56.489> I

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
boyfriend and just wore some like I

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.789 
boyfriend and just wore some like I
don't<00:03:57.480> even<00:03:57.630> think<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.930> had<00:03:58.049> black<00:03:58.290> liquid<00:03:58.560> line

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
don't even think I had black liquid line

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.250 
don't even think I had black liquid line
I<00:03:58.829> think<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.160> just<00:03:59.190> have<00:03:59.519> my<00:03:59.549> scar<00:03:59.910> on<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.510> I

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
I think I just have my scar on and I

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.539 
I think I just have my scar on and I
paint<00:04:01.859> pot<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.340> then<00:04:03.030> red<00:04:03.780> lips<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:05.250> felt

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
paint pot and then red lips and it felt

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.030 
paint pot and then red lips and it felt
really<00:04:05.730> nice<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:07.079> same<00:04:07.350> power<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.859> these

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
really nice and the same power of these

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.520 
really nice and the same power of these
was<00:04:08.940> actually<00:04:09.359> quite<00:04:09.479> good<00:04:09.630> for<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.109> red<00:04:10.290> one

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
was actually quite good for the red one

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.550 
was actually quite good for the red one
and

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
and

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.800 
and
I<00:04:11.650> tend<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.520> find<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.819> Amber<00:04:13.150> Rose<00:04:13.330> wears<00:04:13.599> off

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
I tend to find that Amber Rose wears off

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.259 
I tend to find that Amber Rose wears off
really<00:04:14.020> easily<00:04:14.319> but<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.280> love<00:04:15.520> applying<00:04:15.849> it<00:04:16.090> so

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
really easily but I love applying it so

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.659 
really easily but I love applying it so
that<00:04:16.419> doesn't<00:04:16.690> matter<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:17.049> me<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:18.280> haven't

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
that doesn't matter to me and I haven't

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.310 
that doesn't matter to me and I haven't
worn<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:19.030> plum<00:04:19.269> one<00:04:19.450> out<00:04:19.630> yet<00:04:19.870> although<00:04:20.079> I've

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
worn the plum one out yet although I've

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.020 
worn the plum one out yet although I've
tried<00:04:20.590> it<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:20.829> I<00:04:20.889> haven't<00:04:21.340> won<00:04:21.459> this<00:04:21.639> out<00:04:21.820> yet

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
tried it on I haven't won this out yet

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.180 
tried it on I haven't won this out yet
and<00:04:22.060> kind<00:04:22.240> of<00:04:22.360> think<00:04:22.540> of<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.750> way<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:23.290> wear<00:04:23.950> this

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
and kind of think of a way to wear this

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.670 
and kind of think of a way to wear this
would<00:04:24.400> maybe<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:25.120> really<00:04:25.570> bronzed<00:04:26.050> face<00:04:26.290> so

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
would maybe a really bronzed face so

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.460 
would maybe a really bronzed face so
that<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.860> kind<00:04:27.100> of<00:04:27.310> don't<00:04:27.970> look<00:04:28.240> too<00:04:28.600> bumpy<00:04:29.020> with

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.700 
that I kind of don't look too bumpy with
it<00:04:29.560> on<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:30.750> but<00:04:31.750> i'm<00:04:31.990> not<00:04:32.139> sure<00:04:32.320> i'm<00:04:32.410> not<00:04:32.470> sure
