down and if you follow this method you
get<00:01:46.240> so<00:01:46.689> many<00:01:46.840> more<00:01:47.020> servings<00:01:47.439> out<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.740> it

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
get so many more servings out of it

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.139 
get so many more servings out of it
we're<00:01:48.009> going<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.159> take<00:01:48.219> the<00:01:48.520> leg<00:01:48.670> off<00:01:48.850> we're

to take the breasts off and then we

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.190 
to take the breasts off and then we
can't<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:52.840> meat

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
can't the meat

sharp knife and a carving fork take the

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.429 
sharp knife and a carving fork take the
knife<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.990> using<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.079> tip<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.350> blade

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
knife and using the tip of the blade

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.399 
knife and using the tip of the blade
we're<00:01:59.829> just<00:01:59.979> going<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.159> cut<00:02:00.579> through<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:02.049> skin

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
we're just going to cut through the skin

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.649 
we're just going to cut through the skin
of<00:02:02.439> the<00:02:02.649> thigh<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.380> you've<00:02:05.530> cut<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.950> skin<00:02:06.659> fold

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
of the thigh so you've cut the skin fold

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.350 
of the thigh so you've cut the skin fold
the<00:02:07.840> bird<00:02:07.990> over<00:02:08.200> onto<00:02:08.679> its<00:02:08.799> breasts<00:02:09.220> like<00:02:10.149> that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
the bird over onto its breasts like that

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.860 
the bird over onto its breasts like that
and<00:02:10.599> then<00:02:10.899> you<00:02:11.019> just<00:02:11.230> peel<00:02:11.560> back<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.220> leg<00:02:12.870> like

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
and then you just peel back the leg like

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.449 
and then you just peel back the leg like
that<00:02:15.180> there<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.269> go<00:02:16.680> now<00:02:17.680> what<00:02:17.860> we've<00:02:17.980> got<00:02:18.130> here

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
that there we go now what we've got here

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.670 
that there we go now what we've got here
this<00:02:18.849> actually<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.750> very<00:02:20.110> best<00:02:20.349> part<00:02:20.650> of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
this actually is the very best part of

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.960 
this actually is the very best part of
the<00:02:20.769> turkey<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.310> lot<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.430> people<00:02:21.760> missed

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
the turkey and a lot of people missed

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.069 
the turkey and a lot of people missed
this<00:02:23.069> that<00:02:24.069> is<00:02:24.250> what<00:02:24.610> we<00:02:24.730> call<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.599> oyster

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
this that is what we call the oyster

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.890 
this that is what we call the oyster
that's<00:02:26.319> in<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.590> back<00:02:26.920> rib<00:02:27.190> cage<00:02:27.459> it's<00:02:28.239> similar

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
that's in the back rib cage it's similar

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.170 
that's in the back rib cage it's similar
to<00:02:29.049> the<00:02:29.200> Filat<00:02:29.549> look<00:02:30.549> at<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.030> that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
to the Filat look at that and that

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.050 
to the Filat look at that and that
actually<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.870> carvers<00:02:32.290> perks<00:02:32.849> so<00:02:33.849> turn

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
actually is the carvers perks so turn

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.880 
actually is the carvers perks so turn
the<00:02:34.150> turkey<00:02:34.420> back<00:02:34.810> over<00:02:35.230> onto<00:02:35.950> its<00:02:36.099> back<00:02:36.870> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
the turkey back over onto its back and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.220 
the turkey back over onto its back and
then<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.160> hold<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.489> wing<00:02:39.670> tip<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.230> because

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
then just hold the wing tip and because

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.259 
then just hold the wing tip and because
we've<00:02:41.380> let<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.620> turkey<00:02:41.920> stand<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:42.790> nice<00:02:43.030> and

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
we've let the turkey stand it's nice and

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.720 
we've let the turkey stand it's nice and
cool<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:43.690> can<00:02:43.810> handle<00:02:44.109> the<00:02:44.230> bird<00:02:44.730> that's

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
cool so you can handle the bird that's

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.580 
cool so you can handle the bird that's
very<00:02:45.940> easy<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.420> will<00:02:46.510> just<00:02:46.660> peel<00:02:46.870> off<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.440> if

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
very easy that will just peel off and if

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.270 
very easy that will just peel off and if
you<00:02:47.739> have<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.239> just<00:02:49.239> slip<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.109> wing<00:02:50.260> off<00:02:50.410> so

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
you have to just slip the wing off so

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.009 
you have to just slip the wing off so
that's<00:02:51.459> exposed<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.209> whole<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.750> breast

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
that's exposed the whole of the breast

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.840 
that's exposed the whole of the breast
and<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.650> itself<00:02:54.010> would<00:02:54.310> make<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.549> easier

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
and that in itself would make it easier

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.120 
and that in itself would make it easier
to<00:02:54.970> carve<00:02:55.209> but<00:02:55.840> we<00:02:55.930> only<00:02:56.049> go<00:02:56.200> step<00:02:56.560> further<00:02:56.590> and

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
to carve but we only go step further and

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.289 
to carve but we only go step further and
we're<00:02:57.250> going<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.400> take<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.730> whole<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.060> that

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
we're going to take the whole of that

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.900 
we're going to take the whole of that
breast<00:02:58.540> off<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.200> put<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.530> onto<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.799> plate<00:02:59.980> so

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
breast off and put it onto the plate so

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.690 
breast off and put it onto the plate so
with<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.180> sharp<00:03:01.450> knife<00:03:01.660> just<00:03:01.930> follow<00:03:02.739> the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
with the sharp knife just follow the

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.530 
with the sharp knife just follow the
line<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.180> bone<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:06.549> concentrate<00:03:07.299> on

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
line of the bone and just concentrate on

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.809 
line of the bone and just concentrate on
keeping<00:03:08.139> in<00:03:08.440> tight<00:03:08.859> you<00:03:10.049> know<00:03:11.609> that<00:03:12.609> way

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
keeping in tight you know that way

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.099 
keeping in tight you know that way
you're<00:03:13.269> not<00:03:13.389> going<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.600> leave<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.720> lot<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:13.900> meat

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
you're not going to leave a lot of meat

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.319 
you're not going to leave a lot of meat
on<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.380> carcass<00:03:14.769> you'll<00:03:15.639> get<00:03:15.790> as<00:03:15.910> much<00:03:16.030> off<00:03:16.209> as

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
on the carcass you'll get as much off as

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.330 
on the carcass you'll get as much off as
possible<00:03:16.750> with<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.410> carving<00:03:17.620> for<00:03:17.980> put<00:03:18.250> it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
possible with the carving for put it

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.099 
possible with the carving for put it
into<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.579> breast<00:03:18.819> and<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.510> could<00:03:19.660> just<00:03:19.810> fold

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
into the breast and you could just fold

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.059 
into the breast and you could just fold
it<00:03:20.319> back<00:03:20.500> pull<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.130> back<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.609> that<00:03:21.819> exposes

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
it back pull it back and that exposes

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.729 
it back pull it back and that exposes
the<00:03:24.069> bird<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.090> can<00:03:25.470> see<00:03:26.470> what<00:03:26.620> you're

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
the bird so you can see what you're

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:35.490 
the bird so you can see what you're
doing<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.010> little<00:03:27.160> easier<00:03:27.599> in<00:03:30.030> there<00:03:31.030> we<00:03:31.239> go<00:03:34.500> so

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
doing a little easier in there we go so

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.080 
doing a little easier in there we go so
that's<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.829> hole<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.340> turkey<00:03:36.700> breast<00:03:36.819> off

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
that's the hole of the turkey breast off

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.680 
that's the hole of the turkey breast off
as<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.139> say<00:03:38.319> I<00:03:38.349> make<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:38.769> look<00:03:38.919> quite<00:03:39.220> easy<00:03:39.690> it

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
as I say I make this look quite easy it
