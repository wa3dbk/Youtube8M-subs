00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
invent it I wanted it to be modular I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
invent it I wanted it to be modular I
wanted<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.619> something<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.280> could

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
wanted it to be something that I could

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.090 
wanted it to be something that I could
grow<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:06.030> collection<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.979> the

and the transport ability feature was

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.380 
and the transport ability feature was
actually<00:01:13.350> something<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.710> came<00:01:14.010> along<00:01:14.220> later

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
position and vice versa because of the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.140 
position and vice versa because of the
stacking<00:01:29.250> guides<00:01:29.460> all<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> weight<00:01:29.939> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
stacking guides all the weight is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.569 
stacking guides all the weight is
distributed<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> outside<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> only

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
distributed to the outside so the only

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.520

thing you have to do after that is lock

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.990 
thing you have to do after that is lock
