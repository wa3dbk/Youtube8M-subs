00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.609
 hi sandra girls i hope that 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.680
 you are well today I you 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.960
 found for an order I have 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.240
 spent on the site make up revolution 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.709
 so I saw that on the internet there was 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.730
 many who talk about it right now 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.890
 especially on youtube 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.570
 me it's been a while since I 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.270
 ordered I had already done a 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.200
 first video but I found that 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.320
 here I have a little comparison 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.100
 with the mountains the copies I had 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.140
 bought on ebay 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.880
 but now I thought it would have been 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.260
 more fun to really test them before 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.149
 to talk about it 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.680
 so I redo this video there 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.220
 today because I tested the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.200
 products 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.660
 I watched a lot of swatch on 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.790
 internet compared to real ones a 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.300
 team because I have necessarily taken the 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.070
 three so the year leaves 1-2-3 that he 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.320
 call icon it seems to me ikonik 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.630
 iconic 3 iconic economic 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.680
 1 so I said ordered there is a 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.420
 little time 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.360
 I think that at that moment we do not 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.460
 did not speak too much and that's why I had 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.080
 ordered the three I saw that as and when 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.910
 as the videos the sons said that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.840
 there are pallets they had in 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.550
 sold out 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.320
 necessarily because if they are 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.200
 really good quality 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 so it's the same I'll put you 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.780
 the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.550
 products in info bar for that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.540
 you will look after I can not 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.520
 tell you if there are any who are in 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.619
 out of stock or not so that makes a 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.300
 little moment that I ordered them so 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.100
 so here it is true that these are 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.500
 really very very good product 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.899
 the price it's going to cost I believe that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.040
 for the three I had to have 25 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.110
 euros with postage included 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.670
 so the shipping costs are quite expensive 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.470
 So I find that the pale and cold as 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.560
 the palette was 5 a year from 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.360
 thing like that so so here I go 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.759
 show you the pallets 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.229
 after if you really want more 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.210
 of information you tell me this is 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.310
 really you want to introduce I'm going 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.110
 not all of you this game and even I 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.729
 sell less show you what it gives 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.280
 so that it was the first born kid 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.440
 so she looks like this so 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.380
 it's really the colors of the naked 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.970
 the pigmentation is really perfect 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.350
 so see the delays little stuff in 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.010
 plastic but I think it's not bad 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.950
 it does not bother so that's what it's all about 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.170
 looks like I already did I already did 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.330
 a lot of make up with that and I 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.680
 find really very very pretty so I 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.200
 will show you the pigmentation of 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.110
 some so you see I pass I 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.269
 pass once my finger and see 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.489
 what it gives is really a very 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.870
 very good pigmentation after we say 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.100
 often only on the fingers it does not 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.980
 the same as on the eyes but I 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.140
 can you make sure if because because 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.610
 that here with a brush is really 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.370
 a very good attendance too 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.450
 I will show you the black tac and 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.610
 That's what happens 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.209
 she is really very very nice 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.350
 colors that you show a clearer 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.600
 up the clearest so so here's for the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.070
 for the 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.290
 and I find that the colors are 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.310
 really beautiful i will make you 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.090
 this here 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:07.490
 hop and the last the little pink 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.640
 so you see the pigmentation is 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.750
 really very good makeup 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.750
 are really good 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.300
 the lighthouses lasts all day so 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.440
 so here I am I always put by 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.850
 against a base but I have so much 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.250
 used to put a base I have 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.780
 not tested this time do but for me 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.340
 I tell myself that it takes so much not 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.320
 a lot of time to put a base that 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.700
 here I am moaning with a ride 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.690
 by the way to a base I bought it 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.770
 I need to talk about what she is 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.590
 super super good I was super surprised 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:44.030
 so then you have there iconic 2 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.100
 so she looks like this so 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.320
 the colors are still necessary 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.330
 one and the two are alike 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.630
 it's all about helping women 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.400
 brownies so you see that 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.080
 is still quite similar but it's 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.770
 pallets still enough 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.170
 different 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.300
 we have much lighter headlights 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.770
 but after the rounds is a little the 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.270
 same is that it's the same for 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.750
 the year that of and for the year that of 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:12.740
 anyway so like the other I you 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.300
 shows some colors tac I'm here 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.590
 is really very very bright as 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.560
 you can see he's really very 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:24.200
 very pretty and I'm going to show you a 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:28.810
 rape is funny hop here for the 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.430
 pigmentation was still super good 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.720
 I also tested this palette I was 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.010
 his I made make-ups with all 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.340
 the palettes to see what it gives 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.630
 and was really going to pigmentation is 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.190
 really very good he's stirred 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.320
 perfect I can not tell you the 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.230
 I do not lie to you 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.210
 so that's what it gives you like 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.600
 laughter and maths and resins 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.580
 hold as well as 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.860
 matt so here and for the third 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.840
 they look like these and that's where 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.630
 is it 3 and I believe it's 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:07.080
 this one which was often broken 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:09.300
 so she looks like this and this one 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.990
 I also made make up with you 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.400
 to show the rose what am I going 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:20.730
 show you others I showed you 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:26.940
 a pink a little darker year the one 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:28.380
 this is the last one it's a rape and a 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.060
 little black 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.040
 so you see I spent only one 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.680
 times my finger the colors are too 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.000
 of the middle especially this one but I 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.840
 really find its colors too 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.400
 magnificent 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.630
 so that's what she gives and I'm 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.490
 really happy to have bought them 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.130
 because there the kills it seems to me that 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.230
 the colors stop that pretty much 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.600
 that at the lighthouse elan the lighthouses are 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.130
 much bigger after good it's 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.040
 plastic as I told you but me 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.230
 I have a drawer there this one where the range 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.760
 everything but pallet so anyway 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.500
 I am careful it is not 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.000
 pallets that I'm going to break 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.900
 I've been trying for a while anyway 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.940
 now this case maybe two 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.150
 month that I have them I do not tell you from 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.380
 nonsense but now for a little more 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.030
 of 20 or I think it was a 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.590
 good deal and with the quality 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:23.690
 I really have nothing to say so I 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:27.180
 put all the colors there is this one 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.100
 so that's what's got here so you see 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.050
 the colors are super bright the 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.660
 pigmentation is super good 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.430
 so that's what it gives on my hand 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.910
 I will try to write you an article 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.100
 on the blog where I will put everything 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.180
 love all I have to swatch 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.560
 take the time to do it 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.110
 especially that right now that I miss him 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.570
 it's time so but you can 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.060
 see that it's really me play 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.610
 do not hesitate if you want to order 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.330
 I think for 25 euros it's not 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.770
 all Bernac 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.880
 on the contrary it's headlights 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.400
 hold well after me I eat 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.080
 I do not care about having the night 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.940
 doping is that there's something that pulls 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.130
 really it really pulls them to heart 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.870
 to have the originals me I do not care 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.940
 a little bit of the world the colors please me 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.420
 so here I find that for 25 euros 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.750
 it's really cheap and that's it 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.310
 anyway the swatch 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.770
 we can clearly see that it is 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.540
 now it's super pretty colors 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.540
 and I tell you that it is 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.920
 really very good so so here's 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.150
 do not hesitate to ask me questions 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.520
 do not hesitate to tell me what you are 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.160
 think if you ordered them and 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.810
 then it's over for this video 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.380
 I tell you very quickly 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.380
 Hi
