you're<00:00:33.630> still<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> add<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.410> bit

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
you're still going to add a little bit

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.520

of water to it just to kind of soften it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.270 
of water to it just to kind of soften it
up<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:40.860> bit<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.219> make<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.520> flow<00:00:43.280> it's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
up a little bit and make it flow it's

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
up a little bit and make it flow it's
okay<00:00:44.550> if<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:44.940> pure<00:00:45.300> white<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.780> don't

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
okay if it's not pure white you don't

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.410 
okay if it's not pure white you don't
really<00:00:46.170> want<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.500> stars<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.950> pure<00:00:47.219> white<00:00:47.489> in

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
really want your stars be pure white in

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.510 
really want your stars be pure white in
most<00:00:48.690> cases<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
most cases just because it's so and I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
most cases just because it's so and I
mean<00:00:56.760> mainly<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.870> makes<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
mean mainly because it just makes it a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.290 
mean mainly because it just makes it a
little<00:00:58.680> bit<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.340> uninteresting<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
little bit more uninteresting and the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.660 
little bit more uninteresting and the
stark<00:01:00.600> white<00:01:00.840> stars<00:01:01.260> tend<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> stick<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.640> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
stark white stars tend to stick out a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.590 
stark white stars tend to stick out a
little<00:01:02.789> too<00:01:03.180> much

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.980 

and<00:01:06.159> this<00:01:07.159> particular<00:01:07.490> technique<00:01:08.299> I

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
and this particular technique I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.679 
and this particular technique I
developed<00:01:09.259> by<00:01:09.830> watching<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.640> space<00:01:11.240> painters

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
developed by watching the space painters

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.539 
developed by watching the space painters
out<00:01:11.869> of<00:01:12.020> if<00:01:12.380> you've<00:01:12.560> seen<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.009> space<00:01:13.220> painter

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
out of if you've seen the space painter

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.999 
out of if you've seen the space painter
so<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:13.790> spray<00:01:14.150> paint<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.740> it's<00:01:15.740> just<00:01:15.920> you

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
so you spray paint and it's just you

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.620 
so you spray paint and it's just you
what<00:01:16.610> they<00:01:16.729> do<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:16.940> spray<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.210> little<00:01:17.330> on<00:01:17.479> their

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
what they do is spray a little on their

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.270 
what they do is spray a little on their
hands<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:17.930> then<00:01:18.080> just<00:01:18.229> flick<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.560> Stars<00:01:18.979> onto

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
hands and then just flick the Stars onto

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.639 
hands and then just flick the Stars onto
the<00:01:19.399> onto<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.909> paper<00:01:20.750> or<00:01:20.990> wherever<00:01:21.500> they're

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
the onto the paper or wherever they're

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.920 
the onto the paper or wherever they're
working<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:22.759> this<00:01:23.270> technique<00:01:23.659> is<00:01:23.690> just

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
working and this this technique is just

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.969 
working and this this technique is just
comes<00:01:24.110> right<00:01:24.200> out<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.500> that<00:01:24.619> you're<00:01:24.860> just

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
comes right out of that you're just

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.340 
comes right out of that you're just
making<00:01:25.369> a<00:01:25.460> thin<00:01:25.909> paint<00:01:26.149> getting<00:01:27.080> in<00:01:27.140> on<00:01:27.229> your

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
making a thin paint getting in on your

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.719 
making a thin paint getting in on your
fingers<00:01:27.649> and<00:01:27.680> just<00:01:27.950> flicking<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:28.460> right<00:01:28.610> on

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
fingers and just flicking it right on

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.190 
fingers and just flicking it right on
the<00:01:28.820> canvas<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:29.479> want<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.720> definitely<00:01:29.899> want

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
the canvas you want to definitely want

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.149 
the canvas you want to definitely want
it<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.289> be<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.409> little<00:01:30.440> thinner<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:30.890> don't<00:01:31.039> want

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
it to be a little thinner you don't want

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.740 
it to be a little thinner you don't want
to<00:01:31.220> have<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.369> if<00:01:31.789> you're<00:01:31.940> doing<00:01:32.119> starts<00:01:32.479> doing

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
to have a if you're doing starts doing

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.180 
to have a if you're doing starts doing
like<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.280> funky<00:01:35.350> splat<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:36.680> anywhere<00:01:36.979> in<00:01:37.100> the

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
like a funky splat in anywhere in the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.800 
like a funky splat in anywhere in the
side<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:37.580> we're<00:01:37.670> just<00:01:37.700> basically<00:01:38.240> just<00:01:38.600> doing

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
side so we're just basically just doing

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.120 
side so we're just basically just doing
this<00:01:38.869> little<00:01:39.080> bit<00:01:39.170> of<00:01:39.229> an<00:01:39.319> arc<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.649> maybe<00:01:39.860> a

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
this little bit of an arc and maybe a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.130 
this little bit of an arc and maybe a
little<00:01:40.580> bit<00:01:40.909> on<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.119> edge<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:41.450> there<00:01:41.690> just

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
little bit on the edge up there just

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.960 
little bit on the edge up there just
kind<00:01:42.319> of<00:01:42.409> taking<00:01:42.619> going<00:01:43.429> my<00:01:43.580> little<00:01:43.819> finger

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
kind of taking going my little finger
