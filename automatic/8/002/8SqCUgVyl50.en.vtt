00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 and 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.799
 forgiveness love 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.110
 It was a full moon night but also 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.779
 a night of sweat blood screams 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.490
 tears textual words of the 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.310
 gospels there in the olive grove 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.779
 the problem was not whether jesus died or not 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 but if he died died voluntarily 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.000
 Lord of history the father had 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.750
 allowed the child to be removed from 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.630
 that way and at that age 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.710
 and the son after screaming and crying and 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:45.650
 sweating blood I accept that will and 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.190
 he gave himself without violence to violence 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.280
 of the facts leaving in silence 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.120
 and peace in the hands of whoever allowed his 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.170
 martyrdom and great combat arose the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.839
 great victory 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.140
 the agony combat that that's what 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.330
 means it had been between what I 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.760
 I want and what you want 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.010
 as jesus the three confidants and 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.860
 in front of them he began to feel horror 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:20.340
 and anguish and he made them this terrible 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.340
 confession I feel sadness of death 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.119
 I die of sadness 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.690
 He turned away from them and fell to the ground 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.250
 Dad said dear everything is possible for 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.920
 Please, please take this chalice away from me 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.400
 but if it is not possible to not do what 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.250
 I want but what you want 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.100
 a dark night had seized the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.910
 soul of jesus it seemed to him that the father 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.430
 I was far away or I just was not 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:56.030
 as there was no divine consolation I seek 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.520
 human consolation rose it went 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 where they were and found them 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.800
 asleep, be awake and pray 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.750
 he warned them he left them back to solitude and 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.750
 entering in agony he prayed more 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.260
 agonizingly repeating the same 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.630
 words remove this chalice from me but if 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.450
 it is not possible that this chalice will pass from me 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.530
 without me drinking it, do not do what I 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.640
 I want but what you want 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.490
 the great crisis was at its height in its 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.709
 terrible loneliness again sought jesus a 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.010
 little consolation going back to his three 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.760
 confidantes vana illusion followed 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.690
 asleep nothing said to them back to the place 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.970
 of the agony repeating if it is not possible 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.239
 let this chalice of anise pass by without me 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.970
 drink it do not do what I want but 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:57.180
 whatever you want you going to repeat 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:59.670
 the same words be done be 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.489
 he got up for the third time and left 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.780
 new where they were but this time 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:11.180
 he told them resolutely enough already the 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.549
 time and let us go up as if to say 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.430
 enough of vacillations enough of claims 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.340
 enough of tears enough of fears enough 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.209
 of anguish and protests is enough 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.450
 complaints and cowardice came the time the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.000
 time of resolution and delivery 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.090
 get up and let's go and started the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.510
 pilgrimage of pain and love for 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.569
 death and moved silently but 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.120
 resolutely with his gaze fixed on the 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.930
 will of the father without a gesture of 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.590
 bitterness dress of serenity and peace 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.590
 until the end 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.109
 for all of you the time also came 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.109
 the time of
