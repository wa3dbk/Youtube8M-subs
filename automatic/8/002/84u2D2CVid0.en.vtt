00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello and servus today is about the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.549
 Adjustment of your parking brake 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.280
 Handbrake on your vehicle and that 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.410
 with a drum brake, I varied 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.570
 Show yourself today at a 46 of the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.730
 just behind a drum brake has as 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 Parking brake this may be required 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.439
 if you eg the brake-baking at 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.300
 a drum brake renews the drum 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.210
 renewed your floor renewed itself 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.300
 or your hand brake already over ten 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.500
 is big and thus the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 brake effect of the drum easy to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 is weak first dissolved at their 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340
 two rear wheels of a wheel 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.870
 screw out of the rat out and then to 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.480
 the setting screw to come 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.760
 I'll show you in this video yes 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 whole procedures on one side so on 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.289
 a wheel in the end did that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.289
 Same on the other side 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.280
 so first takes the cover of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.399
 handbrake down 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.170
 just to the side a little bit 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.280
 impress and pull up 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.250
 then you die all the way forward 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.939
 and now you solve both nuts counter 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.560
 here for both sides left and right 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:18.450
 completely off so best with a 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.610
 For ten long, both nuts must be complete 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.960
 Solve so after you both cables 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.189
 have relaxed we can by again 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.110
 go back to the wheels 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.729
 so now could talk back 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.310
 simply jack up the jack 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.810
 take care in the recording approaches 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.159
 that she does not start wrong or you 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:43.770
 damaged the recordings and then the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:48.460
 Dare to pick up a wheel now 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.130
 Turning freely takes the chance 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.220
 and looks for the adjustable one 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.080
 drum brake which can depending on the year of construction 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.940
 either in the case at 90 position 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.119
 So be back to the car show 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.790
 or at 6 o'clock position 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.470
 as is best seen with a lamp 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.200
 hole and looking for the enrollment 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.880
 you can see here in part 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.310
 I have the drawing before that 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.989
 one sees teeth red and around 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.000
 now the brake pads closer to the 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.670
 To drum you turn on this 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.900
 wheel the sprocket inside so that 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.030
 the adjustment screw in the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.459
 length attracts her and thus the documents 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.810
 The drum presses when tightening sees 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.330
 In this case you also get more and more from 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.030
 winner because he so to speak with the part 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.560
 the tooth completely from the profit of 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.540
 screwed down so now turned the 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.070
 Lock the brake to not the wheel 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.070
 could move more by hand 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.610
 and now turns exactly ten days again 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.250
 back so the brake opens at 10 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.320
 things so now could be the handbrake around 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.300
 put on two to four pips and pulls 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.340
 then again so firmly until the 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.180
 rear wheels just barely by hand 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.180
 let rotate freely 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.200
 when you release the handbrake again 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.340
 Your bike should be completely free 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.380
 can be rotated so because he now on both 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.270
 about the same braking effect 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.950
 you can do the wheel bolts again 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:33.580
 turn in and turn the cart again 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.580
 let down 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.950
 Now you are still pulling your wheel bolts 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.630
 depending on the vehicle and rim with approximately 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.630
 100 to 120 newton meters 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.760
 and you are done that way if you are now 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.530
 a handbrake lever completely solved 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.450
 you should have your lights shining like the hand 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.769
 and of course not shine and the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.260
 Wheels rotate freely 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.510
 at the first jag, yes, the light can 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.849
 light or not and you should 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.129
 have no braking effect on the second 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.019
 the light must shine and you must 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.680
 should a slight braking effect too 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.079
 have felt 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.909
