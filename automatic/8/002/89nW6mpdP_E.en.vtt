00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.850 
also when you consider the fact that
it's<00:02:25.910> fully<00:02:26.239> sealed<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:27.080> does<00:02:27.290> have<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> little

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
it's fully sealed it does have a little

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.430 
it's fully sealed it does have a little
bit<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.070> an<00:02:28.220> impact<00:02:28.820> on<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.030> sound<00:02:29.269> quality<00:02:29.690> if

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
bit of an impact on the sound quality if

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:39.010 
bit of an impact on the sound quality if
we<00:02:30.560> start<00:02:30.830> up<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:30.980> music<00:02:31.400> play

[Music]

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.500 

we<00:02:48.070> actually<00:02:48.250> think<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.760> sound<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.300> is

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
we actually think the sound of that is

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.640 
we actually think the sound of that is
pretty<00:02:50.320> good<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.870> could<00:02:53.020> take<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.320> out<00:02:53.410> with

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
pretty good you could take it out with

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.310 
pretty good you could take it out with
you<00:02:53.740> while<00:02:53.920> you're<00:02:54.070> out<00:02:54.310> training<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:56.200> of

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
you while you're out training and of

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.050 
you while you're out training and of
course<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.590> works<00:02:56.800> with<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.100> sound<00:02:57.610> instead<00:02:57.910> of

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
course it works with a sound instead of

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.290 
course it works with a sound instead of

might<00:03:15.700> expect<00:03:16.830> one<00:03:17.830> thing<00:03:17.890> we'll<00:03:18.190> have<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.340> look

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
might expect one thing we'll have a look

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.120 
might expect one thing we'll have a look
at<00:03:18.640> now<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:19.090> web<00:03:19.420> browser<00:03:19.690> and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
at now is the web browser and

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.890 
at now is the web browser and
immediately<00:03:21.130> obvious<00:03:21.280> thing<00:03:21.670> with<00:03:21.790> B<00:03:21.970> 2100<00:03:22.750> is

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
immediately obvious thing with B 2100 is

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.250 
immediately obvious thing with B 2100 is
that<00:03:23.620> it's<00:03:23.770> a<00:03:23.890> gsm-only<00:03:24.580> device<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.900> it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
that it's a gsm-only device so it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.350 
that it's a gsm-only device so it
doesn't<00:03:26.709> have<00:03:26.800> 3g<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.370> we're<00:03:27.850> browsing<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.330> a

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
doesn't have 3g and we're browsing it a

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.860 
doesn't have 3g and we're browsing it a
little<00:03:28.480> bit<00:03:28.660> slow<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:31.390> first<00:03:31.540> thing<00:03:31.750> we're

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
little bit slow the first thing we're

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.970 
little bit slow the first thing we're
going<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.050> have<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.200> look<00:03:32.380> at<00:03:32.470> on<00:03:32.590> this<00:03:32.739> is

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
going to have a look at on this is

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.430
