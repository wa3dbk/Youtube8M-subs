00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.379
 Well here you have it working 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.510
 three-dimensional printer this that 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.610
 we have heard so much in the news 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.669
 in the television shows not good 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.689
 there are many versions there are many 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.029
 different technologies to do this 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.130
 type of 3-d impressions what are you 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.349
 seeing here right now is a printer 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.470
 printing on a non- plastic plastic 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.269
 abs look here has the coil 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.330
 so what it does is feed on 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.790
 a kind of filament thread of 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.830
 plastic the head that has own 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.960
 printer is going to melt and goes 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.690
 building like this by layers like 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.940
 sections of a figure us in the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.710
 shop you already know we have this kind of 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.680
 skulls that is the first thing we take 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.570
 with our impression to three mentions and 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.430
 that looks perfectly like 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.140
 printer is building your fixes 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.219
 here good on the internet there are amount of 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.199
 no videos but it looks great how it goes 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.220
 building layer by layer that is to say 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.870
 how to draw 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.220
 over here you see it in the sections that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.490
 They are getting what they are unfinished 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.580
 they are selected goes building and goes 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 drawing a section another section or 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.860
 transition and that's how you get 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.380
 build things in three dimensions with 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.140
 you are seeing that it is incredible unstoppable 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.690
 all this process are not printing 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 houses sometimes prostheses to put for 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.380
 make reintegration is not expensive 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960
 is talking if they are going to be able to print 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.240
 in human tissues of the organs good 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.490
 it's that infinity 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.160
 we are passionate for example for 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.240
 our field to make miniatures 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.770
 sculptures enlargements reductions the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.920
 truth is that the possibilities are 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.850
 infinite in rigid materials 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.770
 Flexible increasingly are appearing more 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.930
 properties plus product qualities 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.190
 different even here in Spain and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.440
 companies that are already impeding 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.170
 directly in metal what is 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.570
 amazing the subject so nothing over here 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.560
 I leave my staff working with 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.140
 our faces 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.989
 of mystery in the ship's shop 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.489
 mystery where are you going to see perfectly 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.470
 how they are made both inside and 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.030
 outwardly the truth that is a 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.069
 technology that the next few years I think 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.470
 that will give a lot of play a lot that 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.920
 speak and we are there for 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.920
 supposed
