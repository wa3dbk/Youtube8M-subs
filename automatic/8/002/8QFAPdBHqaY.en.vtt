00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that's what a lot of people are

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.109 
that's what a lot of people are
confusing<00:02:07.649> about<00:02:07.740> he's<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.250> he's<00:02:08.970> just

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
confusing about he's just he's just

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
confusing about he's just he's just
comparing<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:09.989> way<00:02:10.229> he'd<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:10.800> Adolf

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
comparing to the way he'd like Adolf

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.160 
comparing to the way he'd like Adolf
Hitler<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:12.050> like<00:02:13.050> towards

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
Hitler is like towards

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.960 
Hitler is like towards
of<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.950> other<00:02:15.130> world<00:02:15.400> leaders<00:02:15.490> out<00:02:15.940> there

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
of the other world leaders out there

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.240 
of the other world leaders out there
that<00:02:16.660> comparing<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.349> how<00:02:17.650> Mayweather<00:02:18.010> is

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
that comparing that to how Mayweather is

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.640 
that comparing that to how Mayweather is
like<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.670> day<00:02:18.819> towards<00:02:19.180> Pacquiao<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:19.810> think<00:02:20.319> he

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
like the day towards Pacquiao I think he

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.530 
like the day towards Pacquiao I think he
could<00:02:20.830> have<00:02:20.950> used<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.370> better<00:02:21.610> example<00:02:21.849> because

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
could have used a better example because

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.870 
could have used a better example because
using<00:02:22.840> Hitler<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.400> Floyd<00:02:24.700> this<00:02:25.030> yes<00:02:26.880> that

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
using Hitler to Floyd this yes that

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.880 
using Hitler to Floyd this yes that
gives<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.239> lot<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.450> people<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.380> gives<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.739> lot

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
gives a lot of people that gives a lot

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.320 
gives a lot of people that gives a lot
of<00:02:29.920> question<00:02:30.340> marks<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:31.000> lot<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.180> people

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
of question marks and a lot of people

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.050 
of question marks and a lot of people
probably<00:02:31.450> don't<00:02:31.810> understand<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.880> but<00:02:33.880> I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
probably don't understand that but I

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.670 
probably don't understand that but I
understood<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.630> though<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.840> understood<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.440> I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
understood it though I understood and I

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.440 
understood it though I understood and I
get<00:02:35.920> what<00:02:36.100> he<00:02:36.160> was<00:02:36.280> trying<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.550> say<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:36.819> it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
get what he was trying to say but it

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.760 
get what he was trying to say but it
could<00:02:37.630> have<00:02:37.720> been<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.900> better<00:02:38.080> example<00:02:38.319> he

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
could have been a better example he

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.440 
could have been a better example he
could<00:02:38.890> have<00:02:39.010> used<00:02:39.160> something<00:02:39.459> else<00:02:39.670> I'm<00:02:40.180> not

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
could have used something else I'm not

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.150 
could have used something else I'm not
sure<00:02:40.510> why<00:02:40.810> he<00:02:40.989> used<00:02:41.170> Adolf<00:02:41.560> Hitler<00:02:41.920> as<00:02:42.040> an

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
sure why he used Adolf Hitler as an

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.259 
sure why he used Adolf Hitler as an
example<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:43.830> compare<00:02:44.830> Hitler<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.730> Floyd<00:02:46.000> I

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
example to compare Hitler to Floyd I

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.030 
example to compare Hitler to Floyd I
mean<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.810> doesn't<00:02:47.140> make<00:02:47.230> sense<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.830> way<00:02:47.980> but

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
mean it doesn't make sense in a way but

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.509 
mean it doesn't make sense in a way but
I<00:02:48.550> get<00:02:48.880> what<00:02:49.030> he's<00:02:49.060> trying<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.450> say<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.519> yeah

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
I get what he's trying to say and yeah

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.559 
I get what he's trying to say and yeah
