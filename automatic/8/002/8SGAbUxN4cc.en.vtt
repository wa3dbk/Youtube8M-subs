00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
for a new PC you want to look for those

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.560 
for a new PC you want to look for those
systems<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.080> handle<00:01:16.380> 3d<00:01:17.189> video<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.420> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
systems that can handle 3d video and you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
systems that can handle 3d video and you
might<00:01:18.600> find<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.049> easier<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.619> look<00:01:19.830> without<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
might find it easier to look without the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.700 
might find it easier to look without the
shutter<00:01:21.330> glasses<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.439> right

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
shutter glasses that we have on right

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310 
shutter glasses that we have on right
now<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.909> supports<00:01:24.689> not<00:01:24.900> only<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
now but this supports not only the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.679 
now but this supports not only the
shutter<00:01:25.560> technology<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.759> also<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.360> earlier

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
shutter technology but also the earlier

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.990 
shutter technology but also the earlier
filter<00:01:28.020> technology<00:01:28.200> right<00:01:28.860> yeah<00:01:29.790> that's

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
filter technology right yeah that's

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630 
filter technology right yeah that's
right<00:01:30.150> 3d<00:01:30.570> blu-ray<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:32.070> spec<00:01:32.369> for

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
right 3d blu-ray is the spec for

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.620 
right 3d blu-ray is the spec for
creating<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> 3d<00:01:33.860> disc<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.450> encoding<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
creating the 3d disc and encoding the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.920 
creating the 3d disc and encoding the
video<00:01:36.990> signal<00:01:37.290> onto<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.189> disk<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.360> 3d<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
video signal onto the disk and so 3d is

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.620 
video signal onto the disk and so 3d is
simply<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.979> different<00:01:41.759> picture<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.329> your<00:01:42.420> left

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
simply a different picture for your left

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.230 
simply a different picture for your left
eye<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.140> your<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:43.740> eye<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.130> 3d<00:01:44.850> blu-ray<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
eye and your right eye and 3d blu-ray is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 
eye and your right eye and 3d blu-ray is
a<00:01:45.360> blu-ray<00:01:45.869> quality<00:01:46.079> video<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> left

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
a blu-ray quality video one for the left

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.429 
a blu-ray quality video one for the left
eye<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.570> right<00:01:48.750> eye<00:01:48.780> from<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
eye one for the right eye from a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.410 
eye one for the right eye from a
different<00:01:49.619> perspective<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.579> then<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.240> can

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
different perspective and then you can

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.670 
different perspective and then you can
choose<00:01:51.720> what<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.259> display<00:01:52.649> technology

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
choose what kind of display technology

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.510 
choose what kind of display technology
you<00:01:53.399> want<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:54.240> will<00:01:54.570> be<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.780> variety<00:01:55.020> of

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
you want so there will be a variety of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.209 
you want so there will be a variety of
displays<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.630> matching<00:01:58.110> glasses<00:01:58.439> system

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
displays and a matching glasses system

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.340 
displays and a matching glasses system
that<00:01:59.909> enable<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> left<00:02:00.810> eye<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that enable the left eye to see a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.410 
that enable the left eye to see a
different<00:02:01.799> picture<00:02:01.979> than<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> right<00:02:02.549> eye<00:02:02.579> so

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
different picture than the right eye so

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.660 
different picture than the right eye so
what<00:02:03.630> happens<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.770> far<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.219> bandwidth

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
what happens now as far as the bandwidth

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.580 
what happens now as far as the bandwidth
of<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.969> system<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.630> does<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.899> double<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
of the system it does this double the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.999 
of the system it does this double the
bandwidth<00:02:08.179> well<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.229> deliver<00:02:10.770> that

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
bandwidth well we have to deliver that

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.470 
bandwidth well we have to deliver that
full<00:02:11.250> quality<00:02:11.610> image

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
full quality image

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.360 
full quality image
to<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.170> left<00:02:13.409> of<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.620> right<00:02:13.769> eye<00:02:13.830> but<00:02:14.129> rather

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
to the left of the right eye but rather

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.160 
to the left of the right eye but rather
than<00:02:14.610> doubling<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.150> there's<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.870> lot<00:02:16.050> of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
than doubling it there's a lot of

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.780 
than doubling it there's a lot of
redundancy<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.799> what<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.370> left<00:02:17.580> eye<00:02:17.730> is

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
redundancy in what the left eye is

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.039 
redundancy in what the left eye is
seeing<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.269> right<00:02:18.420> eye<00:02:18.450> seeing<00:02:18.870> it's

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
seeing in the right eye seeing it's

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.039 
seeing in the right eye seeing it's
basically<00:02:19.440> seeing<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.920> same<00:02:20.159> scene<00:02:20.580> but<00:02:21.450> from

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
basically seeing the same scene but from

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.869 
basically seeing the same scene but from
a<00:02:22.110> slightly<00:02:22.349> different<00:02:22.500> angle<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.519> we<00:02:23.700> take

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
a slightly different angle so we take

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.280 
a slightly different angle so we take
advantage<00:02:23.909> of<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.480> redundancy<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.170> it

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
advantage of that redundancy and it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.869 
advantage of that redundancy and it
doesn't<00:02:25.560> fully<00:02:25.799> double<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.280> bandwidth<00:02:26.640> but

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
doesn't fully double the bandwidth but

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.300 
doesn't fully double the bandwidth but
the<00:02:26.970> bandwidth<00:02:27.269> can<00:02:27.450> go<00:02:27.569> from<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:28.170> peak<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.950> 40

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
the bandwidth can go from a peak of 40

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.830 
the bandwidth can go from a peak of 40
megabits<00:02:29.640> per<00:02:29.760> second<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.239> standard<00:02:30.660> blu-ray

3d<00:02:33.989> blu-ray<00:02:34.200> ok<00:02:34.799> so<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.879> should<00:02:36.150> be

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
3d blu-ray ok so this should be

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.020 
3d blu-ray ok so this should be
available<00:02:36.660> both<00:02:37.319> in<00:02:37.560> laptops<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.819> and
