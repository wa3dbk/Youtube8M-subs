00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
commercials we get in the first and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.999 
commercials we get in the first and
third<00:01:18.119> quarters<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> game<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.200> UK<00:01:19.470> 13<00:01:19.860> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
third quarters of the game at UK 13 I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.140

think there's just going to be more of
them<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:22.439> that's<00:01:22.590> my<00:01:22.770> whole<00:01:22.920> prediction<00:01:23.369> just

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
them and that's my whole prediction just

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.039 
them and that's my whole prediction just
that<00:01:24.090> there's<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> same

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that there's not going to be the same

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
that there's not going to be the same

prediction damn it they're going to also

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.130 
prediction damn it they're going to also
have<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.549> bc<00:01:54.119> which<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.390> very<00:01:54.540> easy<00:01:54.960> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
have a bc which is very easy to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.130 
have a bc which is very easy to
replicate<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:56.009> ABC<00:01:56.729> instead<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.119> ESPN<00:01:57.600> not

replicate just ABC instead of ESPN not

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.120 
replicate just ABC instead of ESPN not
too<00:01:58.320> hard<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.710> also<00:01:59.280> NBA<00:02:00.210> TV<00:02:00.930> packages<00:02:01.530> maybe

NBA<00:02:17.130> 2k14<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:18.060> think<00:02:18.390> they're<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.660> going<00:02:18.750> to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
NBA 2k14 I think they're just going to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.780 
NBA 2k14 I think they're just going to
HD<00:02:19.380> up<00:02:19.620> 2k13<00:02:21.080> nothing<00:02:22.080> too<00:02:22.260> drastic<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:23.640> know

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
HD up 2k13 nothing too drastic you know

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.960 
HD up 2k13 nothing too drastic you know
some<00:02:24.660> higher<00:02:24.920> resolution<00:02:25.920> models<00:02:26.730> higher

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
some higher resolution models higher

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.660 
some higher resolution models higher
resolution<00:02:27.720> textures<00:02:28.430> don't<00:02:29.430> get<00:02:29.550> too

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
resolution textures don't get too

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.250 
resolution textures don't get too
excited<00:02:30.470> it's<00:02:31.470> an<00:02:32.340> expected<00:02:32.970> generation<00:02:33.540> jump

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
excited it's an expected generation jump

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.310 
excited it's an expected generation jump
if<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.560> will<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.700> then<00:02:35.820> for<00:02:36.030> live<00:02:36.180> 14<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.870> think

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
if you will and then for live 14 I think

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.970 
if you will and then for live 14 I think
I<00:02:37.670> think<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.820> NBA<00:02:39.150> live<00:02:39.360> 14<00:02:39.620> they're<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
I think the NBA live 14 they're going to

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.290 
I think the NBA live 14 they're going to
hit<00:02:41.130> us<00:02:41.190> with<00:02:41.400> something<00:02:41.670> completely

hit us with something completely

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300 
hit us with something completely
jaw-dropping<00:02:43.080> something<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.040> we're<00:02:44.220> going

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
jaw-dropping something that we're going

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.370 
jaw-dropping something that we're going
to<00:02:44.370> look<00:02:44.550> at<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.910> go<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.420> bull<00:02:45.750> shot<00:02:46.050> and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
to look at and go that is bull shot and

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.160 
to look at and go that is bull shot and
end<00:02:47.040> up<00:02:47.220> having<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> real<00:02:48.120> game<00:02:48.390> just

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
end up having that be the real game just

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.740 
end up having that be the real game just
I<00:02:49.610> for<00:02:50.610> some<00:02:50.790> reason<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.150> think<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.600> they

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
I for some reason I just think that they

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.510 
I for some reason I just think that they
just<00:02:51.930> have<00:02:52.050> this<00:02:52.200> graphic<00:02:52.590> engine<00:02:52.710> ready<00:02:53.370> to

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
just have this graphic engine ready to

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.220 
just have this graphic engine ready to
go<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.850> coming<00:02:54.030> generation<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.990> it's<00:02:55.110> just

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
go this coming generation and it's just

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.830 
go this coming generation and it's just
going<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.410> wow<00:02:55.650> us<00:02:55.680> with<00:02:56.130> basketball<00:02:56.640> now<00:02:57.570> for

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
going to wow us with basketball now for

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.020 
going to wow us with basketball now for
minor<00:02:58.020> stuff<00:02:58.260> with<00:02:58.440> graphics<00:02:58.860> for<00:02:59.100> 2k14<00:02:59.640> I

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
minor stuff with graphics for 2k14 I

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.490 
minor stuff with graphics for 2k14 I
think<00:03:00.600> we're<00:03:00.720> finally<00:03:00.930> going<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.140> get<00:03:01.260> new

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
think we're finally going to get new

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.260 
think we're finally going to get new
cloth<00:03:01.770> uniforms<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.490> actually<00:03:02.820> rests<00:03:03.150> on

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
cloth uniforms that actually rests on

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.780 
cloth uniforms that actually rests on
the<00:03:03.450> shoulders<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:04.230> doesn't<00:03:04.890> move<00:03:05.040> around<00:03:05.100> as

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the shoulders and doesn't move around as

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.320 
the shoulders and doesn't move around as
much<00:03:06.000> on<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.780> upper<00:03:07.110> body<00:03:07.820> fit<00:03:08.820> realistically

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
much on the upper body fit realistically

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.480 
much on the upper body fit realistically
with<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.630> shorts<00:03:09.960> finally<00:03:10.920> get<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:11.100> I

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
with the shorts finally get that I

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.250 
with the shorts finally get that I
almost<00:03:11.910> think<00:03:12.060> we're<00:03:12.240> finally<00:03:12.570> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.020> get

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
almost think we're finally going to get

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.560 
almost think we're finally going to get
wingspan<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.220> while<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.480> that

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
wingspan and while that I do have that

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.270 
wingspan and while that I do have that
under<00:03:15.810> graphics<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.440> don't<00:03:16.680> think<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.040> it's

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
under graphics I don't think that it's

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.890 
under graphics I don't think that it's
going<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.489> change<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.970> much<00:03:18.120> gameplay<00:03:18.450> wise

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
going to change that much gameplay wise

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.880 
going to change that much gameplay wise
that<00:03:19.110> they<00:03:19.200> they're<00:03:19.320> going<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.500> limit<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
that they they're going to limit that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.520 
that they they're going to limit that
but<00:03:20.820> um<00:03:21.000> graphically<00:03:21.959> wise<00:03:22.110> i<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.410> we<00:03:22.500> are

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
but um graphically wise i think we are

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.630 
but um graphically wise i think we are
going<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.800> finally<00:03:23.070> get<00:03:23.160> different<00:03:23.400> wing

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
going to finally get different wing

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.180 
going to finally get different wing

live<00:03:26.400> 14<00:03:26.430> i<00:03:27.260> think<00:03:28.260> we're<00:03:28.350> going<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.530> get<00:03:28.650> a

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
live 14 i think we're going to get a

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.090 
live 14 i think we're going to get a
return<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> live<00:03:29.610> 13<00:03:30.180> claims<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:31.050> face<00:03:31.830> and

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
return of the live 13 claims of face and

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.460 
return of the live 13 claims of face and
body<00:03:32.340> scans<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.060> on<00:03:33.660> top<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.020> that<00:03:34.230> i<00:03:34.350> think

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
body scans and on top of that i think

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.199 
body scans and on top of that i think
we're<00:03:34.739> going<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.950> get<00:03:35.040> game<00:03:35.340> face<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.910> where<00:03:36.120> we

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
we're going to get game face to where we

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.420 
we're going to get game face to where we
can<00:03:36.330> scan<00:03:36.570> our<00:03:36.720> own<00:03:36.810> face<00:03:37.080> in<00:03:37.290> with<00:03:37.860> kinect<00:03:38.340> 2.0

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
can scan our own face in with kinect 2.0

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.910 
can scan our own face in with kinect 2.0
and<00:03:39.330> whatever<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.989> hell<00:03:40.110> that<00:03:40.260> thing<00:03:40.440> was<00:03:40.770> on

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
and whatever the hell that thing was on

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.449 
and whatever the hell that thing was on
the<00:03:40.980> ps4<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:42.300> on<00:03:43.200> top<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.650> i<00:03:43.950> think<00:03:44.040> that

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the ps4 and on top of that i think that

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.640 
the ps4 and on top of that i think that
live<00:03:44.970> 14<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.600> also<00:03:45.840> going<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.020> have<00:03:46.200> arena

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
live 14 is also going to have arena

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.010 
live 14 is also going to have arena
specific<00:03:47.400> lighting<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:48.390> will<00:03:48.600> notice<00:03:48.840> that

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
specific lighting you will notice that

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.990 
specific lighting you will notice that
there's<00:03:49.170> lighting<00:03:49.580> differences<00:03:50.580> not<00:03:50.790> just

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
there's lighting differences not just

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.820 
there's lighting differences not just
with<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.239> crowds<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:52.200> on<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.560> players

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
with the crowds but on the players

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.699 
with the crowds but on the players
themselves<00:03:53.480> in<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.660> different<00:03:54.989> NBA<00:03:55.260> arenas

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
themselves in the different NBA arenas

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.170 
themselves in the different NBA arenas
and<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.250> think<00:03:56.430> that's<00:03:56.580> sudden<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.880> M<00:03:57.060> be

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and I think that's sudden that M be

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.870 
and I think that's sudden that M be
alive<00:03:57.420> is<00:03:57.570> going<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.900> try<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.170> incorporate
