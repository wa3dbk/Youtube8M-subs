00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.930
 Panasonic's new digital camera lumixfx60 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:11.769
 The next lumix is ​​also daily 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.459
 Bright red color variations 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.459
 Which color do you like? 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.179
 I tried to show the progress of this flix immediately 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.630
 It is night photography that is easy to play 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.900
 First of all, please take a look at the photos taken with my digital camera 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.060
 What am i 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.060
 I checked the night scene and tried to shoot a person 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.610
 If you don't use flash, the school board is awful 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.470
 Then I tried to use life 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.440
 Heart and physical 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.180
 The background is much 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.559
 And the same place at the same time 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.700
 I created it with Avex 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.320
 It is this picture 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.340
 I also say it 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.720
 You can batch 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.720
 I want to take a picture like this next 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.310
 In addition, we are relieved as a result wine camera 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.000
 Force first 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 I'm smooth too 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.280
 fx67 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.120
 It is early 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
 Approximately 1.2 inches 85 such as the speed 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.690
 I just do not wait for the shutter chance 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.540
 It does not extend to fast moving subjects 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.600
 It is just switching cheaply and changing 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.770
 lumixfx60 is over recommended 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.330
 Effective pixel number 12.1 million pixels 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.370
 Optical 4x zoom 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.090
 Latest patch 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.430
 Shinki synthesis 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.430
 Kim also pointed out the start time 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.390
 Here too 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.400
 I was relieved to be caught in the camera of this work and the inside of the car was received 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.590
 I can do it 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 Something different from winning 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.920
 With their power 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.630
 In other words
