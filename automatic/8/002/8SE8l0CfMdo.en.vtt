that I'm gonna talk about on the why but

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.230 
that I'm gonna talk about on the why but
this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.600> kind<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.960> seed<00:01:13.170> saving<00:01:13.470> video<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
this is kind of a seed saving video and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.580 
this is kind of a seed saving video and
this<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.299> something<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> works<00:01:15.960> really<00:01:16.350> well

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
this is something that works really well

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.620 
this is something that works really well
for<00:01:16.650> me<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.100> I've<00:01:17.490> done<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.850> past<00:01:18.090> for

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
for me that I've done in the past for

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.910 
for me that I've done in the past for
many<00:01:19.229> different<00:01:19.560> things<00:01:19.909> lambs<00:01:20.909> quarters

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
many different things lambs quarters

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.230 
many different things lambs quarters
amaranth<00:01:22.920> quinoa<00:01:23.990> basil<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.820> for

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
amaranth quinoa basil I do this for

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240 
amaranth quinoa basil I do this for
pretty<00:01:27.420> much<00:01:27.509> most<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.770> them<00:01:28.860> except<00:01:29.100> for

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
pretty much most of them except for

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.649 
pretty much most of them except for
things<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.729> big<00:01:30.030> seeds<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> have

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
things that have big seeds if you have

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.300 
things that have big seeds if you have
if<00:01:31.229> you're<00:01:31.380> saving<00:01:31.590> seeds<00:01:31.890> from<00:01:32.040> something

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
if you're saving seeds from something

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.760 
if you're saving seeds from something
that<00:01:32.400> has<00:01:32.549> lots<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> flour<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.470> little<00:01:34.500> bit

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that has lots of flour and a little bit

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.590 
that has lots of flour and a little bit
of<00:01:34.860> seed<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.549> probably<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> easiest<00:01:36.119> way

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
of seed this is probably the easiest way

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.060 
of seed this is probably the easiest way
to<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.049> John<00:01:37.409> Kohler<00:01:37.710> did<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
to do and I think John Kohler did a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.510 
to do and I think John Kohler did a
video<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.229> maybe<00:01:40.530> about<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> year<00:01:40.799> ago<00:01:41.340> or

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
video on it maybe about a year ago or

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.830 
video on it maybe about a year ago or
something<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.909> kind<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.509> kind<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
something like that kind of like kind of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.910 
something like that kind of like kind of
like<00:01:42.899> what<00:01:43.110> I'm<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.470> ready<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.680> show<00:01:43.860> you

went there in January the only thing
green<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.439> we<00:01:55.530> actually<00:01:55.710> saw<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.189> middle

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
green that we actually saw in the middle

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.280 
green that we actually saw in the middle
of<00:01:56.430> January<00:01:56.820> was<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.390> sorrel<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.960> planted

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
of January was the sorrel that I planted

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.499 
of January was the sorrel that I planted
the<00:01:58.380> lemon<00:01:58.649> saw<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.700> they<00:01:59.969> went<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> seed

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the lemon saw and they went to seed

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.219 
the lemon saw and they went to seed
right<00:02:00.719> now<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:02.240> here's<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.899> lemon

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
right now and here's the the lemon

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.069 
right now and here's the the lemon
sorrel<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:06.360> started<00:02:06.719> growing<00:02:06.960> back

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
sorrel and it started growing back

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.800 
sorrel and it started growing back
really<00:02:07.500> good<00:02:07.710> since<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.280> cut<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.789> cut<00:02:09.660> these

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
really good since I cut the cut these

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.410 
really good since I cut the cut these
guys<00:02:10.080> off<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.379> there<00:02:10.819> if<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.910> look<00:02:12.060> these<00:02:12.239> are

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
guys off of there if you look these are

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.199 
guys off of there if you look these are
the

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
the

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.599 
the
the<00:02:13.750> seed<00:02:14.049> stocks<00:02:14.680> right<00:02:15.010> here<00:02:15.219> the<00:02:15.340> flower

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:15.609 
the seed stocks right here the flower

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.880 
the seed stocks right here the flower
stalks<00:02:15.969> and<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.079> about<00:02:17.290> how<00:02:17.500> big<00:02:17.739> they

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
stalks and this is about how big they

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.470 
stalks and this is about how big they
were<00:02:17.920> coming<00:02:18.579> up<00:02:18.670> out<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:18.969> here<00:02:19.120> they<00:02:19.420> were

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
were coming up out of here they were

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.929 
were coming up out of here they were
already<00:02:19.840> taller<00:02:20.769> than<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.099> patio<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.730> stuff

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
already taller than the patio and stuff

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.660 
already taller than the patio and stuff
but<00:02:22.180> they<00:02:22.629> dried<00:02:22.870> out<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.349> I<00:02:24.189> had<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.370> bunch<00:02:24.549> of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
but they dried out and I had a bunch of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.229 
but they dried out and I had a bunch of
flowers<00:02:25.060> on<00:02:25.239> here<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:25.900> all<00:02:26.769> I<00:02:26.799> did<00:02:26.950> was<00:02:27.239> take

flowers on here and all I did was take

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.750 
flowers on here and all I did was take
the<00:02:28.420> flowers<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.140> just<00:02:29.859> kind<00:02:30.099> of<00:02:30.159> brush<00:02:30.579> them

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
the flowers and just kind of brush them

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.410 
the flowers and just kind of brush them
off<00:02:30.939> into<00:02:31.389> the<00:02:32.139> bowl<00:02:32.319> right<00:02:32.560> here<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.879> once<00:02:34.299> I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
off into the bowl right here and once I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.149 
off into the bowl right here and once I
put<00:02:34.540> them<00:02:34.689> in<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.840> bowl<00:02:35.019> I<00:02:35.319> leave<00:02:35.859> him<00:02:36.040> in

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
put them in the bowl I leave him in

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.679 
put them in the bowl I leave him in
there<00:02:36.250> for<00:02:36.519> at<00:02:36.579> least<00:02:36.609> a<00:02:36.909> couple<00:02:37.120> days<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.569> kind

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
there for at least a couple days to kind

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.020 
there for at least a couple days to kind
of<00:02:37.810> dry<00:02:37.989> out<00:02:38.019> some<00:02:38.469> more<00:02:38.650> yeah<00:02:39.489> I<00:02:39.579> just<00:02:39.790> kind<00:02:39.969> of

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
of dry out some more yeah I just kind of

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.399 
of dry out some more yeah I just kind of
crush<00:02:40.299> everything<00:02:40.569> up<00:02:40.840> really<00:02:41.109> good<00:02:41.230> once

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
crush everything up really good once

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.690 
crush everything up really good once
it's<00:02:41.500> really<00:02:41.739> dry<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:41.950> just<00:02:42.250> kind<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.489> crush

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
it's really dry you just kind of crush

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.960 
it's really dry you just kind of crush
everything<00:02:43.000> up<00:02:43.239> really<00:02:43.389> good<00:02:43.659> and<00:02:44.200> then<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
everything up really good and then the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.849 
everything up really good and then the
biggest<00:02:46.269> part<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.720> separating<00:02:47.409> the<00:02:47.439> seed

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
biggest part is separating the seed

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.039 
biggest part is separating the seed
which<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:49.030> black<00:02:49.239> thing<00:02:49.269> from<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.840> chaff

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
which is this black thing from the chaff

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.349 
which is this black thing from the chaff
and<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:50.859> is<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.099> chaff<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.790> flour<00:02:52.030> the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
and this is the chaff the the flour the

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.550 
and this is the chaff the the flour the
the<00:02:53.049> spent<00:02:53.379> flour<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:55.200> I'm<00:02:56.200> going<00:02:56.379> to<00:02:56.409> show

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
the spent flour and I'm going to show

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.899 
the spent flour and I'm going to show
you<00:02:56.650> guys<00:02:56.769> right<00:02:56.980> now<00:02:57.040> how<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.400> do<00:02:57.549> it<00:02:57.790> it's

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
you guys right now how I do it it's

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.520 
you guys right now how I do it it's
probably<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.329> easiest<00:02:58.780> way<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.019> do<00:02:59.230> it

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
probably the easiest way to do it

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.099 
probably the easiest way to do it
I<00:02:59.730> mean<00:03:00.730> there's<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.150> few<00:03:01.239> other<00:03:01.599> ways<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.959> doing

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
I mean there's a few other ways to doing

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.990 
I mean there's a few other ways to doing
it<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.409> think<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:02.889> probably<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.340> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
it but I think this is probably the the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.009 
it but I think this is probably the the
fastest<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:05.379> works<00:03:05.709> well<00:03:05.889> for<00:03:05.950> me<00:03:06.250> so

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
fastest and it works well for me so

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.759 
fastest and it works well for me so
that's<00:03:08.019> what<00:03:08.169> I'm<00:03:08.260> going<00:03:08.379> to<00:03:08.409> show<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.650> guys

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
that's what I'm going to show you guys

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.009 
that's what I'm going to show you guys
but<00:03:09.069> I'm<00:03:09.819> gonna<00:03:09.939> update<00:03:10.329> you<00:03:10.480> guys<00:03:10.510> on<00:03:10.659> a<00:03:10.840> few

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
but I'm gonna update you guys on a few

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.860 
but I'm gonna update you guys on a few
other<00:03:11.169> things<00:03:11.819> this<00:03:12.819> container<00:03:13.239> here<00:03:13.659> and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
other things this container here and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.159 
other things this container here and
this<00:03:14.829> container<00:03:15.250> here<00:03:15.790> we're<00:03:16.689> just<00:03:16.719> empty

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
this container here we're just empty

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.710 
this container here we're just empty
things<00:03:17.409> of<00:03:17.560> dirt<00:03:17.879> that<00:03:18.879> made<00:03:19.329> it<00:03:19.449> all<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.690> way

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
things of dirt that made it all the way

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.780 
things of dirt that made it all the way
through<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.109> winter<00:03:20.319> time<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.769> this<00:03:21.639> is

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
through the winter time and this is

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.729 
through the winter time and this is
lamb's<00:03:22.060> quarters<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.629> I<00:03:22.750> planted<00:03:23.199> last<00:03:23.409> fall

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
lamb's quarters that I planted last fall

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.530 
lamb's quarters that I planted last fall
in<00:03:24.040> here<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.430> they've<00:03:24.729> just<00:03:24.760> started<00:03:25.329> growing

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
in here and they've just started growing

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.500 
in here and they've just started growing
and<00:03:26.079> I<00:03:27.069> really<00:03:27.280> don't<00:03:27.430> know<00:03:27.519> what<00:03:27.699> this<00:03:28.000> is

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
and I really don't know what this is

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.809 
and I really don't know what this is
I'm<00:03:29.139> thinking<00:03:29.470> maybe<00:03:29.590> Mexican<00:03:30.220> petunia<00:03:30.699> or

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
I'm thinking maybe Mexican petunia or

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.949 
I'm thinking maybe Mexican petunia or
something<00:03:31.090> like<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.269> but<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.599> never<00:03:31.780> grew

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
something like that but I never grew

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.319 
something like that but I never grew
Mexican<00:03:32.379> petunia<00:03:32.799> but<00:03:32.979> that's<00:03:33.939> probably<00:03:34.060> some

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
Mexican petunia but that's probably some

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.140 
Mexican petunia but that's probably some
type<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.569> weed<00:03:34.810> but<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:35.049> just<00:03:35.169> kept<00:03:35.349> let<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.620> go<00:03:35.769> I

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
type of weed but I just kept let it go I
