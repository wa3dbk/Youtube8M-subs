00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.100
 co of Bibbiano to see this other 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.649
 invention and also this is a motorcycle with 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.590
 and the online connected with 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.050
 good day one day 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.269
 we start by making you hear the noise 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.800
 in the background of this bike and we ask 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.870
 but to mauro that one of those that is the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.250
 tattoo in dna biker doc 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.690
 his bike is high but this is it 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.400
 a meter and twenty high we ask instead 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:33.720
 a gentleman who is up there who calls himself 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:35.400
 fabio reggiani good morning to all 5 mm 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.270
 rightly 15 much higher in the world 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.120
 the best and does very well as it is made 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.010
 bike is working and indeed has one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.910
 hydraulic steering that allows the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.390
 steering and 5700 engine and free in the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.190
 motor car time indeed 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.440
 an engine that with 100 euros to 10 meters from 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.320
 280 horses then to the horses 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.760
 necessary to move this monster 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.790
 which I repeat is completely complete 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.979
 functioning and it is a built car standard 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.860
 in the record time of 6 months with the help 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.860
 of eight people I thank and all 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.010
 details are handcrafted 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.810
 then apart from the toes but tc fronts 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.090
 rear tires that are from 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.670
 bulldozer and everything else was built 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.080
 handmade decoration and it's all 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.770
 there is also the robur made by hand 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.660
 some particular tension element a 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.390
 risk that does not hurt but is only 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.930
 having a lot of ignition is proportionate 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.210
 to the bike is in fact the reflects e 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.710
 all the details have been 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.860
 then executed with various techniques 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.909
 fiberglass and laser cutting as far as 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.100
 regards the circle several pieces and the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.869
 mufflers are artisans yes but fabio 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.960
 the graphics thanks thanks but is that 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.520
 that is, walking is not just a monument 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.680
 statue is a motorcycle 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.310
 in short, you can drive there you can go 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.420
 around exactly not at the bar like 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.620
 Signor dorelli, however, cannot be maneuvered 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.510
 given the size they are a little bit 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.470
 difficult though it has hydraulic steering 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.510
 like how I was explaining that it can equal 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.459
 identical to a normal motorcycle with some 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.019
 difference indeed on the guide indeed 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.000
 the riding position and on the saddle 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.690
 sized where there is a true g 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.810
 regarding the gearbox and the brake 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.880
 the braking and ignition we say are 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.610
 all sent from that location is 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.610
 also the very high handlebar then 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.380
 one cannot touch much here either 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.959
 tight you will never succeed unless 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.330
 not being a giant will have another 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.590
 handlebar somewhere to guide them 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.209
 matrix launches of how it is in its player 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.579
 on the dashboard there is a joystick 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.640
 which allows steering to the right and 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.590
 left is clearly with a genius 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.230
 said a lot in May 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.150
 fabio if I didn't understand her wrong with 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.769
 this realizing this bike 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.290
 building this fashion has entered into the 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.579
 Guinness World Record 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.280
 exact the biggest bike indeed 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.320
 of the world and for the dimensions and also 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.750
 for features in the sense that it is not 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.910
 a statue as we said before and we have 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.459
 abundantly exceeded the bike that 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.560
 he held the record that was a motorcycle 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.470
 American of six meters by three then 10 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.709
 for five we are just great e 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.750
 disarm and therefore this bike built 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.250
 in the Americas in 2007 and this one 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.320
 destruction that in short even in Italy 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.170
 we can create something without need 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.030
 to go overseas inventing who knows 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.450
 what things in short there are also here and 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.790
 with so much passion it is said to offer no no 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.799
 but it's a beautiful engineering job 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.689
 of diecast giancarlo carpentry 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.909
 creator is not a case that serves here 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.069
 walking can take a few meters because 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.799
 certainly the streets are not wanted 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.420
 go around Italy on tour in 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.459
 western and rooms in rai tents 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.090
 guided by claudio a seghetti you can 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.739
 show the medium you need to 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.540
 transport it and of course it's a truck 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.699
 special that serves just is a change 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.729
 special in the exceptional bike then 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.989
 also the transport precisely there today 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.610
 we support a company that is almost unused to 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.960
 bibbiano that helps us precisely in the ray 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.930
 of logistics which is clearly very much 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.780
 difficult light 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.060
 the committee that is like a child to me 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:38.840
 also in some physical aspects he would like 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:41.150
 see the walk you can see 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.500
 But you are walking it is also the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.599
 we can we can we turn 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.900
 speak on the ladder quickly 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:53.210
 we make them do those few meters that 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.930
 they also allowed this bike to 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:01.760
 win the Guinness of the primates and gilded 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.130
 that this time that to the engine that was 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.340
 the real world is the braking one 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.340
 with 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:15.000
 already spent 20 euros to make tests 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:20.490
 yet it moves and love but the shot 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.060
 wide here you see on the dashboard 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:28.540
 ample command of the time requests 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.830
 really the tower is safe here it is 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.830
 done 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.220
 good compliments thanks 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.080
 thanks dark thanks then called 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.080
 because he has hosted us thanks 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.550
 after we meet in the final of 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.200
 connection but here there are the feet on the 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.420
 his creation 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.150
 now unfortunately we go bulls though 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.520
 here to do was want to give up donelli 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.790
 he also left us a bit on Saturday 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.130
 you know what i do now like i do 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.110
 put them next to each other who has it 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.620
 made a giant motorcycle the guinness of the 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.550
 primates, but did the teams have 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.040
 decided they are connected let's say that 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:25.040
 we must review the giant bike of 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.550
 fabio reggiani this guinness bike 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:32.170
 10 meters of vacuum the biggest motorcycle of the 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.670
 working world that also walking 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.140
 all handcrafted very much 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.440
 well 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.670
 if someone wants to contact fabio 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.370
 reggiani 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.470
 to learn more about your bike or 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:50.889
 he wants to contact roberto Treni fare 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:55.330
 offer a coffee I agree he writes 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:58.020
 start a 66 101 95 Rome in fact 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:01.569
 moved and make contact with ours 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.580
 inventors or even an e - mail the facts 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:06.189
 your snail rai.it 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.629
 okay so many compliments to fabio 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:09.629
 thanks points he was traveling 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:16.020
 thanks for this 88 is gone we have 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:19.240
 said and being sick is fine it came 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:22.210
 thank you so much we have to do that in the meantime 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.740
 giant bike and we return here instead 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.810
 because we have something he could 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.810
 be an idea here is the cassette
