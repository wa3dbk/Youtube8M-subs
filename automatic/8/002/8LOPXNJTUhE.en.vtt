 ten chicken sausages 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.390
 so I start the recipe by the dough 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:49.309
 to donuts then I put my flour - 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.309

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.560
 about ten minutes 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.170

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:42.790
