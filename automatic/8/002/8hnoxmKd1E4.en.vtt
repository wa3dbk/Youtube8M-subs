super<00:01:43.979> oily<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> break<00:01:45.000> down<00:01:45.180> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
super oily it's going to break down that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.260 
super oily it's going to break down that
oil<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.380> soon<00:01:46.530> as<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.770> add<00:01:46.920> water<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.579> just
