00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
definitely Remote Desktop is the best

definitely Remote Desktop is the best
app<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.570> let<00:00:48.840> me<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> quick

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
app for that so let me do a quick

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.510

LTE<00:00:56.840> okay<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.350> starters<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.250> reason<00:00:59.640> why

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
LTE okay so for starters the reason why

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.910 
LTE okay so for starters the reason why
it's<00:01:00.000> better<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.140> could<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.620> it

about<00:01:14.030> 450<00:01:15.030> even<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.080> you're<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.500> doing

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
about 450 even if you're not doing

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.700 
about 450 even if you're not doing
anything<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
anything with all the you know all the

anything with all the you know all the
background<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.970> animations<00:01:21.720> disabled<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.470> is

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
background and animations disabled it is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.070 
background and animations disabled it is
still<00:01:22.920> using<00:01:23.340> about<00:01:23.580> 8<00:01:23.880> times<00:01:24.150> more<00:01:24.509> data<00:01:24.750> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
still using about 8 times more data and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.170 
still using about 8 times more data and
you<00:01:25.200> will<00:01:25.350> find<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.700> case<00:01:26.729> in

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
you will find that to be the case in

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.560 
you will find that to be the case in
most<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.630> these<00:01:27.750> apps<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.670> definitely<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:30.360> think

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
most of these apps so definitely I think

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
most of these apps so definitely I think
that<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.049> probably<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> biggest<00:01:32.100> selling

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that is probably the biggest selling

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.440 
that is probably the biggest selling
point<00:01:33.060> now<00:01:33.600> before<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> cover<00:01:34.590> all<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
point now before I cover all the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.760 
point now before I cover all the
positives<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.780> app<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.110> want<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:37.590> over

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
positives of this app I want to go over

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.700 
positives of this app I want to go over
the<00:01:37.890> drawbacks<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.259> order<00:01:40.560> for

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the drawbacks one is that in order for

desktop<00:02:17.130> option<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.209> won't<00:02:18.420> have<00:02:18.600> this

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
desktop option and you won't have this

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.230 
desktop option and you won't have this
option<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.440> home<00:02:19.620> edition<00:02:20.130> okay<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.090> uh

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
option on the home edition okay and uh

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.150 
option on the home edition okay and uh
and<00:02:21.569> another<00:02:22.500> point<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.310> app<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:24.750> is

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
and another point of this app is it is

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.970 
and another point of this app is it is
fifteen<00:02:26.160> dollars<00:02:26.550> right<00:02:27.300> now<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.980> extra

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
fifteen dollars right now the extra

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.010 
fifteen dollars right now the extra
logic<00:02:29.160> remote<00:02:29.640> desktop<00:02:30.090> app<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.780> think

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
logic remote desktop app and I think

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.020 
logic remote desktop app and I think
it's<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.200> good<00:02:31.319> deal<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:32.069> probably<00:02:32.580> will<00:02:32.819> make

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
it's a good deal you probably will make

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.420 
it's a good deal you probably will make
that<00:02:33.239> up<00:02:33.480> probably<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.620> first<00:02:35.100> month<00:02:35.370> that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
that up probably the first month that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.970 
that up probably the first month that
you<00:02:35.730> use<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.120> just<00:02:36.360> for<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.110> data<00:02:37.380> savings

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you use it just for the data savings

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.040 
you use it just for the data savings
right<00:02:38.790> or<00:02:39.060> you'll<00:02:39.239> make<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.510> up<00:02:39.600> in<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.840> couple

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
right or you'll make it up in a couple

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.350 
right or you'll make it up in a couple
of<00:02:40.230> months<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.590> bought<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.280> twenty<00:02:42.239> five

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
of months I bought it for twenty five

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.080 
of months I bought it for twenty five
dollars<00:02:42.530> two<00:02:43.530> years<00:02:43.830> ago<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.730> thought<00:02:44.940> it

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
dollars two years ago and I thought it

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.250 
dollars two years ago and I thought it
was<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.239> great<00:02:45.540> purchase

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
was a great purchase

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110 
was a great purchase
unlike<00:02:46.590> splash<00:02:47.010> desktop<00:02:47.580> which<00:02:47.820> only

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
unlike splash desktop which only

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.790 
unlike splash desktop which only
requires<00:02:48.690> your<00:02:49.519> username<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.850> password<00:02:51.800> this

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
requires your username and password this

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.009 
requires your username and password this
app<00:02:53.100> will<00:02:53.370> take<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.670> little<00:02:54.030> bit<00:02:54.269> more<00:02:54.570> for<00:02:54.930> you

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
app will take a little bit more for you

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.220 
app will take a little bit more for you
to<00:02:55.170> get<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.440> working<00:02:55.680> for<00:02:56.100> example<00:02:57.019> if<00:02:58.019> you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
to get it working for example if you

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.090 
to get it working for example if you
want<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.530> access<00:02:59.459> your<00:03:00.350> work<00:03:01.350> computer<00:03:01.650> you

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
want to access your work computer you

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.550 
want to access your work computer you
probably<00:03:02.280> need<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.880> connect<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> VPN<00:03:03.840> first

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
probably need to connect to a VPN first

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.430 
probably need to connect to a VPN first
or<00:03:04.920> need<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.760> ask<00:03:05.940> your<00:03:06.209> IT<00:03:06.390> admin<00:03:07.019> if<00:03:07.230> you're

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
or need to ask your IT admin if you're

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.030 
or need to ask your IT admin if you're
not<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.769> IT<00:03:07.950> admin<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:09.480> add<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.380> Remote

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
not the IT admin to add it to the Remote

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.670 
not the IT admin to add it to the Remote
Desktop<00:03:11.069> gateway<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:12.420> then<00:03:13.110> after<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.500> make

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
Desktop gateway and then after you make

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.340 
Desktop gateway and then after you make
that<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.920> VPN<00:03:14.760> connection<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.300> could<00:03:15.510> connect

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
that a VPN connection you could connect

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.979 
that a VPN connection you could connect
to<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.590> computer<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:18.239> it's<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.600> little<00:03:18.870> bit

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
to the computer so it's a little bit

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.110 
to the computer so it's a little bit
more<00:03:19.140> complicated<00:03:19.829> but<00:03:19.950> after<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.430> get<00:03:20.970> it

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
more complicated but after you get it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.520 
more complicated but after you get it
down<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.450> first<00:03:21.690> time<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.049> shouldn't<00:03:22.410> be<00:03:22.500> a

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
down the first time it shouldn't be a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.270 
down the first time it shouldn't be a
problem<00:03:22.739> okay<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:24.420> let's<00:03:25.320> go<00:03:25.560> over<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:26.040> good

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
problem okay so let's go over the good

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.380 
problem okay so let's go over the good
things<00:03:26.549> about<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:27.030> app<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:28.459> well<00:03:29.459> well<00:03:30.120> this

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
things about this app so well well this

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.660 
things about this app so well well this
might<00:03:30.570> be<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.750> negative<00:03:30.989> or<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.410> positive<00:03:31.670> but

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
might be a negative or a positive but

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.199 
might be a negative or a positive but
when<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.540> connect<00:03:34.370> with<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.640> app<00:03:35.880> for

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
when you connect with this app for

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
how it's designed and it is probably a

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.210 
how it's designed and it is probably a
good<00:04:06.239> security<00:04:06.660> feature<00:04:06.959> but<00:04:07.380> on<00:04:07.530> probably

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
good security feature but on probably

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.130 
good security feature but on probably
works<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.609> little<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.030> little<00:04:09.480> bit<00:04:09.750> differently

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
works a little a little bit differently

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.870 
works a little a little bit differently
than<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.500> expected<00:04:11.070> if<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.340> see<00:04:11.519> it<00:04:11.640> for<00:04:11.820> the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
than you expected if you see it for the

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.210 
than you expected if you see it for the
first<00:04:11.970> time<00:04:12.359> okay<00:04:13.260> another<00:04:13.650> thing<00:04:13.739> is<00:04:14.190> that

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
first time okay another thing is that

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.020 
first time okay another thing is that
you'll<00:04:15.090> see<00:04:15.329> that<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:16.200> CPU<00:04:16.470> usage<00:04:17.130> if<00:04:17.850> you

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
you'll see that the CPU usage if you

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.099 
you'll see that the CPU usage if you
remember<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.720> splash<00:04:19.109> top<00:04:20.450> IRA<00:04:21.450> pointed<00:04:21.959> out

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
remember the splash top IRA pointed out

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.010 
remember the splash top IRA pointed out
that<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.500> CPU<00:04:23.039> usage<00:04:23.310> was<00:04:23.820> always<00:04:24.270> at<00:04:24.450> 50%

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
that the CPU usage was always at 50%

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.890 
that the CPU usage was always at 50%
well<00:04:25.860> it's<00:04:26.490> basically<00:04:27.210> using

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
well it's basically using

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.870 
well it's basically using
zero<00:04:28.169> percent<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.860> CPU<00:04:29.340> I<00:04:29.400> think<00:04:29.759> it's

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
zero percent of the CPU I think it's

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.469 
zero percent of the CPU I think it's
must<00:04:30.509> be<00:04:30.690> using<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.169> GPU<00:04:31.620> somehow<00:04:32.130> to

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
must be using the GPU somehow to

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.110 
must be using the GPU somehow to
calculate<00:04:33.479> which<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:35.160> know<00:04:35.280> which<00:04:35.520> parts<00:04:35.940> of

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
calculate which you know which parts of

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.270 
calculate which you know which parts of
the<00:04:36.210> image<00:04:36.539> to<00:04:36.570> send<00:04:36.990> over<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:37.560> it's<00:04:37.740> doing<00:04:38.160> it

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
the image to send over and it's doing it

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.909 
the image to send over and it's doing it
very<00:04:39.060> efficiently<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:39.990> want<00:04:40.350> to<00:04:40.470> point<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.800> out

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
very efficiently I want to point it out

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.159 
very efficiently I want to point it out
again<00:04:40.979> because<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.759> is<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:42.060> important<00:04:42.600> the

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
again because it is so important the

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.730 
again because it is so important the
data<00:04:44.070> savings<00:04:44.910> right<00:04:45.270> imagine<00:04:46.169> if<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:46.590> were

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
data savings right imagine if you were

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.129 
data savings right imagine if you were
to<00:04:47.009> connect<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.550> your<00:04:47.610> work<00:04:47.820> computer<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.509> put

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
to connect to your work computer and put

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.310 
to connect to your work computer and put
together<00:04:49.320> like<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.830> PowerPoint<00:04:50.520> presentation

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
together like a PowerPoint presentation

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.159 
together like a PowerPoint presentation
or<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:53.190> know<00:04:53.310> work<00:04:53.550> on<00:04:53.729> something<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.990> could

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
or you know work on something you could

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.499 
or you know work on something you could
do<00:04:55.410> that<00:04:55.560> literally<00:04:56.160> for<00:04:56.400> eight<00:04:56.610> times<00:04:56.910> longer

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
do that literally for eight times longer

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.270 
do that literally for eight times longer
like<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:57.930> do<00:04:58.050> for<00:04:58.289> eight<00:04:58.500> hours<00:04:58.530> instead<00:04:59.220> of

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
like you do for eight hours instead of

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.510 
like you do for eight hours instead of
one<00:04:59.520> hour<00:04:59.729> flash<00:05:00.720> Tom<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.620> requires<00:05:02.220> this

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
one hour flash Tom it requires this

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.670 
one hour flash Tom it requires this
little<00:05:02.820> service<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.780> if<00:05:04.020> you're<00:05:04.169> not<00:05:04.410> logged

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
little service and if you're not logged

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.969 
little service and if you're not logged
into<00:05:04.949> the<00:05:05.190> computer<00:05:05.729> or<00:05:06.720> if<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.530> computer<00:05:07.949> is

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
into the computer or if the computer is

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.860 
into the computer or if the computer is
locked<00:05:08.280> you'll<00:05:08.880> find<00:05:09.240> that<00:05:09.389> you<00:05:09.510> cannot

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
locked you'll find that you cannot

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.810 
locked you'll find that you cannot
connect<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.320> your<00:05:10.410> computer<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:11.100> it's

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
connect to your computer and it's

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.650 
connect to your computer and it's
sometimes<00:05:12.570> in<00:05:13.260> my<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:13.830> might<00:05:14.039> be<00:05:14.360> like<00:05:15.360> a

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
sometimes in my that might be like a

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.350 
sometimes in my that might be like a
showstopper<00:05:16.289> right<00:05:17.010> you're<00:05:17.550> you<00:05:17.729> forgot<00:05:18.180> to

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
showstopper right you're you forgot to

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.540 
showstopper right you're you forgot to
log<00:05:18.539> in<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.199> it's<00:05:19.349> not<00:05:19.530> running<00:05:20.039> it<00:05:20.190> just

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
log in and it's not running it just

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.879 
log in and it's not running it just
can't<00:05:20.820> connect<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.330> computer<00:05:21.889> definitely

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
can't connect to the computer definitely

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.279 
can't connect to the computer definitely
not<00:05:23.099> an<00:05:23.280> issue<00:05:23.430> with<00:05:23.970> this<00:05:24.419> app<00:05:24.690> because<00:05:25.080> it's

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
not an issue with this app because it's

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.779 
not an issue with this app because it's
using<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:27.210> know<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.620> Windows<00:05:28.620> service<00:05:29.009> which

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
using you know a Windows service which

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.850 
using you know a Windows service which
of<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.570> know<00:05:30.690> it's<00:05:30.870> part<00:05:31.169> of<00:05:31.289> the<00:05:31.410> operating

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
of you know it's part of the operating

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.000 
of you know it's part of the operating
system<00:05:31.979> so<00:05:32.370> all<00:05:32.810> you<00:05:33.810> need<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.110> do<00:05:34.260> is<00:05:34.500> have<00:05:34.860> the

system so all you need to do is have the

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.860 
system so all you need to do is have the
computer<00:05:35.460> on<00:05:35.669> and<00:05:35.970> you<00:05:36.090> should<00:05:36.360> be<00:05:36.599> able<00:05:36.720> to

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
computer on and you should be able to

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.620 
computer on and you should be able to
connect<00:05:37.349> to<00:05:37.530> it<00:05:37.680> and<00:05:37.970> one<00:05:38.970> last<00:05:39.210> thing<00:05:39.419> for

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
get a lot of work done when they're

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.159 
get a lot of work done when they're
outside<00:05:45.990> is<00:05:46.560> that<00:05:47.340> it<00:05:47.669> supports<00:05:48.270> keyboard<00:05:48.930> and

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
outside is that it supports keyboard and

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.649 
outside is that it supports keyboard and
mice<00:05:49.470> like<00:05:49.830> nobody's<00:05:50.370> business<00:05:50.610> for<00:05:51.210> example

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
mice like nobody's business for example

mice like nobody's business for example
do<00:05:52.349> a<00:05:52.380> click<00:05:52.770> and<00:05:52.949> drag<00:05:53.250> and<00:05:53.610> you<00:05:53.639> could<00:05:53.880> do<00:05:54.000> a

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
do a click and drag and you could do a

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.060 
do a click and drag and you could do a
right<00:05:54.419> mouse-click<00:05:54.659> and<00:05:55.110> that<00:05:55.650> works<00:05:55.889> no

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
right mouse-click and that works no

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.580 
right mouse-click and that works no
problem<00:05:56.099> the<00:05:56.699> scroll<00:05:57.150> button<00:05:57.330> feels<00:05:58.320> like

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
problem the scroll button feels like

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.010 
problem the scroll button feels like
you're<00:05:59.280> scrolling<00:05:59.909> when<00:06:00.180> you're<00:06:00.360> in<00:06:00.630> front<00:06:00.810> of

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
you're scrolling when you're in front of

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.240 
you're scrolling when you're in front of
the<00:06:01.110> computer<00:06:01.560> itself

so<00:06:02.820> yeah<00:06:03.539> day<00:06:03.720> me<00:06:03.780> the<00:06:04.470> map<00:06:04.740> these<00:06:04.949> buttons

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
so yeah day me the map these buttons

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.060 
so yeah day me the map these buttons
correctly<00:06:05.970> and<00:06:06.330> I<00:06:06.780> can't<00:06:07.320> say<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:07.620> same<00:06:07.830> thing

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
correctly and I can't say the same thing

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.200 
correctly and I can't say the same thing
for<00:06:08.150> other<00:06:09.409> remote<00:06:10.409> desktop<00:06:10.979> or<00:06:11.340> you<00:06:12.120> know

this<00:07:17.100> touch<00:07:17.430> mode<00:07:17.790> just<00:07:18.090> like<00:07:18.210> splash<00:07:18.630> table

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
this touch mode just like splash table

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.800 
this touch mode just like splash table
it<00:07:18.990> has<00:07:19.140> those<00:07:19.320> two<00:07:19.620> modes<00:07:19.920> and<00:07:20.420> you<00:07:21.420> know<00:07:21.540> this

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
it has those two modes and you know this

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.280 
it has those two modes and you know this
is<00:07:21.990> it<00:07:22.860> registers<00:07:23.430> as<00:07:23.670> click<00:07:24.000> but<00:07:24.690> it<00:07:24.840> does<00:07:25.080> not

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.290 
is it registers as click but it does not

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.320 
is it registers as click but it does not
do<00:07:25.530> air<00:07:25.770> view<00:07:26.010> unfortunately<00:07:26.880> and<00:07:27.120> me

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
do air view unfortunately and me

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.120 
do air view unfortunately and me
hopefully<00:07:27.900> they'll<00:07:28.080> get<00:07:28.380> incorporated<00:07:29.040> in

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130 
hopefully they'll get incorporated in

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.710 
hopefully they'll get incorporated in
the<00:07:29.220> future<00:07:29.580> it's<00:07:29.820> a<00:07:29.880> little<00:07:30.180> bit<00:07:30.300> loss<00:07:30.480> of

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 
the future it's a little bit loss of

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.930 
the future it's a little bit loss of
functionality<00:07:31.260> but<00:07:31.770> I<00:07:31.800> think<00:07:32.160> once<00:07:32.490> again<00:07:32.640> for

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
functionality but I think once again for

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.010 
functionality but I think once again for
the<00:07:33.030> data<00:07:33.240> savings<00:07:33.750> that<00:07:34.710> rolls<00:07:35.190> all<00:07:36.020> so

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 
the data savings that rolls all so

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.780 
the data savings that rolls all so
that's<00:07:37.320> the<00:07:37.530> end<00:07:37.680> of<00:07:37.770> this<00:07:37.950> video<00:07:38.220> so<00:07:38.760> please
