00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
I'll say about them we have some

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.700 
I'll say about them we have some

logo right here on the fender as we keep

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.700 
logo right here on the fender as we keep
moving<00:01:58.600> you're<00:01:58.870> on<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.020> side<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.200> course<00:01:59.530> got

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
moving you're on the side of course got

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.840 
moving you're on the side of course got
the<00:01:59.830> door<00:02:00.010> mounted<00:02:00.540> wing<00:02:01.540> style<00:02:02.020> mirrors

the door mounted wing style mirrors

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.990 
the door mounted wing style mirrors
black<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:04.090> pillar<00:02:04.510> here<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.619> is<00:02:05.830> just<00:02:06.760> gives<00:02:06.910> it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
black a pillar here it is just gives it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.230 
black a pillar here it is just gives it
a<00:02:07.090> very<00:02:07.420> very<00:02:07.720> awesome<00:02:08.320> look<00:02:08.789> now<00:02:09.789> we've<00:02:10.090> got

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
a very very awesome look now we've got

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.390 
a very very awesome look now we've got
the<00:02:10.300> carbon<00:02:10.570> fiber<00:02:10.780> roof<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.380> be<00:02:12.130> able<00:02:12.190> to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
the carbon fiber roof to be able to

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.220 
the carbon fiber roof to be able to
decrease<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.820> weight<00:02:13.360> where<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.959> matters

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
decrease the weight where it matters

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.160 
decrease the weight where it matters
most<00:02:14.640> making<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:15.970> roof<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.630> it's<00:02:16.780> removable

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
most making this roof and it's removable

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
most making this roof and it's removable
roof<00:02:17.440> making<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.310> carbon<00:02:18.970> fiber<00:02:19.360> actually

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
roof making it carbon fiber actually

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.710 
roof making it carbon fiber actually
reduces<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.220> center<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.000> gravity<00:02:22.360> because<00:02:22.600> it

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
reduces the center of gravity because it

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.630 
reduces the center of gravity because it
pushes<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.110> weight<00:02:23.260> down<00:02:23.470> less<00:02:24.310> weight<00:02:24.520> up

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
pushes the weight down less weight up

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.820 
pushes the weight down less weight up
here<00:02:24.850> means<00:02:25.150> it's<00:02:25.630> lower<00:02:25.870> center<00:02:26.110> gravity<00:02:26.290> so

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
here means it's lower center gravity so

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.310 
here means it's lower center gravity so
the<00:02:26.980> door<00:02:27.160> opening<00:02:27.670> right<00:02:28.450> here<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:30.520> we<00:02:31.150> have

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
the door opening right here and we have

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.750 
the door opening right here and we have
inlets<00:02:32.320> right<00:02:32.500> here<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:33.130> is<00:02:33.310> again<00:02:33.580> a

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
inlets right here this is again a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.630 
inlets right here this is again a
functional<00:02:34.300> Inlet<00:02:34.920> takes<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> air<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.400> and
