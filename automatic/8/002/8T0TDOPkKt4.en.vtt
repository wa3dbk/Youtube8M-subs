greetings back again here and as you can
see<00:00:08.740> I<00:00:08.980> have<00:00:09.400> my<00:00:09.700> Neo<00:00:10.150> Geo<00:00:10.450> MVS<00:00:10.660> once<00:00:11.530> locked

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
see I have my Neo Geo MVS once locked

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.760 
see I have my Neo Geo MVS once locked
board<00:00:12.010> here<00:00:12.340> and<00:00:13.230> I've<00:00:14.230> been<00:00:14.379> reading<00:00:14.619> a<00:00:14.680> bit

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
board here and I've been reading a bit

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.029 
board here and I've been reading a bit
about<00:00:15.010> these<00:00:15.600> MVS<00:00:16.600> boards<00:00:17.020> and<00:00:17.680> I'll<00:00:17.980> be

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
about these MVS boards and I'll be

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.939 
about these MVS boards and I'll be
watching<00:00:18.400> some<00:00:18.640> videos<00:00:19.000> and<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:20.529> found<00:00:20.800> out

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
watching some videos and I found out

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.989 
watching some videos and I found out
that<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.939> common<00:00:22.359> problem<00:00:22.810> with<00:00:23.679> the<00:00:23.999> with

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:24.999 
that the common problem with the with

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.659 
that the common problem with the with
these<00:00:25.150> MVS<00:00:25.539> sports<00:00:25.810> is<00:00:26.080> that<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:27.189> battery

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
these MVS sports is that the battery

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.689 
these MVS sports is that the battery
will<00:00:28.630> eventually<00:00:29.169> start<00:00:29.380> leaking<00:00:29.669> and<00:00:30.669> the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
will eventually start leaking and the

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.790 
will eventually start leaking and the
battery<00:00:31.329> acid<00:00:31.390> will<00:00:31.749> actually<00:00:32.140> start<00:00:32.410> eating

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
battery acid will actually start eating

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.420 
battery acid will actually start eating
through<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.630> traces<00:00:34.630> on<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.810> board<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:36.250> of

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
through the traces on the board which of

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.290 
through the traces on the board which of
course<00:00:36.460> will<00:00:37.140> create<00:00:38.140> all<00:00:38.350> kinds<00:00:38.380> of<00:00:38.680> problems

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
course will create all kinds of problems

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.180 
course will create all kinds of problems
so<00:00:40.300> what<00:00:40.570> I'm<00:00:40.690> going<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:40.900> do<00:00:41.020> here<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.800> prevent

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
so what I'm going to do here to prevent

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.150 
so what I'm going to do here to prevent
that<00:00:42.310> from<00:00:42.370> happening<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.940> my<00:00:43.810> board<00:00:44.050> is<00:00:44.920> I'm

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
that from happening to my board is I'm

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.760 
that from happening to my board is I'm
going<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:46.600> replacing<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:47.260> battery<00:00:48.090> so

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
going to be replacing the battery so

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.470 
going to be replacing the battery so
this<00:00:50.770> board<00:00:51.670> here<00:00:52.120> this<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.550> mv-1

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
this board here this is the mv-1

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.910 
this board here this is the mv-1
a<00:00:55.720> model<00:00:56.500> and<00:00:57.490> there<00:00:57.760> are<00:00:57.880> several<00:00:58.240> different

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
a model and there are several different

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.030 
a model and there are several different
revisions<00:00:59.920> of<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.310> the<00:01:01.150> one<00:01:01.330> slope<00:01:01.570> board<00:01:02.040> and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
revisions of the the one slope board and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.230 
revisions of the the one slope board and
they<00:01:03.190> will<00:01:03.340> look<00:01:03.490> a<00:01:03.610> bit<00:01:03.640> different<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.939> one

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
they will look a bit different this one

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.399 
they will look a bit different this one
and<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:08.219> was<00:01:09.219> a<00:01:09.249> call<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.549> mV<00:01:10.890> 1f<00:01:11.890> said<00:01:12.340> I<00:01:12.369> think

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and the was a call to mV 1f said I think

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.859 
and the was a call to mV 1f said I think
look<00:01:14.409> pretty<00:01:15.039> similar<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:16.119> think<00:01:16.630> they<00:01:16.719> have

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
look pretty similar I think they have

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.399 
look pretty similar I think they have
all<00:01:17.109> the<00:01:17.229> same<00:01:17.829> components<00:01:18.429> and<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.479> layout

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
all the same components and the layout

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.279 
all the same components and the layout
is<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.740> same<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.890> lot<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.100> other

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
is the same but a lot of the other

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.660 
is the same but a lot of the other
variations<00:01:26.289> of<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.469> board<00:01:26.710> will<00:01:27.340> look<00:01:27.369> a<00:01:27.549> bit

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
variations of the board will look a bit

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.870 
variations of the board will look a bit
different<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:30.280> you<00:01:30.429> have<00:01:30.520> one<00:01:30.700> of<00:01:30.819> the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
different so if you have one of the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.389 
different so if you have one of the
other<00:01:30.999> boards<00:01:31.359> this<00:01:32.170> video<00:01:32.799> might<00:01:33.039> not<00:01:33.069> be

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
other boards this video might not be

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.700 
other boards this video might not be
that<00:01:33.719> that<00:01:34.719> helpful<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.810> anyway<00:01:38.170> on<00:01:38.499> this

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
that that helpful but anyway on this

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.340 
that that helpful but anyway on this
board<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.909> battery<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.299> located<00:01:40.479> underneath

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
board the battery is located underneath

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.270 
board the battery is located underneath
the<00:01:41.819> plastic<00:01:42.819> casing<00:01:43.420> here<00:01:43.889> so<00:01:44.889> I<00:01:44.920> have<00:01:45.130> to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
the plastic casing here so I have to

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.889 
the plastic casing here so I have to
remove<00:01:45.579> this<00:01:45.819> and<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:47.229> is<00:01:47.409> held<00:01:47.889> down<00:01:48.069> by

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
remove this and this is held down by

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.590 
remove this and this is held down by
four<00:01:49.899> screws<00:01:50.020> got<00:01:50.679> one<00:01:50.889> in<00:01:51.009> each<00:01:51.240> corner<00:01:52.240> here

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
four screws got one in each corner here

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.609 
four screws got one in each corner here
so<00:01:53.439> I<00:01:53.829> have<00:01:54.520> removed<00:01:54.789> those<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.840> this<00:01:55.990> can't<00:01:56.409> be

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
so I have removed those so this can't be

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.590 
so I have removed those so this can't be
lift<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.459> up<00:01:57.579> like<00:01:58.299> this

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.390 

and<00:02:01.920> over<00:02:02.920> here<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:04.210> have<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.900> battery<00:02:05.400> now

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
and over here we have the battery now

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.440 
and over here we have the battery now
the<00:02:06.780> original<00:02:07.780> batteries<00:02:08.200> are<00:02:09.450> rechargeable

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
the original batteries are rechargeable

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.220 
the original batteries are rechargeable
ones<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:12.520> could<00:02:12.870> replace<00:02:13.870> them<00:02:14.080> with

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
ones and you could replace them with

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.420 
ones and you could replace them with
another<00:02:15.480> rechargeable<00:02:16.480> battery<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.430> all

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
another rechargeable battery and all

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.020 
another rechargeable battery and all
some<00:02:18.700> people<00:02:19.180> put<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.530> super<00:02:21.459> capacitor

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
some people put in a super capacitor

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.840 
some people put in a super capacitor
instead<00:02:22.800> but<00:02:23.800> what<00:02:24.040> I'm<00:02:24.160> gonna<00:02:24.340> do<00:02:24.520> here<00:02:24.820> is

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
instead but what I'm gonna do here is

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.750 
instead but what I'm gonna do here is
I'm<00:02:25.240> going<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.420> put<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:26.100> non<00:02:27.100> rechargeable

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
I'm going to put in a non rechargeable

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.790 
I'm going to put in a non rechargeable
battery<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.650> have<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.600> oops<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.959> dropped<00:02:32.530> it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
battery so I have this oops I dropped it

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.620 
battery so I have this oops I dropped it
and<00:02:34.560> nice<00:02:35.560> battery<00:02:36.070> socket<00:02:36.430> here<00:02:36.610> which<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:37.450> got

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
and nice battery socket here which I got

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.020 
and nice battery socket here which I got
all<00:02:37.780> off<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:39.239> no<00:02:40.239> PC<00:02:40.690> motherboard<00:02:41.730> as<00:02:42.730> I'm

can find just about anywhere so yeah
we'll<00:02:57.610> need<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.450> start<00:02:58.690> by<00:02:58.959> removing<00:02:59.610> the<00:03:00.610> old

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
we'll need to start by removing the old

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.140 
we'll need to start by removing the old
battery<00:03:01.660> here<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.830> do<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.160> we'll<00:03:04.120> have

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
battery here and to do that we'll have

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.750 
battery here and to do that we'll have
to<00:03:04.420> turn<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.470> board<00:03:05.620> over<00:03:05.769> here<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:11.610> most<00:03:12.610> of

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
to turn the board over here and most of

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.420 
to turn the board over here and most of
these<00:03:12.820> boards<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.269> will<00:03:13.390> find<00:03:13.630> this<00:03:14.430> this

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
these boards you will find this this

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.300 
these boards you will find this this
here<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:15.850> some<00:03:16.180> kind<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.680> protective<00:03:17.680> padding

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
here is some kind of protective padding

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.940 
here is some kind of protective padding
here<00:03:18.519> which<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:18.940> actually<00:03:19.900> glued<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.799> the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
here which is actually glued to the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.300 
here which is actually glued to the
board<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:21.370> I'm<00:03:21.940> gonna<00:03:22.090> have<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:23.070> remove<00:03:24.070> that

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
board so I'm gonna have to remove that

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.120 
board so I'm gonna have to remove that
so<00:03:27.660> I'll<00:03:28.660> do<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.290> then<00:03:29.350> we'll<00:03:29.829> take<00:03:30.100> a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
so I'll do that and then we'll take a

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.280 
so I'll do that and then we'll take a
look<00:03:30.340> at<00:03:30.489> what's<00:03:30.970> underneath<00:03:31.360> here<00:03:34.290> alright

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
look at what's underneath here alright

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.900 
look at what's underneath here alright
so<00:03:35.650> here<00:03:36.400> are<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:37.180> components<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.870> were

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
so here are the components that were

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.789 
so here are the components that were
located<00:03:39.910> under<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.450> piece<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.110> protective

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
located under that piece of protective

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.800 
located under that piece of protective
padding<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.959> it's<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:45.700> area<00:03:46.030> here<00:03:46.600> that

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
padding and it's this area here that

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.970 
padding and it's this area here that
we're<00:03:47.549> interested<00:03:48.549> in<00:03:48.959> now<00:03:49.959> this<00:03:50.230> pin<00:03:50.650> here

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
we're interested in now this pin here

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.670 
we're interested in now this pin here
and<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.850> one<00:03:52.060> here<00:03:52.360> these<00:03:53.260> are<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.530> ones

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
and this one here these are the ones

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.729 
and this one here these are the ones
that<00:03:53.769> hold<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.760> battery<00:03:54.940> in<00:03:55.150> place<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:56.650> I'm

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
that hold the battery in place so I'm

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.460 
that hold the battery in place so I'm
gonna<00:03:56.860> have<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.040> desolder<00:03:58.079> those<00:03:59.079> two<00:03:59.320> and

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
gonna have to desolder those two and

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.680 
gonna have to desolder those two and
since<00:04:02.470> I'm<00:04:02.799> putting<00:04:02.980> in<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.489> non<00:04:03.970> rechargeable

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
since I'm putting in a non rechargeable

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.860 
since I'm putting in a non rechargeable
battery<00:04:05.079> we<00:04:06.010> also<00:04:06.160> have<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.700> disable<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.420> and

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
battery we also have to disable the and

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.280 
battery we also have to disable the and
a<00:04:08.200> shorting<00:04:08.650> function<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:10.359> do<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.690> I'm

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
a shorting function and to do that I'm

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.590 
a shorting function and to do that I'm
going<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:11.530> have<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.889> remove<00:04:12.850> these<00:04:13.750> three

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
going to have to remove these three

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.000 
going to have to remove these three
components<00:04:15.230> here<00:04:15.880> these<00:04:16.880> are<00:04:17.090> marked<00:04:17.360> d1<00:04:18.050> d2

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
components here these are marked d1 d2

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.860 
components here these are marked d1 d2
and<00:04:19.550> are<00:04:20.180> 10<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:22.400> I'll<00:04:22.850> have<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.240> desolder

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
and are 10 so I'll have to desolder

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.440 
and are 10 so I'll have to desolder
those<00:04:24.230> and<00:04:24.970> as<00:04:25.970> I<00:04:26.090> mentioned<00:04:26.680> about<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:28.450> the

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
those and as I mentioned about the the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.680 
those and as I mentioned about the the
board<00:04:29.660> with<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.170> model<00:04:30.620> number<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.690> 1f

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
board with the model number and the 1f

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.750 
board with the model number and the 1f
said<00:04:33.470> or<00:04:33.710> FC<00:04:35.740> as<00:04:36.740> I<00:04:36.920> said<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.250> looks<00:04:37.490> very

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
said or FC as I said that looks very

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.150 
said or FC as I said that looks very
similar<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:38.300> this<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:39.440> layout<00:04:39.740> here<00:04:39.950> is<00:04:40.130> a

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
similar to this the layout here is a

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.550 
similar to this the layout here is a
little<00:04:40.670> bit<00:04:40.820> different<00:04:41.240> but<00:04:41.840> you<00:04:42.170> will<00:04:42.320> find

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
little bit different but you will find

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.150 
little bit different but you will find
the<00:04:43.370> same<00:04:43.580> three<00:04:43.910> components<00:04:44.630> in<00:04:45.320> this<00:04:45.680> area

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
the same three components in this area

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.200 
the same three components in this area
here<00:04:46.750> although<00:04:47.750> I<00:04:47.900> think<00:04:48.050> this<00:04:48.550> r10<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:49.760> smart

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
here although I think this r10 is smart

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.770 
here although I think this r10 is smart
or<00:04:50.480> three<00:04:52.240> on<00:04:53.830> that<00:04:54.830> board<00:04:55.190> but<00:04:55.970> here<00:04:56.390> it's<00:04:56.510> our

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
or three on that board but here it's our

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.060 
or three on that board but here it's our
10<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:58.150> I'm<00:04:59.150> going<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.390> go<00:04:59.480> ahead<00:04:59.540> and<00:05:00.070> disorder

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
10 so I'm going to go ahead and disorder

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.840 
10 so I'm going to go ahead and disorder
the<00:05:01.730> battery<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.330> I'm<00:05:03.290> going<00:05:03.410> to<00:05:03.470> remove<00:05:03.850> the

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
the battery and I'm going to remove the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.090 
the battery and I'm going to remove the
components<00:05:07.600> all<00:05:08.600> right<00:05:08.780> so<00:05:09.320> here<00:05:09.620> I<00:05:09.680> have<00:05:09.740> the

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
components all right so here I have the

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.390 
components all right so here I have the
battery<00:05:10.640> and<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:11.210> three<00:05:11.420> components<00:05:12.020> removed
