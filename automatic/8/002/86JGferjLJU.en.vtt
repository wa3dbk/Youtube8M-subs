00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:10.769
 toulon personal speech 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:16.410
 so this is my old cell phone ring 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:22.939
 I failed to pay anything cheap at the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:29.090
 time android 4.0 52 inch screen 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:32.610
 and he 's falling clean the area is 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:46.530
 Thayanna when she was called and he 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:50.870
 off alone and cache exceptional year 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:55.520
 a little bit and I made it very cheap 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:01:00.930
 not when the thieves disappoints me 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:05.519
 so lets give a punishment had to see 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:13.380
 if it stops falling to the area that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:16.680
 I hit a wild cock that is 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.920
 running right but I think the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 alloy life time 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:27.680
 already look how beautiful it is 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:39.479
 this is for him 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:41.090
 shame in the face does not stop but leave the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.259
 tower 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.259
 I think later 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.630
 after that to learn battery theory 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.259
 because it can not explode in his camera 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.770
 it was bad too 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.770
 now it will get worse 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:12.180
 like these people 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.319
 his interface is not the camera two looks 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:28.829
 chips 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:31.609
 a nice cell phone inside the field 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:43.919
 analyzed hand 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:45.450
 Marcelinho make it clear that no 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:49.319
 I'm disgusted 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:58.709
 I want him to learn with his cell phone. 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:03:08.989
 recent processor of the island had a focus 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:08.989
 I think the processor was in his plate 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:26.250
 I know it's this 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:33.659
 his uncle pounded to cancel two more 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.919
 two years use very good the screen stayed 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:39.239
 sold out when you think they 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:44.189
 android app to have it land 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.620
 cracked is more or less this is very 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:52.189
 cool 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:58.370
 from here until you get the best of it, right? 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:58.370
 because everything is a bit naughty 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.629
 I do not think I'll ever use it again. 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.680
 also is it folks will not affect 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.919
 battery if I do not die from an explosion 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.919
 on here 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.609
 this is what is left 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:26.430
 here is a big hug and even the 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:29.300
 next 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.300
