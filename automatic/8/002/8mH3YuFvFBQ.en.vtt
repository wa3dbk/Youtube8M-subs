know multan a bunch of new sites and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.280 
know multan a bunch of new sites and
they<00:01:42.500> test<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.640> already<00:01:44.180> or<00:01:44.420> Japanese<00:01:45.050> already

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
they test it already or Japanese already

they test it already or Japanese already
that<00:01:45.920> has<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.160> dsi<00:01:46.820> already<00:01:47.330> tested<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:47.869> so

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
that has a dsi already tested it so

00:01:48.649 --> 00:02:01.580 
that has a dsi already tested it so
don't<00:01:48.860> work<00:01:52.000> all<00:01:53.000> right<00:01:53.119> that's<00:01:53.300> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.750 

all<00:02:02.590> right<00:02:02.860> what<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.549> think<00:02:03.880> about<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.180> dsi<00:02:04.869> and

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
all right what I think about the dsi and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.260 
all right what I think about the dsi and
to<00:02:06.760> me<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.090> looks<00:02:07.330> pretty<00:02:07.630> much<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.740> good<00:02:09.039> GS<00:02:09.490> new

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
to me it looks pretty much a good GS new

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.430 
to me it looks pretty much a good GS new
user<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.810> your<00:02:10.929> face<00:02:11.110> but<00:02:11.819> sounds<00:02:12.819> well<00:02:13.440> that

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
user in your face but sounds well that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.570 
user in your face but sounds well that
depends<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:16.300> your<00:02:16.420> taste<00:02:16.800> SD<00:02:17.800> card<00:02:18.069> slot<00:02:18.340> those

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
depends on your taste SD card slot those

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.100 
depends on your taste SD card slot those
very<00:02:18.970> hard<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.420> get<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.720> out<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.080> then

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
very hard to get it out and then

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.400 
very hard to get it out and then
probably<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.640> SD<00:02:22.180> card<00:02:22.209> itself<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:23.110> actually

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
probably the SD card itself is actually

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.640 
probably the SD card itself is actually
really<00:02:24.100> hard<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.510> get<00:02:25.720> out<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.140> also<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.470> put

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
really hard to get out and also to put

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.840 
really hard to get out and also to put
it<00:02:26.770> in<00:02:26.970> it's<00:02:27.970> very<00:02:28.120> different<00:02:29.610> stick<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.730> out

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
it in it's very different stick it out

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:40.000 
it in it's very different stick it out
right<00:02:30.970> now<00:02:31.239> if<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.540> can

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.220 

if<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.819> can<00:02:41.000> see<00:02:41.180> our<00:02:41.330> exam<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.900> that's<00:02:42.049> d

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
if you can see our exam and that's d

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.809 
if you can see our exam and that's d
card<00:02:42.470> in<00:02:42.620> there<00:02:42.830> but<00:02:43.099> it<00:02:43.159> doesn't<00:02:43.430> recognize

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
card in there but it doesn't recognize

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.110 
card in there but it doesn't recognize
it<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.209> I'll<00:02:44.329> figure<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.659> out<00:02:44.780> next<00:02:45.319> time<00:02:49.120> d

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
it so I'll figure it out next time d

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.589 
it so I'll figure it out next time d
asking<00:02:50.540> only<00:02:50.870> one<00:02:51.230> slot<00:02:51.500> obviously<00:02:52.599> screws

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
asking only one slot obviously screws

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.110 
asking only one slot obviously screws
over<00:02:54.230> there<00:02:54.439> at<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.739> battery<00:02:55.069> pack<00:02:55.129> serial

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.309 
number which you won't be able to see
I'm<00:02:58.310> pretty<00:02:58.610> sure<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.390> screws<00:03:02.659> let's

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
I'm pretty sure and the screws let's

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.610 
I'm pretty sure and the screws let's
difference<00:03:04.099> about<00:03:04.280> screws<00:03:04.610> ility<00:03:05.120> use<00:03:05.329> a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
difference about screws ility use a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.460 
difference about screws ility use a
Phillips<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:07.370> one<00:03:07.609> well<00:03:08.569> do<00:03:08.930> use<00:03:09.079> something

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
Phillips this one well do use something

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.479 
Phillips this one well do use something
else<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:10.359> think<00:03:11.359> it's<00:03:11.560> well<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.769> don't<00:03:13.040> know<00:03:13.220> for

mobley might have solved the cracking
problem<00:04:50.480> because<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.720> might<00:04:50.840> has<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.500> well

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740
