this<00:00:33.300> question<00:00:33.690> from<00:00:34.079> an<00:00:34.170> installation

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
this question from an installation

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.260 
this question from an installation
standpoint<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> strap<00:00:35.640> mount<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.120> it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
standpoint is a strap mount or is it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270 
standpoint is a strap mount or is it
magnetic<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.899> answer<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.559> both<00:00:37.739> see

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
magnetic and the answer is it's both see

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.950 
magnetic and the answer is it's both see
that<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.489> has<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> strap<00:00:39.000> mount<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.390> both<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
that it has a strap mount on both the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.299 
that it has a strap mount on both the
tank<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.320> goes<00:00:40.410> or<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.770> straps<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.250> go

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
tank that goes or the straps that go

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.650 
tank that goes or the straps that go
around<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> neck<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> ones<00:00:42.540> that

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
around the neck and then the ones that

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.389 
around the neck and then the ones that
are<00:00:42.750> closer<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.410> seat<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> can

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
are closer to your seat but you can

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
remove them and it has the magnet

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.330 
remove them and it has the magnet
magnets<00:00:46.469> built<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.160> option

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
magnets built in so you have that option

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.150 
magnets built in so you have that option
so<00:00:47.610> magnet<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.450> magnet<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> bag<00:00:49.770> itself

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so magnet here magnet in the bag itself

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.860 
so magnet here magnet in the bag itself
and<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.520> two<00:00:50.760> magnets<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.510> towards<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and then two magnets up here towards the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.600 
and then two magnets up here towards the
top<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.289> again<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.829> flexibility<00:00:53.399> in

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
top so again you have the flexibility in

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.910 
top so again you have the flexibility in
that<00:00:53.640> configuration<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.110> look<00:00:55.320> at<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that configuration if we look at it you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.439 
that configuration if we look at it you
know<00:00:56.039> my<00:00:56.280> gripe<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.879> would<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.120> I'd<00:00:57.270> love
