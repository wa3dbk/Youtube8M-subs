00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.909
 The largest canyon flights of our solar system is not found on earth 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:12.699
 but on mars 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.279
 it was called no violence 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.199
 buffaloes of the magnet 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.910
 in honor of the probe key for the first time that it flew over it in 1971 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.709
 in some areas, as deep as mount Everest e is high 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.560
 and extends for at least five thousand kilometers 5 times the Italian peninsula 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.560
 you are ready to discover these marvelian marvels 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.589
 while we take off a swarm of reels 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.109
 dance alongside us as in the terrestrial deserts 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.320
 we write to him we fly over some impact craters 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.270
 right in front of us on our way to the edge of the canyon e 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.270
 living push clouds of dust from the bottom 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.690
 respect to the grand canyon of Arizona 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.460
 from the stars rimini evening of 10 times longer 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.960
 seven times longer up to 700 kilometers 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.940
 the deepest feelings 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.860
 the media 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.120
 in the arc of more than 100 kilometers it could contain an area as large as 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.480
 Los Angeles 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.200
 we live to the west east lost the condition of women fracture we find 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.310
 the remains of giant sky landslides and landslides that have created spurs 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.719
 rocky 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.440
 yes, closer figures 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.980
 the 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.960
 I ask for English political asylum and we trust in the new daughter reality 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 curve easy to cda convincing 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.210
 it was not dug by a river as it happens on earth but by a stream 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.630
 underground water thesis formed by the sudden melting of icicles 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.630
 caused by a volcanic eruption 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.429
 to shape the walls of this huge scar 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.370
 the turkish signs of Mars 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.470
 hey lying about a quarter of his circumferences 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.700
 it took the force of earthquakes 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.990
 who started opening the rift 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.990
 billions of years ago 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.680
 laid down on mille sacha snals the area wider than from 7 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.169
 we find numerous layers of dust 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.559
 hierro share sediments 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:29.319
 a little further on we fly over a ruinous landslide of 4 and a half kilometers who has 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.759
 scattered debris for more than 160 kilometers on the bottom of val d'elsa 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:38.819
 Soverato web known landslide we find another basin that collects several 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.559
 layers of deposits 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.679
 the various sediments allow to better understand some sentences of the complex 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.479
 geological history of mars 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:53.009
 the twenty expert note millions of years Martian soil have carved the ground 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.249
 softer long shoots sad 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.619
 we ask in a writing that is in me working on a ravine we find ourselves on 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.869
 I trust Senate 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:08.489
 a canyon 317 kilometers long we find them other to me hey ridges 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.879
 a flight on Valais Mariner is 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.330
 gives us an exciting insight into the geological complexity of Clement 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.259
 Russian 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:23.999
 among the rocks of this grand canyon of all the planets rests the book of 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.019
 story of marco 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.019
 that scientists have just started reading 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.659
 one day 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.159
 perhaps sooner than you imagine emo 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.779
 keep reading the whole story in these wonders of the solar system 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:47.759
 already rai
