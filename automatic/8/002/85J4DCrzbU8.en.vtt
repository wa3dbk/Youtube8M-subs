bring the fabric upwards I don't think

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.780

when you were wearing a bra here's
someone<00:03:09.519> who<00:03:09.670> has<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:09.879> bigger<00:03:10.239> bust<00:03:10.599> and<00:03:10.959> you're

someone who has a bigger bust and you're

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.839 
someone who has a bigger bust and you're
looking<00:03:11.379> for<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.590> little<00:03:11.769> more<00:03:11.889> coverage<00:03:12.310> and

maybe an added support

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.589 
maybe an added support
I<00:03:14.530> think<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.160> halter<00:03:15.519> style<00:03:15.819> is<00:03:16.180> one<00:03:16.389> of<00:03:16.510> the

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
I think the halter style is one of the

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.080 
I think the halter style is one of the
best<00:03:16.930> without<00:03:17.430> covering<00:03:18.430> too<00:03:18.669> much<00:03:18.849> of<00:03:19.000> your

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
best without covering too much of your

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.000 
best without covering too much of your
