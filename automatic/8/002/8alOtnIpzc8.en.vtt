over<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.390> codec<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:55.930> I'll<00:01:56.350> give<00:01:56.649> my<00:01:56.800> opinion

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
over the codec and I'll give my opinion

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160 
over the codec and I'll give my opinion
on<00:01:57.250> both<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.490> them<00:01:57.700> all<00:01:58.030> right<00:01:58.300> now<00:01:58.539> this<00:01:58.899> is

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
on both of them all right now this is

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.260 
on both of them all right now this is
recording<00:01:59.770> switched<00:02:00.039> over<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.820> different

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
recording switched over to the different

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.359 
recording switched over to the different
camcorder<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.050> this<00:02:02.440> is<00:02:02.470> done<00:02:02.800> on<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.070> kodak

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
camcorder so this is done on the kodak

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.070 
camcorder so this is done on the kodak
zi8<00:02:03.850> which<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.270> was<00:02:04.360> just<00:02:04.509> showing<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:04.810> earlier

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
zi8 which I was just showing you earlier

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.740 
zi8 which I was just showing you earlier
now<00:02:05.920> first<00:02:06.610> things<00:02:06.880> about<00:02:07.179> it<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.450> you

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
now first things about it is that you

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.930 
now first things about it is that you
can<00:02:07.869> see<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.560> lens<00:02:08.800> is<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.100> lot<00:02:09.340> wider<00:02:09.580> you<00:02:09.880> can

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
can see the lens is a lot wider you can

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.350 
can see the lens is a lot wider you can
see<00:02:10.239> more<00:02:10.450> stuff<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:12.130> has<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.459> nice<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:13.150> not<00:02:13.330> a

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
see more stuff it has it nice it's not a

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.509 
see more stuff it has it nice it's not a
pickle<00:02:13.840> but<00:02:14.019> it's<00:02:14.140> an<00:02:14.260> actual<00:02:14.489> digital<00:02:15.489> zoom

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
pickle but it's an actual digital zoom

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.460 
pickle but it's an actual digital zoom
that's<00:02:15.880> sort<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.180> decent<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.840> mean<00:02:17.200> when<00:02:17.350> you're

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
that's sort of decent I mean when you're

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.380 
that's sort of decent I mean when you're
recording<00:02:17.739> at<00:02:17.950> 720p<00:02:18.580> which<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.120> what<00:02:19.300> I'm

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
recording at 720p which is what I'm

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780 
recording at 720p which is what I'm
doing<00:02:19.420> here<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:20.530> uses<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.100> pixels<00:02:21.519> left

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
doing here and so uses the pixels left

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.789 
doing here and so uses the pixels left
over<00:02:22.090> from<00:02:22.209> say<00:02:22.450> 1080p<00:02:23.079> to<00:02:23.290> do<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.709> know

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
over from say 1080p to do you know

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.199 
over from say 1080p to do you know
zooming<00:02:24.190> in<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.370> bit<00:02:24.549> closer<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.120> it's

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
zooming in a bit closer and it's

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.210 
zooming in a bit closer and it's
actually<00:02:25.360> smooth<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.019> usable<00:02:26.410> anyway<00:02:27.100> so

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
actually smooth and usable anyway so

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.080 
actually smooth and usable anyway so
this<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.120> Samsung<00:02:28.739> hmx<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:29.920> 10<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.940> this

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
this is the Samsung hmx you 10 so this

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.330 
this is the Samsung hmx you 10 so this
is<00:02:31.120> what<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.570> were<00:02:31.630> using<00:02:31.900> earlier<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.769> record

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
is what we were using earlier to record

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.360 
is what we were using earlier to record
me<00:02:34.140> looks<00:02:35.140> nice<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:36.820> got<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> nice<00:02:37.299> sort<00:02:37.660> of

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
me looks nice it's got a nice sort of

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.130 
me looks nice it's got a nice sort of
angled<00:02:39.370> curve<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:39.880> now<00:02:40.780> what<00:02:41.110> a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
angled curve to it now what a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.100 
angled curve to it now what a
fundamental<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.130> that<00:02:42.340> these<00:02:42.519> will<00:02:42.730> use<00:02:43.110> sdhc

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
fundamental is that these will use sdhc

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.430 
fundamental is that these will use sdhc
for<00:02:44.739> its<00:02:44.860> recording<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.840> all<00:02:47.079> memory

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
for its recording so this is all memory

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.530 
for its recording so this is all memory
card<00:02:47.680> kind<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:47.980> stuff<00:02:48.220> plug<00:02:48.850> in<00:02:49.060> off<00:02:49.209> you<00:02:49.480> go

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
card kind of stuff plug in off you go

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.710 
card kind of stuff plug in off you go
now<00:02:49.900> I'm<00:02:50.670> cool<00:02:51.670> thing<00:02:51.910> about<00:02:52.000> these<00:02:52.329> is<00:02:52.390> that

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
now I'm cool thing about these is that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.900 
now I'm cool thing about these is that
they<00:02:53.200> use<00:02:53.380> USB<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.340> plug<00:02:54.519> it<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.790> off

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
they use USB so you plug it in and off

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.420 
they use USB so you plug it in and off
it<00:02:54.940> goes<00:02:55.120> in<00:02:55.959> fact<00:02:56.260> they're<00:02:56.500> done<00:02:56.680> has<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:56.980> movie

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
it goes in fact they're done has a movie

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.699 
it goes in fact they're done has a movie
studio<00:02:57.670> built<00:02:58.060> into<00:02:58.329> it<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.480> long<00:02:58.840> Eddie<00:02:59.410> you

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
studio built into it so long Eddie you

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.620 
studio built into it so long Eddie you
clips<00:02:59.980> or<00:03:00.190> usually<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.239> press<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.600> button

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
clips or usually you press the button

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.560 
clips or usually you press the button
and<00:03:01.989> will<00:03:02.290> upload<00:03:02.620> onto<00:03:02.829> YouTube<00:03:03.310> or<00:03:03.459> Facebook

and will upload onto YouTube or Facebook

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.940 
and will upload onto YouTube or Facebook
so<00:03:04.570> that's<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.170> review<00:03:05.530> about<00:03:05.680> these

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
so that's the review about these

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.400 
so that's the review about these
personally<00:03:06.610> I'm<00:03:06.850> much<00:03:07.540> more<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.959> fan<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
personally I'm much more of a fan of the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.100 
personally I'm much more of a fan of the
codec<00:03:08.709> zi8<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.489> that's<00:03:10.030> because<00:03:10.299> mainly<00:03:10.840> of

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
codec zi8 and that's because mainly of

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.920 
codec zi8 and that's because mainly of
it's<00:03:11.769> got<00:03:11.980> an<00:03:12.100> audio<00:03:12.340> input<00:03:12.579> so<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.030> can<00:03:13.239> get<00:03:13.750> get

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
it's got an audio input so I can get get

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.630 
it's got an audio input so I can get get
out<00:03:14.049> with<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.260> lot<00:03:14.560> better<00:03:14.859> of<00:03:15.040> an<00:03:15.130> audio<00:03:15.459> input

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
out with a lot better of an audio input

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.819 
out with a lot better of an audio input
in<00:03:16.000> their<00:03:16.350> microphones<00:03:17.350> are<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.590> inbuilt

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
in their microphones are the inbuilt

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.940 
in their microphones are the inbuilt
once<00:03:18.190> i<00:03:18.850> have<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.480> say<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.410> one<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.890> a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
once i have to say that this one is a

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.860 
once i have to say that this one is a
lot<00:03:21.130> better<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:21.670> got<00:03:21.850> ones<00:03:22.060> i'll<00:03:22.239> re<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.750> the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
lot better it's got ones i'll re and the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.220 
lot better it's got ones i'll re and the
front

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
front

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.350 
front
so<00:03:23.830> it's<00:03:23.950> fairly<00:03:24.159> good<00:03:24.459> compared<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.300> one

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
so it's fairly good compared to this one

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.449 
so it's fairly good compared to this one
you've<00:03:26.230> actually<00:03:26.409> got<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.709> plug<00:03:26.950> something<00:03:27.220> in

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
you've actually got a plug something in

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.820 
you've actually got a plug something in
there<00:03:27.670> but<00:03:28.209> that's<00:03:28.629> not<00:03:28.810> much<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.170> beef<00:03:29.560> for

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
there but that's not much of a beef for

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.520 
there but that's not much of a beef for
me<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.549> anyway<00:03:30.790> that's<00:03:31.150> why<00:03:31.450> I'm<00:03:31.569> techy<00:03:32.110> if

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
me so anyway that's why I'm techy if

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.380 
me so anyway that's why I'm techy if
you're<00:03:32.680> after<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.920> pocket<00:03:33.250> camcorder<00:03:33.760> cuttack

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
you're after a pocket camcorder cuttack

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.490 
you're after a pocket camcorder cuttack
zi8<00:03:34.720> roughly<00:03:35.440> around<00:03:36.360> 200<00:03:37.360> ish<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.319> these

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500
