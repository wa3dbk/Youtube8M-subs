me<00:03:29.110> because<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.470> was<00:03:29.830> not<00:03:30.040> expecting<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:30.640> the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
me because I was not expecting this the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.020 
me because I was not expecting this the
gameplay<00:03:31.420> is<00:03:31.660> very<00:03:31.990> unique<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:33.310> lot<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.820> fun

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
gameplay is very unique and a lot of fun

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.360 
gameplay is very unique and a lot of fun
now<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.300> was<00:03:34.600> expecting<00:03:34.990> it<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.290> be<00:03:35.380> fun<00:03:35.740> not<00:03:36.010> a

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
now I was expecting it to be fun not a

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.940 
now I was expecting it to be fun not a
lot<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.760> fun<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.360> was<00:03:37.480> expecting<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:38.110> be<00:03:38.140> fun<00:03:38.470> but

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
lot of fun I was expecting to be fun but

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.920 
lot of fun I was expecting to be fun but
I<00:03:39.010> was<00:03:39.280> not<00:03:39.459> expecting<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.300> be<00:03:40.330> unique<00:03:40.600> and

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
I was not expecting it to be unique and

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.229 
I was not expecting it to be unique and
it<00:03:41.680> really<00:03:42.040> was<00:03:42.310> unique<00:03:42.640> in<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.910> way<00:03:42.940> because

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
it really was unique in a way because

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.479 
it really was unique in a way because
they<00:03:43.780> had<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.959> couple<00:03:44.380> of<00:03:44.620> abilities<00:03:45.220> in<00:03:45.400> the

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
they had a couple of abilities in the

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.860 
they had a couple of abilities in the
single-player<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:46.150> end<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.480> multiplayer

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
single-player that end the multiplayer

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.050 
single-player that end the multiplayer
but<00:03:47.140> i'll<00:03:47.260> talk<00:03:47.590> about<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.860> later<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:48.730> just

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
but i'll talk about that later that just

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.000 
but i'll talk about that later that just
make<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:49.450> single<00:03:49.750> player<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.320> much<00:03:50.560> fun<00:03:50.860> and

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
and stealth stealth it up pretty much

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.710 
and stealth stealth it up pretty much
and<00:04:00.250> go<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.550> do<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.670> sam<00:04:00.970> fisher<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.510> kill
