even though I was +1 it still would have

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.110 
even though I was +1 it still would have
been<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.230> two<00:02:25.500> or<00:02:25.530> three<00:02:25.770> hit<00:02:25.890> KO<00:02:26.120> probably

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
and i believe this oh i was thinking so

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.570 
and i believe this oh i was thinking so
Kabutops<00:02:45.150> was<00:02:45.390> focus<00:02:46.020> ashed<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.070> he<00:02:47.430> just

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
Kabutops was focus ashed but I he just

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.120 
Kabutops was focus ashed but I he just
goes<00:02:47.760> ahead<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.120> aqua<00:02:48.540> Jets<00:02:49.080> my<00:02:49.200> mummy<00:02:49.770> and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
goes ahead and aqua Jets my mummy and

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.130 
goes ahead and aqua Jets my mummy and
kills<00:02:50.460> it<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.240> know<00:02:51.360> let's<00:02:51.540> end<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.960> that

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
kills it so you know let's end of that

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.620 
kills it so you know let's end of that
as<00:02:52.350> my<00:02:53.010> role<00:02:53.490> Tom's<00:02:53.730> go<00:02:54.060> straight<00:02:54.420> for<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
as my role Tom's go straight for the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.600 
as my role Tom's go straight for the
Thunderbolt<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.800> kills<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.580> I

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
Thunderbolt on it and kills it so I

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.430 
Thunderbolt on it and kills it so I
guessing<00:02:57.210> he<00:02:57.360> might<00:02:57.630> have<00:02:57.780> been<00:02:57.960> banded

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
guessing he might have been banded

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.880 
guessing he might have been banded
probably<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.640> know<00:02:59.700> kabutops<00:03:00.450> banded<00:03:01.110> you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
probably you know kabutops banded you

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.280 
probably you know kabutops banded you
know<00:03:02.070> aquajet<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.820> guess<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.300> don't<00:03:03.450> know<00:03:03.510> some

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
know aquajet I guess I don't know some

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.870 
know aquajet I guess I don't know some
reason<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.680> decided<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.160> go<00:03:05.340> straight<00:03:05.700> for<00:03:05.820> the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
reason I decided to go straight for the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.090 
reason I decided to go straight for the
return<00:03:06.240> anyways<00:03:06.720> on<00:03:06.930> his<00:03:07.140> empoleon<00:03:07.770> for<00:03:07.980> some

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
return anyways on his empoleon for some

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.740 
return anyways on his empoleon for some
reason<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.430> guess<00:03:08.580> just<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.880> damage<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.630> when

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
reason I guess just a damage on it when

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.090 
reason I guess just a damage on it when
I<00:03:09.780> should<00:03:10.110> have<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.380> probably<00:03:10.470> finished<00:03:10.980> off

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100

but um it turns out that was probably a

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.740 
but um it turns out that was probably a
