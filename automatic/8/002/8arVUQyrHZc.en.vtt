00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.830
“Surely everything is inevitable,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.360
But for now, I’m fine with not knowing

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.930
The meaning behind meetings and partings.”

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.390
But that was just a way to hide our weakness.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.010
If I’m going to be betrayed,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.600
If we’re just going to hurt each other

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.180
Then at least make sure you deceive me completely

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.620
Just for tonight.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.300
As dreams stay only dreams

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.040
At a distance where my feelings are receding

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.070
As we melt our freezing hearts

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.200
Is it too late for you, just now, to be by my side?

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.700
True love with exchanged vows,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.140
Tied together by the red thread of fate -

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.760
The deep red lies you gave me

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.360
Were always so kind.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.950
The red thread of fate has been cut

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.500
Vows unexchanged, and words, false -

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.050
The deep red lie I gave to you was,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.680
“I’ll always love you.”

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.630
Surely everything was a mistake

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.170
From the time we met, until our parting

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.730
Unable to tell you, my heart

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.270
Is disappearing.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.810
If we are both able now

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.320
To forgive each other of betrayal

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.930
Then at least let us love each other completely

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.420
Just for tonight.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.530
As dreams stay only dreams

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.840
At a distance where my feelings are receding

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.800
Even if we melt our freezing hearts

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.480
Now we are already too far apart.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.520
True love with exchanged vows,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.020
Tied together by the red thread of fate -

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.630
The deep red lies you gave me

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.140
Were always so kind.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.720
The red thread of fate has been cut

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.270
Vows unexchanged, and words, false -

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.850
The deep red lie I gave to you was,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.000
“I’ll always love you.”
