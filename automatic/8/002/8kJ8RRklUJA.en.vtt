00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.690 
that there's no you can ask them
something<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.689> see<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.020> immediately<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
something and you see it immediately you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.459 
something and you see it immediately you
there<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.790> no<00:02:02.939> boundaries<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.200> second

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
it's for me it's very important when the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.449 
it's for me it's very important when the
dancer<00:02:11.150> can<00:02:11.480> project<00:02:11.930> something<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:13.069> this<00:02:13.280> is
