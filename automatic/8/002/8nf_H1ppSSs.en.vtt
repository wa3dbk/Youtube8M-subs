00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.680
 hello together I have two here 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.119
 beautiful super well grown 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.779
 tomato plants in hand there is even 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.660
 already a fruit and we have 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.250
 today a fruit day by moon calendar 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.500
 so far we have been able to watch in our videos 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.170
 See how we sowed the ones we have 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.210
 who have pleaded and transplanted and 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.960
 as we put the bucket where the same pure 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.470
 have prepared with ducati 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.470
 Let's go 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.390
 I remove the tomato from the bottom 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.350
 leaves throws her the plant free 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 downward 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.339
 on the one hand so that the leaves not to 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.059
 rest on the one hand and on the other hand with me 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.850
 Carefully plant the tomato deep 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.229
 to solve 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.340
 you can see a beautiful root 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.340
 he looks great 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.700
 Can not do that with the shovel me 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.040
 beautifully the first is in it for 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.800
 plant the tomatoes in pots on these 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.370
 the black ones are so dark 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.590
 Sun 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.180
 they are protected against the wall that is 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.790
 optimally this works great 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.740
 We did not have any ice-saint yet 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.570
 but first of all, it's kind of like that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.520
 anyway, do not leave 2x here 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.570
 a mild climate and third are the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:55.370
 plant big enough 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:02:02.840
 that is why the earth also combines here 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:07.810
 a beautiful root ball what have 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:17.690
 I forget leaves down 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:20.210
 tomato pure kÃ¶gel is now still 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.400
 filled up with earth and then we look 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.400
 which leaves come to the ground 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.840
 he is on the one hand down 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.060
 but also out 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.290
 much water 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.080
 That was about halfway now 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.530
 watering can 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.950
 from this ten liter watering can easter 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.410
 cool streep hd we take out that too 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.950
 is again a tomato this place 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.130
 hover 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.300
 We'll pack that in later 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.740
 nevertheless that did not settle and 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.120
 that would be a bit too wobbly in there 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.120
 so we're coming in later 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.970
 if you do not have enough tomatoes now 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.830
 has or continues to multiply 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.470
 You want to be able to have such a wonderful mind 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.759
 rubbed here usually takes break 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.680
 we 'll keep you out of it 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.729
 can grow and not too bushy 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.110
 but i can break them too then 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.490
 i can water them and 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.509
 plant and have a new one 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.729
 tomato plant what to pour when tomatoes 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.259
 It is also important that you do not have water 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.270
 directly from the line or from the 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.669
 Fountain takes that is much too cold 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:56.020
 Now with the cuttings it is important 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:05:00.909
 leaves evaporate water so that we a 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.500
 make some runners off and also 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.490
 label so we know behind yet 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.479
 what it was 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.060
 which now are from the dathe tomato 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.840
 two to three days in the water come 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.840
 in the sowaaterde 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.110
 here under the carport the three bucket 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:52.210
 with the buffalo heart tomato 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:56.729
 and the next time lawn mowing comes 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.729
 the lawncut as well as 0 on it
