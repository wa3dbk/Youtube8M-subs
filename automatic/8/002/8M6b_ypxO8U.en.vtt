00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.670
 the girls swim from all sides 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.649
 thank you because I'm surprised a lot 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.200
 lots of reproductions that have my 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.960
 videos and good that I already have a few 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.640
 subscribers compared to some 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.320
 they are very little but the truth is that 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.390
 I have the weekend in this that I do not 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.820
 I think so nothing for all 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 thank you because I did not expect it 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.800
 especially pure because of the fact that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.630
 a lot of people uploading videos and such and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.820
 I do it a little more for satisfaction 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.500
 staff that for something else 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.559
 Well, rice, I'm going to do a review 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.809
 of various colors since beneficial are not 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.269
 two because among other things I do not have 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.979
 more and good to tell you that I mark 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:46.859
 benefit last and using since 2000 and 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:49.530
 then well and well here they will carry three 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.420
 years or four in Spain then 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.339
 I have a lot of products because that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.670
 that you do not finish it where it was asked 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.199
 that more 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.140
 so what to teach because it is the same 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.629
 It's a bit of an illusion to see a little 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.909
 well old things of benefit though 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.040
 Well they are out of print and so 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.700
 but hey, you're a bit stung 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.509
 curiosity 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.630
 Well, I'm going to do a review of 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:19.680
 dante the self that is well known and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:25.549
 of this that hard that is the sound like 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.549
 to adjust some strings because for him 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.100
 I do not know how it's called the car lines 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.520
 Well, I'll tell you, I 'm a fan 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.530
 fun fun fun fun the benefit and this is 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.649
 one of the products for my basic 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.789
 super basic especially because as I already 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.979
 You see, I have pretty clear skin 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.899
 so then also this color gives me 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.539
 I'm doing quite well there are people who do not 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.970
 I really like this brush to me if it goes 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.970
 well by right to smile 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.370
 and I at least control her quite 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.280
 well and even if I want to do 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:12.649
 friend pretty good and good because this is 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.649
 the light pink clarito clarito 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.590
 Y 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.540
 pigments well but little 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.629
 and still a little bit because I'm also 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.629
 seeing 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.150
 but good 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.950
 and even what I do is that it did not fill 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.050
 the whole brush but I take a little 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.750
 more on one side than on the other then 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.690
 although you see me doing so really 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.010
 I'm controlling a little and good and the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.530
 another color that I have 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.230
 and as you see this one is basando used and 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.599
 this one is very little the truth is that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:04.590
 the tone I do not know if you see him the dan of the year 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:07.630
 that this is a lot more pink 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.670
 powdered is a pretty similar color 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.400
 it's not that you see it badly on the camera 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.440
 nothing is a pretty clear tone because I 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.630
 I wanted them quite clear because the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.330
 I wanted for every day 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.910
 but 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.680
 this new great and this new regulate 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.480
 we regulate especially for even if you have a 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.470
 anti Nazi villa such and have an effect 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.170
 very different from what I thought 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.690
 the problem with this is what pigment 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.830
 little bit 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.010
 is more if you see the brush this is almost not what 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.010
 I have used 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.590
 and I have the brush done disgusting this one 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.590
 very good for people who like it 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.240
 use a little bit only that you owe a 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.550
 little blush but very little and I 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.520
 I like it quite marked because in plain sight 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.100
 I even put it on today before when 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.920
 He started making the video to give it 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.210
 a bit of use as you see almost you see me 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.690
 a little because he had put the big 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.360
 lion but very little this is the typical 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.160
 you wear when you do not when you do not wear anything 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.079
 or make-up you just want a 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.060
 little color will do as now as you 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.660
 put some makeup on you 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.790
 put on top and I practically do not 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.110
 I notice then well this is my little 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.140
 review 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.020
 I personally dandee the I 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.629
 I recommend enough to 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.419
 for people who have the complexion 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.580
 pretty clear how is mine because it is 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.639
 the typical blusher that gives you good color 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.460
 You do not see the typical rouge on your face 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.129
 that there are gods or supposed there 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.129
 this is the the little touch that all 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:52.970
 we need and this is more like a 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:55.340
 little the same but what are the 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.139
 that you like pretty little marked and I 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.080
 for example with the down of the year that 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.120
 I want more I wear more I want less 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.580
 I put like a little but with this is that 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.500
 I have myself in a pile to be noticed 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.300
 so this one I at least do not 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.530
 I recommend good, now I'm going to do 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.659
 I'm going to do a very small one 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.659
 our video come a kiss see you later
