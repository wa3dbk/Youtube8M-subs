00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
center part of our brain that lights up

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
when that lights up it is on alert

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.640 
when that lights up it is on alert
that's<00:02:50.640> what<00:02:50.940> saves<00:02:51.300> us<00:02:51.510> from<00:02:51.570> lions<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:52.470> now

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
that's what saves us from lions but now

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.970 
that's what saves us from lions but now
we<00:02:52.710> don't<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.160> lions<00:02:53.550> any<00:02:53.970> longer<00:02:54.860> we<00:02:55.860> have

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
we don't have lions any longer we have

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.190 
we don't have lions any longer we have
different<00:02:56.490> demons<00:02:56.700> these<00:02:57.480> children's<00:02:57.990> dæmons

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
different demons these children's dæmons

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.360 
different demons these children's dæmons
are<00:02:58.560> psychological<00:02:59.400> we<00:03:00.210> can't<00:03:00.480> see<00:03:00.780> them<00:03:01.370> but

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
are psychological we can't see them but

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.450 
are psychological we can't see them but
what<00:03:02.520> happens<00:03:02.910> when<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.240> breathe<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:04.050> you

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
what happens when you breathe and you

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.630 
what happens when you breathe and you
focus<00:03:05.460> on<00:03:05.610> sound<00:03:06.260> suddenly<00:03:07.260> magically<00:03:07.890> the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
focus on sound suddenly magically the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.240 
focus on sound suddenly magically the
brain<00:03:08.940> responds<00:03:10.070> physiologically<00:03:11.070> and

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
brain responds physiologically and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.390 
brain responds physiologically and
neurologically<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:13.290> what<00:03:13.440> happens<00:03:13.800> is<00:03:14.010> it

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
neurologically so what happens is it

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.420 
neurologically so what happens is it
quiets<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.420> amygdala<00:03:15.900> when<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.800> amygdala

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
quiets the amygdala when that amygdala

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.630 
quiets the amygdala when that amygdala
quiets<00:03:17.820> down<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.240> an<00:03:18.360> fMRI<00:03:19.430> dopamine<00:03:20.430> get

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
quiets down in an fMRI dopamine get

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.350 
quiets down in an fMRI dopamine get
submitted<00:03:21.000> dopamine<00:03:21.690> makes<00:03:21.960> you<00:03:22.710> feel<00:03:22.950> better

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
submitted dopamine makes you feel better

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.150 
submitted dopamine makes you feel better
it's<00:03:24.360> one<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.630> those<00:03:24.750> wonderful

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
it's one of those wonderful

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.940 
it's one of those wonderful
neurotransmitters<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.340> just<00:03:26.550> goes<00:03:26.760> huh<00:03:27.950> when

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
neurotransmitters it just goes huh when

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.340 
neurotransmitters it just goes huh when
that<00:03:29.070> happens<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.180> prefrontal<00:03:30.660> cortex

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
that happens the prefrontal cortex

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.380 
that happens the prefrontal cortex
lights<00:03:31.650> up<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.160> that's<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.580> new<00:03:32.850> brain<00:03:33.120> and

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
lights up and that's the new brain and

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.300 
lights up and that's the new brain and
that's<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.810> brain<00:03:34.050> that<00:03:34.260> our<00:03:34.350> children<00:03:34.650> need

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
that's the brain that our children need

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.850 
that's the brain that our children need
to<00:03:35.580> have<00:03:35.760> lit<00:03:36.030> up<00:03:36.440> because<00:03:37.440> then<00:03:37.650> they're

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
to have lit up because then they're

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.300 
to have lit up because then they're
ready<00:03:38.070> for<00:03:38.160> learning<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.840> when<00:03:40.770> a<00:03:40.800> child<00:03:41.220> comes

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
ready for learning so when a child comes

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.210 
ready for learning so when a child comes
into<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.850> room<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.240> Mort<00:03:42.750> said<00:03:43.020> so<00:03:43.380> clearly<00:03:43.860> I

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
into the room and Mort said so clearly I

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.320 
into the room and Mort said so clearly I
was<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.940> dancer<00:03:45.270> I<00:03:45.780> am<00:03:46.440> still<00:03:46.740> a<00:03:46.800> dancer<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.580> have

nothing has taught me more than

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.199 
nothing has taught me more than
preparing<00:03:53.850> for<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.750> pirouette<00:03:55.640> preparing<00:03:56.640> for

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
a jump preparing to go on stage you pull

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.480 
a jump preparing to go on stage you pull
everything<00:04:00.990> in<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:02.340> focus<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.209> off<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.290> go
