00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.710
 under almost ideal conditions 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.710
 psv are preparing for the today 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.210
 topper against vitesse Saturday evening 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.740
 Dick Lawyer The trainer had one 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.570
 reassuring thought all 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.120
 internationals are fresh and fruity 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.980
 return of international obligations 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.960
 only the mattress there is something about it 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.310
 hand the only one who cause some problem 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.730
 yesterday was mattress 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.350
 they just link ankle right ankle 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.090
 to train roads so that should not be 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.470
 problem you can be the strongest 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.990
 play setup against vitesse 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 we play in the strongest line-up that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.760
 7 0 from last week that gives one 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.380
 very good feeling I think it was not 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.110
 only the 700 piece to know for too 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.090
 against against Heracles feyenoord 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.500
 so call show if they are champions 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.460
 want to be that these are the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.440
 matches 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.420
 that is also must stand and then is vertez 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.950
 a lot of empty opponent in the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.500
 home game of psv against vitesse 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.670
 made decisive by the polydor 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.010
 hit in favor of the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.530
 arnhemmers afterwards find ivory 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.000
 play exactly in the africa cup 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.090
 time back in Arnhem 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.830
 to participate in bullying yes guys 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.810
 that is a certain player meant for 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.330
 not that hard to redo so rather 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.490
 goes another week longer and what we got there 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 We note okay minister wants you play and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.740
 We must ensure that we do so well 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.780
 possible to play against so I got to see it 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.409
 what positive cores what today what for 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.850
 match do you expect yes it wouldn't 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.189
 so far are kind of like home so that we 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.900
 got many chances and not minutes 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.430
 also received a number of calls and the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.470
 made two boxes so let's worry 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.490
 that the time is different under you play against 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.710
 this kind of plowing might be something 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.329
 checked for example busy jan 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.920
 you would do to other away games 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.790
 no, because we have the team that go 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.060
 want for it 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.650
 we always play organized and we 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.510
 have to make sure that few chance that 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.640
 Everyone gets that it is hoped 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.020
 that is most important 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.120
 and where vitesse can have 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.160
 boni side psv still don't have it 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.510
 about ola toivonen 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.070
 he was injured last year 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.300
 his hamstring but can already be done 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.250
 nice training again 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.120
 how long do dick lawyer think on paper 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.680
 must miss I myself do not know three four 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.000
 soaking on and on 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.540
 for one in the course of March 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.550
 times yes there should rather be some sense there 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.560
 first back to sweden and to as 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.060
 he can almost play the violin like that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.430
 basically you have 4 and none of them 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.080
 so played Lombard but he is entering now 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.890
 from January 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.420
 yes it would rather not be true ola toivonen 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.340
 just sit in the waiting room let jetro 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.080
 willems all the way back 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.959
 because Willem hit last December 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.670
 seriously injured for years and is fairly fast 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.170
 restored again what exactly does it go 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.410
 for injury 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.140
 yes i am a peso but only a single 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.209
 assemble but shaken off but glad I 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.680
 again the can play football 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.050
 difficult time not to play football 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.690
 just rehabilitate for sure 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.700
 usher competitions must go to churches 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.459
 over and over again how does your team 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.260
 saw they did it nice so then you are 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.100
 happy but yes so want it yourself 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.390
 stand 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.500
 that undoubtedly also applies to his 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.180
 place in the Dutch national team 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.310
 jetro willems last wednesday evening 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.780
 looked at the Netherlands Italy 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.299
 at home on the couch while he just had 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.360
 have to play yes they have it whole 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.660
 well done and 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.310
 and as massive expected them 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.070
 it would not do well because yes it is 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.560
 a very big country 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.750
 compared to the Netherlands and those players 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.820
 even they find it done 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.110
 I don't think so of you 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.880
 I should have already assisted if I had that 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.320
 had not had an injury then I had there 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.510
 just played along 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.730
 yes that could but the so can you about 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.790
 think everything and say what you want 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.810
 but will be fine does not make much sense 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.150
 to think so 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.320
 that's why you sometimes have yourself 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.940
 pinched what you it 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.570
 all happened to over the past year 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.459
 what 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.620
 what am I all experiencing from debuting 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.020
 psv to the ek camera 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.250
 Dutch team to be sure there 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.780
 of course 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.700
 return to time goal fast it is 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.709
 gone from sparta-psv of course that 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:00.650
 just going pretty fast and sometimes lying 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:04.070
 that bath and edgar of yes anyway it is 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.320
 hallway and watched him with a joyful 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.300
 face and then for the same money 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.950
 Erik Pieters does not get injured and injured 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.150
 you play a whole season young psv what 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.250
 it may be the other way 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.540
 yes it could but that happens 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.489
 not and therefore play jetro willems 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.320
 Saturday night judgments and fiftieth 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.260
 competition match in the stadium where 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.780
 PSV also debuted the gelredome what 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.490
 expected that Saturday before competition 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.930
 of course and yet there was one 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.690
 at the top along with everything and we also one 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.250
 think it may have been easy 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.060
 It might be easier to vitesse out 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.280
 to play then vita you would see at home 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.570
 at toppers 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.570
 but don't think so much out of this 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.340
 home game to us a strange one 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.620
 match terribly many chances not there 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.289
 and they two chance it wraps yes 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.190
 I had to abandon it from the outside 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.600
 and 2b truer allee yes behold 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.630
 say 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.740
 chances where you didn't finish the 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.740
 and then we come back three games 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.479
 each other vitesse from utrecht home 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.860
 Feyenoord and choose three 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.380
 matches could be in than mine 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.030
 well on the way to maybe 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.710
 something very beautiful at the end 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.340
 yes so far should still try to look 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.870
 looked at last season like that 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.090
 we also continued to look at normal 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.889
 anyway it didn't matter to me either 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.030
 sometimes watch a laptop competition 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.930
 and then it will be fine 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.930
 I have to trust
