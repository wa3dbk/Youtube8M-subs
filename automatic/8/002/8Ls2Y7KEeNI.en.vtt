about like you know using that for the

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.030 
about like you know using that for the
five<00:03:38.030> years<00:03:38.330> of<00:03:38.390> my<00:03:38.570> traveling<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:39.530> teaching

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
five years of my traveling and teaching

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.460 
five years of my traveling and teaching
and<00:03:40.190> choreographing<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:41.230> said<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.350> my

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
and choreographing I said to my

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.130 
and choreographing I said to my
dermatologist<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:43.280> said<00:03:43.549> I've<00:03:44.000> never<00:03:44.360> had<00:03:44.720> dark

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
dermatologist I said I've never had dark

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.509 
dermatologist I said I've never had dark
circles<00:03:45.500> like<00:03:45.620> this<00:03:45.739> before<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.250> she<00:03:46.340> said

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
circles like this before and she said

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.130 
circles like this before and she said
well<00:03:46.670> that's<00:03:46.790> because<00:03:47.060> steroid<00:03:47.750> cream

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
well that's because steroid cream

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.140 
well that's because steroid cream
deteriorates<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.100> first<00:03:49.489> layer<00:03:49.790> of<00:03:49.820> your

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.880 
deteriorates the first layer of your
skin<00:03:50.209> well<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.230> leaves<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:52.480> unprotected<00:03:53.890> so

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
skin well and leaves you unprotected so

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.039 
skin well and leaves you unprotected so
you<00:03:55.579> will<00:03:56.180> probably<00:03:56.390> have<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.660> deal<00:03:56.840> with<00:03:56.870> the

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
you will probably have to deal with the
