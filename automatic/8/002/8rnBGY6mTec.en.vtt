00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 ic 2126 when we agreed software 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.490
 training ground for these tests 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.679
 there was a question about what will be needed 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.490
 be responsible for life and 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.769
 health 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.199
 no man but it's dummy 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.359
 who sits behind the wheel the thing is that 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.369
 experts pretty feared that he 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.340
 maybe this mannequin is great 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.599
 damaged and by the way it costs more 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.769
 a hundred thousand dollars but we decided that 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.140
 information we get to us 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.290
 especially our readers our viewers 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.770
 very important and so we went to this 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.770
 experiment 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.390
 admit even well-worn 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.170
 passive safety specialists 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.969
 were shocked 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.920
 what happened in a foreign language 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.660
 expert euron what is called full 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.340
 loss of structural integrity of the body 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.110
 the left side of the chuck has turned 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.030
 shapeless pile of metal as much 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.890
 windshield on ice vertical 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.690
 the positions of the diver's opening became 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 the rectangular driver dummy turned out 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.640
 sandwiched between the seats and the front panel 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.470
 rather its remnants at a rate of 10 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.310
 centimeters steering back almost to 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.170
 twenty five 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.330
 another 10 centimeters, he went up 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.250
 just as left and when opened with a crowbar 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.050
 driver's door then they saw that the place 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.759
 almost no driver left 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.530
 the wheel about me pawed so much 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.970
 it turned out in the cabin meanwhile one of 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.560
 key passive indicators 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.300
 safety so-called coefficient 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.190
 head injury probabilities 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.960
 English it sounds like becoming a fig 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.509
 criteria or abbreviated fib 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.729
 amounted to 600 40 units although dangerous 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.920
 the critical value is 1000 units 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.210
 it means everything is not so bad alas 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.580
 that these are relatively small 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 overloads acted on the head which 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.420
 already barely rested on the torso of the neck 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.550
 broken because the steering wheel continues 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.320
 move inside the cabin holding my head 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.770
 on at this time the body was inertia 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.049
 forward 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.670
 Let's call a spade a spade with a huge 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.710
 probably a similar accident 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.570
 will lead to the death of the driver zone 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.979
 the men are marked in red 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.259
 subjected to extreme loads 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.369
 why such a terrible result in 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.350
 first body hedgehog 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.420
 from the blow just burst on the welds 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.340
 like a shirt of rotten cloth sewn such 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.230
 same rotten metal threads 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.940
 spot welding vomited with meat for 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.920
 welding points on the body might be 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.110
 more but there is and secondly it is not only 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.299
 a matter of quality but I am a design which 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.739
 requires a very serious revision from the point 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.360
 view of plant passive safety 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.530
 need in the shortest possible time to make 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.900
 major changes 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.780
 otherwise because of the 126 will be called not 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.100
 galvanized and rated by center 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.500
 security defranco 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.250
 code scored only babolat of 16 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.080
 the possible 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.170
 by modern standards it is nowhere 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.170
 good
