as I've said that doesn't have too many

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.950 
as I've said that doesn't have too many
cards<00:03:38.120> for<00:03:38.240> example<00:03:38.480> go<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:38.630> little<00:03:38.810> bit

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
cards for example go a little bit

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.450 
cards for example go a little bit
further<00:03:39.170> back<00:03:39.290> in<00:03:39.470> teammate<00:03:39.650> week<00:03:39.890> see<00:03:40.340> if<00:03:40.400> you

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
further back in teammate week see if you

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.920 
further back in teammate week see if you
can<00:03:40.580> for<00:03:40.670> example<00:03:40.700> fire<00:03:41.120> random<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.570> from<00:03:41.750> from

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
can for example fire random in from from

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.660 
can for example fire random in from from
this<00:03:42.050> team<00:03:42.230> of<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.410> week<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.709> ass<00:03:43.370> against
