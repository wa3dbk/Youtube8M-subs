from<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.380> know<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.550> it's<00:02:15.670> not<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:15.970> much

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
from it you know so it's not so much

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.640 
from it you know so it's not so much
that<00:02:16.270> it's<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.510> different<00:02:16.750> shape<00:02:17.200> than<00:02:17.230> what

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
that it's a different shape than what

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.550

still<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:22.000> still<00:02:22.630> gives<00:02:23.380> me<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.650> length<00:02:24.240> so

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240
