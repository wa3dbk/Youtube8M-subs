00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
have to set it up right and it has to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.370 
have to set it up right and it has to
make<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.860> look<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.520> not<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> setup<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.840> he

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
make it look like it's not a setup so he

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.219 
make it look like it's not a setup so he
puts<00:01:25.619> me<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.860> check<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:27.930> actually

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
puts me in check and this was actually

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.950 
puts me in check and this was actually
the<00:01:28.350> perfect<00:01:28.560> situation<00:01:29.000> because<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.810> had

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the perfect situation because if I had

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.740 
the perfect situation because if I had
moved<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.939> he<00:01:33.180> would've<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.540> took

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
moved here then he would've just took

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.710 
moved here then he would've just took
his<00:01:33.930> rook<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:35.369> check<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> had

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
his rook there check and then out I had

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
his rook there check and then out I had
to<00:01:36.840> move<00:01:37.020> within<00:01:37.290> these<00:01:37.530> rook<00:01:37.799> would<00:01:38.040> have

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
to move within these rook would have

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.039 
to move within these rook would have
snatched<00:01:38.369> my<00:01:38.520> queen<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.689> made<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
snatched my queen so this made it a

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.080 
snatched my queen so this made it a
perfect<00:01:40.560> position<00:01:40.680> for<00:01:41.130> me<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> King

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
perfect position for me to get the King

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
perfect position for me to get the King
