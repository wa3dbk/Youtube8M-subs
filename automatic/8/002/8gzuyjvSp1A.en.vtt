00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
stumbling trying to accelerate and it's

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.389 
stumbling trying to accelerate and it's
been<00:01:35.530> said<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.920> can<00:01:36.009> raise<00:01:36.280> the

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
been said that you can raise the

been said that you can raise the
metering<00:01:36.909> level<00:01:37.329> now<00:01:37.630> mine<00:01:37.959> seems<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.039> be<00:01:39.220> at

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
metering level now mine seems to be at

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.139 
metering level now mine seems to be at
the<00:01:39.940> right<00:01:40.060> height<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.159> have<00:01:42.429> not<00:01:42.670> have<00:01:42.909> any

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
the right height but I have not have any

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.550 
the right height but I have not have any
issue<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.819> stammering<00:01:46.360> at<00:01:46.630> idle<00:01:47.049> going

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
issue with the stammering at idle going

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.949 
issue with the stammering at idle going
the<00:01:47.619> full<00:01:47.799> throttle<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.850> muffler<00:01:49.479> mod<00:01:49.659> I<00:01:49.689> did

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
the full throttle the muffler mod I did

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.410 
the full throttle the muffler mod I did
on<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.289> one<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.709> different<00:01:50.890> than<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.280> 555<00:01:52.000> I

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
on this one is different than the 555 I

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.770 
on this one is different than the 555 I
I<00:01:53.170> split<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.619> 555<00:01:54.369> in<00:01:54.670> half<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.360> took<00:01:55.479> all<00:01:55.630> the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
I split the 555 in half and took all the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.740 
I split the 555 in half and took all the
baffles<00:01:55.929> out<00:01:56.319> but<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.590> made<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.770> really<00:01:57.069> loud

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
baffles out but it made it really loud

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.609 
baffles out but it made it really loud
and<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:59.080> one<00:01:59.349> I<00:01:59.590> just<00:02:00.580> opened<00:02:01.209> up<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
and this one I just opened up the

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.910 
and this one I just opened up the
entrance<00:02:03.039> past<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.179> baffle<00:02:04.630> left<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.740> lower

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
entrance past the baffle left the lower

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.420 
entrance past the baffle left the lower
baffle<00:02:06.459> in<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:09.509> basically<00:02:10.980> just<00:02:11.980> put<00:02:12.190> another

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
baffle in and basically just put another

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.310 
baffle in and basically just put another
port<00:02:13.650> underneath<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.769> deflector<00:02:15.370> itself<00:02:16.320> not

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
port underneath the deflector itself not

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.890 
port underneath the deflector itself not
my<00:02:17.500> favorite<00:02:17.890> way<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.070> do<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.459> but<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.750> was

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
my favorite way to do it but it was

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.920 
my favorite way to do it but it was
effective<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.359> can<00:02:22.510> still<00:02:22.720> put<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
effective and you can still put the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.430 
effective and you can still put the
screen<00:02:23.170> back<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.799> if<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.640> need<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:24.880> do

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
screen back in it if you need to do

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.449 
screen back in it if you need to do
sounds<00:02:26.440> pretty<00:02:26.680> good<00:02:26.829> but<00:02:26.890> not<00:02:27.250> overly<00:02:27.609> loud<00:02:27.910> a

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.560 

little<00:02:33.459> bit<00:02:33.579> of<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.730> look<00:02:33.910> at<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> intake

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.060 

very<00:02:39.570> clean<00:02:39.930> mole<00:02:40.770> but<00:02:40.950> nice<00:02:42.620> that's<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.830> we'll

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
very clean mole but nice that's it we'll

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.170 
very clean mole but nice that's it we'll
see<00:02:44.250> what<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.460> can<00:02:44.580> get<00:02:44.640> out<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:45.030> without

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
see what we can get out of it without

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.110 
see what we can get out of it without
going<00:02:45.510> too<00:02:45.750> extreme
