00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 but 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.800
 our eyes begin to heal as of the age of 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.929
 15 years old and yes it's early then to be 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.670
 sure to save them in the summer it takes 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.139
 wear sunglasses but not 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.600
 any because there is 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.640
 several levels of protection 2 0 which 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.140
 protects from nothing at all to 4 for 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.670
 mountain hikes then the 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.430
 most common protection category 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.439
 for summer it's category 3 then there 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.349
 you actually have the mark this 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.029
 and the category of protection well ben that 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.430
 actually this is what is asked of 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.890
 minima worry about these labels 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.230
 attached or small stickers like 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.879
 like this one for example it's 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.680
 do not have him come off and who gets 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.270
 pose very easily is that we do not have 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.989
 the certainty that these are real 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.149
 label 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.949
 there we have quite the case of 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.930
 the indication which is sure the branch of 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.680
 the mount so we can be almost 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.870
 certain to say at 99% chance that the 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.460
 bezel is actually compliant for 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.500
 the placing on the European market 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.910
 so we wanted to compare our pairs of 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.620
 glasses bought in different points 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.480
 in order to find out if they are 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.970
 also protect against uv 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.680
 and for that we need a pro and a 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.300
 pau device is that like that to 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.370
 the un we can see in fact it leaves 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.750
 to pass the uv or not we need this 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.250
 device that will allow us to 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.780
 know the transmission rate in 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.540
 does so thanks to this passion 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.490
 we will position see the green on this 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.220
 little picot and we know where we will know 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.970
 what is the quantity of filtered down 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.970
 here we go 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.780
 So here it is 100% of uv 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.100
 no problem with our pair of 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.680
 luxury glasses bought at a 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.930
 optician at over 200 euros as well as 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.210
 with the trendy brand bought 120 euros 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.800
 in an optician also we continue 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.990
 so with the pair pay five times less 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.520
 expensive in the supermarket you know the place 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.900
 where some opticians told us not to 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.350
 especially not buy our glasses 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.900
 this one also this season then 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.340
 protected winner for on arrival he does 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.080
 remains to test our two pairs 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.770
 nice range on which we would not have 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.560
 bet a kopeck and this one is the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.750
 first and last is the one on 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.630
 six axes and also so there are my 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.899
 sincere or who go of the blow I can 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.390
 tell you it is 7 to 250 euros 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.160
 yeah we have the same protection against 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.990
 uv exactly you are protected from the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.360
 same way against uv but that's it 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.460
 you surprise his results not these 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.610
 results do not surprise me in fact 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.610
 all 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.080
