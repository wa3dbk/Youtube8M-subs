00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.850
 Mike Chen and the mysterious science program. 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.650
 Do you like Jurassic Park movies? 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.720
 I watched it again and again for 8 times 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.570
 Have you ever watched a movie again and again? Today no one will do it! 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.600
 Now no matter how much I like it, I don't watch it twice. 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.950
 I will never spend money watching movies 7 to 8 times as before ... 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.910
 Do you hesitate to spend money? 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.510
 I like Jurassic Park because I really like dinosaurs! 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.310
 I like interesting things that I've never seen before. 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.620
 For example, if I hear people talking about extinct animals, I think of the Dodo bird. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.550
 Their names are really funny. 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.600
 So what if I told you, maybe the supposedly extinct species still exist? 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.770
 Here are five species that are thought to be extinct but may still exist in the world. 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.510
 Number 1: Thylacine 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.780
 Thylacine is a half-tiger and half-dog animal, thought to be extinct in 1936. 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.250
 They are also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, or the Greek pocketed dog. 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:23.400
 At the end of 2013, a group of British naturalists explored Tasmania's wilderness, where there were virtually no people. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:39.730
 Although no pictures can be taken with their cameras, researchers believe there are still some individuals that survive. They rely on reliable sources and collect some samples that are believed to be Thylacine feces for DNA analysis. 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.660
 Number 2 is the passenger pigeon 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:54.530
 The passenger pigeon was the most numerous bird in the planet in the 19th century, but it was extinct in the early 20th century due to hunting and habitat loss. 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.030
 Passenger pigeon is one of the animals that can be revived by cloning. 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:09.640
 The Long Now Foundation is funding a project to revitalize the passenger pigeon. 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.910
 Oh my God! Whenever people want to revive an animal, I think of the first part of the zombie movie. 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.750
 What's worse is a pigeon on the head? 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.650
 Zombie pigeons on the head! 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.490
 It is possible that some individual pigeons still exist, according to some bird watchers. 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.300
 However, since no reports have been confirmed, the scientific community agreed that they were extinct. 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.430
 Number 3: Wolf Honshu 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.380
 The Japanese wolf, which once dominated the Japanese islands of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, is the smallest known wolf in the world. 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.380
 Their numbers began to decline in 1732 when rabies broke out for the first time in Kyushu and Shikoku. 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.520
 Despite being declared extinct in 1905, a photo shows an individual surviving in 1910. 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:06.430
 It is possible that Honshu wolves still exist, based on numerous witness statements, photos and reports of the animal's body. 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.100
 Number 4 is a dinosaur called Mokele-mbembe. 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.610
 That means the animal can block a river. 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.710
 This legendary creature is thought to have lived deep in the Congo Basin of Central Africa. 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:29.420
 William Gibbons, an explorer, a doctor of anthropology at the Warnborough School of Oxford University, has conducted expeditions into the deep of the Congo River basin. 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:42.030
 Gibbons met Pastor Eugene P. Thomas, who told him about the Pygmy tribe, an indigenous tribe settled near Lake Tele. They killed a Mokele-Mbembe in 1959. 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.010
 He said the Aboriginal people recalled that they had encountered a Mokele-Mbembe herd. They killed one of them, and it took several days to cut meat. 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.280
 40% of tropical forests in the world have never been discovered by humans! Does this species still exist? 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.380
 Maybe it is. 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:06.890
 The last species is the giant mammoth. They lived at the same time as the ancient humans about 200,000 years ago on Eurasia and North America. 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:15.730
 Due to hunting and climate change, the last known individual died in Siberia nearly 10,000 years ago. 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:23.710
 However, mammoth populations live separately on Wrangel Island in the North Sea until 4,000 years ago. 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:32.550
 This leads to the possibility of a number of bodies in the remote wilderness of Siberia, where humans cannot yet discover. 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.790
 So what do you think about these five extinct animals? 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.600
 Let us know your opinion. Should we revive them and build Jurassic Park? 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.770
 Thanks for watching the show. See you again!
