I<00:00:41.870> was<00:00:42.800> awesome<00:00:43.130> I<00:00:43.280> think<00:00:43.610> I<00:00:43.820> definitely<00:00:43.970> get

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
I was awesome I think I definitely get

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.180 
I was awesome I think I definitely get
my<00:00:44.420> team<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.660> boost<00:00:44.900> to<00:00:45.170> start<00:00:45.410> off<00:00:45.530> whenever

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
my team a boost to start off whenever

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.770 
my team a boost to start off whenever
whenever<00:00:46.520> you're<00:00:47.030> able<00:00:47.060> to<00:00:47.270> get<00:00:47.390> up<00:00:47.480> a<00:00:47.600> goal

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
whenever you're able to get up a goal

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.750 
whenever you're able to get up a goal
early<00:00:48.110> on<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.260> team<00:00:48.950> like<00:00:49.100> that<00:00:49.160> I<00:00:49.340> think<00:00:49.430> it

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
early on a team like that I think it

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.190 
early on a team like that I think it
does<00:00:49.940> wonders<00:00:50.480> for<00:00:50.630> your<00:00:50.780> team's<00:00:50.960> confidence

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
so I think we were able to kind of play

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.340 
so I think we were able to kind of play
off<00:00:53.240> for<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.420> first<00:00:53.450> goal<00:00:53.810> when<00:00:53.930> able<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.200> come

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
off for the first goal when able to come

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.530 
off for the first goal when able to come
out<00:00:54.470> of<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.620> first<00:00:54.800> half<00:00:54.980> 10<00:00:55.460> up<00:00:55.580> so<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:56.210> was

after<00:01:48.289> that<00:01:48.530> game<00:01:48.740> terrible<00:01:49.550> conditions<00:01:50.060> turn

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
after that game terrible conditions turn

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.779 
after that game terrible conditions turn
across<00:01:51.350> half<00:01:51.679> is<00:01:51.860> too<00:01:52.250> hot<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:55.520> work

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
across half is too hot and that work

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.700 
across half is too hot and that work
hard<00:01:56.000> for<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.330> victory<00:01:56.600> think<00:01:57.470> once<00:01:57.649> we

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
hard for the victory think once we

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:09.490 
hard for the victory think once we
equalize

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.300 

we'd<00:02:10.100> always<00:02:10.280> be<00:02:10.460> behind<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:11.830> we<00:02:12.830> find

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
we'd always be behind and we find

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.750 
we'd always be behind and we find
ourselves<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.820> insulation<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.960> lot<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.410> things

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
ourselves in insulation a lot of things

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.100 
ourselves in insulation a lot of things
requires<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.000> patient's<00:02:18.250> short<00:02:19.250> kitchens<00:02:20.110> we

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
requires the patient's short kitchens we

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.340 
requires the patient's short kitchens we
don't<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:22.720> display<00:02:23.720> them<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.880> hopefully

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
don't I display them and hopefully

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.750 
don't I display them and hopefully
eventually<00:02:27.350> create<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.010> chance<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.550> eight

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
eventually create a chance of eight

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.990 
eventually create a chance of eight
chances<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.300> get<00:02:29.810> any<00:02:30.290> game<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.130> still<00:02:31.340> in

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
chances to get any game so we still in

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.880

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
we win the last two games we made a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.910 
we win the last two games we made a
competitive<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:41.120> know<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:42.739> wanted

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
competitive and you know I so I wanted

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.770 
competitive and you know I so I wanted
to<00:02:43.160> see<00:02:43.400> from<00:02:43.520> our<00:02:43.730> guys<00:02:43.940> which<00:02:44.180> was<00:02:44.360> good<00:02:44.570> and

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
to see from our guys which was good and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.590 
to see from our guys which was good and
I<00:02:45.140> think<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.500> fans<00:02:45.880> also<00:02:46.880> enjoyed<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.420> game

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
I think the fans also enjoyed the game

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.050 
I think the fans also enjoyed the game
because<00:02:47.989> they<00:02:48.950> got<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.250> see<00:02:49.400> some<00:02:49.430> world-class

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
because they got to see some world-class

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.870 
because they got to see some world-class
players<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:51.830> thought<00:02:52.220> all<00:02:52.340> around<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.790> was

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
players and I thought all around it was

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.040 
players and I thought all around it was
very<00:02:53.060> positive<00:02:53.830> sport<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.890> soccer
