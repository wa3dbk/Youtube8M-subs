right here as you see it's not

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.890 
right here as you see it's not
completely<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> ground<00:02:30.000> sometimes<00:02:30.600> he'll

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
completely on the ground sometimes he'll

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.990 
completely on the ground sometimes he'll
go<00:02:31.140> back<00:02:31.290> up<00:02:31.530> as<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:31.890> see<00:02:32.070> right<00:02:32.100> there<00:02:32.430> so

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
is I just put the bulldozer sort of on

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.640 
is I just put the bulldozer sort of on
it<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:38.880> kind<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.540> clamp<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:40.140> down<00:02:40.170> to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
it and like kind of clamp it down to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.640 
it and like kind of clamp it down to
make<00:02:40.830> sure<00:02:41.180> now<00:02:42.180> like<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.840> said<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.290> be

make sure now like I said just be

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.110 
make sure now like I said just be
careful<00:02:44.040> though<00:02:44.070> because<00:02:44.310> we've<00:02:44.670> done<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.060> a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
careful though because we've done this a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.880 
careful though because we've done this a
couple<00:02:45.480> times<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.020> know<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.470> hit<00:02:46.740> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
couple times and you know you hit the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.380 
couple times and you know you hit the
plane<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.130> certain<00:02:47.520> way<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.970> thing<00:02:48.120> blows

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
plane a certain way and and thing blows

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.900 
plane a certain way and and thing blows
up<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.500> just<00:02:49.530> got<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.950> be<00:02:50.040> careful<00:02:50.220> but

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
because one time we had it's where it

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.110 
because one time we had it's where it
was<00:03:00.960> open<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.350> my<00:03:01.560> screen<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:02.310> on<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.730> person

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
was open on my screen but on the person

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.700 
was open on my screen but on the person
you<00:03:03.270> know<00:03:03.360> flying<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.750> plane<00:03:03.960> it<00:03:04.200> wasn't<00:03:04.560> open

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
you know flying the plane it wasn't open

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.880 
you know flying the plane it wasn't open
and<00:03:05.070> when<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:05.970> drove<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.630> there<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.170> glitched

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
and when I drove in there it glitched

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.400 
and when I drove in there it glitched
out<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.520> then<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.480> know<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.690> blew<00:03:09.870> up<00:03:10.080> because

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
out and then you know it blew up because

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.260 
out and then you know it blew up because
on<00:03:10.590> his<00:03:10.800> screen<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.370> was<00:03:11.520> just<00:03:11.670> driving<00:03:11.850> into

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
on his screen I was just driving into

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.690 
on his screen I was just driving into
the<00:03:12.480> plane<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.020> just<00:03:13.560> be<00:03:13.680> careful<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:14.580> is

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the plane so just be careful but this is

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.980 
the plane so just be careful but this is
pretty<00:03:14.910> cool<00:03:15.120> because<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.540> know<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:15.690> can

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
pretty cool because you know you can

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.230 
pretty cool because you know you can
take<00:03:16.230> off<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.590> what's<00:03:16.740> awesome<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.940> seems

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
take off and what's awesome it seems

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.820 
take off and what's awesome it seems
like<00:03:18.390> about<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.750> cargo<00:03:19.140> plane<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.530> once

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
like about the cargo plane is that once

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.650 
like about the cargo plane is that once
you<00:03:19.950> get<00:03:20.100> in<00:03:20.190> here<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:21.060> almost<00:03:21.330> seems<00:03:21.570> like

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
you get in here it almost seems like

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.440 
you get in here it almost seems like
when<00:03:21.930> you're<00:03:22.050> flying<00:03:22.380> there's<00:03:22.860> no<00:03:23.100> like<00:03:23.450> in

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
when you're flying there's no like in

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.970 
when you're flying there's no like in
the<00:03:24.600> back<00:03:24.780> like<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.230> don't<00:03:25.380> even<00:03:25.440> notice<00:03:25.740> it

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
the back like you don't even notice it

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.980 
the back like you don't even notice it
really<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.760> know<00:03:26.850> for<00:03:27.030> example<00:03:27.120> when<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.780> get

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
really you know for example when you get

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.140 
really you know for example when you get
into<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.440> ec130<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.280> know<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.460> cars<00:03:29.730> flying

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
into the ec130 you know the cars flying

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.840 
into the ec130 you know the cars flying
around<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.720> stuff<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:30.990> that<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:31.920> here<00:03:32.340> you

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
around and stuff like that but here you

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.760 
around and stuff like that but here you
know<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.360> walk<00:03:33.720> around<00:03:33.930> drive<00:03:34.440> around

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
know you can walk around drive around

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.280 
know you can walk around drive around
pretty<00:03:35.010> cool<00:03:35.250> although<00:03:35.520> I<00:03:35.970> will<00:03:36.360> say<00:03:36.600> we

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
pretty cool although I will say we

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.330 
pretty cool although I will say we
should<00:03:37.470> have<00:03:37.500> done<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:37.860> with<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.010> hearse

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
should have done it with the hearse

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.430 
should have done it with the hearse
because<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:39.030> hearse<00:03:39.300> actually<00:03:40.110> wind<00:03:40.320> up

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
because the hearse actually wind up

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.710 
because the hearse actually wind up
flying<00:03:40.860> out<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.220> back<00:03:41.430> because<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:42.630> know

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
flying out of the back because you know

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.060 
flying out of the back because you know
when<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.930> take<00:03:43.080> off<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.440> got<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.650> get<00:03:43.770> an

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
when you take off you got to get an

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.430 
when you take off you got to get an
angle<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:45.300> hearse<00:03:45.510> cannot<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.320> know

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
angle and the hearse cannot you know

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.110 
angle and the hearse cannot you know
doesn't<00:03:46.710> have<00:03:46.770> enough<00:03:46.950> horsepower<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.760> stay

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
doesn't have enough horsepower to stay

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.600 
doesn't have enough horsepower to stay
in<00:03:48.600> here<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.020> it<00:03:49.590> went<00:03:49.800> backwards<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.460> know<00:03:50.520> I

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
in here so it went backwards you know I

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.100 
in here so it went backwards you know I
would<00:03:50.760> suggest<00:03:51.030> doing<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.600> with<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> cheetah

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
would suggest doing it with the cheetah

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.900 
would suggest doing it with the cheetah
because<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.500> cheetah<00:03:52.710> obviously<00:03:53.220> it's

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
because the cheetah obviously it's

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.310 
because the cheetah obviously it's
probably<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.210> better<00:03:54.300> car<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.840> do<00:03:54.960> this<00:03:55.110> with

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
probably a better car to do this with

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.260 
probably a better car to do this with
but<00:03:55.770> it's<00:03:56.070> still<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.280> pretty<00:03:56.520> cool<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:57.240> know

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
but it's still a pretty cool you know

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.200 
but it's still a pretty cool you know
little<00:03:57.600> fun<00:03:58.080> thing<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.350> do<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:59.640> know<00:03:59.760> what

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
little fun thing to do and you know what

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.700 
little fun thing to do and you know what
we<00:04:00.360> were<00:04:00.480> doing<00:04:00.840> eventually<00:04:01.410> when<00:04:01.530> we<00:04:01.590> got

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
we were doing eventually when we got

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.860 
we were doing eventually when we got
Orkin<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.370> don't<00:04:02.850> think<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.060> recorded<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:03.630> but

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
Orkin I don't think I recorded this but

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.840 
Orkin I don't think I recorded this but
you<00:04:04.440> know<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:04.620> put<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.800> bunch<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.130> cars<00:04:05.400> in<00:04:05.610> here

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
you know we put a bunch of cars in here

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.820 
you know we put a bunch of cars in here
and<00:04:06.000> then<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.240> while<00:04:06.480> we're<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.750> midair<00:04:06.990> just

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
and then like while we're in midair just

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.410 
and then like while we're in midair just
like<00:04:08.010> almost<00:04:08.640> like<00:04:08.790> we're<00:04:09.000> pretending<00:04:09.390> like

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
like almost like we're pretending like

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.910 
like almost like we're pretending like
we're<00:04:09.630> in<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.750> Army<00:04:10.080> like<00:04:10.170> dropping<00:04:10.500> out<00:04:10.800> with

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
we're in the Army like dropping out with

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.400 
we're in the Army like dropping out with
cars<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.340> stuff<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:11.850> was<00:04:12.060> pretty<00:04:12.270> fun<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:13.230> you

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
cars and stuff it was pretty fun and you

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.870 
cars and stuff it was pretty fun and you
know<00:04:13.530> that's<00:04:13.680> why<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:13.920> know<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.730> know<00:04:14.790> I

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
know that's why you know I you know I

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.400 
know that's why you know I you know I
think<00:04:14.940> these<00:04:15.270> modern<00:04:15.630> missions<00:04:15.930> are<00:04:16.049> cool<00:04:16.260> I

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
think these modern missions are cool I

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.960 
think these modern missions are cool I
granted<00:04:16.830> yes<00:04:17.070> they're<00:04:17.250> in<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.430> mission<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:17.910> you

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
granted yes they're in a mission and you

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.880 
granted yes they're in a mission and you
know<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.150> can<00:04:18.270> only<00:04:18.299> have<00:04:18.540> what<00:04:18.750> eight<00:04:18.960> or<00:04:19.560> so

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
know you can only have what eight or so

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.920 
know you can only have what eight or so
people<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.370> don't<00:04:20.580> know<00:04:20.760> how<00:04:20.880> many<00:04:20.940> this<00:04:21.180> uh<00:04:21.239> how

people I don't know how many this uh how

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.680 
people I don't know how many this uh how
many<00:04:22.109> people<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.530> mission<00:04:22.890> holds<00:04:23.130> but<00:04:23.690> you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
many people this mission holds but you

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.810 
many people this mission holds but you
can<00:04:25.110> have<00:04:25.230> a<00:04:25.290> certain<00:04:25.650> amount<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:26.220> does

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.710 
plane in online note I understand like
the<00:04:50.310> reason<00:04:50.610> they<00:04:50.730> can't<00:04:50.970> have<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.240> tow

trucks and stuff like that because you

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.610 
trucks and stuff like that because you

one<00:06:03.900> thing<00:06:04.140> I<00:06:04.260> will<00:06:04.470> mention<00:06:04.620> though<00:06:04.920> about

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
one thing I will mention though about

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.700 
one thing I will mention though about
this<00:06:05.640> map<00:06:05.880> in<00:06:06.060> particular<00:06:06.570> is<00:06:06.750> that<00:06:06.780> unless

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
this map in particular is that unless

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.760 
this map in particular is that unless
you<00:06:08.130> have<00:06:08.460> the<00:06:08.910> DLC<00:06:09.570> which<00:06:10.020> you<00:06:10.230> know<00:06:10.320> contains

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
you have the DLC which you know contains

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.980 
you have the DLC which you know contains
the<00:06:10.980> blimp<00:06:11.220> from<00:06:11.520> single-player<00:06:12.120> then<00:06:12.840> you

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
the blimp from single-player then you

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.350 
the blimp from single-player then you
can't<00:06:13.260> fly<00:06:13.590> which<00:06:13.830> is<00:06:13.980> kind<00:06:14.340> of<00:06:14.460> odd<00:06:14.640> but<00:06:15.120> you

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
can't fly which is kind of odd but you

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.910 
can't fly which is kind of odd but you
know<00:06:15.510> I<00:06:15.540> guess<00:06:16.050> that<00:06:16.080> makes<00:06:16.410> sense<00:06:16.470> you<00:06:16.800> know

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
know I guess that makes sense you know

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.250 
know I guess that makes sense you know
so<00:06:17.370> that<00:06:17.850> that<00:06:18.270> that<00:06:18.750> kind<00:06:18.960> of<00:06:19.020> sucks

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
so that that that kind of sucks

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.900 
so that that that kind of sucks
