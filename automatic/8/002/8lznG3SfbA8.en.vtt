00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.769
 g2 is a device with full screen 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.019
 hd of five points two inches and that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.859
 is very similar to the galaxy s 4 of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.359
 samsung 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.640

 additional software features 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.840
 which explore the large area of â€‹â€‹the screen as 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.350
 the possibility of displaying two 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.870

 they went to a not so much place 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.840
 Conventional they are now down 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.270
 the camera lens on the back of the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.609
 LG device says that on smartphones 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.770
 large is not very functional buttons 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.769
 next to the appliance 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.229
 the processor is a quad core snapdragon 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.180
 800 are available 32 gb of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.580
 non- civil spam storage 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.860
 the 3 megapixel rear camera and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.960
 front is two-point megapixels 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.100
 there is still no price and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.659
 availability 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.880
 What we do know is that the two will arrive 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.960
 to the international market in this 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.960
 quarter 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.689
 google started releasing this week the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.400
 Android service is going to average so that the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.650
 find your device if it 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.360
 been lost or stolen 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.000
 the tool displays a map that shows 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.680
 where the device is and makes it 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.259
 maximum volume if it has been 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.850
 lost in a nearby location on a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.710
 more drastic situation when the user 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.750
 you are already aware that you will not 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.579
 find the device it can erase 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.729
 all information provided in 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.439
 smartphone to protect your data to 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.899
 that the service works, it is necessary that 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.850
 your smartphone is connected to the internet 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.740
 the tool is being made available 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.649
 for mobile with android from 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.450
 version 2.2 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.850
 talking on google the app store 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.520
 of the company went to apple apps store 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.560
 in number of downloads the difference was 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.930
 of 10% between the two stores in the first 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.209
 this year one of the main reasons that 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.610
 led to this was the significant increase 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.819
 downloads in countries such as Japan 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.709
 korea south russia and india 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.330
 although google is in front who 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.680
 had a greater profit from the applications 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.420
 went to apple 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.330
 the income of the company manufacturing the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.370
 iphone was 130 percent higher than 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.040
 high percentage but the leadership of 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.980
 apple has been falling for two years this profit 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.510
 was 400% bigger than google 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.489
 Brazilians are among the most 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 download apps for 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.200
 android games for both as 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.220
 for the google system are the most 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.769
 downloaded 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.840
 the messaging app or even zap 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.700
 came one more function and now allows the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.680
 sending voice messages 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.560
 the update is now available for 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.709
 smartphones with the system then the android 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.750
 blackberry and windows phone and symbian 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.849
 messages can now be saved and 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.459
 sent at the same time to contacts 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.500
 there is no limit to the duration of the message and the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.510
 volume changes according to the distance of the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.310
 ear as well as text messages 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.030
 the user will know when the audio was 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.310
 heard 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.500
 what's up already has over 300 million 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.390
 of users and this new function leaves 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.190
 more like the nextel and the 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.470
 check and another app launched 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.269
 recently here in Brazil and what makes 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.370
 much success in the orient 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.420
 after some rumors indicate that the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.510
 radeon hd 79 90 would be discontinued amd 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.760
 reduced the plate price by more than 40% 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.760
 the gpu that before cost thousand and 200 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.690
 dollars happens to be marketed to 699 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.760
 dollars 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.540
 with this reduction to the chip has a 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.329
 similar price to gtx 780 creating 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.799
 a competition between the two agb boards 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.019
 a high that was about to 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.850
 disappear can become a strong 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.590
 nvidia board competitor 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.530
 especially after the correction of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.170
 latency issues in the catalyst 13.8 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.730
 which affected the boards with crossfire 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.739

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.630
 week a change in news feed 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.180
 so that users do not lose the 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.340
 updates via 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.229
 algorithms the social network will define the 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.419
 that the user needs to see based on 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.090
 number of tanned views 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.570

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.700
 of content increases from 57 to 70% 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.040
 after activists received several 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.650
 threats of rape via twitter the network 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.880
 added the button 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.590

 application for s 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.230

 android application and on the website itself 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.070
 in the new rules of network usage 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.660
 disclosed during the week twitter 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.750

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.090
 inappropriate in microblog posts 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.010
 twitter director tony hoang asked 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.140
 apologies for abuse cases 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.150
 for you to understand the case activists of the 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.310
 Kingdom asked that the scores of 10 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.110

 user accounts have been 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.290
 suspended but they created new profiles 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.300
 and continued with the attacks 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.890
 twitter says it does not block for 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.530
 the creation of new accounts because 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.510
 identification mechanisms such as ipÃª are 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.840
 inefficient and may prevent 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.920
 legitimate users to create profiles on the network 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.750
