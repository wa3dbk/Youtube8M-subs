00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 I am your mister dwarf and today he is 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.450
 your lucky day 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.329
 you know because last night I went to the 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.930
 cinema to see a movie really 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:36.130
 sensational 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.649
 it's about the last bing six shot where 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.920
 the main character is a boy with his 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.399
 personal robot b max 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.550
 you want to know why you are lucky 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.830
 because today your mister dwarves there 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:59.290
 will reveal how to build yours 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:01:02.500
 very personal b max to do ours 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.960
 robot b max we need a balloon of 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.490
 white color I confirm it and it 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.000
 we joke a little to give him the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.000
 pear shape 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.399
 now we have to split the balloon into 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.649
 two parts to make the body and the head 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.619
 with simple twist at the end 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.179
 we take the knot and fix it around 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.179
 to the pressure we just did 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.840
 now we have to do the back we take 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.360
 always a white balloon 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.660
 we fix at this point we do it 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.690
 scroll along the length of the 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.390
 Our balloon will eventually do two 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.880
 balls with twist by ear and le 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.149
 we are taking a piece of balloon 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.400
 deflated this part will serve us for 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.560
 sticking the legs 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.230
 we will take a balloon of those more 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.600
 big from 360 we divide it into two 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.590
 sausages with simple pressure and e 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.590
 we stare at each other 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.820
 our robot is almost completed there 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.920

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.220
