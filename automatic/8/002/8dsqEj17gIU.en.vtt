00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:36.999 
distinctive sound and I feel sounds a

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:38.759 
distinctive sound and I feel sounds a
little<00:00:37.120> bit<00:00:37.359> different<00:00:37.809> than<00:00:38.469> all<00:00:38.739> the

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
little bit different than all the

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.009 
little bit different than all the
marshall<00:00:39.309> amps<00:00:39.429> that<00:00:39.609> came<00:00:39.789> before<00:00:39.969> it<00:00:40.179> i'll

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
marshall amps that came before it i'll

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.610 
marshall amps that came before it i'll
play<00:00:41.409> the<00:00:41.679> match<00:00:41.920> sound<00:00:42.460> as<00:00:42.989> well<00:00:43.989> as<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.440> real
