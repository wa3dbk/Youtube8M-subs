00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
was thinking you know if well we are

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.560 
was thinking you know if well we are
getting<00:01:23.250> together<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.150> couple<00:01:24.390> times

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
getting together here a couple times

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.450 
getting together here a couple times
within<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.409> next<00:01:25.560> couple<00:01:25.710> months<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
within the next couple months and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.390 
within the next couple months and
putting<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.450> some<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.590> real<00:01:28.770> life<00:01:28.950> stuff<00:01:29.189> but

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
putting the some in real life stuff but

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
putting the some in real life stuff but
I<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.759> doing<00:01:30.030> some<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.479> trolling<00:01:30.869> stuff

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
I think doing some like trolling stuff

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.950 
I think doing some like trolling stuff
or<00:01:31.650> even<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> print<00:01:32.939> calls<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.570> hookers

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
or even like the print calls to hookers

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.480 
or even like the print calls to hookers
or<00:01:34.140> whatever<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.130> together<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
or whatever that we all do together I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.210 
or whatever that we all do together I
think<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.909> would<00:01:35.970> be<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.500> pretty<00:01:37.500> big<00:01:37.770> hit<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
think that would be a pretty big hit and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.679 
think that would be a pretty big hit and
and<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.700> won't<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.090> leave<00:01:39.360> everybody
