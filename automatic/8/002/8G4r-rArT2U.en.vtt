00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 a highly praised drama with Jessica 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.310
 chastain and oscar isaac in the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.620
 there have been main roles since the beginning of august 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.420
 on blu ray and dvd and that's it 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.420
 now abroad 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.779
 I understand that you and your men 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.340
 do your job but we celebrate 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.230
 just the birthday of my daughter 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.599
 I'm sorry we're coming in now 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.439
 that there is no problem we do not intend to 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.500
 to hide him 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.119
 My husband is a good man confused 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.619
 Do not wear his honesty with weakness 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.619
 he deserves respect 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.960
 it was really very irreverent 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.770
 I would be a serious and clean company 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.340
 and I fight to the end for that 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.410
 to prove 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.120
 the times are dangerous we have to 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.770
 It's not like us anymore 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.770
 earlier than we were driving 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.630
 it killed her more last year 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.860
 and rape than ever before 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.510
 they came to tell me that 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.000
 we have an acute security problem 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.380
 I am aware of that 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.760
 this can not go on like this 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.040
 there is a war going on here 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.630
 they started in two years ago 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.790
 they have to identify my industry 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.500
 any idea while doing this 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.290
 Well, maybe they themselves contribute 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.700
 That's what happened to him . I got it 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.800
 always for the most honest way 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.369
 decided 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:31.240
 the goal is a possibility for me never 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:32.020
 just the way to reach it where 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.430
 did you come here? 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.170
 his youngest daughter has her in the bushes 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.940
 This is not found in front of our door 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.710
 only a slice hit your 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.850
 Child has a loaded weapon 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.860
 the prosecutor raises the 14 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.909
 points accusation we have it only something 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.370
 pushed too far 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.960
 that's all 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.850
 we can not allow it that way 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.800
 goes on if one of these guy 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.870
 shooting someone is the end of it 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.070
 Everything we have worked against 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.140
 they are now running serious 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.150
 Legal proceedings range from fraud 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.860
 to tax evasion that was 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.350
 not luck that all the years 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.640
 that helped as I want to with 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.640
 this thing to do nothing 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.980
 if you are afraid to jump 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.450
 just then you have to jump otherwise it will 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.720
 one for the rest of his life on the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.720
 location 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.880
 and I just can not 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.200
 The mouse was 28 minutes from twelve 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.780
 released years and is since then 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.670

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.840
 by abel played by oscar isaac man 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.790
 for example from inside worth davis 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.830
 and abel it to one of you at the beginning of the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.960
 1980s years in New York 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.820
 but heating oil business moves one of the 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.980
 expand would be bigger if he his 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.630
 Above all, he wants a big competition 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.550
 important land we have for it 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.050
 he needs money the problem is only he 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.490
 will gradually be in his company 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.050
 steals the woman by his side 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.090
 tried the books as good as 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.710
 possible to style at the same time 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.540
 This lawyer is sitting in the 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.490
 nacken because in this industry but like 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.320
 sometimes tricked and illegal times 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.390
 the same time werner bandel 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.550
 besides these hijacked trucks as well 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.209
 many again and again 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.800
 conflict more and more violent 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.630
 man reaches for the weapons and one 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.520
 business what abel actually necessarily 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.140
 legally wants to go through and after 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.270
 after getting illegal or getting it one 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.770
 easily mafia structure and gangster 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.660
 stick character and thus it is found 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.459
 im handing you over the two hours 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.020
 run somewhere between drama thriller 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.720
 and thriller again especially through 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.370
 the intensity of oscar isaac lipp it 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.600
 is a pretty good character mimo 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.430
 if you look too long in the eyes 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.660
 he looks then you can already 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.310
 a bit cold shivers on the back 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.110
 This is what jessica chastain calls about 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.220
 his side is also pretty great 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.840
 but sometimes not much say 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.880
 Main actor from helmer with as 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.200
 Prosecutor it is a very quiet 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.970
 not happy in every one of us 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.560
 moment on hectic action 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.630
 chase voltage sets but 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.280
 one of the intensity of the strength 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.530
 the dialogues looks like that one with this 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.970
 man celebrating or as military leader fever 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.470
 he tried to be an entrepreneur 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.420
 to build the company but of 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.890
 Now you can lose everything right away 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.959
 and again and again the spiral of the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.760
 unhappy circumstances getting deeper and deeper 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.190
 there are more and more stones in the way 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.630
 put results at the end has been a film 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.250
 not necessarily the broad one 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.410
 mainstream achieves this quietly 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.150
 this may be too atmospheric 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.460
 but anything but bad 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.110
 that is really well recorded over the 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.580
 intensity, he works well 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.930
 written script and basically 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.330
 a story about everything 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.919
 could and do not want to tell because it is not 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.870
 does not matter or because it does not matter 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.280
 what happens but can be unique 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.720
 only on how limited is one 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.850
 very fine power won by one 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.990
 good book a very great movie york 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.000
 in the 80s again and again 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.460
 Nice settings can bring the 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.350
 you really stand out here 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.120
 works out in the film and should mean 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.310
 I love anyway mafia movie or has 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.350
 his light gangster touch and that 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.240
 the mouse gets choices of crying out 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.520
 you from me eight and a half out of 10 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.050
 possible points as a drama slash 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.370
 earlier overall definitely too 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.300
 worth seven and a half out of 10 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.620
 possible points 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.880
 and then I rip through my to 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.560
 The stripes like to read a perm 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.539
 this video made 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.949
 Let's not leave it that otherwise 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.050
 You know there are still a few left around 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.569
 me around and tomorrow at 15 o'clock of course 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.190
 at the latest a new video and until then 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.289
 I hope since May again 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.289
 of course on the 3rd
