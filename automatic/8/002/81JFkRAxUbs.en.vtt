we got that going for us it could be

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.340 
we got that going for us it could be
potentially<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> daily<00:01:03.629> driver<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.170> only

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
potentially be a daily driver the only

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
potentially be a daily driver the only
thing<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.619> could<00:01:04.680> find<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.220> didn't<00:01:05.519> work<00:01:05.640> was

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
thing I could find that didn't work was

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.679 
thing I could find that didn't work was
GPS<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.960> went<00:01:07.439> outside<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.100> froze<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.420> SAT

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
GPS I went outside and froze and SAT

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.149 
GPS I went outside and froze and SAT
there<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.080> five<00:01:10.320> minutes<00:01:10.560> trying<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
there for five minutes trying to get the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.340 
there for five minutes trying to get the
GPS<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.700> walk<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.240> clear<00:01:12.540> night<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> did

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
GPS to walk on a clear night and it did

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.399 
GPS to walk on a clear night and it did
so<00:01:14.420> hopefully<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> developer<00:01:15.869> comes<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
so hopefully a developer comes up with a

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.980 
so hopefully a developer comes up with a
fix<00:01:16.680> probably<00:01:17.460> pure<00:01:18.210> shabby<00:01:18.540> penguin<00:01:18.900> will

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
fix probably pure shabby penguin will
