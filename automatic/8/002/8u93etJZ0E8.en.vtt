00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.609 
you can see it's a free plant because
nothing<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> plant<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:40.259> will<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
nothing to plant it and it will have a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.289 
nothing to plant it and it will have a
very<00:01:40.770> fast<00:01:41.009> cooldown<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> mean<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.060> really

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
very fast cooldown I mean you can really

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
very fast cooldown I mean you can really
put<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> lot<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.990> lot<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> mushrooms<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:44.070> there

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
put a lot a lot of mushrooms out there

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.980 
put a lot a lot of mushrooms out there
really<00:01:44.610> fast

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
really fast

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
really fast
this<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.470> another<00:01:46.619> way<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> actually<00:01:47.040> battle

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
this is another way to actually battle

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.039 
this is another way to actually battle
the<00:01:47.640> fact<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.000> didn't<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.450> much<00:01:48.600> toner<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the fact I didn't have as much toner to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.740 
the fact I didn't have as much toner to
use<00:01:49.229> -<00:01:49.520> also<00:01:50.520> another<00:01:50.909> quality<00:01:51.329> about<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
use - also another quality about the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.450 
use - also another quality about the
first<00:01:52.110> one<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.350> over<00:01:52.649> time<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.340> see

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
first one is that over time you can see

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.280 
first one is that over time you can see
this<00:01:53.579> guy's<00:01:53.790> sort<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.240> fading<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:54.750> bit

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
this guy's sort of fading a little bit

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.319 
this guy's sort of fading a little bit
that<00:01:55.680> means<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.130> Fox<00:01:56.759> room<00:01:56.909> actually<00:01:57.060> has<00:01:57.210> a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
that means the Fox room actually has a

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.530 
that means the Fox room actually has a
small<00:01:57.689> timer<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> end<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> will

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
small timer and at the end of it it will

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.499 
small timer and at the end of it it will
actually<00:02:00.689> disappear<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:02.790> however<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.390> can

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
actually disappear but however you can

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.870 
actually disappear but however you can
do<00:02:03.630> this

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
do this

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.790 
do this
you<00:02:05.420> can<00:02:05.570> see<00:02:05.690> how<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:06.020> single<00:02:06.350> plant<00:02:06.590> food

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
you can see how a single plant food

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.620 
you can see how a single plant food
actually<00:02:07.070> activates<00:02:07.670> plant<00:02:07.909> for<00:02:08.030> every<00:02:08.360> puffs

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
actually activates plant for every puffs

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.690 
actually activates plant for every puffs
room<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:09.110> currently<00:02:09.380> on<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.649> screen<00:02:09.740> and

room that is currently on the screen and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.430 
room that is currently on the screen and
not<00:02:10.910> only<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.180> but<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.690> also<00:02:11.780> resets<00:02:12.080> the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
not only that but it also resets the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.260 
not only that but it also resets the
timer<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.980> every<00:02:13.190> puffs<00:02:13.400> room<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.060> they

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
timer on every puffs room so that they

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.360 
timer on every puffs room so that they
can<00:02:14.450> keep<00:02:14.600> on<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.810> screen<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.380> longer<00:02:15.680> the
