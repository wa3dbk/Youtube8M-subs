the handspring half or the round off
it's<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.580> most<00:00:20.730> important<00:00:21.330> skill<00:00:21.570> in

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
it's the most important skill in

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.930 
it's the most important skill in
tumbling<00:00:22.260> because<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.860> first<00:00:23.100> move<00:00:23.580> in

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
tumbling because it's the first move in

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.120 
tumbling because it's the first move in
the<00:00:24.090> chain<00:00:24.360> of<00:00:24.540> moves<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.860> another

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the chain of moves and we have another

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.330 
the chain of moves and we have another
seven<00:00:26.850> to<00:00:27.000> add<00:00:27.590> to<00:00:28.590> get<00:00:28.770> this<00:00:28.920> right<00:00:29.160> is

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
seven to add to get this right is

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.460 
seven to add to get this right is
essential<00:00:29.940> so<00:00:30.540> it's<00:00:30.720> important<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.260> you

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.300 

the<00:01:23.640> hand<00:01:23.969> position<00:01:24.539> is<00:01:24.630> essential<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:26.130> need

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the hand position is essential we need

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
the hand position is essential we need
to<00:01:26.460> keep<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> fingers<00:01:27.149> stretched<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
to keep the fingers stretched and the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080 
to keep the fingers stretched and the
thumb<00:01:28.170> stretch<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> hand<00:01:29.850> has

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
thumb stretch so that the hand has

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.179 
thumb stretch so that the hand has
complete<00:01:30.570> control<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:31.860> will<00:01:32.039> have<00:01:32.159> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
complete control this will have a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.069 
complete control this will have a
knock-on<00:01:32.579> effect<00:01:32.969> of<00:01:33.210> keeping<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> arms

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
knock-on effect of keeping the arms

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.410 
knock-on effect of keeping the arms
straight<00:01:34.409> when<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> gymnast<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.880> working<00:01:36.299> on

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
straight when the gymnast is working on

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.209 
straight when the gymnast is working on
the<00:01:36.570> track<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.439> they<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.799> their<00:01:37.979> hand

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
the track if they have their hand

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.370 
the track if they have their hand
position<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.539> time<00:01:39.810> they

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
position like this all the time they

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.469 
position like this all the time they
have<00:01:40.409> complete<00:01:41.009> control<00:01:41.460> over<00:01:41.880> their<00:01:42.450> arms

have complete control over their arms
obviously<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:44.039> same<00:01:44.280> thing<00:01:44.520> applies<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
obviously the same thing applies to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.690 
obviously the same thing applies to
their<00:01:45.240> feet<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.929> feet<00:01:46.590> should<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:47.009> completely

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
their feet the feet should be completely

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.410 
their feet the feet should be completely
stretched<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.530> everything<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.560> they<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:50.420> now

from standing the gymnast will do a

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.590 
from standing the gymnast will do a
handspring<00:01:55.079> entry<00:01:55.729> with<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:57.030> hand<00:01:57.390> that

touches the floor to finish in the pike
position<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:01.170> she<00:02:01.439> will<00:02:01.619> pivot<00:02:02.070> back

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249

position and then she will pivot back
onto<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.880> mat<00:02:03.439> now<00:02:04.439> let's<00:02:04.679> talk<00:02:04.829> about<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
onto the mat now let's talk about the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.310 
onto the mat now let's talk about the
hand<00:02:05.369> position<00:02:05.820> obviously<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> hands<00:02:07.170> have

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
hand position obviously the hands have

hand position obviously the hands have
to<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.499> shoulder-width<00:02:07.979> apart

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
to be shoulder-width apart

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.669 
to be shoulder-width apart
we're<00:02:09.179> trying<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.509> encourage<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.170> gymnast<00:02:10.530> to
