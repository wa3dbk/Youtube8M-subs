00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.380
 so hey people gets to a new one 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.090
 Thank you for connecting my name 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.330
 is human because today it is about 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.210
 air superiority or rather superior in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.070
 China pricing who does not know what that is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.039
 yes this is a game mode which it 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.449
 Looks into battlefield in 1943 and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.609
 Battlefield 3 gave 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.140
 in principle this is half like nomination 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.630
 except that you are here with jets or 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.130
 Helicopter on the road is spot in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.050
 an already flying jet or 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.640
 helicopter and then it's already 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.320
 There is no smart protection 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.629
 or something like that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.250
 it's just more to be played 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.309
 Can on four different cards 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.370
 called kite pass guilin summit altay 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.370
 and the Silk Road and all of them 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.960
 a very own characteristic of the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.840
 first card we see here 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.730
 kite pass and well she is already 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.039
 relatively handsome one flies between 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.170
 the mountains which all nice 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.940
 are overgrown and tried 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.769
 to use these as cover 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.080
 the whole thing reminds me a bit 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.000
 board on there at least some maps of it 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.290
 are similar and personal 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 I think that's pretty cool if you can 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.140
 here, of course, neat with cover 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.600
 can work 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.640
 especially on servers on which the rockets 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.409
 how heated so who allows visitors 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.350
 are it can be very unpleasant if 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.640
 you no longer work with the cover 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.680
 on the second card called lulin 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.930
 summit is no longer with jets 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.869
 but directly with combat helicopters 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.299
 thing of it is again up to twelve 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.939
 bad 12 so 24 as far as I know 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.960
 and that can go pretty well 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.119
 you have to say that 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.400
 Here, too, you really have to pay attention 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.070
 that you are not too much in the crowd 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.659
 flies because 24 helicopters can do that 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130
 but sometimes very confusing 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.610
 become 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.320
 I find the decision interesting 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.770
 that you also like to fly here 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.020
 can 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.579
 but then again, not necessarily a 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.049
 squad is packed that is it is 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.119
 not quite optimal in my opinion 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.490
 So at least 1 word tries to go 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.659
 because that's how you can increase the efficiency of one 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.210
 helicopters and sometimes a bit 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.820
 increase even if the whole of this 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.459
 second it can be the 30 mm cannon 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.550
 not too much damage to vehicles 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.370
 makes the cold card number 3 called 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.709
 age reminds you at first 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.950
 something at albums mountain of battlefield 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.750
 3 At least there is snow just now 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.610
 on this card you noticed that 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.500
 the reflections and the sun it 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.629
 really make it very difficult at all 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.909
 what to do for the crosshair or 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.470
 your instruments like speed 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.150
 height and so on and so forth 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.680
 It's hard to see why 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.230
 I do not like this card that much 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.450
 find this card offers you something 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.430
 Cover at the corners or at the edges 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.290
 the map we say so in with 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.269
 However, that's like an arena and 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.250
 board you can find no cover 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.650
 that means you are really alone 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.900
 put on you and your jet skills 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.400
 my favorite card that brings 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.069
 Last but not least because I am the longest 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.260
 Silk Road becomes sovereign 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.629
 desert map really extremely beautiful 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.489
 optics in my opinion and but 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.629
 again no cover here personally 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.859
 if I'm kinda pretty good at that 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.239
 probably because of me 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.280
 just way too often in any 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.069
 mountains or supposed coverages 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.799
 Rheinreise something aside I really think 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.420
 cool this card right on this card 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.879
 I noticed, however, that 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.160
 these transactions more often 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.900
 Of course, not everyone is represented 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.370
 so beautiful that means here is neat 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.739
 go out a lot of action 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.049
 Everyone tries to know each other like team 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.760
 deathmatch just stop jets all the way 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.620
 will be very dangerous again 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.120
 once you get up close to what 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.120
 really pretty easy happened 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.769
 bang bangs but also if you have the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.750
 opponents just with his mini because 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.190
 shoots and that's my favorite 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.049
 variant to complete the 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.199
 There are three different types of the 20 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.060
 mm 25 mm and 30 mm 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.290
 cannon 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.150
 Of course, that is particularly noticeable 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.910
 you also such servers if you only 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.959
 a vehicle plays this 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.489
 unlockable objects of course all the more 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.169
 Personally, I find that faster 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.910
 pretty good on the normal 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.949
 Conquering servers, it is partly real 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.269
 difficult to get a job and then 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.250
 again you can not find enough 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.449
 who you really are 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.970
 that can be completed, for example 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:10.970
 with this little jet with the maximum 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.129
 You can almost 30 millimeter cannon almost 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.750
 do nothing against the tank and that 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.250
 Of course it is really difficult there 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.380
 to unlock something new at all 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.810
 I can only say about the types of ammunition 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.969
 that I use the 30 mm cannon best 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.969
 find just against other jets, the 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.840
 really pretty effective fundamentally 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:28.310
 You can also say that 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.500
 the air superiority or first 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.360
 Priority to English a lot more 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.250
 fun when you play on servers 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.440
 on which no heat seekers or 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.389
 Similar logon weapons are allowed 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.460
 you have to imagine that as soon as possible 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.830
 one attracts you with the heat search 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.660
 and shoot them or fire them 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.639
 Do you still fight back but as soon as a 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.460
 second jet comes to it and the same 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.139
 in a very short time behind it 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.830
 this will not be possible anymore 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.300
 ward 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.880
 and then it does not make fun 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.560
 more because who likes to like it 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.820
 to fight something you actually do 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.220
 can not fight 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.410
 no racing is available anyway 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.510
 So you the possibility first period 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.729
 or to play air superiority and 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.530
 that's fun as well not so good 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.630
 jetpilot just like me, for example 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.280
 I'm just a few new ones 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.479
 unlocks need this 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.669
 really great 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.770
 because that is leveling or unlocking 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.110
 different things for your jet goes 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.419
 relatively fast to the end there is 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.160
 By the way, also a few objects at 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.419
 this game mode we want 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.699
 Of course not completely forgotten that is 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.010
 flag points are here zeppelins or 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.900
 Balloons simply in the air too 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.340
 you have to fly around and you have to fly around 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.020
 then take the flag a 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.510
 so you can see the tickets of the opponent 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.100
 teams, of course, something more effective 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.830
 sink as if you just 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.450
 on the opponent is on it too 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.970
 In this case, we flew on 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.320
 the end of the video because I'm done 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.880
 that's it again you're too 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.170
 see 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.170
 hopefully until next time
