saddle now Ram has been around this
saddle<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> lot<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.570> he<00:00:30.750> doesn't<00:00:31.080> necessarily

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
saddle a lot so he doesn't necessarily

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.630 
saddle a lot so he doesn't necessarily
have<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> sniff<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:31.949> all<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> time<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.579> most

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that I'm saddling from the right hand

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.890 
that I'm saddling from the right hand
side<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.520> my<00:01:23.640> horse<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.210> cuts<00:01:24.450> down<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
side of my horse and this cuts down on a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.020 
side of my horse and this cuts down on a
step<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.740> means<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> only<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.909> move

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
step it means that I only have to move

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.850 
step it means that I only have to move
him<00:01:27.180> once<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.590> sides

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
him once because now the right sides

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
him once because now the right sides
ready<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.970> instead<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.299> me<00:01:30.509> ducking<00:01:30.930> under<00:01:31.170> him

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
to him and that he is going to become

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.220

so one more tightening maybe two more
tightenings<00:02:26.070> moving<00:02:26.880> them<00:02:26.970> around<00:02:27.090> each<00:02:27.420> time

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
tightenings moving them around each time

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.320 
tightenings moving them around each time
and<00:02:27.990> that's<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.650> friendly<00:02:29.040> way<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.460> saddle<00:02:30.210> my
