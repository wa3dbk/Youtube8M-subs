00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 I do not know you but there is some 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.899
 I film books so critical success me 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.610
 a little scary it's the kind of 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.889
 work that you start telling me 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.480
 good everyone loved so necessarily 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.210
 you have huge expectations 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.000
 alas as soon as you come across the slightest 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.619
 little fault that there is a real mountain 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.449
 with a 18 on nantes on jeuxvideo.com 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.000
 to 8 out of 10 on gamekult and a cat 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.439
 Enemies on five on fire gameblog 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.609
 emblem with ning is definitely part 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.609
 of this game category 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.030
 no 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.360
 so let's get the basics right now 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.010
 am an uneducated I never made fire 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.510
 emblem of my life so I could not 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.079
 not compare to techniques to opus 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.820
 previous 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.100
 yet this game made me anyway 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.509
 serious desire I even partly buy 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.479
 a 3ds to be able to play 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.310
 so necessarily that more success 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.690
 critical 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.690
 I had the balls in the beginning 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.590
 and the direct bam as soon as I start the 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.960
 game I take his biggest defect 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.600
 in the mouth a scenario stuffed with 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.190
 clichés without spoiler to summarize quickly 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.020
 does it's based on the links that 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.920
 unite the characters the typical thing 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.920
 Japanese rpg 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.410
 you see it coming the big stereotype 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.259
 power mega hyper significant Supra 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.229
 friendship what it is there and a lot 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.690
 too present but in addition to being clichés 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.039
 the scenario is ultra predictable all 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.100
 the twists I saw them coming 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.890
 were going an hour in advance and that's 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.569
 not super well written fortunately for 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.240
 to compensate for that we have characters who 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.850
 although it is totally clichés too 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.979
 are pretty endearing we start with 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.840
 for example a prince who is ultra 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.479
 endearing who wants to save the widow and 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.100
 the orphan the princess who is a 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.049
 real little bitch for not saying a 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.030
 little bitch who makes pranks to 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.620
 day length but also the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.739
 mercenary fighter who think that a 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.180
 true warrior people yes it's cliché 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.900
 but they are endearing it works well 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 I promise you 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.650
 Yes 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.140
 but where it's strong is that this 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.000
 attachment it is super well used 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.250
 by the gameplay as well as generates 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.060
 smash the game but in fact it is 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.220
 downright huge 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.410
 so you have to know that it's 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.910
 tactical role intelligent system does 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.770
 are not on their first shot in this 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.150
 kind of game is there but they managed 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.040
 a fucking thing 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.050
 the fights are just hyper interesting 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.030
 and its deep can improve weapons 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.340
 there is a sheet stone system 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.110
 scissors paper for weaknesses and 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.810
 the benefits the various weapons 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.220
 there are a lot of features the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.230
 characters can help each other between 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.990
 them short it's a game that is at once 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.240
 deep and fun it's role play at 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.430
 turn by turn necessarily it's not great 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.890
 sexy bhl like that but it works great 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.180
 well and cherry on the cake 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.050
 the characters can die 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.110
 finally 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.850
 and that's just great every time 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.590
 you lose a character you have 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.050
 boosted thoroughly that makes it big 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.850
 metronome of your team that in addition 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.260
 you wash yourself thoroughly boosted in general 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.700
 is a character that you like the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.140
 scenario but every time they 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.330
 are dying in combat you know you 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.070
 definitely lose with all 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.170
 consequences that entails and you 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.240
 are a little doing no in front of 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.730
 your 3ds 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.710
 the thing is, it's actually 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:03.240
 do not necessarily like that shit 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:06.230
 shit the tracks is still dead for 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.230
 backup charles 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.959
 but hey, I do not want you to do 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.090
 this practice because although that 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.950
 takes away a lot of the game 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.539
 must admit that it is necessary because 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.889
 that even if he plays is relatively 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.930
 classic and has no balls in 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.579
 his scenario is something else for these 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.160
 fighting the fights in addition to losing 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.169
 the characters definitely his ultra 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.870
 hard fighting a way of 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.419
 difficulty we will say means this is 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.340
 really complicated you have to be busy 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.930
 every time you really have to do 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.580
 blunder the enemy's movements because 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.979
 only in one round where we can lose units 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.199
 stupid then necessarily the guys 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.449
 intelligent systems are good the 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.970
 definitive loss of characters a 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.800
 difficulty high enough for the game we are going 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.449
 maybe deprive yourself of a big audience 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.740
 with that then if you are big 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.880
 let go you do not want to 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.250
 reload your backup every 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.680
 five minutes they incorporated a mode 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.930
 game or the characters do not die 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.669
 not definitely I do not advise you 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.830
 to opt for this mode between us 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:06.880
 socially it hides a good part of the 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.860
 fun game good fox I put a 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.419
 thirty hours to finish this game there 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.729
 is hard and long all that we like 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.409
 30 hours is by counting the 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.460
 backup refills but also 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.990
 all the side quests 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.460
 I did all the fights schedule 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.960
 cossart we have a world map will be 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.030
 which one will be able to move freely 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.220
 go buy equipment in shop 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.770
 but also doing secondary fights 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.780
 that will not do anything except 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.190
 express your characters but also 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.990
 ancillary missions that are more 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.000
 friendly because they allow 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.949
 recruit new characters characters 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.919
 which will be linked scenaristically to your 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.570
 characters that you already have but 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.669
 it's nice because after a while 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.690
 he lives there having to have half of 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.530
 his team bursting 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.720
 you have to replace them it's enough 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.750
 horrible and it does not stick too much with 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.300
 the idea links of brain friendship but 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.690
 good besides having a fighting system 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.099
 super interesting to be long the game is 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.770
 pay the luxury of having a very good 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.719
 achievement achievement in itself 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.009
 and his beautiful setting aside a little 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.110
 of aliasing and the fact 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.550
 very strange that is not modeling the 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.199
 feet of the characters could 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.490
 watch it in cinematics 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.279
 finally the cutscenes it is because 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.599
 that there are cinematics that are not 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:17.529
 with a game engine that are just 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.360
 wonderful 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.860
 you can see that from a cut-scenes that 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.419
 are made with the engine of the game they have 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.860
 not model the feet of the characters 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.629
 he's resting on their ankles that's 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.550
 strange enough apart from that is a little 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:29.860
 aliasing not technically it's 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.689
 really strong in addition to the 3d effect it 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.399
 is quite nice especially during 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:37.029
 combat phases where this time it's in 

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:40.259
 3d and it works great a beautiful game 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:43.300
 and deep that asks the people 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:45.430
 add to that a soundtrack that is very 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.529
 good although not necessarily memorable 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.599
 and you will have a game that does not fly 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:51.789
 his reputation for a long time 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.110
 complex interesting even though the 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:54.939
 scenario will not push you to return 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.099
 on it all the time the fights are 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:59.289
 sufficiently well done so that the 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:00.550
 lassitude does not occur suddenly 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:02.349
 you buy I'm pretty much 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.169
 certain if you are not allergic to 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.819
 kind of going on we'll say at least 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.529
 twenty good hours on it's a 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.300
 total success for once i'm 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:11.110
 not disappointed by a game that has a big 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.349
 reputation 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.120
 so bravo smart system I you 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:19.169
 recommend fire emblem at the happening 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.169
 See you
