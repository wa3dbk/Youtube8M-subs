00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
but from what I understand the price is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.520 
but from what I understand the price is
supposed<00:00:38.270> to<00:00:38.450> be<00:00:38.570> around<00:00:38.870> two<00:00:39.140> hundred<00:00:39.260> fifty

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
supposed to be around two hundred fifty

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
dollars which is still a little bit

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.209 
dollars which is still a little bit

if your device is supported see if

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.020 
if your device is supported see if
you're<00:02:15.530> interested<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:15.920> developing<00:02:16.280> for<00:02:16.880> it

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
you're interested in developing for it

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.759 
you're interested in developing for it
helping<00:02:17.360> out<00:02:17.510> in<00:02:17.690> any<00:02:17.810> way<00:02:17.900> one<00:02:18.590> way<00:02:18.709> or

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
another it seems like a really

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.309 
another it seems like a really
interesting<00:02:19.879> feature<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.569> perhaps<00:02:20.930> other

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
interesting feature and perhaps other

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.510 
interesting feature and perhaps other
roms<00:02:21.590> will<00:02:21.860> want<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.099> adopt

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
roms will want to adopt

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.160 
roms will want to adopt
as<00:02:22.700> well<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.150> take<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.540> look<00:02:23.720> at<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.900> if<00:02:24.080> it

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
as well so take a look at it if it

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.510 
as well so take a look at it if it
sounds<00:02:24.440> interesting<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.130> next<00:02:25.340> door<00:02:25.490> I

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
sounds interesting the next door I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.890 
sounds interesting the next door I
wanted<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.850> talk<00:02:26.030> about<00:02:26.060> involves<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.720> one

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
wanted to talk about involves the one

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.320 
wanted to talk about involves the one
plus<00:02:27.110> one<00:02:27.230> which<00:02:27.560> unfortunately<00:02:28.490> has<00:02:28.850> not

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
plus one which unfortunately has not

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.090 
plus one which unfortunately has not
seen<00:02:29.630> much<00:02:29.810> yet<00:02:29.870> in<00:02:30.290> terms<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.650> development

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
seen much yet in terms of development

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.040 
seen much yet in terms of development
part<00:02:31.520> of<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.700> has<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.880> do<00:02:32.120> with<00:02:32.330> just<00:02:32.570> lack<00:02:32.840> of

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
part of that has to do with just lack of

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.960 
part of that has to do with just lack of
availability<00:02:33.530> but<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.310> other<00:02:34.460> part<00:02:34.730> is<00:02:34.910> that

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
availability but the other part is that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.480 
availability but the other part is that
a<00:02:35.180> custom<00:02:35.600> recovery<00:02:36.050> wasn't<00:02:36.620> available<00:02:36.860> up

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
a custom recovery wasn't available up

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.760 
a custom recovery wasn't available up

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
interesting feature as far as I'm

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.760 
interesting feature as far as I'm
concerned<00:02:52.660> mouse<00:02:53.660> support<00:02:54.020> for<00:02:54.530> USB

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
concerned mouse support for USB

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.650 
concerned mouse support for USB
on-the-go<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:55.730> basically<00:02:56.180> if<00:02:56.480> you're<00:02:56.630> a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
on-the-go so basically if you're a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.270 
on-the-go so basically if you're a
digitizer<00:02:57.140> doesn't<00:02:57.620> work<00:02:57.740> right<00:02:57.950> for<00:02:58.130> some

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.680 
digitizer doesn't work right for some
reason<00:02:58.310> or<00:02:58.610> another<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:59.090> need<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.480> flash

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
reason or another and you need to flash

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.600 
reason or another and you need to flash
something<00:03:00.110> new<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.290> your<00:03:00.380> device<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:01.010> can<00:03:01.430> do

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
something new to your device you can do

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.010
