okay<00:00:03.270> we're<00:00:03.659> back<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:04.140> part<00:00:04.440> two<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.710> our<00:00:04.950> video

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
okay we're back to part two of our video

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.270 
okay we're back to part two of our video
here<00:00:05.660> we've<00:00:06.660> changed<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.230> coil<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:07.919> we<00:00:08.040> put

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
here we've changed the coil here we put

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.240 
here we've changed the coil here we put
a<00:00:08.309> new<00:00:08.460> coil<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:09.030> we're<00:00:09.960> still<00:00:10.170> back<00:00:10.380> probe<00:00:10.769> to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
a new coil on we're still back probe to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.549 
a new coil on we're still back probe to
that<00:00:11.460> coil<00:00:11.820> for<00:00:12.630> retrieving<00:00:13.170> off<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.469> that

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
that coil for retrieving off of that

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.760 
that coil for retrieving off of that
coil<00:00:13.860> only<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.870> little<00:00:15.870> amp<00:00:16.109> probe<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.560> still

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
coil only a little amp probe is still

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.980 
coil only a little amp probe is still
around<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.190> feed<00:00:17.400> lawyer<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.180> slice<00:00:18.660> bar

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
around the feed lawyer that slice bar

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.920 
around the feed lawyer that slice bar
put<00:00:19.770> all<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> coils<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.810> we're<00:00:21.810> over<00:00:22.020> here<00:00:22.170> at

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
put all the coils and we're over here at

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.720 
put all the coils and we're over here at
at<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.260> scope<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.740> we<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.070> see<00:00:26.250> now<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.460> got<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
at the scope and we can see now we got a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.730 
at the scope and we can see now we got a
nice<00:00:26.939> clean<00:00:27.949> clean<00:00:28.949> line<00:00:29.960> on<00:00:30.960> our<00:00:31.019> amp<00:00:31.410> probe

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
nice clean clean line on our amp probe

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.950 
nice clean clean line on our amp probe
this<00:00:32.160> would<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> amp<00:00:33.300> probe<00:00:33.630> line

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
this would this is the amp probe line

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.610 
this would this is the amp probe line
shows<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.710> current<00:00:35.100> draw<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.180> coil<00:00:36.620> it

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
shows the current draw of the coil it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.490 
shows the current draw of the coil it
builds<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:39.000> coil<00:00:39.360> winding<00:00:39.930> saturate

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
builds up as the coil winding saturate

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500 
builds up as the coil winding saturate
it<00:00:40.620> builds<00:00:40.920> up<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.370> draws<00:00:41.640> more<00:00:41.879> current<00:00:42.300> till

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it builds up and draws more current till

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.380 
it builds up and draws more current till
it<00:00:42.690> till<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.680> ignition<00:00:44.160> collapses<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> coil

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
it till the ignition collapses the coil

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.869 
it till the ignition collapses the coil
and<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.440> gives<00:00:46.680> us<00:00:46.890> our<00:00:47.070> spark<00:00:47.430> which<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and that gives us our spark which is

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
and that gives us our spark which is
this<00:00:48.059> area<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.739> actual

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
this area right here this is the actual

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.910 
this area right here this is the actual
spark<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> actual<00:00:52.620> burn

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
spark and this is the is the actual burn

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520 
spark and this is the is the actual burn
time<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.640> spark<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.270> i'll<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.199> show<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
time of the spark so i'll just show you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.080 
time of the spark so i'll just show you
one<00:00:55.739> other<00:00:55.890> thing<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.820> here

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
one other thing that you can do here

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
one other thing that you can do here
when<00:00:57.660> you're<00:00:57.780> triggering<00:00:58.140> off<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.739> when

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
when you're triggering off of it when

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.889 
when you're triggering off of it when
you<00:00:59.070> got<00:00:59.219> your<00:00:59.340> low<00:00:59.789> amp<00:01:00.059> kroger<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.690> main

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you got your low amp kroger on the main

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.609 
you got your low amp kroger on the main
feed<00:01:01.230> wire<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.850> take<00:01:05.090> your<00:01:06.090> sweet<00:01:06.479> time

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
feed wire you can take your sweet time

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.870 
feed wire you can take your sweet time
adjust<00:01:07.619> your<00:01:07.710> sweep<00:01:08.040> time<00:01:08.280> we're<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.610> 10

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
adjust your sweep time we're at 10

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
adjust your sweep time we're at 10
milliseconds<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.950> go<00:01:11.130> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
milliseconds right now so if we go that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.870 
milliseconds right now so if we go that
and<00:01:11.610> go<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.330> 100<00:01:12.840> milliseconds

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and go up to 100 milliseconds

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
and go up to 100 milliseconds
now<00:01:15.390> he<00:01:15.450> gets<00:01:15.689> now<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> got<00:01:16.229> three<00:01:16.469> coils<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
now he gets now I got three coils on it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.830 
now he gets now I got three coils on it
we're<00:01:17.430> still<00:01:17.640> triggering<00:01:18.119> off<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> same

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
we're still triggering off of the same

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.990 
we're still triggering off of the same
coil<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.829> then<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.280> follow<00:01:20.490> your<00:01:20.759> firing

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
coil but then you can follow your firing

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.999 
coil but then you can follow your firing
order<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.719> had<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.899> coil<00:01:22.649> that<00:01:22.890> was

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
order if you had a coil that was

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.499 
order if you had a coil that was
completely<00:01:23.549> dead<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:23.939> something<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
completely dead or something like that

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.960 
completely dead or something like that
then<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.409> able<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.759> we

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
then you would be able to see that if we

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.990 
then you would be able to see that if we
increase<00:01:27.360> our<00:01:27.539> sweet<00:01:27.780> time<00:01:27.810> even<00:01:28.380> more<00:01:29.000> then

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
increase our sweet time even more then

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.149 
increase our sweet time even more then
we<00:01:30.090> got<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.659> our<00:01:30.750> coil<00:01:31.079> firings<00:01:31.649> on<00:01:31.890> there

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
we got all of our coil firings on there

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.950 
we got all of our coil firings on there
at<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.729> same<00:01:32.939> time<00:01:33.210> even<00:01:33.509> though<00:01:33.600> we're<00:01:33.750> still

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
at the same time even though we're still

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
at the same time even though we're still
triggering<00:01:34.409> off<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.799> one<00:01:35.210> for<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
triggering off of this one for the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.649 
triggering off of this one for the
number<00:01:36.569> five<00:01:36.810> coil<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:38.039> can<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.490> work<00:01:39.450> your

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
number five coil you can just work your

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.389 
number five coil you can just work your
way<00:01:39.810> down<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.319> one<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:40.950> missy<00:01:41.189> you

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
way down if one of these with missy you

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.100 
way down if one of these with missy you
really<00:01:41.610> can't<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:41.909> much<00:01:42.179> definition<00:01:42.539> in<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
really can't see much definition in the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.440 
really can't see much definition in the
firing<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.399> coils<00:01:44.970> when<00:01:45.179> they're<00:01:45.299> like

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
firing of the coils when they're like

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
firing of the coils when they're like
this<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> lot<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.799> time<00:01:47.039> they'll<00:01:47.280> even

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
this and a lot of time they'll even

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.520 
this and a lot of time they'll even
disappear<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.599> wanted<00:01:48.929> to<00:01:49.049> zero<00:01:49.319> in

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
disappear but if you wanted to zero in

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.440 
disappear but if you wanted to zero in
on<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:49.920> then<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.789> would<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.030> move<00:01:51.270> your

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
on one then you would just move your

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.559 
on one then you would just move your
trigger<00:01:51.950> over<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.429> whichever<00:01:53.789> cylinder<00:01:54.450> you

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
trigger over to whichever cylinder you

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.120 
trigger over to whichever cylinder you
want<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.959> you<00:01:55.080> can<00:01:55.289> count<00:01:55.439> your<00:01:55.679> cylinders

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
want and you can count your cylinders

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.309 
want and you can count your cylinders
since<00:01:56.369> we're<00:01:56.580> at<00:01:56.640> five<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.899> count<00:01:58.110> up

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
since we're at five you just count up

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.870 
since we're at five you just count up
the<00:01:58.349> firing<00:01:59.009> order<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.459> get<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> right

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
the firing order to get the right

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.339 
the firing order to get the right
cylinder<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:00.630> we're<00:02:00.750> back<00:02:00.899> at<00:02:01.110> five

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
cylinder and then we're back at five

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.279 
cylinder and then we're back at five
again<00:02:01.709> over<00:02:02.069> here<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.959> move<00:02:04.170> your

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
again over here so you just move your

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.370 
again over here so you just move your
trigger<00:02:04.530> around<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.069> different<00:02:05.280> coils<00:02:05.849> and<00:02:06.380> on

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
trigger around to different coils and on

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.100 
trigger around to different coils and on
here<00:02:07.679> you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.910> got<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> main<00:02:09.420> plug<00:02:09.869> right

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
here you can you got a main plug right

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.979 
here you can you got a main plug right
here<00:02:10.489> for<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.579> coil<00:02:11.849> wires<00:02:12.120> go<00:02:12.690> for<00:02:12.900> these

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
here for your coil wires go for these

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.650 
here for your coil wires go for these
back<00:02:13.319> coils<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.220> are<00:02:14.790> under<00:02:15.299> the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.770 

at<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.440> connector<00:02:19.010> right<00:02:19.250> there<00:02:19.780> that's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
at the connector right there that's

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.640 
at the connector right there that's
about<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.170> for<00:02:21.470> now<00:02:21.650> okay
