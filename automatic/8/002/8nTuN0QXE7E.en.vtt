00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hi I'm Nicky Hayes I'm a retired math

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.769 
hi I'm Nicky Hayes I'm a retired math
teacher<00:00:03.570> and<00:00:04.020> school<00:00:04.380> principal<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:06.450> want

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
teacher and school principal and I want

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.290 
teacher and school principal and I want
to<00:00:06.870> talk<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.290> about<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.680> fact<00:00:07.950> that<00:00:08.300> we

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
to talk to you about the fact that we

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.740 
to talk to you about the fact that we
stay<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.780> America<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.610> reason<00:00:12.030> children

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
stay in America that the reason children

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.150 
stay in America that the reason children
aren't<00:00:12.900> doing<00:00:13.080> well<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.469> math<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.980> it's

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
aren't doing well in math is it's

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.029 
aren't doing well in math is it's
because<00:00:14.549> they're<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.389> poverty<00:00:16.199> they're<00:00:16.770> in

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
because they're in poverty they're in

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.359 
because they're in poverty they're in
minority<00:00:17.760> groups<00:00:18.240> they<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:18.980> girls<00:00:19.980> aren't

minority groups they are girls aren't

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.240 
minority groups they are girls aren't
doing<00:00:20.520> well<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:22.109> bottom<00:00:22.439> line<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.949> it's

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
doing well and the bottom line is it's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.400 
doing well and the bottom line is it's
not<00:00:23.430> really<00:00:23.820> about<00:00:23.939> any<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:25.260> not

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
not really about any of that it's not

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.130 
not really about any of that it's not
even<00:00:25.680> about<00:00:25.769> budgets<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.760> about<00:00:27.269> poor

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
even about budgets it's about poor

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.919 
even about budgets it's about poor
curriculum<00:00:28.830> poor<00:00:29.670> choices<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.390> material

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
that's used on children in math

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.069 
that's used on children in math
education<00:00:33.230> if<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.770> math<00:00:35.120> program<00:00:36.120> has<00:00:36.719> your

who<00:00:40.020> supposedly<00:00:40.590> doesn't<00:00:41.010> learn<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.670> girls

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
who supposedly doesn't learn like girls

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.630 
who supposedly doesn't learn like girls
and<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:42.930> don't<00:00:43.079> learn<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.590> him<00:00:43.950> therefore

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and they don't learn like him therefore

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.369 
and they don't learn like him therefore
we<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.450> differentiated

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
we have to have all this differentiated

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.830 
we have to have all this differentiated
instruction<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.510> aim

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
instruction and we have to really aim

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.310 
instruction and we have to really aim
the<00:00:49.320> math<00:00:49.980> program<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> girls<00:00:51.570> because

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the math program for the girls because

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.160 
the math program for the girls because
we<00:00:52.559> want<00:00:52.949> equity<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> classroom<00:00:54.390> which<00:00:54.989> is

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
we want equity on the classroom which is

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.900 
we want equity on the classroom which is
not<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> bad<00:00:55.469> thing<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.190> then<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.579> forget

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
not a bad thing but then you forget

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.319 
not a bad thing but then you forget
about<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> boys<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> process<00:00:58.609> so<00:00:59.609> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
about the boys in the process so the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.229 
about the boys in the process so the
problem<00:01:00.930> should<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.559> how<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.730> one

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
problem should be how do we have one

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.950 
problem should be how do we have one
math<00:01:03.600> program<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.769> works<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.430> kids<00:01:05.960> we

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
math program that works for all kids we

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.859 
math program that works for all kids we
had<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.530> starting<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.430> 1980s<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.540> still

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
had that starting in the 1980s we still

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.440 
had that starting in the 1980s we still
have<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.320> today<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:11.010> called<00:01:11.220> Saxon<00:01:11.850> Math<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
have it today it's called Saxon Math and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.679 
have it today it's called Saxon Math and
I've<00:01:13.320> written<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.040> biography<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.790> John<00:01:15.119> Saxon

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
I've written the biography of John Saxon

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.010 
I've written the biography of John Saxon
because<00:01:16.110> he<00:01:16.799> called<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.490> idea<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.060> Matt<00:01:18.750> had

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
because he called the idea that Matt had

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
because he called the idea that Matt had
to<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.320> written<00:01:19.950> differently<00:01:20.280> because<00:01:20.909> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
to be written differently because of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.980 
to be written differently because of
color<00:01:21.570> or<00:01:21.930> gender<00:01:21.960> or<00:01:23.479> budgets<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:24.780> have

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
color or gender or budgets or what have

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.190 
color or gender or budgets or what have
you<00:01:25.070> racist<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.280> sexist<00:01:26.820> he<00:01:27.420> said<00:01:27.689> math<00:01:27.960> is

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
you racist and sexist he said math is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.050 
you racist and sexist he said math is
math<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.740> doesn't<00:01:29.159> care<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.549> color<00:01:29.759> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
math that doesn't care what color you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.819 
math that doesn't care what color you
are<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.390> doesn't<00:01:30.570> care<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.380> gender<00:01:31.680> is

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
are it doesn't care what your gender is

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.880 
are it doesn't care what your gender is
is<00:01:32.189> good<00:01:33.000> math<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.659> good<00:01:34.020> curriculum<00:01:34.380> will

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
is good math and good curriculum will

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.300 
is good math and good curriculum will
make<00:01:35.100> every<00:01:35.759> child<00:01:36.119> become<00:01:36.860> equitable<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
make every child become equitable and a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.330 
make every child become equitable and a
classroom<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.110> wrote<00:01:40.439> his<00:01:40.650> biography
