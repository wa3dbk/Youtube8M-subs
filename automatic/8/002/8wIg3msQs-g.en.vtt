only<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.890> them<00:01:50.009> which<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.970> pretty

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
only have one of them which is pretty

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.660 
only have one of them which is pretty
nice<00:01:51.659> functionality<00:01:52.290> then<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.369> your

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
nice functionality then you have your

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969 
nice functionality then you have your
right<00:01:53.909> left<00:01:54.180> speaker<00:01:54.689> hookups<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.649> 12

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
right left speaker hookups and your 12

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.010 
right left speaker hookups and your 12
volt<00:01:56.040> input<00:01:56.369> which<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.240> says<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> takes<00:01:57.750> two

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
volt input which it says it takes two

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.590 
volt input which it says it takes two
amps<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> 2<00:01:59.670> amp<00:01:59.850> 12<00:02:00.270> volt<00:02:00.450> power

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
amps and I have a 2 amp 12 volt power

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.620 
amps and I have a 2 amp 12 volt power
supply<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.020> test<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.180> know<00:02:03.450> let

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
supply to test it with so you know let

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.310 
supply to test it with so you know let
me<00:02:03.689> hook<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.100> test<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:06.320> so

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
me hook it up and we can test it out so

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.880 
me hook it up and we can test it out so
on<00:02:07.770> mic<00:02:07.979> inter<00:02:08.340> video<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.879> used<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
on mic inter video I used the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.120 
on mic inter video I used the
small<00:02:11.300> white<00:02:12.300> speaker<00:02:12.810> which<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.650> right<00:02:14.100> here

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
small white speaker which is right here

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.290 
small white speaker which is right here
and<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:16.500> l'épée<00:02:16.860> amplifier<00:02:17.490> actually<00:02:18.030> caused

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
and the l'épée amplifier actually caused

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.870 
and the l'épée amplifier actually caused
this<00:02:18.569> speaker<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.020> bottom<00:02:19.290> out<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.459> had<00:02:20.670> to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
this speaker to bottom out so I had to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.750 
this speaker to bottom out so I had to
get<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> little<00:02:21.420> bit<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.660> bigger<00:02:21.810> speaker

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
get a little bit of a bigger speaker

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.330 
get a little bit of a bigger speaker
which<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.240> see<00:02:24.420> right<00:02:24.450> here<00:02:24.980> which<00:02:25.980> I'll<00:02:26.220> be

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
which you see right here which I'll be

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.130 
which you see right here which I'll be
showing<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.819> sec<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.450> let<00:02:27.780> me<00:02:27.930> turn<00:02:28.080> on

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
showing you in a sec so let me turn on

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.070 
showing you in a sec so let me turn on
the<00:02:28.260> sucks<00:02:28.560> extra<00:02:28.980> light<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.840> let<00:02:30.840> me<00:02:30.930> just

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
the sucks extra light and let me just

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.870 
the sucks extra light and let me just
connect<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.650> speaker<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:34.730> positive<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
connect the speaker the positive and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.920 
connect the speaker the positive and
negative<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.910> that's<00:02:39.030> black<00:02:39.420> speaker<00:02:39.720> right

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
negative so that's black speaker right

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.830 
negative so that's black speaker right
there<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.410> 8<00:02:40.800> ohms<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:42.239> that's<00:02:42.480> just<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.750> know

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
there is 8 ohms so that's just you know

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.790 
there is 8 ohms so that's just you know
puts<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.230> perspective

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
puts it in perspective

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.710 
puts it in perspective
depending<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.700> which<00:02:44.940> ohm<00:02:45.180> speaker<00:02:45.600> you're

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
depending on which ohm speaker you're

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.900 
depending on which ohm speaker you're
using<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.770> have<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.130> same<00:02:47.340> exact<00:02:47.640> drum

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
using so I have that same exact drum

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.780 
using so I have that same exact drum
loop<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> use<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.080> kinter<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.790> I'll

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
loop that I use for the kinter and I'll

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.930 
loop that I use for the kinter and I'll
be<00:02:50.880> playing<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:53.280> larger<00:02:53.610> speaker

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
be playing that on the larger speaker

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.600 
be playing that on the larger speaker
for<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.390> here<00:02:54.540> let<00:02:54.690> me<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:54.930> zoom<00:02:54.959> in<00:02:55.610> on

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
for you so here let me just zoom in on

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.320 
for you so here let me just zoom in on
the<00:02:56.970> speaker<00:02:57.300> itself<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.070> can<00:02:59.220> see<00:02:59.430> it

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.350 

okay<00:03:03.330> that's<00:03:03.450> good<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.050> we<00:03:04.620> turned<00:03:04.860> on<00:03:05.360> and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
okay that's good so we turned on and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:22.420 
okay that's good so we turned on and
played<00:03:07.080> on<00:03:07.200> my<00:03:07.320> laptop

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.789 

so<00:03:23.430> as<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.670> can<00:03:23.760> see<00:03:23.819> with<00:03:24.299> um<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:25.680> by

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
so as you can see with um just by

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.229 
so as you can see with um just by

looking at the speaker you can tell that

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.839 
looking at the speaker you can tell that
it's<00:03:27.390> definitely<00:03:27.569> powering<00:03:28.379> it<00:03:28.640> pretty<00:03:29.640> well

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
it's definitely powering it pretty well

you know it um it definitely provides
enough<00:03:33.420> power<00:03:33.659> for<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.930> speaker<00:03:34.440> I've

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
enough power for this speaker I've

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.190 
enough power for this speaker I've
actually<00:03:35.430> used<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:36.090> amp<00:03:36.420> with<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.750> taller

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
actually used this amp with a taller

so you know this thing supplies a pretty
good<00:03:54.299> amount<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.569> power<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.989> them<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.200> was<00:03:55.290> it

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
good amount of power to them it was it

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.020 
good amount of power to them it was it
was<00:03:55.590> pretty<00:03:55.769> loud<00:03:56.099> considering<00:03:56.879> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
was pretty loud considering the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.610 
was pretty loud considering the
amplifier<00:03:57.569> size<00:03:57.870> which<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.349> was<00:03:58.440> pretty

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
amplifier size which I was pretty

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.970 
amplifier size which I was pretty
impressed<00:03:58.920> with<00:03:59.040> um<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.590> know<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.739> also

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.670 
has the Oh when I when I play the music
which<00:04:06.799> again<00:04:08.629> you<00:04:09.629> can<00:04:09.659> see<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.349> speaker

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
which again you can see it the speaker

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:19.270 
which again you can see it the speaker
starts<00:04:10.859> to<00:04:11.040> bottom<00:04:11.370> out<00:04:11.519> around<00:04:11.849> hand<00:04:12.780> falling

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.589 

so<00:04:20.280> when<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.519> while<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.209> was<00:04:21.299> playing<00:04:21.419> a

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
so when I while I was playing a

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.180 
so when I while I was playing a
speaker's<00:04:21.959> up<00:04:22.109> in<00:04:22.229> my<00:04:22.320> dorm<00:04:22.560> room<00:04:22.650> which<00:04:23.070> are

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
speaker's up in my dorm room which are

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.600 
speaker's up in my dorm room which are
the<00:04:23.250> ones<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.460> are<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.639> little<00:04:23.849> bit<00:04:23.940> nicer<00:04:24.270> um

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
the ones that are a little bit nicer um

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.279 
the ones that are a little bit nicer um
the<00:04:26.610> speaker's<00:04:27.000> themselves<00:04:27.510> work<00:04:27.720> being<00:04:27.990> for

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
the speaker's themselves work being for

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.589 
the speaker's themselves work being for
more<00:04:28.590> bottoming<00:04:28.979> out<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.419> amplifier<00:04:30.419> was

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
more bottoming out the amplifier was

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:31.969 
more bottoming out the amplifier was
clipping<00:04:30.870> as<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.229> was<00:04:31.320> reaching<00:04:31.590> its<00:04:31.680> limits

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
clipping as it was reaching its limits

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.740 
clipping as it was reaching its limits
and<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.580> think<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.030> was<00:04:33.150> right<00:04:33.360> around<00:04:33.389> the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
and I think that was right around the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.570 
and I think that was right around the
3/4<00:04:34.349> mark<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:34.919> was<00:04:35.039> like<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.370> was<00:04:35.460> right

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
3/4 mark so it was like it was right

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.710 
3/4 mark so it was like it was right
around<00:04:35.849> right<00:04:36.210> around<00:04:36.479> there<00:04:36.720> about<00:04:37.440> um<00:04:38.720> just

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
around right around there about um just

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.120 
around right around there about um just
you<00:04:39.900> know<00:04:39.930> put<00:04:40.139> in<00:04:40.229> perspective<00:04:40.380> on<00:04:40.800> how<00:04:40.919> loud

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
you know put in perspective on how loud

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.580 
you know put in perspective on how loud
it<00:04:41.310> goes<00:04:41.460> for<00:04:42.030> other<00:04:42.690> speakers<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.660> can<00:04:46.440> show

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
it goes for other speakers so I can show

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.070 
it goes for other speakers so I can show
you<00:04:46.650> now<00:04:46.740> with<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.639> that<00:04:48.419> was<00:04:48.599> this<00:04:48.720> just

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
you now with the that was this just

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.779 
you now with the that was this just
direct<00:04:49.410> sound<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:50.220> was<00:04:50.310> like<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.699> would

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
direct sound so that was like it would

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.219 
direct sound so that was like it would
didn't<00:04:50.970> pass<00:04:51.150> through<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.539> bass<00:04:51.750> or<00:04:52.020> treble

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
didn't pass through the bass or treble

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.680 
didn't pass through the bass or treble
or<00:04:52.410> anything<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:53.340> here's<00:04:53.699> a<00:04:53.970> weak<00:04:54.449> and<00:04:54.539> I'll

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
or anything so here's a weak and I'll

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.189 
or anything so here's a weak and I'll
just<00:04:54.840> show<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:54.990> real<00:04:55.229> quick<00:04:55.470> um<00:04:57.110> when<00:04:58.110> you

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
just show you real quick um when you

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.219 
just show you real quick um when you
push<00:04:58.380> this<00:04:58.530> in<00:04:58.740> now<00:04:58.919> you<00:04:59.460> do<00:04:59.669> hear<00:04:59.940> as<00:05:00.229> nuts

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
push this in now you do hear as nuts

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.550 
push this in now you do hear as nuts
that's<00:05:01.560> out<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.190> then<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:02.610> is<00:05:02.729> in<00:05:02.909> I<00:05:03.560> don't

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
that's out and then this is in I don't

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.290 
that's out and then this is in I don't
know<00:05:04.650> if<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:04.800> can<00:05:04.919> hear<00:05:05.099> it<00:05:05.159> on<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.300> camera

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
know if you can hear it on the camera

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.379 
know if you can hear it on the camera
but<00:05:06.659> there's<00:05:07.289> actually<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:08.250> little<00:05:08.970> bit<00:05:09.120> of

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
but there's actually a little bit of

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.379 
but there's actually a little bit of
feedback<00:05:09.690> on<00:05:10.289> little<00:05:11.280> white<00:05:11.430> noise<00:05:11.669> that<00:05:12.210> for

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
feedback on little white noise that for

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.640 
feedback on little white noise that for
some<00:05:12.539> reason<00:05:12.570> is<00:05:12.990> played<00:05:13.289> through<00:05:13.560> the

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
some reason is played through the

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.100 
some reason is played through the
speaker<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.550> doesn't<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:15.630> doesn't<00:05:15.900> get<00:05:15.990> any

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
speaker it doesn't it doesn't get any

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.080 
speaker it doesn't it doesn't get any
louder<00:05:16.320> if<00:05:16.770> you<00:05:17.220> turn<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.490> volume<00:05:17.610> up<00:05:17.880> it's

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
louder if you turn the volume up it's

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.490 
louder if you turn the volume up it's
just<00:05:18.240> it's<00:05:18.419> just<00:05:18.570> kind<00:05:18.720> of<00:05:18.750> always<00:05:18.990> there<00:05:19.199> um

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
just it's just kind of always there um

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.290 
just it's just kind of always there um
it's<00:05:20.130> not<00:05:20.220> you<00:05:20.520> know<00:05:20.550> it's<00:05:20.669> not<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:20.789> huge<00:05:21.090> deal

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
it's not you know it's not a huge deal

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.879 
it's not you know it's not a huge deal
because<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:22.110> know<00:05:22.199> you<00:05:22.289> can<00:05:22.380> only<00:05:22.440> hear<00:05:22.740> when

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
because you know you can only hear when

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.219 
because you know you can only hear when
the<00:05:22.979> volume<00:05:23.190> is<00:05:23.310> extremely<00:05:23.729> low<00:05:23.969> but<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:25.080> know

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
the volume is extremely low but you know

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.650 
the volume is extremely low but you know
I<00:05:25.639> guess<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:26.760> still<00:05:26.909> could<00:05:27.000> be<00:05:27.150> improved<00:05:27.419> so

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
I guess it still could be improved so

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.920 
I guess it still could be improved so
here<00:05:29.500> I'll<00:05:29.620> play<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:29.860> now<00:05:30.070> with<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.300> tone

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
here I'll play it now with the tone

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.570 
here I'll play it now with the tone
enabled<00:05:33.270> so<00:05:34.950> let's<00:05:35.950> turn<00:05:36.160> it<00:05:36.280> around<00:05:36.340> there<00:05:36.850> um

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
enabled so let's turn it around there um

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.610 
enabled so let's turn it around there um
turn<00:05:39.580> these<00:05:39.730> both<00:05:39.910> down<00:05:40.150> here<00:05:41.140> so<00:05:41.410> here's

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
turn these both down here so here's

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.760 
turn these both down here so here's
here's<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.890> bass<00:05:42.070> knob<00:05:46.200> to<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:47.230> bass<00:05:47.470> goes

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
here's the bass knob to the bass goes

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.440 
here's the bass knob to the bass goes
off<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.160> treble<00:05:48.490> knob<00:05:51.300> troubled<00:05:52.300> what's

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
off and the treble knob troubled what's

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.890 
off and the treble knob troubled what's
up<00:05:52.800> so<00:05:54.570> you<00:05:55.570> know<00:05:55.660> pretty<00:05:56.020> cool<00:05:56.260> um<00:05:57.900> it's

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
up so you know pretty cool um it's

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.430 
up so you know pretty cool um it's
pretty<00:05:59.050> it's<00:05:59.260> pretty<00:05:59.350> neat<00:05:59.620> functionality<00:06:00.280> um

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
pretty it's pretty neat functionality um

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.220 
pretty it's pretty neat functionality um
so<00:06:02.440> I<00:06:02.470> mean<00:06:02.650> all<00:06:02.800> in<00:06:02.920> all<00:06:03.040> I<00:06:03.960> really<00:06:04.960> like<00:06:05.140> this

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
so I mean all in all I really like this

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.440 
so I mean all in all I really like this
amplifier<00:06:05.850> you<00:06:06.850> know<00:06:06.940> you<00:06:07.000> only<00:06:07.150> it's<00:06:07.390> only

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
amplifier you know you only it's only

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.480 
amplifier you know you only it's only
twenty<00:06:08.260> or<00:06:08.320> twenty<00:06:08.530> five<00:06:08.590> dollars<00:06:09.070> you<00:06:09.220> know

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
twenty or twenty five dollars you know

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.360 
twenty or twenty five dollars you know
it's<00:06:09.580> pretty<00:06:09.760> cheap<00:06:09.940> in<00:06:10.450> terms<00:06:10.510> of<00:06:10.810> amplifiers

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
it's pretty cheap in terms of amplifiers

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.600 
it's pretty cheap in terms of amplifiers
you<00:06:12.370> know<00:06:12.460> it<00:06:12.730> also<00:06:12.880> has<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.540> uh<00:06:14.160> mp3<00:06:15.160> or<00:06:15.430> audio

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
you know it also has the uh mp3 or audio

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.580 
you know it also has the uh mp3 or audio
error<00:06:16.150> headphone<00:06:16.570> input<00:06:16.780> which<00:06:17.200> I<00:06:17.350> really

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
error headphone input which I really

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.360 
error headphone input which I really
like<00:06:17.800> also<00:06:18.250> and<00:06:19.080> it's<00:06:20.080> a<00:06:20.170> lot<00:06:20.320> more<00:06:20.530> powerful<00:06:20.890> a

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
like also and it's a lot more powerful a

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.860 
like also and it's a lot more powerful a
lot<00:06:21.850> more<00:06:22.060> robust<00:06:22.540> than<00:06:23.200> the<00:06:23.260> kinter<00:06:24.630> um<00:06:25.630> I

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
lot more robust than the kinter um I

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.120 
lot more robust than the kinter um I
don't<00:06:26.050> I<00:06:26.140> don't<00:06:26.290> know<00:06:26.350> if<00:06:26.440> I<00:06:26.500> did<00:06:26.650> mention<00:06:26.860> this

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
don't I don't know if I did mention this

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:33.120 
don't I don't know if I did mention this
but<00:06:27.880> inside<00:06:28.660> it<00:06:28.930> it<00:06:29.220> has<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.720> TA<00:06:31.830> 2020<00:06:32.830> audio

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
but inside it it has the TA 2020 audio

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.570 
but inside it it has the TA 2020 audio
chip<00:06:33.400> you<00:06:34.390> know<00:06:34.510> hence<00:06:34.720> the<00:06:34.900> name<00:06:35.020> LP<00:06:35.620> 2020<00:06:36.220> eh

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
chip you know hence the name LP 2020 eh

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.790 
chip you know hence the name LP 2020 eh
um<00:06:38.100> so<00:06:39.100> you<00:06:39.160> know<00:06:39.340> it<00:06:39.460> is<00:06:39.550> it<00:06:39.820> is<00:06:40.410> really<00:06:41.410> giving

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
um so you know it is it is really giving

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.370 
um so you know it is it is really giving
me<00:06:41.830> 20<00:06:42.190> watts<00:06:42.370> per<00:06:42.700> channel<00:06:43.020> which<00:06:44.020> is<00:06:44.050> really

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
me 20 watts per channel which is really

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.200 
me 20 watts per channel which is really
nice<00:06:44.530> because<00:06:45.430> you<00:06:45.610> know<00:06:45.640> I<00:06:45.700> looked<00:06:45.940> up<00:06:46.060> the

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
nice because you know I looked up the

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.490 
nice because you know I looked up the
chip<00:06:46.630> and<00:06:46.780> that's<00:06:46.840> you<00:06:47.290> know<00:06:47.380> the

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
chip and that's you know the

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.310 
chip and that's you know the
manufacturer<00:06:48.040> ratings<00:06:48.370> on<00:06:48.490> the<00:06:48.580> chip<00:06:48.760> itself

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
manufacturer ratings on the chip itself

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.180 
manufacturer ratings on the chip itself
so<00:06:50.320> all<00:06:50.380> in<00:06:50.560> all<00:06:50.680> it's<00:06:50.830> a<00:06:50.890> pretty<00:06:51.040> good

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
so all in all it's a pretty good

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.500 
so all in all it's a pretty good
amplifier<00:06:51.550> I<00:06:51.760> would<00:06:52.030> definitely<00:06:52.390> recommend

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
amplifier I would definitely recommend

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.960 
amplifier I would definitely recommend
it<00:06:52.960> to<00:06:53.200> someone<00:06:53.440> who's<00:06:53.830> looking<00:06:54.190> to<00:06:54.220> power<00:06:54.490> on

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
it to someone who's looking to power on

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.160 
it to someone who's looking to power on
a<00:06:55.390> mid<00:06:55.900> sized<00:06:56.140> speaker<00:06:56.710> which<00:06:57.700> you<00:06:57.940> know<00:06:58.060> uh<00:06:58.270> it

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 
a mid sized speaker which you know uh it

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.720 
a mid sized speaker which you know uh it
definitely<00:06:59.530> can<00:06:59.650> power<00:06:59.800> this<00:07:00.100> full<00:07:00.490> volume

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:00.730 
definitely can power this full volume

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.770 
definitely can power this full volume
and<00:07:01.150> it<00:07:01.960> could<00:07:02.170> power<00:07:02.380> my<00:07:03.270> tower<00:07:04.270> speakers

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
and it could power my tower speakers

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.840 
and it could power my tower speakers
probably<00:07:05.410> I'd<00:07:05.650> say<00:07:05.860> about<00:07:06.010> half<00:07:06.310> their

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
probably I'd say about half their

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.820 
probably I'd say about half their
maximum<00:07:07.300> volume<00:07:07.720> because<00:07:08.260> I<00:07:08.350> put<00:07:08.530> them<00:07:08.680> up<00:07:08.800> to

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
maximum volume because I put them up to

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.530 
maximum volume because I put them up to
it<00:07:08.980> more<00:07:09.220> powerful<00:07:09.520> amp<00:07:09.820> to<00:07:10.030> you<00:07:10.270> know<00:07:10.360> see

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:10.540 
it more powerful amp to you know see

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.010 
it more powerful amp to you know see
what<00:07:10.570> they<00:07:10.750> really<00:07:10.930> sound<00:07:11.260> like<00:07:11.320> um<00:07:12.810> so<00:07:13.810> I<00:07:13.840> mean

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
what they really sound like um so I mean

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.300 
what they really sound like um so I mean
if<00:07:14.140> you<00:07:14.230> guys<00:07:14.350> have<00:07:14.620> any<00:07:14.770> questions<00:07:14.920> about

if you guys have any questions about

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.160 
if you guys have any questions about
this<00:07:15.670> or<00:07:15.940> you<00:07:16.090> won't<00:07:16.240> meet<00:07:16.360> a<00:07:16.420> videotape<00:07:16.930> some
