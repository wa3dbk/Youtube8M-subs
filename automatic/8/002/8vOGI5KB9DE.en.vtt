00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
to come through and in hopes that maybe

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.720 
to come through and in hopes that maybe
in<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.870> couple<00:03:45.900> years<00:03:46.260> while<00:03:47.010> we<00:03:47.220> do<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.550> again

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
in a couple years while we do this again

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.199
