00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that but it was it was a it was a very

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.630

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
yard games and i thought all three backs

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
yard games and i thought all three backs
did<00:01:23.280> real<00:01:23.460> well<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.509> offensive<00:01:24.750> line<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
did real well and the offensive line to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.289 
did real well and the offensive line to
get<00:01:25.110> job<00:01:25.290> blocking<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:25.939> you<00:01:26.939> know<00:01:27.030> Kelly

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
get job blocking but you know Kelly

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.990 
get job blocking but you know Kelly
started<00:01:28.189> Trey<00:01:29.189> got<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.520> most<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> time<00:01:29.939> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
started Trey got up most the time I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
started Trey got up most the time I
think<00:01:30.150> prey<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> touchdowns<00:01:30.900> at

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
think prey on all the touchdowns at

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.069 
think prey on all the touchdowns at
least<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.950> offense<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:33.270> Fozzy<00:01:33.689> course

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
least on offense and then Fozzy course

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.359 
least on offense and then Fozzy course
came<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.409> thought<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.680> three<00:01:34.950> backs<00:01:35.189> did<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
came in I thought all three backs did a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.109

really<00:01:35.520> good<00:01:35.670> job<00:01:35.729> all<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.600> ram<00:01:36.810> ran<00:01:37.200> hard

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
note because we did have the game

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.060 
note because we did have the game
covered<00:04:29.310> until<00:04:29.880> until<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.450> happens<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:31.070> no

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
covered until until that happens so no

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.770 
covered until until that happens so no
that<00:04:32.250> was<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.520> know<00:04:32.550> just<00:04:32.610> no<00:04:33.300> mistakes<00:04:33.630> like

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780

that that you don't want to see but I

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
that that you don't want to see but I
don't<00:04:35.430> think<00:04:35.550> things<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:35.910> will<00:04:36.030> be<00:04:36.120> making

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
don't think things that will be making

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.630 
don't think things that will be making
mistakes<00:04:37.290> we<00:04:37.410> won't<00:04:37.590> be<00:04:37.650> making<00:04:37.830> in<00:04:38.400> bigger

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
mistakes we won't be making in bigger

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.060 
mistakes we won't be making in bigger
and<00:04:38.820> more<00:04:38.970> meaningful<00:04:39.120> games<00:04:39.540> so<00:04:40.170> with<00:04:40.980> all

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070

don't know we got to see a whole lot
from<00:05:02.460> him<00:05:02.550> because<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.630> center<00:05:03.900> was<00:05:04.050> terrible

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440
