00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
tried like changing the fuse and stuff

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.240 
tried like changing the fuse and stuff
and<00:01:43.020> checking<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> lights<00:01:43.649> last<00:01:43.860> night<00:01:44.040> but

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.380 
and checking the lights last night but
i'm<00:01:44.310> pretty<00:01:44.430> sure<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> whole<00:01:44.850> string<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.240> just

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
i'm pretty sure the whole string is just

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.090 
i'm pretty sure the whole string is just
dead<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.869> they're<00:01:46.500> literally<00:01:46.799> like

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
dead because they're literally like

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.210 
dead because they're literally like
older<00:01:47.640> than<00:01:47.820> dirt<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.360> yep<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.680> today<00:01:50.070> I'm
