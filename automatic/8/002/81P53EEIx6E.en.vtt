and it gives me energy yeah we don't

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.529 
and it gives me energy yeah we don't
like<00:01:41.959> we<00:01:42.140> don't<00:01:42.259> like<00:01:42.469> gummy<00:01:42.740> worms<00:01:43.509> before<00:01:44.509> a

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
like we don't like gummy worms before a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.219 
like we don't like gummy worms before a
racist<00:01:45.079> or<00:01:45.920> before<00:01:46.369> games<00:01:46.640> but<00:01:47.149> you<00:01:47.780> know<00:01:47.959> I

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
racist or before games but you know I

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.050 
racist or before games but you know I
think<00:01:48.500> he'd<00:01:48.829> probably<00:01:49.130> came<00:01:49.399> in<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.640> little<00:01:49.700> bit

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
think he'd probably came in a little bit

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.389 
think he'd probably came in a little bit
quicker<00:01:50.420> faster<00:01:51.110> if<00:01:51.590> he<00:01:51.739> doesn't<00:01:51.979> win<00:01:52.069> 8<00:01:52.280> the

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
quicker faster if he doesn't win 8 the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.100 
quicker faster if he doesn't win 8 the
gummy<00:01:52.610> bears<00:01:52.939> but<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.179> can't<00:01:53.450> complain<00:01:53.630> with
