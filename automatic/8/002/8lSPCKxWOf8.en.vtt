00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
interesting is that there seems to be an

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.140 
interesting is that there seems to be an
orthodoxy<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.359> even<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.900> religious<00:02:49.409> dogma

you can certainly say that the God of

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.610 
you can certainly say that the God of
the<00:03:26.519> Bible<00:03:26.549> cannot<00:03:27.389> be<00:03:27.540> proved<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.959> be<00:03:27.989> true<00:03:28.290> if

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the Bible cannot be proved to be true if

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.680 
the Bible cannot be proved to be true if
there<00:03:28.889> is<00:03:29.280> no<00:03:29.609> proof<00:03:29.879> for<00:03:29.940> something<00:03:30.540> we

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
there is no proof for something we

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.719 
there is no proof for something we
should<00:03:30.930> not<00:03:31.079> believe<00:03:31.409> it<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.829> more<00:03:32.370> people

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
should not believe it and more people

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.699 
should not believe it and more people
have<00:03:32.909> been<00:03:33.060> killed<00:03:33.389> in<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.900> name<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.260> religion

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
have been killed in the name of religion

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.250 
have been killed in the name of religion
for<00:03:35.159> something<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.639> cannot<00:03:35.879> be<00:03:35.940> proved<00:03:36.599> than

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
for something that cannot be proved than

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.920 
for something that cannot be proved than
for<00:03:37.470> any<00:03:37.620> other<00:03:37.739> reason<00:03:37.949> and<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.609> think<00:03:39.540> that

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
for any other reason and I think that

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.569 
for any other reason and I think that
many<00:03:40.139> people<00:03:40.560> might<00:03:40.859> be<00:03:41.040> pleased<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.489> know

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
many people might be pleased to know

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.939 
many people might be pleased to know
there<00:03:41.849> is<00:03:41.879> no<00:03:42.299> God<00:03:42.329> there's<00:03:42.780> no<00:03:42.989> person<00:03:43.799> watch

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
there is no God there's no person watch

I<00:05:38.919> think<00:05:39.160> children<00:05:39.340> should<00:05:39.550> be<00:05:39.820> allowed<00:05:40.090> to

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
I think children should be allowed to

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.640 
I think children should be allowed to
grow<00:05:40.419> up<00:05:40.510> and<00:05:40.690> make<00:05:40.870> these<00:05:41.020> decisions<00:05:41.410> for

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
grow up and make these decisions for

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.820 
grow up and make these decisions for
themselves<00:05:42.419> so<00:05:43.419> a<00:05:43.450> six<00:05:43.780> year<00:05:43.900> a<00:05:44.050> lot<00:05:44.800> of

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
themselves so a six year a lot of

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.550 
themselves so a six year a lot of
children<00:05:45.310> grow<00:05:45.490> up<00:05:45.520> in<00:05:45.820> great<00:05:46.030> fear<00:05:46.539> they<00:05:47.410> grew

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
children grow up in great fear they grew

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.590 
children grow up in great fear they grew
up<00:05:47.590> in<00:05:47.800> great<00:05:47.950> fear<00:05:48.250> for<00:05:48.430> example<00:05:48.820> of<00:05:48.940> how<00:05:49.120> and

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
up in great fear for example of how and

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.050 
up in great fear for example of how and
I<00:05:50.530> think<00:05:50.770> that<00:05:50.919> is<00:05:51.100> you<00:05:51.400> should<00:05:51.610> be<00:05:51.640> afraid

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
I think that is you should be afraid

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.560 
I think that is you should be afraid
eles<00:05:52.630> not<00:05:52.810> a<00:05:52.840> fun<00:05:53.080> place<00:05:53.229> yeah<00:05:54.390> not<00:05:55.390> great

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
eles not a fun place yeah not great

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.920 
eles not a fun place yeah not great
about<00:05:55.950> I<00:05:57.060> mean<00:05:58.060> I<00:05:58.210> think<00:05:58.419> that<00:05:58.600> this<00:05:58.720> is<00:05:58.900> a

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
about I mean I think that this is a

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.140 
about I mean I think that this is a
primitive<00:05:59.200> notion<00:06:00.039> and<00:06:00.340> it's<00:06:00.520> very<00:06:00.789> harmful

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
primitive notion and it's very harmful

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.469 
primitive notion and it's very harmful
to<00:06:01.360> small<00:06:01.720> children<00:06:01.960> to<00:06:02.410> have<00:06:03.160> ideas<00:06:03.970> that<00:06:04.060> are

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
to small children to have ideas that are

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.540 
to small children to have ideas that are
that<00:06:04.600> fearful<00:06:05.020> inculcated<00:06:05.919> in<00:06:06.070> them<00:06:06.250> by<00:06:06.370> their

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
that fearful inculcated in them by their

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.070 
that fearful inculcated in them by their
parents<00:06:06.970> and<00:06:07.060> their<00:06:07.240> churches<00:06:07.479> have<00:06:07.810> you<00:06:07.900> had
