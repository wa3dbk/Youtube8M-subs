pro<00:02:44.530> retina<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:45.519> first<00:02:45.849> thing<00:02:46.090> was<00:02:46.569> that<00:02:46.840> it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
pro retina the first thing was that it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.600 
pro retina the first thing was that it
didn't<00:02:47.260> blow<00:02:47.380> me<00:02:47.560> away<00:02:47.590> immediately<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.549> was

didn't blow me away immediately this was
something<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.060> i<00:02:49.180> noticed<00:02:49.599> i<00:02:49.660> was<00:02:49.780> like

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
something that i noticed i was like

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.960 
something that i noticed i was like
expecting<00:02:50.799> it<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.069> sort<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.310> come<00:02:51.519> out<00:02:51.640> at<00:02:51.790> me

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
expecting it to sort of come out at me

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.210 
expecting it to sort of come out at me
it<00:02:52.329> didn't<00:02:52.720> do<00:02:52.810> any<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:53.079> that<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.920> one<00:02:54.069> of<00:02:54.099> the

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
it didn't do any of that but one of the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.550 
it didn't do any of that but one of the
things<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.940> did<00:02:55.150> do<00:02:55.390> when<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.260> get<00:02:56.410> up

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
things that it did do when you get up

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.289 
things that it did do when you get up
close<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:56.890> when<00:02:57.250> when<00:02:57.549> I<00:02:57.579> got<00:02:57.790> close<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
close and when when I got close to the

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.900 
close and when when I got close to the
macbook<00:02:58.599> pro<00:02:58.750> when<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:58.989> was<00:02:59.170> using<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.910> almost

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
macbook pro when I was using it almost

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.440 
macbook pro when I was using it almost
like<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.530> usable<00:03:02.530> kind<00:03:02.829> of<00:03:02.920> effect<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.000> way<00:03:04.150> I

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
like a usable kind of effect and way I

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.420 
like a usable kind of effect and way I
was<00:03:05.230> blown<00:03:05.500> away<00:03:05.530> with<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.069> display

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
was blown away with that display

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.789 
was blown away with that display
ultimately<00:03:07.329> it's<00:03:07.780> just<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.650> know<00:03:08.680> it's

of the the graphic detail come across in
that<00:03:20.980> display<00:03:21.190> it's<00:03:21.489> really<00:03:21.819> something<00:03:22.000> you

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
that display it's really something you

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.970 
that display it's really something you
have<00:03:22.389> to<00:03:22.420> see<00:03:22.600> I'm<00:03:23.350> going<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.530> compare<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:23.950> with

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
have to see I'm going to compare it with

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.879 
have to see I'm going to compare it with
my<00:03:24.190> 13-inch<00:03:24.760> MacBook<00:03:25.239> Pro<00:03:25.450> my<00:03:25.690> macbook<00:03:26.440> pro<00:03:26.650> is

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
my 13-inch MacBook Pro my macbook pro is

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.970 
my 13-inch MacBook Pro my macbook pro is
a<00:03:27.239> 2010<00:03:28.239> model<00:03:28.569> just<00:03:28.989> have<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.260> look<00:03:29.500> at<00:03:29.769> the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
a 2010 model just have a look at the

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.309 
a 2010 model just have a look at the
thickness<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.519> my<00:03:30.609> display<00:03:31.269> alright<00:03:32.109> and

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
thickness of my display alright and

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.030 
thickness of my display alright and
compare<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.099> with<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.910> new<00:03:34.560> macbook<00:03:35.560> pro

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
compare that with the new macbook pro

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.220 
compare that with the new macbook pro
retina<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.849> that's<00:03:37.389> where<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.750> magic<00:03:37.900> is

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
retina and that's where the magic is

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.849 
retina and that's where the magic is
that<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.980> display<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.639> really<00:03:40.299> really<00:03:40.450> thin

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
that the display is really really thin

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.099 
that the display is really really thin
and<00:03:41.859> again<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:42.910> can<00:03:42.940> compare<00:03:43.389> it<00:03:43.510> with<00:03:43.569> my

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
and again you can compare it with my

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.170 
and again you can compare it with my
13-inch<00:03:44.709> macbook<00:03:45.040> pro<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:45.790> isn't<00:03:46.030> going<00:03:46.120> to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
13-inch macbook pro this isn't going to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.180 
13-inch macbook pro this isn't going to
come<00:03:46.359> across<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:46.959> do<00:03:47.079> justice<00:03:47.500> on<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.799> camera

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
come across and do justice on the camera

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.250 
come across and do justice on the camera
but<00:03:48.220> when<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.329> compare<00:03:49.540> them<00:03:49.930> side-by-side

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
but when you compare them side-by-side

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.220 
but when you compare them side-by-side
if<00:03:50.919> you're<00:03:51.099> looking<00:03:51.430> at<00:03:51.519> them<00:03:51.730> from<00:03:51.970> afar<00:03:52.230> you

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
if you're looking at them from afar you

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.470 
if you're looking at them from afar you
will<00:03:53.380> notice<00:03:54.000> there<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.180> slight<00:03:55.419> difference

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
will notice there is a slight difference

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.379 
will notice there is a slight difference
but<00:03:55.959> it's<00:03:56.079> not<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.470> substantial<00:03:57.099> difference

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
but it's not a substantial difference

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.120 
but it's not a substantial difference
the<00:03:58.389> big<00:03:58.720> difference<00:03:59.200> right<00:03:59.319> is<00:03:59.680> when<00:04:00.010> you

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
the big difference right is when you

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.220 
the big difference right is when you
come<00:04:00.370> up<00:04:00.579> close<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.299> it's<00:04:01.480> again<00:04:01.959> it's<00:04:01.989> like

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
come up close and it's again it's like

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.409 
come up close and it's again it's like
comparing<00:04:02.380> it<00:04:02.829> with<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.430> new<00:04:03.880> version<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.329> the

comparing it with the new version of the
mac<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.900> ipad<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.760> older<00:04:07.150> ipad<00:04:07.510> 2<00:04:07.720> this

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
mac the ipad and the older ipad 2 this

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.479 
mac the ipad and the older ipad 2 this
is<00:04:07.930> something<00:04:08.349> that<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.590> only<00:04:08.859> notice<00:04:09.130> when

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
is something that you only notice when

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.670 
is something that you only notice when
you<00:04:09.579> stop<00:04:09.970> using<00:04:10.239> it<00:04:10.510> or<00:04:10.930> when<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.349> use

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
you stop using it or when you use

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.720 
you stop using it or when you use
another<00:04:12.639> display<00:04:13.510> or<00:04:13.720> another<00:04:13.959> screen

from<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.780> production<00:04:20.349> process<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:20.919> that

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
from the production process so that

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.920 
from the production process so that

means the display in the new macbook

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.709 
means the display in the new macbook
retina<00:04:23.140> is<00:04:23.590> actually<00:04:23.979> up<00:04:24.130> closer<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.969> you<00:04:25.450> see
