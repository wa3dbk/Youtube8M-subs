you<00:02:27.060> guys<00:02:27.240> are<00:02:27.480> designing<00:02:27.900> vehicles<00:02:28.500> do<00:02:28.860> you

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you guys are designing vehicles do you

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.010 
you guys are designing vehicles do you
guys<00:02:29.070> keep<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:29.670> mind<00:02:29.880> pet<00:02:30.090> safety<00:02:30.420> or<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.900> it

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
guys keep in mind pet safety or is it

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.200 
guys keep in mind pet safety or is it
just<00:02:31.140> overall<00:02:31.710> safety<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.370> think<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:32.880> overall

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
just overall safety I think it's overall

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.480 
just overall safety I think it's overall
safety<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.500> know<00:02:34.560> pet<00:02:34.770> safety<00:02:35.010> goes<00:02:35.250> hand

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
safety and you know pet safety goes hand

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.950 
safety and you know pet safety goes hand
in<00:02:35.610> hand<00:02:35.670> through<00:02:36.240> when<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.570> design<00:02:36.930> a

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
in hand through when you design a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.690 
in hand through when you design a
vehicle<00:02:37.410> like<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.680> borrego<00:02:37.920> if<00:02:38.550> you're

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
vehicle like the borrego if you're

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.010 
vehicle like the borrego if you're
looking<00:02:38.970> at<00:02:39.060> its<00:02:39.240> cargo<00:02:39.480> carrying

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
looking at its cargo carrying

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.510 
looking at its cargo carrying
capabilities<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.130> put<00:02:41.310> extra

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
capabilities and so you put extra

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.400 
capabilities and so you put extra
d-rings<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.240> back<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.690> those<00:02:43.110> are<00:02:43.140> used

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
d-rings in the back and those are used

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.500 
d-rings in the back and those are used
as<00:02:43.530> fasteners<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.280> pet<00:02:44.880> carriers<00:02:45.300> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
as fasteners for pet carriers and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.360 
as fasteners for pet carriers and
whatnot<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.110> noticed<00:02:46.710> that<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.980> kia

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
whatnot so I noticed that the kia

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.700 
whatnot so I noticed that the kia
borrego<00:02:47.670> here<00:02:48.240> has<00:02:48.450> these<00:02:48.810> d-rings<00:02:49.110> what

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
borrego here has these d-rings what

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.530 
borrego here has these d-rings what
other<00:02:49.920> features<00:02:50.400> does<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.760> Kia<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.270> that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
other features does the Kia have that

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.330 
other features does the Kia have that
made<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.020> one<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.260> your<00:02:52.410> winners<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.100> list

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
made it one of your winners on the list

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.760 
made it one of your winners on the list
the<00:02:53.850> borrego<00:02:54.180> actually<00:02:54.810> also<00:02:55.200> has<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.590> back

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
the borrego actually also has the back

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.070 
the borrego actually also has the back
up<00:02:55.950> camera<00:02:55.980> now<00:02:56.820> there<00:02:57.420> are<00:02:57.600> hundreds<00:02:57.990> of

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
up camera now there are hundreds of

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.350 
up camera now there are hundreds of
children<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.680> pets<00:02:58.920> backed<00:02:59.430> over<00:02:59.760> each<00:03:00.090> year

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
children and pets backed over each year

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.590 
children and pets backed over each year
so<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.690> back<00:03:00.930> up<00:03:01.140> camera<00:03:01.560> was<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.770> key<00:03:02.250> feature

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
so that back up camera was a key feature

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.540 
so that back up camera was a key feature
d-ring<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.870> back-end<00:03:04.290> SUV<00:03:05.040> area<00:03:05.310> actually

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
d-ring this back-end SUV area actually

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.330 
d-ring this back-end SUV area actually
has<00:03:06.000> five<00:03:06.630> d-rings<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.070> wouldn't<00:03:08.310> have

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
has five d-rings so you wouldn't have

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.640 
has five d-rings so you wouldn't have
any<00:03:08.430> trouble<00:03:08.700> tethering<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.510> pets<00:03:09.810> or<00:03:10.260> an
