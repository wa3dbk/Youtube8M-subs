00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
one we're going to be talking about is

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.580 
one we're going to be talking about is
the<00:00:28.230> iron<00:00:28.760> bomber<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.600> here<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.350> stats

the iron bomber so here are the stats

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.170 
the iron bomber so here are the stats
for<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> iron<00:00:32.070> bomber<00:00:32.279> grenades<00:00:32.699> have<00:00:32.940> very

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
for the iron bomber grenades have very

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.780 
for the iron bomber grenades have very
little<00:00:33.360> bounce<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.870> roll<00:00:33.930> -<00:00:34.830> 10<00:00:35.040> %<00:00:35.340> damage<00:00:35.640> on

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
little bounce and roll - 10 % damage on

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.389 
little bounce and roll - 10 % damage on
grenades<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.269> explode<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.660> timer<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.290> -<00:00:37.920> 20

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
grenades that explode on timer and - 20

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.870 
grenades that explode on timer and - 20
%<00:00:38.730> explosion<00:00:39.360> radius<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.340> means<00:00:41.640> is

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
% explosion radius so what this means is

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.819 
% explosion radius so what this means is
it's<00:00:42.090> not<00:00:42.329> really<00:00:42.630> the<00:00:42.870> best<00:00:42.899> gun<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.530> using

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it's not really the best gun to be using

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's not really the best gun to be using
for<00:00:43.860> spamming<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:45.180> would<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.450> better<00:00:45.719> off

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
for spamming you would be better off

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
for spamming you would be better off
with<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.440> stock<00:00:46.829> grenade<00:00:47.130> launcher<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
with the stock grenade launcher for that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760 
with the stock grenade launcher for that
as<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:48.030> grenades<00:00:48.420> don't<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.320> roll<00:00:49.590> they

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
as these grenades don't really roll they

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.080 
as these grenades don't really roll they
just<00:00:49.950> kind<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.130> stay<00:00:50.370> put<00:00:50.610> when<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.850> put<00:00:51.000> them

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
just kind of stay put when you put them

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.229 
just kind of stay put when you put them
down<00:00:51.300> similar<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> sticky<00:00:52.590> bomb<00:00:52.739> launcher

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
down similar to the sticky bomb launcher

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
down similar to the sticky bomb launcher
so<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.510> way<00:00:54.629> I'm<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.110> seeing<00:00:55.290> this<00:00:55.440> weapon

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
so the way I'm really seeing this weapon

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.190 
so the way I'm really seeing this weapon
used<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.420> direct<00:00:57.719> hits

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
used is going for direct hits

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.209 
used is going for direct hits
just<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.649> would<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.950> Lock<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
just like you would with the Lock and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.830 
just like you would with the Lock and
Load<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.789> does<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> little<00:01:00.210> bit<00:01:00.420> less<00:01:00.600> more

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
Load it does a little bit less more

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.690 
Load it does a little bit less more
damage<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.379> less<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> little<00:01:01.980> bit<00:01:02.070> less<00:01:02.340> more

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
damage a less a little bit less more

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.930 
damage a less a little bit less more
damage<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.660> does<00:01:03.930> less<00:01:04.229> damage<00:01:04.610> but<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.759> does

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
damage it does less damage but it does

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.139 
damage it does less damage but it does
have<00:01:06.119> more<00:01:06.450> rounds<00:01:07.410> in<00:01:07.500> its<00:01:07.770> clip<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.670> that's

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
have more rounds in its clip so that's

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.460 
have more rounds in its clip so that's
the<00:01:09.360> benefit<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.229> kind<00:01:10.440> of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the benefit of it and that's kind of

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.219 
the benefit of it and that's kind of
what<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:10.679> saying<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.690> moving<00:01:12.690> on<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.110> next

in my opinion so here are the stats for

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.870 
in my opinion so here are the stats for
the<00:01:28.200> quicky<00:01:28.470> bomb<00:01:28.649> launcher<00:01:28.830> 0.2<00:01:29.490> seconds

the quicky bomb launcher 0.2 seconds

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
enemies sticky bombs max charge time

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.710 
enemies sticky bombs max charge time
decreased<00:01:34.380> by<00:01:34.500> 50%<00:01:34.830> sticky<00:01:35.819> bombs<00:01:36.060> fizzle<00:01:36.539> 2

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
decreased by 50% sticky bombs fizzle 2

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.400 
designed to be used as the sticky bomb
it<00:01:47.399> used<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.819> be<00:01:47.940> used<00:01:48.119> there<00:01:48.660> were<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.110> couple

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
it used to be used there were a couple

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.889 
it used to be used there were a couple
of<00:01:49.590> nerfs<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.670> stock<00:01:51.179> sticky<00:01:51.750> bomb

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
of nerfs to the stock sticky bomb

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.419 
of nerfs to the stock sticky bomb
launcher<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.920> update

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
launcher in this update

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.279 
launcher in this update
so<00:01:53.550> this<00:01:54.060> weapon<00:01:54.420> has<00:01:54.569> kind<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.840> been<00:01:54.929> designed

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
so this weapon has kind of been designed

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.669 
so this weapon has kind of been designed
to<00:01:55.410> fill<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.950> gap<00:01:56.190> there<00:01:56.459> as<00:01:56.640> less<00:01:57.420> shots<00:01:58.349> in

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
to fill the gap there as less shots in

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.490 
to fill the gap there as less shots in
the<00:01:58.800> clip<00:01:59.160> and<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.729> does<00:01:59.880> less<00:02:00.119> damage<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.599> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the clip and it does less damage but you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.089 
the clip and it does less damage but you
are<00:02:01.739> able<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.450> detonate<00:02:03.450> your<00:02:03.840> bombs<00:02:04.099> sooner

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
are able to detonate your bombs sooner

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.279 
are able to detonate your bombs sooner
so<00:02:05.759> here's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.330> quick<00:02:06.569> side-by-side

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
so here's a quick side-by-side

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.889 
so here's a quick side-by-side
comparison<00:02:08.069> stock<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> left<00:02:09.330> quickie

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
comparison stock on the left quickie

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.750 
comparison stock on the left quickie
bomb<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> right<00:02:10.530> as<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.160> see<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
bomb on the right as you can see the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.240 
bomb on the right as you can see the
quickie<00:02:12.150> bomb<00:02:12.330> launcher<00:02:12.569> does<00:02:13.349> explode<00:02:14.010> a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
quickie bomb launcher does explode a

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.619 
quickie bomb launcher does explode a
little<00:02:14.849> bit<00:02:14.969> faster<00:02:15.540> than<00:02:15.719> the<00:02:16.019> stock<00:02:16.620> about

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
little bit faster than the stock about

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.270 
little bit faster than the stock about
0.14<00:02:18.629> seconds

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
0.14 seconds

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.090 
0.14 seconds
and<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.450> stats<00:02:21.750> they<00:02:22.020> point<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.920> course

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
and the stats they point to so of course

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.410 
and the stats they point to so of course
there's<00:02:23.370> probably<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> little<00:02:23.790> bit<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> human

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
there's probably a little bit of human

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.059 
there's probably a little bit of human
error<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.959> there<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.350> my<00:02:25.380> part

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
error in there on my part

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.640 
error in there on my part
but<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:27.270> obvious<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.170> quickie<00:02:28.500> bomb

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
but it's obvious that the quickie bomb

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.610 
but it's obvious that the quickie bomb
launcher<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.220> quicker<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.790> detonate<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.290> this

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
launcher is quicker to detonate and this

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.080 
launcher is quicker to detonate and this
can<00:02:31.800> come<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:31.980> pretty<00:02:32.250> handy<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.910> few

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
can come in pretty handy in a few

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.550 
can come in pretty handy in a few
different<00:02:33.390> scenarios<00:02:33.540> just<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.440> one

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
different scenarios just like this one

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.960 
different scenarios just like this one
you're<00:02:34.680> seeing<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.069> screen<00:02:35.100> come<00:02:35.880> around

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
you're seeing on the screen come around

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.580 
you're seeing on the screen come around
this<00:02:36.150> corner<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.480> bunch<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.959> different<00:02:37.320> enemies

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
this corner a bunch of different enemies

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.590 
this corner a bunch of different enemies
I'm<00:02:37.800> able<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.220> get<00:02:38.400> off<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.820> bunch<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.420> these

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
I'm able to get off a bunch of these

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.600 
I'm able to get off a bunch of these
sticky<00:02:39.900> bombs<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.380> detonate<00:02:40.950> them<00:02:41.160> all<00:02:41.400> and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
sticky bombs and detonate them all and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.940 
sticky bombs and detonate them all and
deal<00:02:42.120> out<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.450> massive<00:02:43.020> amount<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.350> damage<00:02:43.590> as

there with the iron bomber and with the
stock<00:02:47.940> sticky<00:02:48.390> launcher<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.810> know<00:02:48.930> maybe<00:02:49.170> I

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
stock sticky launcher you know maybe I

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.050 
stock sticky launcher you know maybe I
wouldn't<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:49.739> had<00:02:49.860> time<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.550> detonate<00:02:50.910> those

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
wouldn't have had time to detonate those

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.460 
wouldn't have had time to detonate those
maybe<00:02:51.300> they<00:02:51.480> would<00:02:51.569> have<00:02:51.660> noticed<00:02:51.870> me<00:02:52.140> before

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
maybe they would have noticed me before

maybe they would have noticed me before
who<00:02:53.070> knows<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.580> can't<00:02:53.790> really<00:02:53.970> say<00:02:54.209> for

certain but I am happy that I had the

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.830 
certain but I am happy that I had the
quicker<00:02:57.510> detonation<00:02:58.290> time<00:02:58.530> there<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.840> what

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
quicker detonation time there so what

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.060 
quicker detonation time there so what
else<00:03:00.959> can<00:03:01.140> i<00:03:01.170> really<00:03:01.440> say<00:03:01.590> about<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.890> weapon

else can i really say about this weapon

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.610 
else can i really say about this weapon
it's<00:03:02.310> extremely<00:03:02.880> fun<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.120> use<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.690> with<00:03:04.440> the

sticky bombs fizzling out after just a
couple<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:07.140> seconds<00:03:07.500> it's<00:03:07.709> really<00:03:08.130> not<00:03:08.250> when

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
couple of seconds it's really not when

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
couple of seconds it's really not when
those<00:03:08.550> weapons<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:08.940> know<00:03:09.030> where<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.209> set<00:03:09.420> up
