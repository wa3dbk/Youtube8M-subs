this<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.970> an<00:00:06.090> instructional<00:00:06.899> video<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.790> how<00:00:08.790> to

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
this is an instructional video on how to

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.130 
this is an instructional video on how to
tape<00:00:09.930> a<00:00:10.320> wafer<00:00:11.010> using<00:00:11.400> UV<00:00:11.550> dicing<00:00:12.150> tape<00:00:12.390> and<00:00:12.660> a

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.140 
tape a wafer using UV dicing tape and a

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.390 
tape a wafer using UV dicing tape and a
tape<00:00:13.410> mounter<00:00:14.750> our<00:00:15.750> first<00:00:16.080> step<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:17.070> take<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
tape mounter our first step is to take a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.320 
tape mounter our first step is to take a
tie<00:00:17.850> back<00:00:18.150> sheet<00:00:18.570> Tyvek<00:00:19.470> disk<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.330> we're

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
tie back sheet Tyvek disk and we're

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.740 
tie back sheet Tyvek disk and we're
going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.539> Center<00:00:22.110> it<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.440> to<00:00:23.070> our<00:00:23.510> mounter<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
going to Center it on to our mounter and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.980 
going to Center it on to our mounter and
we<00:00:24.930> tape<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.650> down

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.950 

now<00:00:29.560> this<00:00:29.859> is<00:00:30.160> basically<00:00:30.759> to<00:00:31.269> protect<00:00:31.779> the

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
now this is basically to protect the

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.000 
now this is basically to protect the
device<00:00:32.140> side<00:00:32.710> of<00:00:33.100> our<00:00:33.340> wafer<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:35.680> are<00:00:35.800> going<00:00:35.949> to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
device side of our wafer we are going to

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.450 
device side of our wafer we are going to
take<00:00:36.790> our<00:00:37.449> wafer<00:00:37.899> that<00:00:38.410> we<00:00:38.530> have<00:00:38.739> here<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.280> can

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
take our wafer that we have here you can

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.729 
take our wafer that we have here you can
see<00:00:39.699> that<00:00:40.000> one<00:00:40.180> side<00:00:40.480> is<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.989> device<00:00:41.290> and<00:00:41.590> the

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
see that one side is the device and the

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.819 
see that one side is the device and the
other<00:00:41.890> side<00:00:42.219> is<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.579> backside<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.379> we<00:00:44.500> place

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
other side is the backside so we place

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.049 
other side is the backside so we place
our<00:00:45.250> wafer<00:00:45.550> device<00:00:46.300> side<00:00:46.659> down<00:00:47.730> onto<00:00:48.730> the

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
our wafer device side down onto the

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.590 
our wafer device side down onto the
tie-back<00:00:49.449> sheet<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:50.079> protect

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
tie-back sheet to protect

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.430 
tie-back sheet to protect
next<00:00:53.380> we<00:00:53.560> take<00:00:53.590> our<00:00:54.040> film<00:00:54.370> frame<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:56.290> we

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
next we take our film frame and we

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.130 
next we take our film frame and we
Center<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.040> onto<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.120> wafer<00:00:58.270> onto<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:58.960> mount

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
Center it onto the wafer onto the mount

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.160 
Center it onto the wafer onto the mount
er

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
er

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.840 
er
we<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:02.010> take<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:03.180> cleanroom<00:01:03.870> wipe<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.850> you're

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
we then take a cleanroom wipe and you're

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.140 
we then take a cleanroom wipe and you're
going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.360> wipe<00:01:06.659> off<00:01:06.960> any<00:01:07.229> particles<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
going to wipe off any particles on the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.440 
going to wipe off any particles on the
backside<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.960> your<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:13.640> next<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.119> our

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
backside of your way next we have our

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.260 
backside of your way next we have our
tape<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> shiny<00:01:17.970> so

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
tape you can see that the shiny so

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.510 
tape you can see that the shiny so
there's<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.690> shiny<00:01:19.080> side<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.070> other<00:01:20.160> side

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
there's a shiny side and the other side

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.580 
there's a shiny side and the other side
is<00:01:20.970> dull<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.720> shiny<00:01:21.960> side<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.320> our<00:01:22.560> liner<00:01:22.860> side

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.950 

we<00:01:27.130> take<00:01:27.460> a<00:01:27.909> razor<00:01:28.299> blade<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:29.829> slice<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
we take a razor blade and we slice the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.910 
we take a razor blade and we slice the
corner<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.530> tape

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
corner of the tape

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.649 
corner of the tape
now<00:01:33.009> you<00:01:33.070> don't<00:01:33.369> slice<00:01:33.729> all<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.210> way<00:01:34.329> through

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
now you don't slice all the way through

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.429 
now you don't slice all the way through
but<00:01:34.899> just<00:01:35.350> enough<00:01:35.710> for<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:36.789> to<00:01:37.479> peel<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.079> tape

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
but just enough for you to peel the tape

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:49.050 
but just enough for you to peel the tape
away<00:01:39.039> from<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.820> liner

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.460 

take<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.780> piece<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.170> tape<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:51.460> tape<00:01:51.850> back

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
take a piece of tape and you tape back

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.929 
take a piece of tape and you tape back
one<00:01:53.470> side<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:54.100> take<00:01:54.369> back<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.970> liner<00:01:56.310> next<00:01:57.310> we

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
one side you take back the liner next we

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.950 
one side you take back the liner next we
have<00:01:58.119> our<00:01:58.149> tape<00:01:59.970> we<00:02:00.970> are<00:02:01.000> going<00:02:01.329> to<00:02:01.539> lay<00:02:01.780> it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
have our tape we are going to lay it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.620 
have our tape we are going to lay it
flat<00:02:02.409> on<00:02:02.799> sim<00:02:03.159> mounter<00:02:03.640> this<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:04.030> sticky<00:02:04.390> side

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
flat on sim mounter this is sticky side

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.919
