the enemies respawn and you can run back
down<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> pathway<00:01:43.500> again<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> I'll<00:01:44.250> explain

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
down the pathway again and I'll explain

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120 
down the pathway again and I'll explain
the<00:01:45.180> technique<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.630> little<00:01:45.720> bit<00:01:45.930> later<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.770> um

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
the technique a little bit later but um

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
the technique a little bit later but um
the<00:01:47.759> best<00:01:48.000> part<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.600> technique<00:01:49.049> with

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the best part about this technique with

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.530 
the best part about this technique with
Toco<00:01:49.710> Toco<00:01:49.890> z'<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> pretty<00:01:51.299> good

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
Toco Toco z' is you have a pretty good

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.319 
Toco Toco z' is you have a pretty good
chance<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.140> finding<00:01:52.799> two<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.460> them<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.820> combats

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
chance of finding two of them in combats

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
chance of finding two of them in combats
when<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.869> run<00:01:55.110> into<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.040> world<00:01:56.280> map

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
when you run into one on the world map

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.719 
when you run into one on the world map
so<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:57.210> net<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.390> around<00:01:58.729> 17,000

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
so that will net you around 17,000

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.880 
so that will net you around 17,000
experience<00:02:00.210> which<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.540> pretty<00:02:00.899> damn<00:02:01.200> close<00:02:01.560> to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
experience which is pretty damn close to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.340 
experience which is pretty damn close to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.740 
eight oco-2 cold in the ivory tower and
the<00:02:04.500> best<00:02:04.710> part<00:02:04.920> about<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:06.420> method

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the best part about that is this method

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.320 
the best part about that is this method
takes<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.590> lot<00:02:07.920> less<00:02:08.280> time<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:08.879> farming<00:02:09.239> the
