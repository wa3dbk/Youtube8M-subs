high fives and shakes and again we're
going<00:00:17.109> to<00:00:17.199> use<00:00:17.410> our<00:00:17.650> clicker<00:00:17.980> training

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
going to use our clicker training

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.089 
going to use our clicker training
technique<00:00:18.939> like<00:00:19.119> we've<00:00:19.330> used<00:00:19.539> before<00:00:20.099> Dasher

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
technique like we've used before Dasher

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.010 
technique like we've used before Dasher
was<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.430> star<00:00:21.699> of<00:00:21.730> or<00:00:22.150> frisbee<00:00:22.630> catching

and again our object is to mark the

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.069 
and again our object is to mark the
behavior<00:00:32.649> that<00:00:32.680> we<00:00:33.010> want<00:00:33.280> so<00:00:34.030> if<00:00:34.210> I<00:00:34.390> see<00:00:34.660> him<00:00:34.870> do

when I know he reliably does that over
and<00:01:36.490> over<00:01:36.550> again<00:01:36.790> then<00:01:37.270> I'll<00:01:37.450> put<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.690> command

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
and over again then I'll put a command

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.640 
and over again then I'll put a command
to<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.390> what<00:01:43.630> we're<00:01:43.780> actually<00:01:43.960> working<00:01:44.350> on

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
to it and what we're actually working on

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.930 
to it and what we're actually working on
right<00:01:44.890> now<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:46.690> shake<00:01:47.020> part<00:01:47.580> not<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.610> high

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
right now is the shake part not the high

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:58.500 
right now is the shake part not the high
five<00:01:49.210> yet<00:01:52.110> good<00:01:53.110> boy

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.900 

now<00:01:59.200> when<00:01:59.740> you're<00:01:59.890> training<00:02:00.160> your<00:02:00.340> dog<00:02:00.610> it's

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
now when you're training your dog it's

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.670 
now when you're training your dog it's
important<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.570> try<00:02:01.840> things<00:02:01.900> in<00:02:02.380> different

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
important to try things in different

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.580 
important to try things in different
places<00:02:03.010> we've<00:02:03.910> been<00:02:04.060> doing<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.720> same<00:02:04.930> place

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
places we've been doing the same place

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.950 
places we've been doing the same place
I'm<00:02:05.980> going<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.400> move<00:02:06.550> a<00:02:06.670> little<00:02:06.850> bit<00:02:06.970> have<00:02:07.660> him

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
I'm going to move a little bit have him

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.960 
I'm going to move a little bit have him
move<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.500> then<00:02:08.680> we'll<00:02:08.860> go<00:02:09.040> and<00:02:09.220> start<00:02:09.580> doing

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
move and then we'll go and start doing

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.540 
move and then we'll go and start doing
it<00:02:10.090> again<00:02:10.390> this<00:02:11.320> way<00:02:11.500> dogs<00:02:11.860> not<00:02:12.130> used<00:02:12.400> to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
it again this way dogs not used to

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.460 
it again this way dogs not used to
always<00:02:12.790> being<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:13.330> one<00:02:13.660> area<00:02:13.990> when<00:02:14.320> they're

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
always being in one area when they're

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.320 
always being in one area when they're
trained<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.280> then<00:02:15.490> it'll<00:02:15.640> only<00:02:15.850> do<00:02:16.150> that

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
trained and then it'll only do that

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.150 
trained and then it'll only do that
behavior<00:02:16.810> in<00:02:16.960> that<00:02:17.140> one<00:02:17.320> area<00:02:17.350> it's<00:02:17.830> always

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
behavior in that one area it's always

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.680 
behavior in that one area it's always
important<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> train<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.210> many<00:02:19.420> different
