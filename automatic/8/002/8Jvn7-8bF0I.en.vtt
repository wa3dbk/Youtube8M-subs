so<00:01:57.360> don't<00:01:58.050> really<00:01:58.470> worry<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.220> looks<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
so don't really worry if it looks a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.300 
so don't really worry if it looks a
little<00:01:59.790> plain<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.840> too<00:02:01.200> thick<00:02:01.650> or<00:02:01.920> whatever

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
little plain or too thick or whatever

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.910 
little plain or too thick or whatever
because<00:02:03.000> when<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.900> wash<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.380> again<00:02:04.470> it'll

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
because when we wash it again it'll

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.070 
because when we wash it again it'll
really<00:02:05.220> kind<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.150> make<00:02:06.420> those<00:02:06.630> whites

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
really kind of make those whites

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.600 
really kind of make those whites
bit<00:02:08.259> more<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.920> we're<00:02:12.040> going<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.190> move<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.550> to

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
bit more then we're going to move on to

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.080 
bit more then we're going to move on to
edge<00:02:13.450> highlighting<00:02:14.080> once<00:02:14.440> more<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.910> did

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
edge highlighting once more and I did

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.700 
edge highlighting once more and I did
say<00:02:16.270> we<00:02:16.450> are<00:02:16.540> going<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.750> be<00:02:16.840> washing<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.410> again

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
say we are going to be washing it again

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.610 
say we are going to be washing it again
so<00:02:18.430> that'll<00:02:19.060> bring<00:02:19.300> down<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.960> tone<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.500> this

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
so that'll bring down this tone and this

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.190 
so that'll bring down this tone and this
is<00:02:20.830> just<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.550> mix<00:02:21.910> between<00:02:22.090> narla<00:02:22.660> green<00:02:22.990> and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
is just a mix between narla green and

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.730 
is just a mix between narla green and
camo<00:02:23.530> green<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.690> going<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.170> really

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
camo green and this is going to really

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.400 
camo green and this is going to really
make<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.670> edges<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.330> armorer<00:02:28.750> stand<00:02:29.200> out

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
make the edges of the armorer stand out

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.290 
make the edges of the armorer stand out
a<00:02:29.710> little<00:02:29.950> bit<00:02:30.160> more<00:02:30.340> which<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.670> important

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
a little bit more which is important

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.550 
a little bit more which is important
when<00:02:31.420> you're<00:02:31.510> playing<00:02:31.720> with<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.990> tabletop

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
left eye you have to go across the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.400

bridge of the nose so that's going to be

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.710 
bridge of the nose so that's going to be
horrible<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.250> do<00:03:30.460> so<00:03:30.700> flip<00:03:30.940> them<00:03:31.120> upside<00:03:31.570> down

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
horrible to do so flip them upside down

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.190 
horrible to do so flip them upside down
it'll<00:03:31.990> really<00:03:32.170> help<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:34.390> then<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.720> just<00:03:35.020> kind

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
it'll really help and then I just kind

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.830 
it'll really help and then I just kind
of<00:03:35.320> fill<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:36.610> raised<00:03:36.970> area<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.810> eye

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
of fill in the raised area of the eye

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.690 
of fill in the raised area of the eye
but<00:03:38.740> and<00:03:40.260> most<00:03:41.260> models<00:03:41.890> will<00:03:42.070> have<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> slight

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
but and most models will have a slight

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.660 
but and most models will have a slight
raised<00:03:43.030> area<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:44.200> just<00:03:44.410> like<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.860> hit<00:03:45.430> that

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
raised area and I just like to hit that

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.480 
raised area and I just like to hit that
with<00:03:46.180> white<00:03:47.020> now<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.620> trick<00:03:47.860> here<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.130> not<00:03:48.460> to

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
with white now the trick here is not to

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.970 
with white now the trick here is not to
push<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:48.940> down<00:03:49.210> too<00:03:49.540> hard<00:03:49.570> just<00:03:50.380> enough<00:03:50.770> that

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
push it down too hard just enough that

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.380 
push it down too hard just enough that
the<00:03:51.190> raised<00:03:51.490> area<00:03:52.230> gets<00:03:53.230> gets<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.160> white<00:03:54.400> so

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
the raised area gets gets the white so

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.970 
the raised area gets gets the white so
as<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.570> can<00:03:55.720> see<00:03:55.900> here<00:03:56.170> I'm<00:03:56.470> just<00:03:56.620> using<00:03:56.830> a
