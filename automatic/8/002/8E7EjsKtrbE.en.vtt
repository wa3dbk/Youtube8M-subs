00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 
it's made from bristle and hair but it's

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.310 
it's made from bristle and hair but it's
has<00:00:08.990> a<00:00:09.070> rounded<00:00:10.070> shape<00:00:10.480> to<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:11.660> end<00:00:12.049> of<00:00:12.259> the

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.249 
has a rounded shape to the end of the
brush<00:00:12.559> but<00:00:13.219> also<00:00:13.539> the<00:00:14.539> top<00:00:14.749> and<00:00:14.959> bottom

brush but also the top and bottom

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.390 
brush but also the top and bottom
actually<00:00:15.619> tapers<00:00:16.780> to<00:00:17.780> a<00:00:17.810> point<00:00:17.900> like<00:00:18.320> that<00:00:18.860> so

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
actually tapers to a point like that so

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.270 
actually tapers to a point like that so
there's<00:00:19.670> an<00:00:20.000> angle<00:00:20.420> here<00:00:20.780> and<00:00:20.960> an<00:00:21.740> angle<00:00:22.130> on

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
there's an angle here and an angle on

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.730 
there's an angle here and an angle on
the<00:00:22.400> other<00:00:22.520> side<00:00:25.060> so<00:00:26.060> it's<00:00:26.240> a<00:00:26.560> rounded<00:00:27.560> brush

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740

the other side so it's a rounded brush
with<00:00:28.580> no<00:00:28.610> straight<00:00:29.450> edges<00:00:31.809> it's<00:00:32.809> quite<00:00:33.290> a

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
with no straight edges it's quite a

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.310 
with no straight edges it's quite a
