00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.900 
low range and this is the plug 1.1 and
when<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.170> got<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.560> thing<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.099> was<00:00:29.340> really

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you can kill people from mid range from

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.100 
you can kill people from mid range from
long<00:01:14.580> range<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> them<00:01:15.360> even<00:01:15.479> your

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
long range some of them even your

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
long range some of them even your
testing<00:01:16.590> out<00:01:16.710> snipers<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> need

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
testing out snipers you know you need

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.999 
testing out snipers you know you need
maybe<00:01:18.000> need<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.390> burst<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.229> kill<00:01:19.380> sniper<00:01:19.680> but

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
maybe need to burst to kill sniper but

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.429 
maybe need to burst to kill sniper but
you<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.330> damage<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> arrange<00:01:22.229> it's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
you do a lot of damage and arrange it's

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.990 
you do a lot of damage and arrange it's
actually<00:01:22.740> pretty<00:01:23.040> insane<00:01:23.430> as<00:01:23.580> well<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.850> do

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
actually pretty insane as well you do

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.770 
actually pretty insane as well you do
around<00:01:24.680> 47th<00:01:25.680> 248<00:01:26.430> damage<00:01:26.759> per<00:01:26.970> shot<00:01:27.000> when<00:01:27.570> you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
around 47th 248 damage per shot when you

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.410 
around 47th 248 damage per shot when you
are<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.740> little<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.280> longer<00:01:29.400> ranging<00:01:29.880> may<00:01:30.270> go

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
are a little bit longer ranging may go

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
are a little bit longer ranging may go
further<00:01:30.600> down<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> range<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.470> 36<00:01:32.070> damage

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
further down the range you do 36 damage

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.880 
further down the range you do 36 damage
so<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.420> won't<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> able<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.110> get<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> full

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
so you won't be able to get the full

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.640 
so you won't be able to get the full
kill<00:01:35.159> actually<00:01:35.750> but<00:01:36.750> still<00:01:37.049> man<00:01:37.290> for

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
kill actually but still man for

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.920 
kill actually but still man for
mid-range<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.579> easily<00:01:39.150> kill<00:01:39.780> your

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
mid-range you can easily kill your

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.710 
mid-range you can easily kill your
target<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:41.220> makes<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.670> fusion<00:01:42.299> rifle

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
target and that makes this fusion rifle

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.710 
target and that makes this fusion rifle
kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.920> point<00:01:44.159> why<00:01:44.520> people<00:01:44.939> think<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
kind of the point why people think it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.660 
kind of the point why people think it
should<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:45.960> nervous<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.500> also<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:47.009> saying

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
should be nervous I also as well saying

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.830 
should be nervous I also as well saying
confusion<00:01:48.119> Ravi<00:01:48.270> should<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.630> nerves<00:01:48.840> because

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
confusion Ravi should be nerves because

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.350 
confusion Ravi should be nerves because
fusion<00:01:49.649> arrival<00:01:50.009> should<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.310> close<00:01:50.670> cuales

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
fusion arrival should be close cuales

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.440 
fusion arrival should be close cuales
guns<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:53.549> shotguns<00:01:54.000> actually

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
guns just like the shotguns actually

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.450 
guns just like the shotguns actually
maybe<00:01:54.930> mid<00:01:55.229> range<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.680> course<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.189> still

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
maybe mid range of course they can still

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.340 
maybe mid range of course they can still
take<00:01:56.640> two<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:57.149> three<00:01:57.180> shuttered<00:01:57.869> depends<00:01:58.259> on

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
take two to three shuttered depends on

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.160 
take two to three shuttered depends on
your<00:01:58.469> stability<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:59.159> aim<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.640> skill

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
your stability your aim and your skill

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.050 
your stability your aim and your skill
but<00:02:01.170> overall<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.820> perfect

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
but overall I think this is the perfect

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.300 
but overall I think this is the perfect
example<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.960> people<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.409> mad<00:02:04.710> by<00:02:05.009> fusion

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
example like people get mad by fusion

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.010 
example like people get mad by fusion
rivals<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.360> well<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.659> game<00:02:06.810> place

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.510 
rivals and as well in this game place
you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.259> see<00:02:07.439> sometimes<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.369> get

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
you can see sometimes I just really get

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.460 
you can see sometimes I just really get
out<00:02:08.640> shut<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> charge<00:02:10.170> time

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
out shut but because of the charge time

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.490 
out shut but because of the charge time
and<00:02:10.770> how<00:02:11.550> easy<00:02:11.730> I'm<00:02:11.970> able<00:02:12.239> to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
and how easy I'm able to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.920 
and how easy I'm able to
kill<00:02:12.620> them<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:13.180> stills<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.300> life<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.750> that's

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
kill them I stills of life and that's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.870 
kill them I stills of life and that's
kind<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.260> another<00:02:15.560> way<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.250> future<00:02:16.580> rival

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
kind of another way the future rival

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.610 
kind of another way the future rival
should<00:02:17.090> be<00:02:17.180> played<00:02:17.390> with<00:02:17.600> it's<00:02:18.350> even<00:02:18.470> a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
should be played with it's even a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.260 
should be played with it's even a
legendary<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.490> next<00:02:19.700> something<00:02:19.970> like<00:02:20.120> the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
legendary to the next something like the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.970 
legendary to the next something like the
pocket<00:02:20.630> infinity<00:02:21.050> that<00:02:21.200> weapon<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.500> great<00:02:21.770> and

pocket infinity that weapon is great and
i<00:02:22.040> do<00:02:22.520> should<00:02:22.580> think<00:02:22.970> it's<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:24.320> should<00:02:24.530> be

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
i do should think it's a it should be

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.160 
i do should think it's a it should be
great<00:02:24.890> because<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.730> exotic<00:02:26.270> its<00:02:26.690> heart

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
great because it's a exotic its heart
