00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.089
 good even today in the sound lab 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.030
 machine with valentine to introduce you a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:14.130
 navigation and entertainment system 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:16.590
 on hyundai ix35 we have as you can see here 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.039
 product of perfect integration 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.170
 aesthetic that will allow us through i 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.699
 touch controls to manage functions 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.050
 radio the usb function 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 we have the flash drive we have 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.940
 basically restored the grip 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.570
 original integrating it with the new 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.510
 device we can of course 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.450
 strip the contents of ours 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.550
 music inside the USB stick 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.530
 we have the retrocamera function which 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.860
 will obviously speak to the inclusion that 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.780
 the reverse also removing 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:57.120
 the acoustic effect entertainment 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.730
 this is also a grid that you gave us 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:05.159
 wounded by distance from obstacles 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.170
 we can see in this case that they have 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.880
 also installed a digital terrestrial 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.590
 because we will also have an ntv television 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.380
 we can see in this case the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.399
 dvd cd mp3 player 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.210
 in short, it is usually becoming 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.899
 old but also that there is and the unity of 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.899
 navigation 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.850
 here we obviously have a platform 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.440
 I first call for procedures 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.440
 the insertion of the 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.800
 of the nation are always the same 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.130
 then we access the menu and find 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.600
 we insert our address on 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.300
 any other platform of 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.730
 basically we have navigation 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.290
 also the obviously bluetooth function 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.300
 there is no tour connection on a 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.330
 phone but we can is a bluetooth 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.240
 parrot in this case we can integrate 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.270
 ie download the phone book e 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.430
 also manage music and content 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.500
 of our music library can 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.500
 be transferred to the plant of the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.630
 our car without need without the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.080
 need to attach the device 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.300
 Cable short via bluetooth as 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.500
 says streaming audio we can manage 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.090
 the contents of our library 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.200
 music on our phone and I know 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.700
 well that's it 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.370

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.800

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.430
