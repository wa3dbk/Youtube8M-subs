00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
it's it's critical for something like

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.899 
it's it's critical for something like
this<00:01:13.920> piece<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.430> were<00:01:14.549> talking<00:01:14.700> about

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
this piece here we were talking about

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.700 
this piece here we were talking about
and<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> center

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and you can see right in the center

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.440 
and you can see right in the center
where<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.220> heart<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.610> where<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.150> starting

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
where the heart is where it's starting

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
where the heart is where it's starting
to<00:01:18.600> split<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.140> because<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> moisture<00:01:19.740> can't

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to split it's because the moisture can't

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.429 
to split it's because the moisture can't
get<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.490> fast<00:01:20.909> enough<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:21.840> just

is<00:01:40.380> smaller<00:01:40.829> right<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.570> way<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.840> gets<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
is smaller right so that way it gets it

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.960 
is smaller right so that way it gets it
gives<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.979> little<00:01:44.130> bit<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.430> space<00:01:44.670> dude

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
gives it a little bit of space dude

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.149 
gives it a little bit of space dude
right<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.810> kind<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.110> difficult<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
right it's kind of difficult to the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
it in there and that slows down the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.130 
it in there and that slows down the
drying<00:02:12.940> process<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.540> I've<00:02:13.599> had<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:13.900> piece

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
drying process and I've had this piece

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.339 
drying process and I've had this piece
for<00:02:14.410> probably<00:02:14.890> six<00:02:15.220> or<00:02:15.370> seven<00:02:15.640> years<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.120> it's

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
for probably six or seven years and it's

for probably six or seven years and it's
so<00:02:17.349> what's<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.650> very<00:02:17.860> wet<00:02:18.099> initially<00:02:18.819> when

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
so what's that very wet initially when

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.790 
so what's that very wet initially when
you<00:02:19.030> first<00:02:19.209> got<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.630> yes<00:02:19.810> yeah<00:02:20.140> kind<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:20.500> kind

thing here with this large piece of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.979 
thing here with this large piece of
walnut<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.890> just<00:02:27.099> got<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.700> heart<00:02:27.849> out<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.810> it

walnut I just got the heart out and it
was<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> much<00:02:29.349> much<00:02:29.709> larger<00:02:30.040> log<00:02:30.459> right<00:02:31.300> brought

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
was a much much larger log right brought

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.220 
was a much much larger log right brought
you<00:02:32.290> down<00:02:32.440> some<00:02:32.890> cherry<00:02:33.550> same<00:02:34.330> thing<00:02:34.569> that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
you down some cherry same thing that

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.259 
you down some cherry same thing that
kind<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.500> process<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.400> log<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.849> dipped<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.150> in

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
kind of process the log and dipped it in

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.360 
kind of process the log and dipped it in
wax<00:02:37.890> make<00:02:38.890> out<00:02:39.099> of<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.310> shape<00:02:40.049> actually<00:02:41.370> that

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
wax make out of this shape actually that

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.440 
wax make out of this shape actually that
would<00:02:42.489> probably<00:02:42.610> make<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.910> nice<00:02:43.120> bottle

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
would probably make a nice bottle

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.720 
would probably make a nice bottle
stopper<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:44.019> a<00:02:44.080> little<00:02:44.319> little<00:02:44.830> big<00:02:45.160> but<00:02:45.459> or

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
stopper it's a little little big but or

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.210 
stopper it's a little little big but or
you<00:02:45.790> can<00:02:45.850> make<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> small<00:02:46.330> box<00:02:46.600> yeah<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.769> little

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
you can make a small box yeah a little

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.870 
you can make a small box yeah a little
it<00:02:48.370> box<00:02:49.319> very<00:02:50.319> nice<00:02:50.590> yeah<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.519> kind<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.760> a

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
it box very nice yeah it's kind of a

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.910 
it box very nice yeah it's kind of a
kind<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:52.720> an<00:02:52.840> odd<00:02:52.959> little<00:02:53.170> shape<00:02:53.500> because<00:02:53.739> once

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
kind of an odd little shape because once

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.800 
kind of an odd little shape because once
you<00:02:54.040> get<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:55.060> know<00:02:55.180> square<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.660> up

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
you get it on the you know square it up

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.690 
you get it on the you know square it up
and<00:02:56.470> then<00:02:56.620> put<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.860> on<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.160> lathe<00:02:57.340> you're

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
and then put it on the lathe you're

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.670 
and then put it on the lathe you're
you're<00:02:58.209> probably<00:02:58.390> only<00:02:58.630> getting<00:02:59.019> maybe<00:02:59.319> edge

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
you're probably only getting maybe edge

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.240 
you're probably only getting maybe edge
and<00:02:59.860> out<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.069> two<00:03:00.220> edges<00:03:00.370> yeah<00:03:02.010> yeah

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
and out of two edges yeah yeah

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.320 
and out of two edges yeah yeah
and<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.330> brought<00:03:04.690> down<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.580> bit<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.730> maple

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
and then I brought down a bit of maple

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:15.300 
and then I brought down a bit of maple
burl<00:03:09.630> different<00:03:10.630> projects<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.100> piece<00:03:15.280> of

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
Wow so depending on on what I'm gonna do

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.470 
Wow so depending on on what I'm gonna do
with<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.989> depends<00:03:32.680> on<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:33.609> lot<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.390> do

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
with it it depends on a lot to do

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.720 
with it it depends on a lot to do
without<00:03:34.630> one<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.049> dry<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.319> so<00:03:36.010> four<00:03:36.280> boxes

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
without one that dry it so four boxes

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.910 
without one that dry it so four boxes
little<00:03:37.480> little<00:03:37.900> boxes<00:03:38.260> where<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.560> lid<00:03:38.739> needs

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
little little boxes where the lid needs

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.740 
little little boxes where the lid needs
to<00:03:39.040> fit<00:03:39.190> on<00:03:39.280> nice<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.519> tight<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.389> needs<00:03:40.569> to<00:03:40.630> be

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
to fit on nice and tight it needs to be

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.140 
to fit on nice and tight it needs to be
completely<00:03:41.170> dry<00:03:41.530> okay<00:03:42.040> okay<00:03:42.609> that<00:03:43.000> actually

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
completely dry okay okay that actually

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.150 
completely dry okay okay that actually
is<00:03:43.389> a<00:03:43.450> good<00:03:43.600> point<00:03:43.870> like<00:03:44.290> when<00:03:44.620> do<00:03:44.859> you<00:03:44.950> want<00:03:45.100> to

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
is a good point like when do you want to

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.890 
is a good point like when do you want to
use<00:03:45.310> what<00:03:45.579> wood<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.120> when<00:03:46.389> do<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:46.690> want<00:03:46.840> to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
use what wood and when do you want to

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.680 
use what wood and when do you want to
use<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.019> dry<00:03:47.380> wood<00:03:47.650> okay<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:48.700> if<00:03:49.389> you're

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
use a dry wood okay so if you're

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.740 
use a dry wood okay so if you're
cleaning<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.470> boat<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.519> lot<00:03:51.819> of<00:03:51.880> times<00:03:52.180> they're

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
cleaning a boat a lot of times they're

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.900 
cleaning a boat a lot of times they're
most<00:03:53.200> time<00:03:53.440> they<00:03:53.620> rough<00:03:54.010> turn<00:03:54.310> balls<00:03:54.609> with

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
most time they rough turn balls with

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.870 
most time they rough turn balls with
green<00:03:55.269> so<00:03:55.989> you'll<00:03:56.590> take<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.130> log<00:03:57.400> right<00:03:57.700> off

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
green so you'll take the log right off

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.110 
green so you'll take the log right off
the<00:03:58.060> tree<00:03:58.299> cut<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.319> heart<00:03:59.530> out<00:03:59.680> there<00:03:59.970> put<00:04:00.970> on

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
the tree cut the heart out there put on

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.670 
the tree cut the heart out there put on
the<00:04:01.269> weight<00:04:01.450> turn<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:01.959> that's<00:04:02.139> where<00:04:02.319> you<00:04:02.440> see

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
the weight turn it that's where you see

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.949 
the weight turn it that's where you see
I<00:04:02.920> think<00:04:03.519> you're<00:04:03.760> you're<00:04:04.180> at<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.660> symposium

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
I think you're you're at the symposium

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.530 
I think you're you're at the symposium
and<00:04:05.380> watch<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
and watch the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.470 
and watch the
Robo<00:04:07.440> yes<00:04:08.070> happy<00:04:08.370> guy<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:08.730> those<00:04:09.090> giant

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
Robo yes happy guy and those giant

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.750 
Robo yes happy guy and those giant
shavings<00:04:10.200> coming<00:04:10.470> in<00:04:10.560> very<00:04:10.740> that's<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.520> green

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
shavings coming in very that's a green

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.570 
shavings coming in very that's a green
one<00:04:11.970> very<00:04:12.270> much<00:04:12.570> yeah<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.380> it's<00:04:13.560> it's<00:04:13.950> fun<00:04:14.460> to

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
one very much yeah and it's it's fun to

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.000 
one very much yeah and it's it's fun to
turn<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:15.120> super<00:04:15.540> easy<00:04:15.570> but<00:04:16.320> what<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.859> do

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
turn it's super easy but what the you do

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.250 
turn it's super easy but what the you do
is<00:04:17.040> rough<00:04:17.459> turning<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.450> turn<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:18.870> down<00:04:18.989> and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
is rough turning so you turn it down and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.930 
is rough turning so you turn it down and
leave<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.440> about<00:04:19.650> an<00:04:19.890> inch<00:04:20.040> thick<00:04:20.190> because<00:04:20.670> it

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
leave it about an inch thick because it

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.880 
leave it about an inch thick because it
will<00:04:21.090> shrink<00:04:21.390> that's<00:04:21.720> it'll<00:04:22.140> shrink<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.680> warm

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
will shrink that's it'll shrink and warm

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.160 
will shrink that's it'll shrink and warm
so<00:04:23.460> then<00:04:24.030> there's<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.270> calculation<00:04:24.720> for<00:04:24.870> that<00:04:25.020> I

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
so then there's a calculation for that I

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.050 
so then there's a calculation for that I
think<00:04:25.290> for<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.920> 10<00:04:26.160> inch<00:04:26.340> bowl<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.820> want<00:04:26.940> to

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
think for a 10 inch bowl you want to

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.830 
think for a 10 inch bowl you want to
leave<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.560> interesting<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:28.770> look<00:04:29.250> there's<00:04:29.460> a

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
leave it interesting so look there's a

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.330 
leave it interesting so look there's a
little<00:04:30.840> calculation<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:31.620> very<00:04:31.860> similar<00:04:32.100> just

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
little calculation so very similar just

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.250 
little calculation so very similar just
ceramics<00:04:32.910> in<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.150> sense<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:33.480> ceramics<00:04:34.110> also

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
ceramics in the sense that ceramics also

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.920 
ceramics in the sense that ceramics also
dries<00:04:34.710> acid<00:04:35.490> right<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.360> goes<00:04:36.480> in<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.750> oven

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
dries acid right and it goes in the oven

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.680 
dries acid right and it goes in the oven
and<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.830> wood<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.370> course<00:04:38.610> will<00:04:38.820> dry<00:04:39.030> right

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
and the wood of course will dry right

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.630 
and the wood of course will dry right
that's<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:40.050> choice<00:04:40.230> too<00:04:40.530> how<00:04:40.710> many<00:04:40.860> good<00:04:41.040> people

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
that's a choice too how many good people

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.590 
that's a choice too how many good people
shrink<00:04:42.180> as<00:04:42.450> it<00:04:42.480> dries<00:04:42.810> yes<00:04:43.320> yeah<00:04:43.760> so<00:04:44.760> there's

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
shrink as it dries yes yeah so there's

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.530 
shrink as it dries yes yeah so there's
you<00:04:46.110> can<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:47.160> can<00:04:47.310> rough<00:04:47.520> turn<00:04:47.790> boxes<00:04:48.360> I've

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
you can you can rough turn boxes I've

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.850 
you can you can rough turn boxes I've
seen<00:04:48.750> some<00:04:48.900> people<00:04:49.140> do<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.440> I've<00:04:49.710> never

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
seen some people do that I've never

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.880 
seen some people do that I've never
really<00:04:50.220> tried<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:50.670> always<00:04:51.120> just<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.600> I<00:04:52.440> kind

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
really tried that I always just I I kind

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.240 
really tried that I always just I I kind
of<00:04:52.950> have<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.370> cycle<00:04:53.970> so<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:54.570> you<00:04:55.410> know<00:04:55.530> if<00:04:55.620> I<00:04:55.710> find

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
of have a cycle so I you know if I find

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.590 
of have a cycle so I you know if I find
some<00:04:56.370> way<00:04:56.520> down<00:04:56.700> I'll<00:04:56.910> get<00:04:57.090> it<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.270> start

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
some way down I'll get it and start

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.810 
some way down I'll get it and start
processing<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:58.230> I<00:04:58.410> have<00:04:58.650> behind<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.610> shop

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
processing that I have behind the shop

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.090 
processing that I have behind the shop
there<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.120> have<00:05:00.330> a<00:05:00.360> whole<00:05:00.990> whole<00:05:01.440> system<00:05:01.950> where

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
there I have a whole whole system where

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.380 
there I have a whole whole system where
I<00:05:02.130> just<00:05:02.220> keep<00:05:02.520> kind<00:05:02.669> of<00:05:02.790> moving<00:05:02.970> it<00:05:03.180> forward

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
I just keep kind of moving it forward

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.200 
I just keep kind of moving it forward
until<00:05:03.690> it's<00:05:03.960> dry<00:05:04.230> but<00:05:04.860> for<00:05:05.610> balls<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:06.030> things

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
until it's dry but for balls and things

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.940 
until it's dry but for balls and things
I<00:05:06.390> would<00:05:06.570> rough<00:05:06.780> Turnham<00:05:07.140> green<00:05:07.169> and<00:05:07.710> really

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
I would rough Turnham green and really

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.790 
I would rough Turnham green and really
speeds<00:05:08.400> up<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.700> process<00:05:08.730> so<00:05:09.770> something<00:05:10.770> like

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
speeds up the process so something like

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.730 
speeds up the process so something like
this<00:05:11.040> I've<00:05:11.280> had<00:05:11.400> this<00:05:11.550> for<00:05:12.140> quite<00:05:13.140> a<00:05:13.500> few<00:05:13.650> years

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
this I've had this for quite a few years

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.010 
this I've had this for quite a few years
if<00:05:14.520> I<00:05:14.730> would<00:05:14.880> have<00:05:14.970> taken<00:05:15.210> it<00:05:15.450> right<00:05:15.630> out<00:05:15.990> of

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
if I would have taken it right out of

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.860 
if I would have taken it right out of
the<00:05:16.169> orchard<00:05:17.180> cut<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.300> heart<00:05:18.480> out

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
the orchard cut the heart out

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.840 
the orchard cut the heart out
put<00:05:19.140> a<00:05:19.169> little<00:05:19.350> lathe<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:19.860> green<00:05:20.430> turned<00:05:20.700> it

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
put a little lathe and green turned it

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.880 
put a little lathe and green turned it
it<00:05:21.210> would<00:05:21.360> be<00:05:21.450> ready<00:05:21.690> to<00:05:21.870> go<00:05:22.020> in<00:05:22.169> about<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:22.380> year

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
it would be ready to go in about a year

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.830 
it would be ready to go in about a year
sealing<00:05:23.340> up<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.490> ends<00:05:24.300> is<00:05:24.390> what<00:05:24.600> slows

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
sealing up the ends is what slows

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.719 
sealing up the ends is what slows
everything<00:05:25.380> down<00:05:27.200> right<00:05:28.200> or<00:05:28.650> just<00:05:29.250> green<00:05:29.490> turn

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
everything down right or just green turn

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.020 
everything down right or just green turn
it<00:05:29.880> and<00:05:30.030> then<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.750> goes<00:05:30.900> pretty<00:05:31.110> fast<00:05:31.380> so<00:05:32.220> when

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
it and then it goes pretty fast so when

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.080 
it and then it goes pretty fast so when
I<00:05:33.090> started<00:05:33.419> out<00:05:33.540> I<00:05:33.600> was<00:05:33.750> ya<00:05:34.430> all<00:05:35.430> researching

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
I started out I was ya all researching

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.790 
I started out I was ya all researching
for<00:05:36.240> wood<00:05:36.450> but<00:05:36.600> I<00:05:36.660> didn't<00:05:37.020> get<00:05:37.140> any<00:05:37.290> dry<00:05:37.560> wood

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
for wood but I didn't get any dry wood

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.540 
for wood but I didn't get any dry wood
so<00:05:38.010> it's<00:05:38.400> kind<00:05:38.760> of<00:05:39.620> what<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:40.740> could<00:05:40.890> use<00:05:41.130> right

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
so it's kind of what you could use right

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.460 
so it's kind of what you could use right
and<00:05:41.850> this<00:05:42.030> so<00:05:42.120> I<00:05:42.180> had<00:05:42.300> to<00:05:42.390> buy<00:05:42.570> dry<00:05:42.930> wood<00:05:43.169> until

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
and this so I had to buy dry wood until

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.219 
and this so I had to buy dry wood until
I<00:05:43.500> got<00:05:43.680> this<00:05:44.150> got<00:05:45.150> to<00:05:45.180> that<00:05:45.419> point<00:05:45.630> where<00:05:45.930> I

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
I got this got to that point where I

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.729 
I got this got to that point where I
always<00:05:46.560> have<00:05:46.770> something<00:05:46.979> dry<00:05:47.310> coming<00:05:47.640> up
