00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:08.040
 to travel here and welcome but the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:16.289
 video or tank actor galera shot gun 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:18.720
 jazz has something more pleasurable than 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.369
 You give a cannon shot never walk 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.900
 nothing good to him every type in the game of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.599
 I'm against violence in life. 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.369
 and would not harm any fish at all. 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.470
 unless he is already x signal 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.300
 several fish and I did him harm in the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.140
 Actually I was I who did evil was the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.600
 emergence 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.420
 But you understood I was reading that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.340
 because she wanted me to be the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.020
 remaining the same every wind sucking 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.360
 and fixing them back there 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.320
 This is my second game play the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.850
 bear to the cold from 4 to again thank you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.590
 by and push the team bringing here 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.180
 to play these games, which is my 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.940
 dream play games there were other things 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.320
 also in e3 must have seen videos but 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.420
 Look, this is one of the things I 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.840
 I wanted to show you what the boat is. 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.939
 I here in the case tone is like sniper of the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.409
 boat has a face that makes me miooloid 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.170
 directing why he was not leading 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.810
 program no face is day is the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.450
 buildings not towards the beach I know the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.200
 cool beach I know you wanna be a 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:24.180
 enjoy the bikini vacation sunbathing 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.369
 taking a margarita hilton margarita 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.409
 I do not know I do not know I know is that it's pizza 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.560
 now I'm confused 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.390
 Then I said the police are leaving here. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.939
 but I 'm going to give a lot of shots in the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.740
 caribe that does not die, man, it's one thing 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.770
 I realized that the mouse is very 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.229
 different mouse is different but the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.090
 accessibility and when you are in a new 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.799
 piloting a piece of 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.509
 When you 're aiming normally, it's 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.950
 totally different is seen there when 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.259
 you get off the boat 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.079
 You get a jet ski, which is very crazy. 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.090
 Dude, I got the dial. 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.009
 time to master the point my team lost 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.710
 it was like all the points are 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.509
 lost I said oh no, it's not me 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.799
 In this game, it's not going to be anyone. 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.650
 who was playing on my side 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.680
 including 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.910
 He was from my team too and then I said 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.290
 Beauty, I'll pick up the flag here. 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.690
 it's because I'm Chinese who does not 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.870
 I play the Chinese in the galley and the waist 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.870
 down 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.080
 It's not a joke, not wanting me. 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.760
 The best of the future relaxes but only then I 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.110
 I got the flag, nobody came here. 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.180
 to attack me I think when you 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.150
 dominates the mother 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.740
 the command is old played mass in me is 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.350
 as I said commendation is that guy 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.120
 who has control and the cases there the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.600
 another even on the computer 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.060
 he makes the tactical decisions of the team, right? 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.270
 he got there and decided to send a missile 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.430
 on my neck which was not cool is okay 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.620
 if you do not you're not a good person 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.070
 saw a guy there I started to 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.900
 take it out it can not apply to hair 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.080
 so soon let me stab out 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.670
 So see the names goya gave it to me. 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.110
 me that is what it is and will start killing in 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.640
 I think it must be the relative's touching 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.080
 I was a little nervous there because 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.330
 I 'm finally a knife in his neck . 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.160
 but it is also starting there 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.380
 beauty now which will be the next 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.840
 point that I can already capture civilian 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.360
 I captured 1 and my team and captured the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.739
 Another one I told you about is still being 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.620
 captured let me go back there to 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.910
 ensure that the a will be captured and there 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.500
 I knew them for their 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.550
 parking, I do not know what that is 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.650
 Right? 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.380
 only then my team dominated wonder 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.940
 in tip and even to dominate 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.739
 then the guy shot him and finally 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.709
 finally I managed to kill someone 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.290
 in this game will appear the other and ii was 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.000
 shot off shot ended up even in that km are 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.980
 always ends very fast this game is 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.090
 very annoying that the guy disappeared 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.280
 disappeared I do not understand that it is not 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.500
 taking off that gun I got 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.400
 She was very good although I killed 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.810
 people right? 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.820
 I also noticed that in this game the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.970
 positioning is the most expensive 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.610
 in the kind of reflection you will get 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.200
 well and tetra account counts but it's more the 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.750
 positioning if you get ahead 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.170
 to an enemy pick up from behind sec the edu me 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.170
 you see 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.360
 if you and I will have the advantage if you 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.400
 can kill many and also have to 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.140
 make goal with bea point guys i 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.420
 in that game for example almost does not 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.110
 and nobody but I stayed in first or 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.450
 in second 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.490
 actually who second why I did 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.530
 lots of points capturing the flags that 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.480
 that guy does not die show a car 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.100
 there giving talks galley where the shot 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.630
 palace I came here in the 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.300
 and I'm going to go around behind 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.310
 here because it did not even take the guys 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.110
 mine on me and I would end up dying 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.860
 people watching here in this trap 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.350
 to vii lift and in the game and reminded me 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.210
 an interesting thing that for example 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:59.430
 When are you going to the giant building? 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.620
 You can actually take the elevator. 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.050
 elevator that rises leading up there 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.890
 That 's cool, I was playing doctor. 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.890
 goes to the reason 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.190
 I threw the business there to heal what 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.350
 she spoke with the name of dots 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.720
 I also think that it points to the 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:20.100
 probably tip galley who 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.800
 thing that I 'm talking about there I got the 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.760
 my evil pistol but the guy was over 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:31.290
 of evil still mine gave me the final blow 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:34.890
 and my ox was on vacation this game was me 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.990
 each one interesting is that time 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.280
 passed very fast old and I wanted 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.530
 play but I think I got in line 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.530
 goals four times between promise and 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.919
 record two games unfortunately I stayed 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.840
 twice in big games nor animal 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.330
 or retarded knew how to handle 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.100
 mathematics your stupid character 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.210
 ethnographic commentary appearing to the 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.580
 on youtube there are fruits now I got the 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.530
 way there among others by the most 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.950
 I'm incompetent and I said I'm going to kill 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.620
 he in the pistol in so bad or 11 thousand to 7 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.780
 thousand per customer was then beauty and total 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.730
 from the car with the car I'll get a 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.460
 earth dear mother goes there someone killed 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.620
 before I can get you here, hate 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.270
 hate of those malware ks there appeared a 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.060
 monte carlo was run over but it was 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.460
 Dear friend, I'm very bad to know that it is 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.590
 friend in which the enemy 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.530
 I'm very much in this game, I need 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:30.889
 improve and I think I 'll go back I know 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.720
 I think it's better to play more fps than ever 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.229
 I enjoy when the fps do not know why 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.910
 not already 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.419
 I like RP game r more 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.870
 Such strategy I had when will play 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:41.330
 fsc 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.830
 At least I always have fun there. 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.319
 this stuff that wanted to go through 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.699
 bridge bridge with a tie but not 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:50.930
 Could you pass the bridge then I 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:52.880
 Give up and I'll tell you what to do. 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.330
 I jumped that you can walk normal 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.759
 5 am and Canada krall 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:03.110
 I think I said, can I go up? 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:05.720
 the boat there I was right behind lse well 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.580
 I took one out on the forehead despite 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.970
 be showing that alpha 12 killed 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:14.870
 damn the fabulous and you'll have the 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:17.539
 I'll have porridge, or not, because we 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.789
 lost of playing very bad people 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:21.800
 have had too bad touch this I 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.870
 I was third placed second and 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.599
 Quieter a lot, I was, yes, not only. 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.729
 because I made more points, it 's expensive and if 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:31.009
 says that it's very crazy, it's going to always be 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:33.229
 always cool you get a speedboat and 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:35.090
 climb a real ramp she was like 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:37.159
 no wheel works 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.159
 There you get a boost, but then our 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:42.169
 team lost china was bad with patriot 

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:44.180

 Thank you so much, we'll see the next one. 

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.159
 need for speed Morning anger earned 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.729
 People are going to say that they are going to give a hug. 

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:51.729
 was
