Tahoes s tends summon Zuzu's and all
that<00:00:28.800> kind<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.099> stuff<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:30.439> my<00:00:31.439> girlfriend's

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that kind of stuff so my girlfriend's

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.750 
that kind of stuff so my girlfriend's
dad's<00:00:32.189> truck<00:00:32.840> had<00:00:33.840> an<00:00:34.110> independent<00:00:34.760> problem

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
dad's truck had an independent problem

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.250 
dad's truck had an independent problem
on<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> ABS<00:00:37.250> he<00:00:38.250> would<00:00:38.430> drive<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:39.690> would<00:00:39.960> trip

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
on the ABS he would drive it would trip

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.310 
on the ABS he would drive it would trip
and<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.390> will<00:00:42.540> shut<00:00:42.719> off<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.020> next<00:00:43.290> day

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
and so on and will shut off the next day

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.850 
and so on and will shut off the next day
and<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.570> crazy<00:00:45.809> stuff<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> did

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and and do that crazy stuff so I did

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.380 
and and do that crazy stuff so I did
some<00:00:47.070> tests<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.550> figured<00:00:47.940> out<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
some tests on it figured out it was the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.139 
some tests on it figured out it was the
ABS<00:00:48.780> module<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.559> was<00:00:50.460> gonna<00:00:50.579> take<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.059> this

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
ABS module I was gonna take it to this

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.660 
ABS module I was gonna take it to this
guy<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.390> $80<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.430> what

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
guy for $80 but I was like you know what

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.650 
guy for $80 but I was like you know what
let<00:00:53.969> me<00:00:54.000> give<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> try

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
let me give it a try

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.170 
let me give it a try
and<00:00:55.070> before<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> let<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.670> over<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and before I let it go over there you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.610 
and before I let it go over there you
know<00:00:57.300> always<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.840> learn<00:00:57.989> little<00:00:58.379> small

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
know always want to learn little small

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.040 
know always want to learn little small
stuff<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.129> was<00:00:59.250> doing<00:00:59.480> some<00:01:00.480> research<00:01:00.660> on

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
stuff so I was doing some research on

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.410 
stuff so I was doing some research on
this<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.730> normally<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.850> say<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
this and normally they say that the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.560 
this and normally they say that the
circuit<00:01:03.780> board<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> issue<00:01:08.270> it's<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.390> pain

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
circuit board is the issue it's a pain

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.870 
circuit board is the issue it's a pain
in<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> butt<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.960> take<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.380> off<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:11.700> really

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
in the butt to take this off you really

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.609 
in the butt to take this off you really
have<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.780> careful<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.350> some

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
have to be careful and have some

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.840 
have to be careful and have some
patience<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.360> try<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> pry

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
patience because if you try to pry

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.450 
patience because if you try to pry
probably<00:01:17.850> open<00:01:18.330> too<00:01:18.600> fast

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
probably open too fast

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.070 
probably open too fast
this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.700> silicone<00:01:21.299> right<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.930> gets

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
this is silicone right there it gets

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.510 
this is silicone right there it gets
stuck<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.590> circuit<00:01:22.950> board<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.310> could

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
stuck to the circuit board it could

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.719 
stuck to the circuit board it could
crack<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.909> circuit<00:01:24.270> board<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.430> gotta<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.520> kind

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
crack the circuit board so gotta be kind

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.420 
crack the circuit board so gotta be kind
of<00:01:26.790> careful<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.220> an

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
of careful on that but if you have an

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.730 
of careful on that but if you have an
ABS<00:01:29.909> light<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> Chevy<00:01:30.900> truck<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.530> know<00:01:31.650> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
ABS light on a Chevy truck you know you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.469 
ABS light on a Chevy truck you know you
might<00:01:32.040> want<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> look<00:01:32.490> into<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.299> might

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
might want to look into this this might

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
might want to look into this this might
be<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> issue<00:01:33.840> sometimes<00:01:34.560> they<00:01:34.740> stay<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
be the issue sometimes they stay on the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.999 
be the issue sometimes they stay on the
whole<00:01:35.610> time<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.240> they<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> loud<00:01:37.680> buzzing

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
whole time and they have a loud buzzing

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.719 
whole time and they have a loud buzzing
noise<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.670> know<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.720> cause<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> problem

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
noise you know this can cause a problem

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.609 
noise you know this can cause a problem
but<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:42.180> his<00:01:42.390> truck<00:01:42.630> what<00:01:42.810> he<00:01:42.899> would<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.200> you

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
but on his truck what he would do you

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.109 
but on his truck what he would do you
know<00:01:43.740> you'll<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.280> driving<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:45.030> of

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
know you'll be driving and out of

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:45.530 
know you'll be driving and out of
nowhere

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
nowhere

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.440 
nowhere
I'll<00:01:46.140> ten<00:01:46.380> minutes<00:01:46.680> into<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.070> BAM<00:01:47.700> ABS<00:01:48.240> light

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
I'll ten minutes into it BAM ABS light

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.690 
I'll ten minutes into it BAM ABS light
would<00:01:48.570> turn<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:50.159> you'll<00:01:50.399> turn<00:01:50.549> off

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
would turn on and then you'll turn off

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.960 
would turn on and then you'll turn off
the<00:01:50.820> vehicle<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:52.220> wouldn't<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.579> until

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the vehicle I wouldn't have it on until

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.630 
the vehicle I wouldn't have it on until
a<00:01:54.030> couple<00:01:54.509> minutes<00:01:54.960> later<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.369> would<00:01:56.490> turn

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
a couple minutes later and it would turn

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.980 
a couple minutes later and it would turn
back<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.060> again<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:57.930> of

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
back on again so it's kind of

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.630 
back on again so it's kind of
intermittent<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.770> knew<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.340> something

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
intermittent so I knew it was something

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.649 
intermittent so I knew it was something
to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.360> with<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> soldering<00:02:02.270> let<00:02:03.270> me<00:02:03.360> show<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659

light right here yeah bot see if you
cannot<00:02:18.319> see<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:20.569> try<00:02:21.569> get<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.930> best<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.439> I<00:02:22.560> can

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.610 

that<00:02:29.579> one<00:02:29.969> right<00:02:30.389> there<00:02:30.500> close<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.829> tag

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
that one right there close to the tag

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.559 
that one right there close to the tag
what<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.650> was<00:02:34.889> reading<00:02:35.219> on<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.420> web

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
what I was reading on the on the web

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.899 
what I was reading on the on the web
forms<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.349> ones<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.769> normally<00:02:38.400> mess<00:02:38.579> up<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
forms the ones that normally mess up the

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.449 
forms the ones that normally mess up the
most<00:02:39.120> are<00:02:41.359> over<00:02:42.359> here<00:02:42.829> and<00:02:43.829> those<00:02:44.010> are<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
most are over here and those are the

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.909 
most are over here and those are the
powers<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.829> grounds<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:47.010> then<00:02:47.790> over<00:02:48.419> here

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:48.919 
powers and grounds and then over here

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:55.610 
powers and grounds and then over here
you<00:02:49.919> have<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.189> real<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:53.930> further<00:02:54.930> inspection

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
you have the real a further inspection

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.039 
you have the real a further inspection
there's<00:02:56.280> actually<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> crack<00:02:57.299> on<00:02:59.629> that<00:03:00.629> one

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
there's actually a crack on that one

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.679 
there's actually a crack on that one
right<00:03:01.079> there<00:03:01.560> I'm<00:03:02.280> sorry<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.609> doesn't<00:03:03.389> show<00:03:03.510> up

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
right there I'm sorry I doesn't show up

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.449 
right there I'm sorry I doesn't show up
my<00:03:03.840> camera's<00:03:04.230> not<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.650> yet<00:03:04.859> but<00:03:05.129> there's<00:03:05.370> a

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
my camera's not that yet but there's a

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.119 
my camera's not that yet but there's a
crack<00:03:05.819> right<00:03:06.030> there<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.799> essentially<00:03:07.799> what

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
crack right there and essentially what

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.830 
crack right there and essentially what
happens<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.750> when<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.439> ABS<00:03:10.859> turns<00:03:11.129> on

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
happens is when the ABS turns on

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.679 
happens is when the ABS turns on
stresses<00:03:12.840> out<00:03:13.879> loose<00:03:14.879> Continent<00:03:15.389> loses

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
stresses out loose Continent loses

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.360 
stresses out loose Continent loses
contact<00:03:16.169> for<00:03:16.349> a<00:03:16.379> split<00:03:16.620> second<00:03:17.010> that's<00:03:17.159> that's

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
contact for a split second that's that's

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.740 
contact for a split second that's that's
the<00:03:17.519> code<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:19.879> if<00:03:20.879> you<00:03:21.269> have<00:03:21.449> the<00:03:21.599> patience<00:03:22.109> and

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
the code so if you have the patience and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.360 
the code so if you have the patience and
you<00:03:24.750> know<00:03:24.870> about<00:03:24.989> an<00:03:25.290> hour<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.620> your<00:03:25.769> time<00:03:25.829> and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
you know about an hour of your time and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.949 
you know about an hour of your time and
the<00:03:26.790> solder<00:03:27.090> gun<00:03:27.470> might<00:03:28.470> be<00:03:28.590> able<00:03:28.859> just<00:03:28.889> to

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
the solder gun might be able just to

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.429 
the solder gun might be able just to
clean<00:03:30.959> these<00:03:31.139> up<00:03:31.340> we<00:03:32.340> tap<00:03:32.579> them<00:03:33.169> resolder<00:03:34.169> them

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
clean these up we tap them resolder them

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.599 
clean these up we tap them resolder them
right<00:03:34.560> there<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.359> that<00:03:36.359> should<00:03:36.540> do<00:03:36.659> the<00:03:36.689> fix

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
right there and that should do the fix

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.159 
right there and that should do the fix
hope<00:03:38.609> you<00:03:38.790> liked<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.180> video<00:03:39.329> if<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:39.840> have<00:03:39.989> any

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
hope you liked the video if you have any

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.659 
hope you liked the video if you have any
other<00:03:40.379> questions<00:03:40.829> about<00:03:40.979> this<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.489> can

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
other questions about this I can

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.490 
other questions about this I can
probably<00:03:42.150> write<00:03:42.629> it<00:03:42.810> down<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:42.989> just<00:03:43.259> gotta<00:03:43.409> get

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
probably write it down I just gotta get

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.399 
probably write it down I just gotta get
back<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.829> work<00:03:44.009> but<00:03:44.250> uh<00:03:44.599> subscribe<00:03:45.599> write<00:03:46.229> some
