00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.470
 small boxes video from our channel 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.980
 last pcs today we pack the years 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.960
 aerocool modern as out of that is one 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.699
 fan control stop of aerocool das 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.830
 should be one of the best and also 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.740
 the cheapest and therefore have 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.810
 I also choose me yes I want you 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.350
 wait long chatter but directly 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.050
 to begin 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.689
 here are a few values ​​recorded 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.800
 the fahrenheit and celsius how much 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.879
 the manie pc should turn off or how 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.800
 a lot you can fix that 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.440
 fan control on the back are 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.020
 again is described in more detail 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.780
 I can do everything I can see here 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.120
 but better show it when I get the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.010
 Unpacked because the package is very 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.660
 easy so at least 100 200 grams 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.660
 so it is not really hard 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.659
 then we pack the cardboard is not 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.760
 instructions because I look now first whether 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.760
 who is multilingual and she is 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.750
 she is multilingual and even in 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.470
 German that is very good 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.509
 in white screen and an off sells 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.420
 Drive as reset technical data 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.290
 okay well that I shall be only 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.509
 need 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.810
 I'm described how everything 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:39.060
 So it's really okay to install 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.509
 well well then now arrive to the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.890
 boxing there are definitely many 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.479
 cable here you have it directly the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 fan control i want easy now 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.869
 Here are a lot of cables and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.340
 I'll start by explaining it 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.950
 what's here, so this is where it is 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.950
 white or as y it says that in 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.439
 These students use this heat bulb for 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.190
 hard disk video card motherboard and 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.400
 so on 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.440
 which one should but it would be best 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.940
 not before 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.460
 So the fans do not sting 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.700
 to ask manually for the fans 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.780
 the sensors are not exactly so 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.490
 it may be that she then 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.950
 permanently before that percent or just run 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.390
 to one percent because the sensors are not 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.860
 I do not know exactly how to measure it 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.140
 this one is more with me 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.990
 It was definitely going to sell 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.330
 so you have the regular power connection 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:40.160
 4 pin and here you have the fans 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:45.500
 plug because you have just the normal 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.990
 three spiders are also included 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.740
 So the fans have to be able to do so 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.960
 do not be afraid 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.600
 we are there that means that can 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:00.230
 four fans on so steer from the front 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.580
 So you can not say that 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.400
 we do not look bad that here 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.400
 There is a lot to see, like here 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.090
 are the keys celsius were just 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.240
 Automotor I'll be there last time 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.860
 make this screen slide off but 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.160
 your best on my screen 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.770
 a little bit better I do not know if you 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.770
 you can see is always short 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.930
 now you can see so pale you can see 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.790
 now such a computer case that is 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.690
 probably from the display what 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.920
 is illuminated 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.440
 So now you see through aha that is 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.640
 also a display where no fingerprints 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:47.209
 So it's very good on it 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.940
 here are still bargains and 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.580
 also 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.410
 what are the extension cables too 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.110
 again for more sensors that it 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.990
 Also very good and here are these stickers 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.290
 so that, for example, the cpu-cooler 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:06.430
 You can install these sensors 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:10.210
 keys or sensors for the one would have 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.850
 then yes they come out 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.680
 they come down there then you have to 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.000
 probably expand expand 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.140
 So you can write very well 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.670
 Here I will not need if 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.730
 I just get trapped 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.680
 into the housing 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.120
 so much to unboxing i have here now 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.960
 again the instructions there will be times 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.420
 well written what is what it is 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.540
 also very good 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.550
 otherwise further follows an installation 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.290
 that will come too 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:46.080
 and yes , we'll meet again soon 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.080
 in the installation then believes until the same
