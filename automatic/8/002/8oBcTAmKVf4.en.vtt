I<00:02:01.100> definitely<00:02:02.100> think<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.370> series<00:02:02.760> deserves

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
I definitely think the series deserves

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.590 
I definitely think the series deserves
more<00:02:03.540> attention<00:02:04.760> it's<00:02:05.760> probably<00:02:06.150> in<00:02:06.240> Japan

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
more attention it's probably in Japan

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.889 
more attention it's probably in Japan
but<00:02:06.840> definitely<00:02:07.230> not<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.710> anywhere<00:02:08.130> else<00:02:08.899> does

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
but definitely not so anywhere else does

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.600 
but definitely not so anywhere else does
a<00:02:09.930> shame<00:02:10.260> because<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.740> think<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.070> a<00:02:11.160> real<00:02:11.340> fun
