fine<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.510> touched<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.840> again<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.110> just

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
fine and so I touched it again so I just

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.899 
fine and so I touched it again so I just
gotta<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.830> pop<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.190> back<00:02:05.340> together<00:02:05.490> then<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
gotta just pop it back together then I

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.469 
gotta just pop it back together then I
should<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.119> good<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.640> hopefully<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> pick

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
should be good so hopefully when I pick

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
should be good so hopefully when I pick
back<00:02:09.569> together<00:02:09.750> work<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.830> put<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.250> back

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
back together work I just put it back

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.670 
back together work I just put it back
together<00:02:11.610> little<00:02:12.030> by<00:02:12.209> little<00:02:12.420> until<00:02:12.680> you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
together little by little until you

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.710 
together little by little until you
don't<00:02:13.830> see<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.370> stopped<00:02:14.610> again<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.510> think

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
don't see just stopped again so I think

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.970 
don't see just stopped again so I think
it<00:02:16.020> would<00:02:16.110> be<00:02:16.170> fine<00:02:16.350> if<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.650> put<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.890> back

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
it would be fine if I put it back

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.460 
it would be fine if I put it back
together<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:18.360> know<00:02:18.540> just<00:02:18.780> this
