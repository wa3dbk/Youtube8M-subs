00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.230
Hello and welcome to the Tuesday show

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.030
if you're not familiar, my name is Philip DeFranco

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.530
and this show really isn't a show 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.600
it's just me talking about some of the stuff

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.280
that mattered in the news to me, starting with

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.300
one: I'm a little hungover

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.390
two: today is the 65th anniversary

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.500
of the invention of the two piece bikini

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.660
65 years ago today

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.680
Louis Reard said how could we trick women into wearing

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.700
a bra and panties but outside

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.720
and everyone loved it, best thing

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.760
ever! it's a good

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.800
oh I love girls that are going to have lower back problems

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.830
next up in news that makes me a little

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.860
Charlie Sheen is back in the picture because

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.890
he's going to get roasted on Comedy Central

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.930
and yes this is actually a true story, it's not just something

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.970
Charlie Sheen said like "Oh I'm getting on this show

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.020
and I'm in this movie" no you're not

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.070
Charlie, but you are definitely are on this

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.150
and I can not wait to see

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.230
the line up they get to destroy Charlie Sheen

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.320
but world can we just agree after this roast

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.420
Charlie Sheen just go back to not mattering

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.480
he's not even dating Bree Olson anymore

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.510
you know how annoying it is to look at Bree Olson

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590
get pounded by 80 dudes in videos I watch on the internet

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.610
from time to time and go, eh it's not Charlie Sheen's

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.620
girlfriend anymore, less appealing

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.630
Joe Biden is on twitter

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.680
@VP so that'd be fun to see Joe Biden

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730
make an ass of himself a little more, always a fan

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.780
next up is our douchebag of the day

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.180
and it's a story about a man name Juan Tijerina

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.030
the reason Juan is in the news is because

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.420
he's in jail, and the thing about this Mexican jail he's in

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.460
they allow conjugal visits, which is awesome

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480
if you're going to jail for 20 years, a little vajay goes a long way

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.510
hence why this is even a thing, but

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.530
to make the story more interesting, Juan's 19 year old

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.580
wife decided she wasn't getting it on the regular

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.610
and she had to fix that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.660
after their conjugal visit, she put him

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.720
in a roll away suitcase

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.770
and tried to leave and then the guards were like "Hey

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.830
why is that suitcase moving?" they opened it up

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.870
to find: Juan butt naked

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.910
oh poor Juan that's embarrassing, socks

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.970
just naked in socks

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.020
side fact you don't need to know, I like to wear shoes

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.060
you can just get a lot more accomplished

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.110
with good footing, that's true in like almost every

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.230
area of life, sneakers are a must

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.280
in news that makes me very sad, we talked a new service

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.310
called MoviePass about a week ago, it's of course the service

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
where you pay like $50 a month and you get

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350
to go to movies everywhere and so they were testing it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.370
out in San Francisco, but there's a problem

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.410
apparently MoviePass didn't get

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.440
all the theaters to agree to this and so then the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.470
two major movie chains were like

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.500
"No, why would we do that, ever?"

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.520
and just like that, MoviePass was done

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.580
and it made me sad, and once again personally I think this is a great

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.620
idea, even if it's just specifically for the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.670
movie theaters, not so much the people that make

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.740
the movies, because the thing I think most people know, is that when you go

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.810
to the movie theater, they're making most of their money

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.840
on your fat ass eating candy

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.890
I know! turns out a bottle of water doesn't actually

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.920
cost $7, but that's what they charge

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.970
anyway, I know crazy!

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.000
so the way MoviePass has been pitching it to these theaters

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.110
is "Hey, we'll get more people in your doors more often"

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.230
so if you're having to pay out a certain amount for the ticket

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.360
even a if you lose a few bucks in long run

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.500
you make a whole bunch more in concessions

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.510
but it doesn't matter because it's not happening and it makes me sad

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.520
makes me want to punch a baby in the face, while

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.540
it's laughing, and guys the last story of the day today is a 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.580
big one, a very serious issue, you have a woman

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.610
by the name of Rennie Gibbs, she's a 15 year old

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.660
girl, she was pregnant and at

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.700
36 weeks she lost 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.750
the baby, then come to find out that she had a cocaine

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.790
problem and they believe that that's the reason the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.840
baby died, and so then the State of Mississippi

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.890
charged her with depraved-heart

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.960
murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.040
they're essentially saying because she was on drugs

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.130
she killed her baby which was a person

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.220
but here's the thing that's confusing to me,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.320
if you look at the way the laws currently are, abortion

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.430
being legal, how can you charge a woman

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.530
with the murder of a baby because it died

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.570
unintentionally rather than intentionally, to which

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.610
you could argue, "Well it depends on how long she was pregnant"

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.660
but there's this thing called third trimester

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.690
abortion, but even my pro-choice mind is like

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.740
no! worst thing in the world,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.780
but it is legal in a few states and I figured

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.380
I like when people argue a lot and call each other names

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.680
and that's going to be your question of the day: 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.030
Did this woman, then girl, commit murder?

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.040
And should she face time in jail?

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.050
let me know in the comments down below

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.070

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.100
