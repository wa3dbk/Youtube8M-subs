 Soudani james basu again 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.100
 It's been a while since I did not make a video lesson 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.539
 so I think something interesting has 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.840
 many people were complaining that they 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.609
 I got this already has several versions 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.519
 but I'll be teaching, played a new one 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.570
 context here how much we have here 1.6 knots 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.120
 we have mine was the alfaya happen too 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.129
 today i get back how to use sxc 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 Injection 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.540
 so come on you guys will need to have 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.370
 installed I'll leave the link to leave 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.390
 it at the discretion of you who does not have 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.489
 beautiful and also a program that you 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.430
 will need that many people will then 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:04.500
 I could not use it's sx and in error 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:06.810
 Because when you open up here, it 's what 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.700
 This message will appear for me 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.420
 You're going to need them, I 'm 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.619
 in the guest account you can close the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.759
 things like that can not change anything have the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.159
 Portuguese here but I'll let you guys go 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.979
 minimize and open a normal context 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.470
 but when you are at home will you give a 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.570
 error who does not have eta's computer at 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.880
 computer that does not give many people spoke 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.979
 that one of them gives so let's go there 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.079
 leave beyond sx and 98 also in the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:46.860
 description opens it on this 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:49.350
 O little program that opens it here 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.299
 fifth and you will do here in 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.810
 first you will put the oni is the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:03.030
 your context drive and on the bottom where 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:10.530
 is the case if I have already put you here 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:12.510
 will apply sx is to inject hate and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.040
 there was no shortcut there in the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.569
 job 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.859
 appeared the face that knows I did nothing there 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.329
 work here 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:23.680
 but now that you close the program 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:31.299
 will come out okay so concerns us and then 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.170
 here the string strikes and here it goes 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:40.689
 appear 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:43.469
 it's there game final jaked caught so let's go 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.469
 there to prove 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:03:39.270
 now she looks like she's going to have to leave 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:39.270
 the colleague and I'll go back to the selection, that's it 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.990
 So that 's it, people are worth it for more 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.180
 a video lesson any problem comments 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.060
 and in the video I'll try to solve it 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.920
 you 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.920
 That 's right guaranteed to close the former ac 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.030
 ad 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:24.660
 Jois business will leave here after have 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.660
