00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.740
 and what's happening youtube people have left my 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.080
 bat and I am my game and today I'm going to 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.080
 spend yellow pokemon in a minute 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.960
 yes 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.170
 here this special edition pikachu 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.840
 yellow pokemon and we started this 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.610
 adventure that will last very short minutes 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.470
 in fact good this is not going to tell 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.300
 because it puts a little fair stopwatch 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.430
 when it starts against the time it is 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.010
 when it appears within the game 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.260
 obviously this is an illicit speaking 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.660
 bullshit this does not count as a game 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.100
 and this has to happen all this is 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.140
 important that each take by name 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.020
 so that's here is worth this is super 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.830
 important we continue and here I speak to 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.500
 call him blog 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.880
 of nigris ni nilas cocks and nothing 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.880
 Robert call him to work 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.170
 it's perfect and now nothing simply 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.369
 follow and it's not a tutorial this I 'm not 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.659
 explain I want to do it as fast 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.610
 possible the circle is not a record 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.950
 world or now begins to count him and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.810
 such will have left and sometimes I will stay 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.729
 quiet because he played very things 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.070
 concrete for example stay 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.450
 they were two toilets and and save the game 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.549
 and while I'm saving 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.770
 it's reset I think I did it well 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.560
 it's like the fifth attempt I make of 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.270
 this right now because it does not always come out 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.759
 good guy keeps counting the chronometer 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.060
 obviously and now attentive I'm not going to 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.570
 be silent surely 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.650
 do not 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.930
 OK

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.930

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.040
 als of fame 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.620
 it's already past the game happens to me the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.510
 game in one minute play time 1 minute and 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.360
 there we saw that he put 102 captured 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.920
 152 sorry and 152 seen for what it was 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.680

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.750
 sign and it's already here are the writings 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.400
 finals I spent yellow pokemon the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.410
 passed because yellow bolt brother in 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.270
 a minute minute brother that is what 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.340
 happen with you will be flipping today 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.540
 you will ask as soon as the 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.950
 doors have a thing called 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.950
 world work 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.470
 Well basically what we have done is 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.730
 confuse the fire 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.560
 hesitating 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.260
 to see if you look teis we could go 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.430
 to the pokémon or we could see our 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.450
 because a person that we do not have any 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.220
 pokemon this is because we turn off the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.510
 console just with we're saving the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.860
 game was confused I thought that already 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.420
 we had acquired our first 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.310
 pokemon and since there is no pokemon there 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.170
 a failure that can continue to go down and 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.879
 change the order of good by changing a 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.290
 little order pulling such an object I do not know 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.360
 what doing exactly what it says that 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.760
 if you did not see it exactly you can 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.440
 see in 20 minutes is that there then 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.660
 when is it 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.260
 the game like you ask the clamp 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.940
 to see if he's 68 that everyone is 65 I know 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.460
 because that object varies does not have to 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.530
 be the most training if you shoot 65 then 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.060
 there were apparently other side but 68 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.610
 the exact number so that the guard is 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.830
 transform into his to the fame of in 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.110
 the entrance of the fame village then is 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.580
 as if you had passed the game and 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.900
 then you are the fucking master even though 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.570
 just say the head and look is the 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.989
 fucking master 152 achieved even though 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.550
 there are only 151 you are the fucking master and you and 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.320
 your pokemon that are registered in the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.750
 way since we are in the credits 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.760
 seeing how it is that we have spent the 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.950
 game ok I know we've been 4 minutes 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.720
 and such but more than a minute and a half 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.810
 has been more than a minute and a half has not 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.670
 been so you already know if you want 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.020
 bet your best friend that you 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.380
 you can go through yellow one minute 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.890
 you know that you can see it later 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.890
