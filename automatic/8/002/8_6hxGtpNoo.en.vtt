00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.340 

parkour

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.070 

drag<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:03.370> side<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:03.970> there<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:04.900> go

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
drag it to this side and there you go

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.820 
drag it to this side and there you go
and<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:06.850> think<00:04:07.410> but<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.500> got<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.650> be<00:04:08.740> careful

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
and I think but you got to be careful

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.560 
and I think but you got to be careful
because<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.220> think<00:04:09.400> once<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:09.820> place<00:04:10.540> the

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
because I think once you place the

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.120 
because I think once you place the
letters<00:04:10.990> you<00:04:11.110> can't<00:04:11.320> edit<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:11.710> let<00:04:11.860> me<00:04:11.950> try<00:04:12.070> to
