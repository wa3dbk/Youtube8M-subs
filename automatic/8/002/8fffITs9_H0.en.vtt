00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.300
 Oh Yura's very much Hello 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.270
 It is a net 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:20.310
 This time, I would like to recruit the solution of the wheel using every process of the train 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.840
 And it will introduce putty you for repairing the wheel Kochiran 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.280
 A day party with Horus 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:31.550
 I think that I want to recruit trauma using in every field of Holtz today 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:35.230
 So education fraction tries to enter Sassokuru work 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.450
 It is correction, it is smelly 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.410
 2 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.620
 It is a wheel of bbs which I had put on until the last time 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.610
 It is said that there are 4 rim rimuri wounds 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.090
 I wanted the previous owner'm less 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.360
 Overall I think it has been found that contains the scratch by say 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.700
 Then I think that I want to do the processing without alive from now on 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.300
 Guri wound Guri wound using paper etc. 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.630
 We have cut something like sound on the surface lightly please gone shaved 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.799
 In strongly main to repair and let's immediate field is minute to jump out by itself 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.799
 We with the exception of the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:20.570
 Ok If there is no part that is protruding touched with a finger 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.570
 The next will continue to cut through the scratch using a fine sandpaper than earlier 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:31.290
 When I 'm done with the work I finished using a piece of paper 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.290
 Koshikoshi'm then let's Koshikoshi cosi cosi 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:43.470
 Yes, this completes the surface treatment of wheel galling scratches 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:46.830
 It is the point that it is evenly distributed and the number of polishing axes here 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:52.940
 There is no surface, but it feels like it's a little prep 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.940
 If you use this, your work will be faster and you will solve 2 patterns using this 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.630
 If it is a shallow wound, this alone will disappear 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.710
 If you use this to rim all rim edge car 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:19.300
 And when such time attention when the discomfort is to just use it no longer to be too cut 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.350
 Because the balance of the wheel is broken, it seems like you paint the wheel when you use it 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.350
 Please polish 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.150
 Yes, the rim surface is now set to 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:38.120
 Cheat with new 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:43.970
 One caution, but if you use below this eye roughness 320, it will cut off the wheel gun gun 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.159
 If possible, please draw with a guy above 320. That's pretty easy for beginners. 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.970
 I think Tteka graduates 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.239
 Is is me 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.600
 When the footing of the rim is over 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:59.620
 We will raise wipe the under-treated surface using Holtz magazine agent 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.740
 Hmm Hmm, in the click rate 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:08.840
 In I think would like to enter the increasingly putty forest work from now 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:15.790
 So I'm going to bring a family from now, but before putting on a patty 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.790
 We protect place that should not have putty by using masking tape 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.340
 Masking hunting to protect the shield The place where this tape is put is the gully wound of the wheel now 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:33.430
 It is a place to repair 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:38.849
 It seems that the solution of the wheel was hardest at this guy 's wheel so then I will walk from now on putty 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.849
 We mix main ingredient and hardening agent of 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.409
 Hardening agent 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:56.070
 Let's elaborate painted against the previous wound After carefully, mixed by mixing a curing agent 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.070
 By the way, the putty is difficult or has become a texture like sponsored public safety one step 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.650
 At this time , let's keep the putty in evidence collection 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:16.579
 Before the part that I do not need Once you have the putty to dry 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:22.039
 Let's keep it light Now we've finished painting the wheel a 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:24.370
 Since the vertical effect time is one day , I would like to put it as it is today 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.370
 I 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.270
 push 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.270
 Now the painting of duty is over
