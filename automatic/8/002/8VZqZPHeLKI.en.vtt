00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
technical skills to be able to do it and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.710 
technical skills to be able to do it and
make<00:02:07.739> sure<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.009> there's<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> market<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.179> you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
make sure that there's a market that you

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.020 
make sure that there's a market that you
can<00:02:09.869> deliver<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.430> all<00:02:11.610> three<00:02:12.000> of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
can deliver that to so all three of

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.940 
can deliver that to so all three of
those<00:02:12.299> seem<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.959> there<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:13.410> film<00:02:13.739> so

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
those seem to be there for this film so

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.800 
those seem to be there for this film so
while<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.190> seems<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.579> an<00:02:14.730> enormous<00:02:15.150> risk<00:02:15.450> I'm

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
while it seems like an enormous risk I'm

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.539 
while it seems like an enormous risk I'm
not<00:02:16.170> just<00:02:16.440> doing<00:02:16.530> something<00:02:17.040> which<00:02:17.280> seems

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
not just doing something which seems

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:24.000 
not just doing something which seems
absurd<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.299> there<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.569> calculated<00:02:18.959> risk

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.069
