00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
teams and stuff like that but this is

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.369 
teams and stuff like that but this is
completely<00:00:39.570> different<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.350> completely

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
completely different it's a completely

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.490

year<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.930> couple<00:00:46.050> months<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.739> something

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
year in a couple months or something

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.470 
year in a couple months or something
like<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> don't<00:00:47.969> go<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
like that but I don't go on all the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.330 
like that but I don't go on all the
trips<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.200> when<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> chance<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> come

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
trips but when I do get a chance to come

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.549 
trips but when I do get a chance to come
in<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.300> best<00:00:51.480> experience<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.410> high

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.789 
it's definitely a hard mental switch

never<00:02:42.810> played<00:02:43.049> at<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.700> intense<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:44.969> level

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
never played at this intense of a level

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.259 
never played at this intense of a level
before<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:45.659> just<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.169> much<00:02:46.409> more<00:02:46.620> demanding

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
before it just it's much more demanding

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.159 
before it just it's much more demanding
and<00:02:48.590> quicker<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.889> faster<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:51.689> is<00:02:51.840> kind<00:02:52.109> of

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
and quicker and faster and it is kind of

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.869 
and quicker and faster and it is kind of
hard<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.379> adjust<00:02:52.799> for<00:02:53.219> the<00:02:53.340> first<00:02:53.519> couple<00:02:53.730> days

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
hard to adjust for the first couple days

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.399 
hard to adjust for the first couple days
of<00:02:54.120> camp<00:02:54.389> but<00:02:54.540> then<00:02:54.659> I<00:02:54.689> think<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.989> finally<00:02:55.319> get

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
of camp but then I think I finally get

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.170 
of camp but then I think I finally get
the<00:02:55.530> hang<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.799> it<00:02:55.889> after<00:02:56.189> a<00:02:56.250> while<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.969> talked

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the hang of it after a while we talked

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.259 
the hang of it after a while we talked
