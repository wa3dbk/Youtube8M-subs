 you have a great team you do things very well but when the mountain 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:04.909
 does not want 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.320
 let us climb does not leave us other times without equipment 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.900
 with less people because we have had more success but it has nothing to do 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.790
 we have had a great time
