yes that's what can we have a look at
now<00:02:03.710> um<00:02:04.010> well<00:02:04.190> actually<00:02:04.580> what<00:02:05.570> we<00:02:05.690> can<00:02:05.840> look<00:02:06.020> at

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
now um well actually what we can look at

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.259 
now um well actually what we can look at
and<00:02:07.280> then<00:02:07.400> we<00:02:07.460> bought<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.730> battery<00:02:08.060> pack<00:02:08.239> that

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
and then we bought the battery pack that

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.999 
and then we bought the battery pack that
is<00:02:08.629> the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
is the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.420 
is the
Peris<00:02:12.319> charger<00:02:15.349> there's<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.439> similar<00:02:16.829> to<00:02:17.010> what

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
Peris charger there's a similar to what

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.240 
Peris charger there's a similar to what
they<00:02:17.549> had<00:02:17.700> with<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.879> golden<00:02:18.659> sense<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.950> two

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
they had with a golden sense is a two

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.009 
they had with a golden sense is a two
pin<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.819> will<00:02:20.970> need<00:02:21.180> an<00:02:21.269> adapter<00:02:21.360> but<00:02:21.870> only

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
pin so you will need an adapter but only

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.960 
pin so you will need an adapter but only
cost<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.409> a<00:02:22.439> couple<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.739> pounds<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:23.939> a

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
cost you a couple of pounds this is a

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.910 
cost you a couple of pounds this is a
sample<00:02:24.450> detector<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.079> maybe<00:02:25.379> they<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:25.709> put

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
sample detector so maybe they will put

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.770 
sample detector so maybe they will put
an<00:02:26.099> adapter<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.909> kept<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.269> UK<00:02:27.569> market

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
an adapter in for you kept the UK market

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.990 
an adapter in for you kept the UK market
I<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:27.989> no<00:02:28.200> idea<00:02:28.530> but<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.549> all<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.819> what

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
I have no idea but it's all that what

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.610 
I have no idea but it's all that what
happens<00:02:30.360> there<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.659> just<00:02:31.049> quite<00:02:31.290> simplistic

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
happens there is just quite simplistic

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.160 
happens there is just quite simplistic
you<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.159> plug<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:33.000> charge<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:33.959> with

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
you just plug it in charge it up with

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.039 
you just plug it in charge it up with
your<00:02:34.260> adapter<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.920> hope<00:02:35.640> there<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.879> go<00:02:36.049> so

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
your adapter I hope there you go so

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.289 
your adapter I hope there you go so
that's<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.349> charger<00:02:37.799> all<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.670> cycles

that's the charger all that cycles

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.470 
that's the charger all that cycles
simple<00:02:39.959> enough<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.590> now<00:02:41.220> here<00:02:41.579> we<00:02:41.730> have<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
simple enough and now here we have the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.240 
simple enough and now here we have the
main<00:02:42.659> unit<00:02:43.079> to<00:02:43.230> know<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.440> half<00:02:43.620> main<00:02:43.890> unit

main unit to know the half main unit

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.860 
main unit to know the half main unit
looks<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.489> really<00:02:44.730> chunky<00:02:44.970> heavy<00:02:45.299> bit<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.629> kick

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
looks a really chunky heavy bit of kick

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.129 
looks a really chunky heavy bit of kick
it's<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:46.799> very<00:02:47.040> strong<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.790> solid<00:02:48.659> you<00:02:49.019> can

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
it's very very strong and solid you can

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.979 
it's very very strong and solid you can
clearly<00:02:49.620> see<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:51.120> at<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.269> same<00:02:51.420> time<00:02:51.690> it
