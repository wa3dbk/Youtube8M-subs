00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.010 

and<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.440> used<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.799> exactly<00:01:46.220> same<00:01:46.280> shop<00:01:46.820> I<00:01:47.180> think

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
and I used the exactly same shop I think

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:59.959 
and I used the exactly same shop I think
this<00:01:48.290> box<00:01:48.619> should<00:01:48.830> go<00:01:49.040> a<00:01:49.070> little<00:01:49.220> higher

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.580 

so<00:02:00.969> you<00:02:01.090> see<00:02:01.329> it<00:02:01.509> with<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> little<00:02:02.109> more<00:02:02.289> curve

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
we got get the pot a little higher

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.039
