00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and work hard over I've played against

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.529 
and work hard over I've played against
all<00:00:58.109> three<00:00:58.350> I'll<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.640> those<00:01:00.120> different

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
all three I'll see those different

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.670 
all three I'll see those different
levels<00:01:00.809> link<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> league<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.469> in

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
levels link to league one in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
levels link to league one in
championship<00:01:02.129> those<00:01:02.699> are<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:03.090> difficult

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
championship those are all difficult

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.140 
championship those are all difficult
games<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.140> think<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> great<00:01:04.890> test<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
games I think be a great test for the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.730 
games I think be a great test for the
plane<00:01:06.600> group<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.930> know<00:01:06.960> mean<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.530> will<00:01:07.590> be

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
plane group you know mean there will be

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.560 
plane group you know mean there will be
all<00:01:07.830> hard<00:01:08.040> games<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.820> bit<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.330> said<00:01:09.479> it'd

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
all hard games so a bit like I said it'd

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.590 
all hard games so a bit like I said it'd
be<00:01:09.630> great<00:01:09.840> test<00:01:11.119> obviously<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> effect<00:01:12.479> helps

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
be great test obviously the effect helps

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.210 
be great test obviously the effect helps
coming<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.320> before<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> season<00:01:14.010> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
coming you know before the season so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
coming you know before the season so
it's<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.670> great<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.570> asteroids

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
great to see where react the plane group

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.999 
great to see where react the plane group
and<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.110> where<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.290> takes<00:01:19.350> us<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:19.890> we're

bonding it's great for the page just to
get<00:01:34.770> away<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.329> be<00:01:36.329> part<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.810> team<00:01:36.840> experience

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
get away in be part of a team experience

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.830 
get away in be part of a team experience
I<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.220> far<00:01:38.400> away<00:01:38.520> from<00:01:38.670> home<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.689> you

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I know it's far away from home but you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.929 
I know it's far away from home but you
know<00:01:39.990> diskin<00:01:40.710> distance<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.490> only<00:01:41.610> make<00:01:41.790> us

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
know diskin distance can only make us

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.810 
know diskin distance can only make us
stronger<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.659> hopefully<00:01:42.899> does<00:01:43.079> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
stronger and hopefully does that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.310 
stronger and hopefully does that
yeah<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.659> everyone's<00:01:45.960> gonna<00:01:46.050> miss<00:01:46.230> the
