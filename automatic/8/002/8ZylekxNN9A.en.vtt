00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
excellent really rigorous study behind

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.070 
excellent really rigorous study behind
it<00:03:16.069> about<00:03:17.069> fifty<00:03:17.519> percent<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.090> owners<00:03:18.480> saw

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
it about fifty percent of the owners saw

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.470 
it about fifty percent of the owners saw
their<00:03:19.319> dogs<00:03:19.530> mental<00:03:20.010> impairment<00:03:20.610> decreased

by fifty percent that's a big drop yeah

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.270 
by fifty percent that's a big drop yeah
that<00:03:24.239> use<00:03:24.540> more<00:03:24.989> energetic<00:03:25.440> dogs<00:03:25.799> more
