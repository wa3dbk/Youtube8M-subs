 Modest Tastes cuisine from armful loves 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.080
 in this section we have a very easy to make catering recipe 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.080
 We will share the description of "Picnic Cookie" 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.360
 But let's take a look at the list of required materials before you choose 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.560
 250 grams of butter 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.560
 2 eggs 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.120
 1 cup powdered sugar 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.880
 1 cup of corn starch 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.400
 1 piece of lemon zest 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.680
 1 teaspoon of carbonate 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.960
 and as much flour as possible 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.400
 we know the necessary ingredients for picnic cookies 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 we can make it right now 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.360
 at the room temperature softened over the butter ... 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.000
 powdered sugar ... 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.640
 Add 2 eggs 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.960
 and fingertips and materials 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.640
 now we have corn starch 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.320
 we mix a little more 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.640
 Let's continue to add flour slowly now 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 And let's knead on one hand 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.520
 in the meantime we will add up to carbon on flour 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 add the last lemon grater 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.600
 dough started to gather, now we can grate our lemon 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.320
 Now we are kneading the lemon peel so homogeneously 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.560
 now fully integrated 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 we're gonna make big coarse cookies 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.800
 we're in a hurry because we're going to a picnic 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.880
 We're doing the same size, we'il put it on the fat-free baking tray 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.840
 in this way we have completed our last cookie 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.840
 now we are making cuts with the back of a knife 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.320
 In the meantime we have heated our oven at 190 degrees 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.000
 already crack, no worries, let's take it to the oven now 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 15 minutes later 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.840
 Our cookies were baked out of the oven, 190 degrees to the hot oven. 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.840
 Enough to cook for 15 minutes 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.840
 as you can see until we get a light pink color 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.560
 very nicely cracked and cuts were divided 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.560
 now we can leave it on the serving plate 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.280
 but if you're going to a picnic, get cold 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.080
 enjoy your meal... 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.920
 The modest tastes can be made to the picnic right in the kitchen ... 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.600
 we shared an easy cookie recipe 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.120
 We learned the construction of "Picnic Cookie" 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.480
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible, sir 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.160
 goodbye...
