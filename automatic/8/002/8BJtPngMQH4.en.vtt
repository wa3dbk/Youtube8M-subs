equipment not really hard rank to do the
V<00:01:01.890> honest<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:02.670> sort<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> obvious

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.560 
V honest I think that's sort of obvious
but<00:01:03.719> again<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> first<00:01:06.000> rank<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and again you can do this at any hideout

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480 
and again you can do this at any hideout
I<00:01:18.119> did<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.080> new<00:01:19.200> Salida<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.950> however<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
I did this at new Salida or however you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
I did this at new Salida or however you
pronounce<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.110> again<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.259> not<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.560> hard

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
pronounce it again it's not very hard

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.440 
pronounce it again it's not very hard
you<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.520> note<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> tomahawk

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
you just have to note that the tomahawk

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.280 
you just have to note that the tomahawk
has<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:25.009> much<00:01:26.009> bigger<00:01:26.369> curved

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
has that much bigger curved

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.840 
has that much bigger curved
gravitational<00:01:28.290> like<00:01:28.409> curve<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.610> actual

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
gravitational like curve then the actual

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.920 
gravitational like curve then the actual
throwing<00:01:30.180> knife<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.509> does<00:01:30.689> become

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
throwing knife is does become

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.080 
throwing knife is does become
ineffective<00:01:31.320> after<00:01:31.860> about<00:01:32.009> 10<00:01:32.549> meters<00:01:32.939> or

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
ineffective after about 10 meters or

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.740 
ineffective after about 10 meters or
something<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.799> approximately<00:01:34.799> so

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
something like that approximately so

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.569 
something like that approximately so
it's<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:37.140> amazing<00:01:37.530> melee<00:01:38.040> weapon<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it's not amazing melee weapon but it

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.490 
it's not amazing melee weapon but it
does<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.850> tremendous<00:01:39.659> amount<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.960> damage<00:01:40.140> much

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
does a tremendous amount of damage much

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.800 
does a tremendous amount of damage much
more<00:01:40.710> than<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> actual<00:01:41.070> throwing<00:01:41.579> knife

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
more than the actual throwing knife

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
using Deadeye and there are lots of

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.360 
using Deadeye and there are lots of
places<00:02:09.690> where<00:02:09.929> birds<00:02:10.259> fly<00:02:10.560> really<00:02:10.860> low<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.310> I

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
places where birds fly really low but I

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.850 
places where birds fly really low but I
found<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.000> best<00:02:12.150> place<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.810> in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
found the best place to do it in

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.710 
found the best place to do it in
is<00:02:14.220> at<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.520> end<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.910> Twin<00:02:15.150> Rocks<00:02:15.330> once<00:02:15.630> you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
is at the end of Twin Rocks once you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.080 
is at the end of Twin Rocks once you
complete<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.050> Twin<00:02:16.290> Rocks<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.680> doubt<00:02:17.090> there'll

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
complete the Twin Rocks I doubt there'll

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.940 
complete the Twin Rocks I doubt there'll
be<00:02:18.120> some<00:02:18.630> birds<00:02:18.870> flying<00:02:19.260> very<00:02:19.500> low<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
be some birds flying very low to the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.550 
be some birds flying very low to the
ground<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.540> usually<00:02:21.990> find<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.350> best

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
ground and what I usually find the best

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.710 
ground and what I usually find the best
way<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.010> complete<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.880> remember<00:02:24.630> you

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
way to complete this is remember you

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.240 
way to complete this is remember you
can't<00:02:24.930> use<00:02:25.080> Deadeye<00:02:25.290> as<00:02:25.560> well<00:02:25.740> which<00:02:25.950> makes<00:02:26.070> it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
can't use Deadeye as well which makes it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.550 
can't use Deadeye as well which makes it
even<00:02:26.310> harder<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.510> usually<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.930> find<00:02:28.320> that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
even harder is that usually I find that

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.530 
even harder is that usually I find that
if<00:02:28.710> you're<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> buildings<00:02:30.090> at<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.270> top

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
if you're on to the buildings at the top

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.300 
if you're on to the buildings at the top
and<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.380> try<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.770> tomahawk<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
and you can just try and tomahawk the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.880 
and you can just try and tomahawk the
birds<00:02:32.520> as<00:02:32.760> they<00:02:32.790> fly<00:02:32.910> over<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.810> easiest<00:02:34.710> way

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
birds as they fly over and easiest way

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.440 
birds as they fly over and easiest way
is<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.190> when<00:02:35.280> they're<00:02:35.460> flying<00:02:35.670> away<00:02:35.910> from<00:02:36.270> you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
is it when they're flying away from you

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.200 
is it when they're flying away from you
exactly<00:02:36.900> parallel<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.130> flying<00:02:38.430> away<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.760> found

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
exactly parallel but flying away I found

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.170 
exactly parallel but flying away I found
that<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.420> best<00:02:39.600> time<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> tomahawk<00:02:41.180> them.you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that the best time to tomahawk them.you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.170 
that the best time to tomahawk them.you
can<00:02:42.209> tomahawk<00:02:42.810> them<00:02:43.290> as<00:02:43.440> well<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.730> think<00:02:44.820> I've

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
can tomahawk them as well I think I've

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.490 
can tomahawk them as well I think I've
seen<00:02:45.360> some<00:02:45.540> birds<00:02:45.750> around<00:02:45.930> rats<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.350> get<00:02:46.470> a

seen some birds around rats to get a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.430 
seen some birds around rats to get a
fork<00:02:46.860> right<00:02:47.100> up<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> very<00:02:48.030> top<00:02:48.290> there's<00:02:49.290> some

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
fork right up the very top there's some

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.110 
fork right up the very top there's some
vultures<00:02:49.920> they<00:02:50.370> don't<00:02:50.520> have<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.700> be<00:02:50.790> flying

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
vultures they don't have to be flying

vultures they don't have to be flying
birds<00:02:51.420> though<00:02:51.660> that's<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> thing<00:02:52.350> they<00:02:52.680> can

be<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.459> ground<00:02:53.580> but<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:54.660> very<00:02:54.870> hard<00:02:55.170> it's

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
be on the ground but it's very hard it's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.320

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.900 
anyway again it isn't really that hard
just<00:03:27.959> need<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.140> line<00:03:28.350> up<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.650> bird<00:03:28.860> exactly<00:03:29.640> if

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
just need to line up the bird exactly if

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.699 
just need to line up the bird exactly if
you<00:03:30.060> need<00:03:30.209> help<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:30.989> personal<00:03:31.440> message

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
you need help you can personal message

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.229 
you need help you can personal message
me<00:03:31.890> or<00:03:32.010> something<00:03:32.400> because<00:03:32.580> this<00:03:32.850> one<00:03:33.060> is

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
me or something because this one is

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.870 
me or something because this one is
probably<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.600> hardest<00:03:34.049> out<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.290> them<00:03:34.380> all

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
probably the hardest out of them all

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.479 
probably the hardest out of them all
rank<00:03:35.880> for<00:03:36.150> tomahawk<00:03:36.600> challenge<00:03:37.019> again<00:03:37.709> seems

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
rank for tomahawk challenge again seems

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.070 
rank for tomahawk challenge again seems
hard<00:03:38.790> but<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.030> really<00:03:39.209> isn't<00:03:39.480> it's<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:39.959> to

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
hard but it really isn't it's just to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.020 
hard but it really isn't it's just to
get<00:03:40.230> five<00:03:40.560> kills<00:03:40.860> with<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.370> tomahawk<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:41.970> a

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
get five kills with the tomahawk in a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.470 
get five kills with the tomahawk in a
row<00:03:42.269> without<00:03:42.660> missing<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:45.000> way<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.209> do

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
row without missing and the way to do

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.420 
row without missing and the way to do
that<00:03:45.750> really<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.290> find<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:47.040> probably<00:03:47.310> go

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
that really I find is to probably go

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.370 
that really I find is to probably go
into<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> hideout<00:03:48.120> that's<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.420> very<00:03:48.600> close<00:03:48.900> range

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
into a hideout that's a very close range

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.009 
into a hideout that's a very close range
I<00:03:49.470> find<00:03:49.769> sorrow<00:03:50.489> as<00:03:50.880> well<00:03:51.420> enough<00:03:51.900> uh

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
I find sorrow as well enough uh

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.350 
I find sorrow as well enough uh
pronounce<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.530> correctly<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.030> good

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
pronounce that correctly is a good

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.259 
pronounce that correctly is a good
hideout<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.870> do<00:03:55.019> actually<00:03:55.530> if<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:56.670> because

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
hideout to do actually if you because

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.789 
hideout to do actually if you because
the<00:03:57.420> enemies<00:03:57.720> are<00:03:57.870> all<00:03:57.989> inside<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.440> one

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
the enemies are all inside that one

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.250 
the enemies are all inside that one
little<00:03:59.130> like<00:03:59.400> city<00:03:59.760> area<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.570> find<00:04:01.049> it's<00:04:01.200> not

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
little like city area I find it's not

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.400 
little like city area I find it's not
exactly<00:04:01.680> hard<00:04:02.180> remember<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.600> says<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.170> can't

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
to sound very odd that believe me once

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.510 
to sound very odd that believe me once
you<00:04:51.380> had<00:04:52.380> this<00:04:52.560> sort<00:04:52.800> of<00:04:52.920> experience<00:04:53.370> of<00:04:53.460> the

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
you had this sort of experience of the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.630 
you had this sort of experience of the
tomahawk<00:04:54.710> really<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.950> easiest<00:04:56.160> place<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.490> go

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
tomahawk really the easiest place to go

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.390 
tomahawk really the easiest place to go
is<00:04:56.790> probably<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.240> Twin<00:04:57.480> Rocks

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
is probably the Twin Rocks

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.220 
is probably the Twin Rocks
because<00:04:59.400> there's<00:04:59.670> pretty<00:05:00.630> much<00:05:00.660> no<00:05:00.930> one<00:05:01.080> at

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
because there's pretty much no one at

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.290 
because there's pretty much no one at
Twin<00:05:01.470> Rocks<00:05:01.650> there's<00:05:02.040> barely<00:05:02.550> any<00:05:02.790> enemies<00:05:03.150> to

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
Twin Rocks there's barely any enemies to

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.810 
Twin Rocks there's barely any enemies to
kill<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:03.810> remember<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:04.920> can<00:05:05.190> scavenge

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
kill and remember you can scavenge

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.140 
kill and remember you can scavenge
tomahawks<00:05:06.660> from<00:05:06.960> dead<00:05:07.200> bodies<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:07.860> if<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:08.940> get

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
tomahawks from dead bodies so if you get

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.660 
tomahawks from dead bodies so if you get
the<00:05:09.540> person<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.410> can<00:05:10.620> loot<00:05:11.070> their<00:05:11.280> body<00:05:11.460> and

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
the person you can loot their body and

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.150 
the person you can loot their body and
regain<00:05:12.030> your<00:05:12.060> tomahawk<00:05:12.510> but<00:05:13.410> keep<00:05:13.890> this<00:05:14.010> in

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
regain your tomahawk but keep this in

you could also do this as well I've

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.570 
you could also do this as well I've
heard<00:05:48.210> people<00:05:48.600> doing<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:48.930> get<00:05:49.140> to<00:05:49.350> reach<00:05:50.040> the

out there just to sneak in steal the
treasure<00:05:56.310> and<00:05:56.610> then<00:05:56.760> kill<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.090> guys<00:05:57.240> to<00:05:57.420> try

to<00:05:57.630> kill<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:58.610> you<00:05:59.610> can<00:05:59.850> do<00:06:00.000> it<00:06:00.030> that<00:06:00.270> way<00:06:00.300> I've

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
to kill you you can do it that way I've

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.180 
to kill you you can do it that way I've
heard<00:06:00.960> it's<00:06:01.200> pretty<00:06:01.410> easy<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:01.890> they're<00:06:02.010> like

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
heard it's pretty easy and they're like

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.090 
heard it's pretty easy and they're like
two<00:06:02.790> people<00:06:03.120> who<00:06:03.210> try<00:06:03.360> to<00:06:03.390> attack<00:06:03.750> you<00:06:04.020> but<00:06:04.860> you

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
two people who try to attack you but you

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.200 
two people who try to attack you but you
do<00:06:05.250> need<00:06:05.430> to<00:06:05.490> get<00:06:05.610> the<00:06:05.700> treasure<00:06:05.910> hunter

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
do need to get the treasure hunter

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.200 
do need to get the treasure hunter
outfit<00:06:06.630> and<00:06:06.840> that<00:06:06.870> does<00:06:07.260> mean<00:06:07.440> completing<00:06:07.950> the

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
outfit and that does mean completing the

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.720 
outfit and that does mean completing the
full<00:06:09.380> options<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:10.620> try<00:06:10.830> and<00:06:10.980> gain<00:06:11.250> access<00:06:11.460> to

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
full options to try and gain access to

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.510 
full options to try and gain access to
it<00:06:12.030> so<00:06:12.320> this<00:06:13.320> way<00:06:13.530> is<00:06:13.590> probably<00:06:13.920> easier<00:06:14.250> if<00:06:14.400> you

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
it so this way is probably easier if you

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.190 
it so this way is probably easier if you
can't<00:06:14.760> be<00:06:14.850> asked<00:06:15.330> try<00:06:15.660> and<00:06:15.780> get<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:15.990> treasure

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
can't be asked try and get the treasure

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.020 
can't be asked try and get the treasure
hunter<00:06:16.470> outfit<00:06:16.860> so<00:06:17.460> if<00:06:17.640> you've<00:06:17.790> got<00:06:17.940> the

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
hunter outfit so if you've got the

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.520 
hunter outfit so if you've got the
treasure<00:06:18.240> hunter<00:06:18.510> outfit<00:06:18.840> already<00:06:18.990> it's

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
treasure hunter outfit already it's

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.710 
treasure hunter outfit already it's
probably<00:06:19.920> a<00:06:19.950> good<00:06:20.040> idea<00:06:20.100> to<00:06:20.640> go<00:06:21.180> to<00:06:21.240> gap<00:06:21.540> to

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
probably a good idea to go to gap to

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.010 
probably a good idea to go to gap to
breach<00:06:22.110> and<00:06:22.380> do<00:06:22.530> it<00:06:22.650> that<00:06:22.830> way<00:06:23.420> to<00:06:24.420> be<00:06:24.570> honest

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
breach and do it that way to be honest

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.870 
breach and do it that way to be honest
twin<00:06:25.350> rocks<00:06:25.590> really<00:06:25.830> isn't<00:06:26.070> that<00:06:26.220> hard<00:06:26.340> the

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
twin rocks really isn't that hard the

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.300 
twin rocks really isn't that hard the
only<00:06:26.990> thing<00:06:27.990> I<00:06:28.110> could<00:06:28.170> say<00:06:28.590> probably<00:06:29.010> is<00:06:29.100> try

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
only thing I could say probably is try

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.590 
only thing I could say probably is try
and<00:06:29.430> take<00:06:29.580> out<00:06:29.730> the<00:06:29.880> guys<00:06:30.030> on<00:06:30.270> top<00:06:30.420> of<00:06:30.510> the

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
and take out the guys on top of the

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.240 
and take out the guys on top of the
towers<00:06:31.020> first<00:06:31.290> because<00:06:31.560> they'll<00:06:31.710> piss<00:06:32.040> you

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
towers first because they'll piss you

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.670 
towers first because they'll piss you
off<00:06:32.280> so<00:06:32.700> much<00:06:32.840> try<00:06:33.840> and<00:06:33.960> do<00:06:34.050> that<00:06:34.200> first<00:06:34.500> and

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
off so much try and do that first and
