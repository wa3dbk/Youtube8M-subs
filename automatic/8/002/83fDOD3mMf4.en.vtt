cases<00:01:50.970> from<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:52.619> past<00:01:52.649> had<00:01:53.220> been<00:01:53.460> pretty

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
cases from the past had been pretty

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.520 
cases from the past had been pretty
floppy<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.810> about<00:01:54.930> speaking<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
floppy but I like about speaking is to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.340

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
make a really good quality case so you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.899 
make a really good quality case so you
don't<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.799> worry<00:01:58.979> about<00:01:59.219> things<00:01:59.430> kind<00:01:59.820> of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
really hard with cases like this to tell

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.160 
really hard with cases like this to tell
which<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.000> these<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.420> which<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.870> mean<00:02:31.020> we

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
which one of these is which I mean we

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.450 
which one of these is which I mean we
know<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.350> power<00:02:31.620> buttons<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.070> bottom<00:02:32.370> of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
the volume buttons are here on the top

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.500 
the volume buttons are here on the top
but<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:34.980> still<00:02:35.340> really<00:02:35.700> hard<00:02:36.120> when<00:02:36.360> you're

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
but it's still really hard when you're

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.750 
but it's still really hard when you're
not<00:02:36.750> looking<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.680> actually<00:02:37.830> hit<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.430> button

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
not looking to actually hit the button

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.580 
not looking to actually hit the button
that<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.360> want<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:40.170> would<00:02:40.290> think<00:02:40.470> these

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
that you want you would think these

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.250 
that you want you would think these
dividers<00:02:40.980> help<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:42.270> they<00:02:42.390> kind<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.780> don't<00:02:42.960> so

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
dividers help but they kind of don't so

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.960 
dividers help but they kind of don't so
if<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.770> deal-breaker<00:02:44.100> for<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.700> I

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
if that is a deal-breaker for you I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.630 
if that is a deal-breaker for you I
would<00:02:45.330> suggest<00:02:45.480> getting<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:46.110> case<00:02:46.350> with<00:02:46.740> more

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
would suggest getting a case with more

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.660 
would suggest getting a case with more
pronounced<00:02:48.240> buttons<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.080> side<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:50.490> that's

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
pronounced buttons on the side so that's

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.400 
pronounced buttons on the side so that's
pretty<00:02:51.150> much<00:02:51.300> all<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.600> can<00:02:51.900> really<00:02:52.140> say<00:02:52.380> about

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
pretty much all I can really say about

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.170 
pretty much all I can really say about
this<00:02:52.740> case<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.220> good<00:02:53.250> case<00:02:53.550> it's<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.000> very

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
this case it's a good case it's a very

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.600 
this case it's a good case it's a very
popular<00:02:54.390> case<00:02:54.750> as<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.050> stated<00:02:55.320> $13.99<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.430> not<00:02:56.580> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
popular case as I stated $13.99 is not a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.010 
popular case as I stated $13.99 is not a
