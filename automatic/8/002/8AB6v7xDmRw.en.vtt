questions<00:01:03.690> are<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:03.870> easy<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.320> because

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
questions are really easy just because

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
questions are really easy just because
they're<00:01:04.920> high<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.189> protein<00:01:05.430> um<00:01:06.090> video<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
they're high in protein um video of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080 
they're high in protein um video of
carbs<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.640> they<00:01:08.880> say<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
carbs but like you know they say the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.960 
carbs but like you know they say the
fiber<00:01:09.510> cancels<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.350> carbs<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.979> doubt<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
fiber cancels out the carbs and doubt it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.840 
fiber cancels out the carbs and doubt it
but<00:01:12.119> anyway<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.900> still<00:01:13.140> fairly<00:01:13.770> healthy<00:01:14.189> for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
but anyway it's still fairly healthy for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090 
but anyway it's still fairly healthy for
a<00:01:15.090> quick<00:01:15.659> snack<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.229> obviously<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.799> food<00:01:16.979> is
