00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.700
 of course i'm in los angeles it's 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.700
 forced 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:34.949
 damn to paris driving respectful I had 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.470
 shot a scene in a car 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.750
 I was in Haiti and that's for sure 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:44.699
 had no and was not really 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.239
 rule so I think it's more like that 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.250
 because it was really without 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.600
 obligation but also quite dangerous 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:00.379
 in the background because we did not have 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.379
 protection to a film 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.580
 what she is already filming where there is a movie 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.310
 which came out about five years ago where he 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.130
 is a scene in a car that lasts 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.290
 almost a quarter of an hour what you need 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:22.920
 that it comes back but great the scene 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:24.990
 beautiful it does not come back to me I had a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.040
 accident in all my vision actually 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.180
 it's not even an accident 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.700
 someone who came past me and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.070
 I took a little bit in the back 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:39.990
 but but that's all I've ever had 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:41.880
 of accident not inevitable I'm on 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.979
 a line and he jumps two lines 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.570
 because he saw a turning right at 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.090
 last moment he came across like this and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.090
 I come I could not 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.640
 go soft life is long
