00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the blue mud and there you go

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.050 
the blue mud and there you go
pretty<00:01:02.789> simple<00:01:03.059> right<00:01:04.309> now<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
pretty simple right now we just have to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
pretty simple right now we just have to
do<00:01:06.150> everything<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.810> our<00:01:06.930> own<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.590> I'm<00:01:08.040> pretty

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
do everything on our own and I'm pretty

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.609 
do everything on our own and I'm pretty
sure<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.970> faster<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.900> solve<00:01:10.380> this

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
sure that the faster you solve this

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.260 
sure that the faster you solve this
puzzle<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.580> more<00:01:11.820> points<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:14.090> make<00:01:15.090> your

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
puzzle the more points you get make your

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.929 
puzzle the more points you get make your
client<00:01:15.720> look<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:22.729> all<00:01:23.729> right

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
client look just like this all right

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.190 
client look just like this all right
pretty<00:01:24.299> simple<00:01:27.500> okay<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.829> need<00:01:28.979> yellow

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
pretty simple okay so we need yellow

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.810 
pretty simple okay so we need yellow
then<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> think<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:31.740> cover<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.159> mouth<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
then I think we cover the mouth and the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.740 
then I think we cover the mouth and the
right<00:01:33.060> hand<00:01:33.299> side<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> face<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:35.750> then

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
right hand side of the face and then

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.289 
right hand side of the face and then
everything<00:01:37.259> else<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.619> green<00:01:40.909> okay<00:01:41.909> I'm<00:01:42.030> going

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
everything else is green okay I'm going

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.170 
everything else is green okay I'm going
to<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.689> my<00:01:42.930> time<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.829> solution<00:01:44.220> just

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
to take my time with this solution just

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
to take my time with this solution just
to<00:01:45.420> test<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:46.049> theory<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.009> faster

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
to test out my theory that the faster

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.840 
to test out my theory that the faster
you<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.450> points<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.079> get<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:50.700> let

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you do it the more points you get so let

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.319 
you do it the more points you get so let
me<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> cover<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> nose<00:01:53.060> then<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.149> make

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
me see I cover up the nose then I make

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.060 
me see I cover up the nose then I make
everything<00:01:54.659> green

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
everything green

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.170

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
ever at the bottom of the mouth then I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.320 
ever at the bottom of the mouth then I
make<00:02:00.360> everything<00:02:00.780> blue<00:02:01.790> then<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:02.940> some

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
make everything blue then we have some

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.330 
make everything blue then we have some
little<00:02:03.570> dots<00:02:03.900> on<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.380> cheeks<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:07.160> there<00:02:08.160> we

little dots on the cheeks and there we
go<00:02:09.619> alright<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.070> my<00:02:11.370> theory<00:02:11.640> has<00:02:11.910> been<00:02:12.180> tested

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
go alright so my theory has been tested

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.650 
go alright so my theory has been tested
out<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.590> faster<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.730> more<00:02:15.120> points

that's a lot of work drain the pod

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:09.040 
that's a lot of work drain the pod
refill<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.580> pod<00:02:59.760> refill<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.390> salt<00:03:01.970> okay

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.830 

here's<00:03:10.050> how<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.400> fill<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.610> pod<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.360> first<00:03:12.660> we

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
here's how you fill the pod but first we

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.640 
here's how you fill the pod but first we
have<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.140> drain<00:03:13.380> it

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
have to drain it

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.130 
have to drain it
so<00:03:13.980> let's<00:03:14.370> drain<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:17.060> drain<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.239> then<00:03:18.540> refill

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
so let's drain it drain it then refill

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.420 
so let's drain it drain it then refill
it<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:21.230> next<00:03:22.230> we<00:03:22.380> need<00:03:22.500> some<00:03:22.739> salt<00:03:25.190> salt<00:03:26.190> goes

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
it and next we need some salt salt goes

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.650 
it and next we need some salt salt goes
here<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:28.430> we<00:03:29.430> push<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.940> button<00:03:30.180> here<00:03:30.600> to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
here and we push this button here to

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.970 
here and we push this button here to
find<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.200> salt<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:36.600> we<00:03:36.989> need<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.230> turn<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
find the salt and we need to turn on the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.360 
find the salt and we need to turn on the
UV<00:03:38.250> cycle<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.500> basically<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.739> means<00:03:40.799> we<00:03:41.190> take

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
UV cycle so basically that means we take

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.759 
UV cycle so basically that means we take
this<00:03:41.519> UV<00:03:42.030> bulb<00:03:42.330> here<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:45.110> then<00:03:46.110> we<00:03:46.230> use<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.620> on

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
this UV bulb here and then we use it on

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.850 
this UV bulb here and then we use it on
the<00:03:46.980> area<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.610> needs<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:48.120> UV<00:03:48.630> bulb<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.170> we

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
the area that needs a UV bulb and we

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.600 
the area that needs a UV bulb and we
just<00:03:50.130> found<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.430> bomb<00:03:50.610> let's<00:03:50.910> open<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.420> ball

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
or let's not open the bomb let's prevent

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.460 
or let's not open the bomb let's prevent
the<00:03:55.520> bomb<00:03:55.700> from<00:03:56.000> going<00:03:56.210> off<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.810> as<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.230> can

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
the bomb from going off and as you can

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.280 
the bomb from going off and as you can
see<00:03:57.530> we<00:03:57.860> have<00:03:58.040> green<00:03:58.940> squares<00:03:59.450> which<00:03:59.900> block

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
see we have green squares which block

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.620 
see we have green squares which block
our<00:04:00.500> way<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:01.700> I'm<00:04:01.970> going<00:04:02.240> to<00:04:02.270> take<00:04:02.480> this

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
our way so I'm going to take this

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.530 
our way so I'm going to take this
opportunity<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.380> plan<00:04:03.980> my<00:04:04.220> route<00:04:04.520> I'm<00:04:05.390> gonna

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540
