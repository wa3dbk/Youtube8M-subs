00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
of reminds me of that and then also one

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.060 
of reminds me of that and then also one
of<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> co-op<00:01:37.259> missions<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:37.950> the

of the co-op missions it's like the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
of the co-op missions it's like the
second<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.520> yeah<00:01:39.420> I'm<00:01:39.630> thinking<00:01:40.110> that's<00:01:40.380> what

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
second one yeah I'm thinking that's what

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.289 
second one yeah I'm thinking that's what
I<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.770> my<00:01:40.950> head<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.579> these<00:01:41.909> new<00:01:42.060> maps

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
I have my head for this these new maps

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.539 
I have my head for this these new maps
they're<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.860> maybe<00:01:44.369> in

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
they're going to be you know maybe in

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.450 
they're going to be you know maybe in
the<00:01:44.640> city<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.210> what<00:01:45.450> I'm<00:01:45.540> thinking<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:47.189> like

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the city is what I'm thinking and like

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.069 
the city is what I'm thinking and like
right<00:01:47.729> after<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.180> earthquake<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.899> there's

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
right after the earthquake so there's

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.139 
right after the earthquake so there's
probably<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.759> huge

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
probably going to be one that huge

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.620 
probably going to be one that huge
building<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.100> uh<00:01:53.100> knocked<00:01:53.729> over<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.299> gets
