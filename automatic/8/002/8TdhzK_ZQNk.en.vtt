 the elementary school at Westerberg the walls 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:12.179
 one pupil reads before the others listen to actually self-evident 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.419
 not so for liver and lung cancer 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.349
 the ten-year-old is seriously hearing-impaired, despite two 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.439
 supporting implants in the 28-student class hardly anything 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.529
 take up 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.050
 The lesson is focused on the big Zagat so he chooses the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.399
 Reading classmates from the lips 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.809
 But not only that the teachers are with a height facility 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.050
 who hijacked her words directly to Leon in February 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.600
 Ulm 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.660
 No 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.640
 Heike Beckmann is the director of the albertville School 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.290
 Communication in Olpe 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.310
 she has been helping Leon since he was nine years old 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.310
 his hearing impairment was sketched shortly before the Viennese 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.660
 The integration of the boy here also works because he is weekly 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290
 two hours of private lessons 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.280
 tailored to his handicap 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.009
 Leon attended the special school in Olpe and Glock for one year prior to elementary school 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.640
 helped this preparation in the lwl-förderschule very much 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.610
 Confidence Self-confidence to convey self-confidence 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.290
 Percent that he needs here 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.820
 Rank at a regular school 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.340
 that means he could already read he could already write from one 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 Ahead of the other children van Gaal has 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.910
 then the pressure is not so great 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.750
 Over 36 children want to be looked after so busy schools 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.980
 Part of the common instruction is the consultation between the 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.420
 special education specialist such as Heike Beckmann and the mainstream schools 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.210
 and not only that the LWL counseling centers also offer 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.210
 Advanced training for primary school teachers 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.990
 To help children with disabilities live as normally as possible 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.140
 a big goal for the Landschaftsverband westfalen-lippe 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 we make a wreath important contribution to this 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.860
 The OAS claim on people long ago, convention right value one 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.159
 Aim for the inclusion of disabled people in our society 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.329
 however, we have to worry about about a quarter of our children around us 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.249
 We are often severely handicapped 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:27.040
 and it will be very difficult for the mainstream schools to do that 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:31.019
 These children can also be helped according to their handicap 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.169
 Therefore, there will be a need for special needs schools in the future as well 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.349
 Special education schools such as the fpö hearing communication in Olpe 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.909
 In addition to the normal and fragrances here special learning objectives for the 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.939
 around 150 students in the foreground 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:50.609
 attached to the school the kindergarten 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.279
 the children benefit from this small groups with eleven children comes two each 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.809
 Special education teacher could 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.999
 from them, the language is consciously incorporated into everyday life enormous sums of children 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.729
 constantly caught and reproduced correctly 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:06.749
 This calls for rest concentration because some children are hearing impaired others 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:11.169
 Completely deaf sound education is therefore a must go 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.779
 to the perfect sign language 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:17.089
 Leon spent one year at the special school today 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:20.319
 limited hearing in Petrov the OLO Geschendorf maintenance 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.599
 Body re-examined Apple was about three years ago 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:25.580
 a reform 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.750
 Dr, I will keep fighting 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:35.000
 the lwl-förderschule has a modern lost 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.139
 not way 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.989
 here is tested for free 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.359
 How the ten year old describes the direction 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.510
 There are different sounds from the speakers first requests from which 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.030
 Direction of the tours 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.510
 that is one percentage point more than in stones just mean the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.099
 Regular school visits the euro again afterwards punishable 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.719
 a deliverer after class 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.459
 Nawi Graz to follow 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.060
 Leon can visit Nasim thanks to the integration starting this summer 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.060
 Not every hearing-impaired student is possible 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.950
 the children at the lwl-förderschule benefit from the good facilities in 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.049
 Each room is carpeted and the ceilings are extra insulated 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:18.239
 So noise from the outside minimizes the students are not irritated 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.210
 Thanks to the technical equipment such as the fortifications, the children can get up 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.310
 the teaching voices concentrate and so the lesson optimally on the eye 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.909
 to reach every student 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.360
 the teachers speak more slowly and with a distinct and image about each child 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.710
 reach out to get the best out of it 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.260
 The most important thing, of course, is that the children graduate 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.210
 earn and then learn a profession can have a future 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.370
 and then it does not matter at some point whether she graduated from the 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.830
 Realschule and a special school have acquired life is important 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.949
 can be later sighted into the listening world a contented life 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.990
 can lead with a good job and that's what we try 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.350
 the special school as well as the mainstream schools to reach for the 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.550
 children 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.170
 In addition to the school in Olpe, there are five more LWL special education school with the 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.729
 Main focus and communication 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.630
 and on every mister the kids have the chance to get damaged almost 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.629
 normal life to be prepared 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.770
 on
