we<00:01:18.380> have<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.530> second<00:01:18.979> fell<00:01:19.159> winters<00:01:19.520> that

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
we have a second fell winters that

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.789 
we have a second fell winters that
rolled<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.180> reinforced<00:01:20.899> barrel<00:01:21.259> but<00:01:21.530> we<00:01:21.680> just

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
rolled a reinforced barrel but we just

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.889 
rolled a reinforced barrel but we just
haven't<00:01:22.130> leveled<00:01:22.369> it<00:01:22.640> up<00:01:22.729> yet<00:01:22.969> but<00:01:23.479> we<00:01:23.570> will<00:01:23.600> be

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
haven't leveled it up yet but we will be

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.690 
haven't leveled it up yet but we will be
this<00:01:24.289> one<00:01:24.469> rolled<00:01:24.710> battle<00:01:25.039> runner<00:01:25.250> which<00:01:25.549> is

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
this one rolled battle runner which is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.550 
this one rolled battle runner which is
also<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.030> real<00:01:26.270> nice<00:01:26.450> stat<00:01:26.780> kills<00:01:27.320> with<00:01:27.439> this

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
also a real nice stat kills with this

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.219 
also a real nice stat kills with this
weapon<00:01:27.740> grant<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.189> brief<00:01:28.430> boost<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.240> speed<00:01:29.450> and

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
weapon grant a brief boost of speed and

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.920 
weapon grant a brief boost of speed and
the<00:01:33.229> thing<00:01:33.469> is<00:01:33.500> fell<00:01:34.250> winters<00:01:34.549> lie<00:01:34.789> lies<00:01:35.450> it

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
the thing is fell winters lie lies it

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.340 
the thing is fell winters lie lies it
has<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.530> exact<00:01:36.920> same<00:01:36.950> impact<00:01:37.789> as<00:01:38.000> Matador<00:01:38.659> 64

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
has the exact same impact as Matador 64

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.819 
has the exact same impact as Matador 64
so<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.340> would<00:01:40.729> assume<00:01:41.060> Matador<00:01:41.509> 64<00:01:42.170> does<00:01:42.590> the

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
so you would assume Matador 64 does the

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.319 
so you would assume Matador 64 does the
same<00:01:43.009> damage<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:43.670> don't<00:01:43.850> know<00:01:43.909> if<00:01:44.030> it's<00:01:44.149> fell

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
same damage I don't know if it's fell

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.480 
same damage I don't know if it's fell
winters<00:01:44.630> lie<00:01:44.810> that's<00:01:45.049> lying<00:01:45.259> or<00:01:45.469> Matador<00:01:45.890> 64

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
winters lie that's lying or Matador 64

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.109 
winters lie that's lying or Matador 64
that's<00:01:46.700> lion<00:01:46.909> but<00:01:47.149> Matador<00:01:47.869> 64<00:01:48.560> only<00:01:49.219> does<00:01:49.460> 24

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
that's lion but Matador 64 only does 24

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.969 
that's lion but Matador 64 only does 24
damage<00:01:50.539> no<00:01:50.750> matter<00:01:50.929> how<00:01:51.170> hard<00:01:51.439> you<00:01:51.500> try<00:01:51.619> you

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
damage no matter how hard you try you

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.819 
damage no matter how hard you try you
can't<00:01:52.429> get<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:52.880> hit<00:01:53.060> 425<00:01:53.719> no<00:01:54.469> matter<00:01:54.649> how

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
can't get it to hit 425 no matter how

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.679 
can't get it to hit 425 no matter how
close<00:01:55.189> which<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:56.090> really<00:01:56.270> unfortunate

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
close which is really unfortunate

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.800 
close which is really unfortunate
because<00:01:57.399> when<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:58.490> compare<00:01:58.969> party<00:01:59.359> crasher

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
because when you compare party crasher

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.800 
because when you compare party crasher
to<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.320> matador<00:02:01.000> party<00:02:02.000> crasher<00:02:02.359> has<00:02:02.539> less

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
to the matador party crasher has less

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.899 
to the matador party crasher has less
impact<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.560> more<00:02:03.890> rate<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.249> fire<00:02:04.460> more

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
impact and more rate of fire more

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.239 
impact and more rate of fire more
stability<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.659> more<00:02:05.810> reload<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.039> would

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
stability and more reload so you would

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.460 
stability and more reload so you would
assume<00:02:07.579> Matador<00:02:08.090> does<00:02:08.270> more<00:02:08.479> damage<00:02:08.509> but<00:02:09.289> in

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
assume Matador does more damage but in

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.920 
assume Matador does more damage but in
fact<00:02:09.950> they<00:02:10.399> do<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.729> exact<00:02:11.060> same<00:02:11.090> damage<00:02:11.570> they

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
fact they do the exact same damage they

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.040 
fact they do the exact same damage they
both<00:02:12.170> do<00:02:12.440> 24<00:02:13.070> for<00:02:13.880> quite<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> while<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.390> assumed

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
both do 24 for quite a while I assumed

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.530 
both do 24 for quite a while I assumed
Matador<00:02:15.620> was<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.920> best<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.519> talked<00:02:17.180> about<00:02:17.420> it

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
Matador was the best I talked about it

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.690 
Matador was the best I talked about it
being<00:02:17.629> the<00:02:17.840> best<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.470> didn't<00:02:19.310> have<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.459> fell

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
being the best I didn't have a fell

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.590 
being the best I didn't have a fell
winters<00:02:20.000> at<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.209> time

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
winters at the time

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600 
winters at the time
I'm<00:02:21.050> talking<00:02:21.440> about<00:02:21.470> between<00:02:21.890> party<00:02:22.250> crasher

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
I'm talking about between party crasher

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.260 
I'm talking about between party crasher
Matador<00:02:23.030> but<00:02:23.660> after<00:02:24.530> playing<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:25.130> lot<00:02:25.490> of<00:02:25.700> PvP

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
Matador but after playing a lot of PvP

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.970 
Matador but after playing a lot of PvP
with<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:27.020> determined<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.590> party

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
with it I have determined that party

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.550 
with it I have determined that party
crasher<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.610> in<00:02:28.880> fact<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.480> clear<00:02:29.720> Victor<00:02:30.200> /

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
crasher is in fact the clear Victor /

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.790 
crasher is in fact the clear Victor /
matador<00:02:31.070> versus<00:02:31.520> party<00:02:31.850> crasher<00:02:32.300> fighting

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
matador versus party crasher fighting

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.200 
matador versus party crasher fighting
party<00:02:33.800> crasher<00:02:34.160> has<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.340> better<00:02:34.610> rate<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:34.970> fire

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
party crasher has a better rate of fire

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.540 
party crasher has a better rate of fire
allowing<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.990> kill<00:02:36.680> more<00:02:36.950> people<00:02:37.160> in<00:02:37.490> the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
allowing you to kill more people in the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.500 
allowing you to kill more people in the
same<00:02:37.820> amount<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.240> time<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:41.120> does<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.480> same

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
same amount of time and it does the same

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.410 
same amount of time and it does the same
exact<00:02:42.110> damage<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.700> only<00:02:43.850> downside<00:02:44.330> of

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
exact damage so the only downside of

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.940 
exact damage so the only downside of
party<00:02:44.660> crashers<00:02:44.990> I<00:02:45.140> don't<00:02:45.380> really<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.770> it's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
party crashers I don't really like it's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.740 
party crashers I don't really like it's
iron<00:02:46.190> sights<00:02:46.550> but<00:02:46.820> once<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.270> get<00:02:47.390> used<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.690> a

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
iron sights but once you get used to a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.240 
iron sights but once you get used to a
shotgun<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.290> don't<00:02:48.470> really<00:02:48.620> care<00:02:48.950> about<00:02:48.980> the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
shotgun you don't really care about the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.090 
shotgun you don't really care about the
iron<00:02:49.490> sights<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.780> if<00:02:50.930> you're<00:02:51.140> if<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.920> don't

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
iron sights so if you're if you don't

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.320 
iron sights so if you're if you don't
have<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> fell<00:02:52.490> winters<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.910> you're<00:02:53.000> trying<00:02:53.180> to

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
have a fell winters and you're trying to

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.150 
have a fell winters and you're trying to
determine<00:02:53.570> what<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.620> want<00:02:54.770> to<00:02:54.890> put<00:02:55.070> your

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
determine what you want to put your

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.100 
determine what you want to put your
moats<00:02:55.460> and<00:02:55.640> do<00:02:55.820> rolling<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.240> perfect<00:02:56.660> role<00:02:56.840> I

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
moats and do rolling a perfect role I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.950 
moats and do rolling a perfect role I
suggest<00:02:57.890> party<00:02:58.220> crasher<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.180> in<00:02:59.420> my

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
suggest party crasher it is in my

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.010 
suggest party crasher it is in my
opinion<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.590> better<00:03:00.860> shotgun<00:03:01.730> now<00:03:02.510> all<00:03:02.810> three

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
opinion the better shotgun now all three

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.440 
opinion the better shotgun now all three
of<00:03:03.110> these<00:03:03.290> are<00:03:03.350> great<00:03:03.770> but<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:04.490> I<00:03:04.820> said<00:03:04.880> these

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
of these are great but like I said these

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.110 
of these are great but like I said these
ones<00:03:05.690> do<00:03:05.870> 24<00:03:06.440> damage<00:03:06.860> each<00:03:07.070> pellet<00:03:07.400> which

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
ones do 24 damage each pellet which

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.090 
ones do 24 damage each pellet which
takes<00:03:08.510> nine<00:03:08.870> pellets<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.590> kill<00:03:09.830> someone

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
takes nine pellets to kill someone

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.130 
takes nine pellets to kill someone
unless<00:03:10.580> they're<00:03:10.790> very<00:03:11.030> low<00:03:11.300> armored<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:11.960> can

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
unless they're very low armored you can

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.200 
unless they're very low armored you can
kill<00:03:12.350> them<00:03:12.470> an<00:03:12.590> eight<00:03:12.830> I<00:03:13.100> believe<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.090> can

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
kill them an eight I believe you can

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.660 
kill them an eight I believe you can
kill<00:03:14.390> someone<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:14.780> 192<00:03:15.530> damage<00:03:16.100> that<00:03:16.310> has<00:03:16.460> low

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
kill someone in 192 damage that has low

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.990 
kill someone in 192 damage that has low
armor<00:03:17.020> which<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.470> will<00:03:18.620> be<00:03:18.740> doing<00:03:18.920> if<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.820> hit

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
armor which you will be doing if you hit

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.330 
armor which you will be doing if you hit
them<00:03:20.150> with<00:03:20.330> nine<00:03:20.540> pellets<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:21.110> believe<00:03:21.380> or<00:03:21.590> with

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
them with nine pellets I believe or with

them with nine pellets I believe or with
eight<00:03:22.520> pellets<00:03:22.880> but<00:03:23.750> ever<00:03:24.440> since<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.800> got<00:03:24.830> a
