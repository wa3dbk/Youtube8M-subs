00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.850 

this<00:01:07.330> is<00:01:07.480> the<00:01:07.570> wonderful<00:01:07.840> traffic<00:01:08.440> I<00:01:08.560> have<00:01:08.740> to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
this is the wonderful traffic I have to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:30.450 
this is the wonderful traffic I have to
deal<00:01:09.040> with

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.250 

a<00:01:30.520> little<00:01:31.180> bit<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.360> torque<00:01:31.600> steer<00:01:31.870> there<00:01:32.080> as

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
a little bit of torque steer there as

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.719 
a little bit of torque steer there as
you<00:01:32.409> can<00:01:32.530> see<00:01:32.680> I<00:01:32.710> had<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.070> tug<00:01:33.490> with<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
you can see I had to tug with the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.719 
you can see I had to tug with the
steering<00:01:33.970> wheel<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:36.070> know<00:01:36.190> just<00:01:36.490> got<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.670> be

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
steering wheel you know just got to be

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.109 
steering wheel you know just got to be
careful<00:01:36.880> applying<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.720> throttle<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.970> else

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
careful applying the throttle or else

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.490 
careful applying the throttle or else
you're<00:01:40.270> going<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.630> traction<00:01:40.900> control<00:01:41.380> is

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
you're going to the traction control is

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.960 
you're going to the traction control is
going<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.680> intervene<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.520> then<00:01:42.640> it's<00:01:42.820> just

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
going to intervene and then it's just

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.370 
going to intervene and then it's just
you're<00:01:43.600> not<00:01:43.659> going<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.930> be<00:01:43.990> able<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.170> go

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
you're not going to be able to go

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.340 
you're not going to be able to go
because<00:01:45.100> it's<00:01:45.310> it's<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.990> traction

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
because it's it's just the traction

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.320 
because it's it's just the traction
control<00:01:47.650> is<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:47.890> powerful<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.460> takes<00:01:48.670> away<00:01:49.300> all

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
control is so powerful it takes away all

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.580 
control is so powerful it takes away all
control<00:01:49.930> for<00:01:50.110> mobiles<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:53.229> car<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.560> very

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
control for mobiles but the car is very

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.080 
control for mobiles but the car is very
smooth<00:01:54.280> riding<00:01:55.860> over<00:01:56.860> bumps<00:01:57.430> it<00:01:57.640> is<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.850> bit

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
smooth riding over bumps it is a bit

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.120 
smooth riding over bumps it is a bit
harsh<00:01:58.420> but<00:01:58.780> it's<00:01:59.320> never<00:01:59.500> unsettled<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
harsh but it's never unsettled and the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.889 
harsh but it's never unsettled and the
wind<00:02:03.340> noise<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.729> here<00:02:03.940> really<00:02:04.179> isn't<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.600> bad

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
wind noise in here really isn't that bad

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.050 
wind noise in here really isn't that bad
some<00:02:05.590> people<00:02:05.619> complain<00:02:06.220> about<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.820> wouldn't

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
some people complain about it I wouldn't

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.690 
some people complain about it I wouldn't
say<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.509> know<00:02:07.630> this<00:02:07.929> is<00:02:08.289> like<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.039> Buick<00:02:09.429> or

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
say you know this is like a Buick or

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.919 
say you know this is like a Buick or
anything<00:02:09.910> when<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.330> comes<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.690> sound

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
anything when it comes to sound

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.610 
anything when it comes to sound
deadening<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:13.019> think<00:02:14.019> it<00:02:14.110> does<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> very<00:02:14.470> good

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
deadening I think it does a very good

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.320 
deadening I think it does a very good
job<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:15.070> definitely<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.519> good<00:02:15.640> road<00:02:15.880> trip<00:02:15.910> car

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
job it's definitely a good road trip car

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.220 
job it's definitely a good road trip car
we've<00:02:16.900> driven<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:18.300> New<00:02:19.300> York<00:02:19.450> countless

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
we've driven this to New York countless

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.990 
we've driven this to New York countless
times<00:02:20.470> which<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:20.890> an<00:02:21.070> eight<00:02:21.220> hour<00:02:21.370> drive<00:02:21.640> for

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
times which is an eight hour drive for

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.620 
times which is an eight hour drive for
us<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:23.310> we<00:02:24.310> certainly<00:02:24.519> don't<00:02:25.209> mind<00:02:25.450> taking

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
us so we certainly don't mind taking

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:40.369 
us so we certainly don't mind taking
this<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.019> road<00:02:26.140> trip

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.940 

you<00:02:40.769> may<00:02:40.890> be<00:02:40.950> able<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.219> hear<00:02:41.400> all<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.849> sand

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
you may be able to hear all the sand

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.199 
you may be able to hear all the sand
it's<00:02:43.950> because<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.250> recent<00:02:44.400> snow<00:02:44.969> we've

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
it's because of the recent snow we've

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.250 
it's because of the recent snow we've
had<00:02:50.359> all<00:02:51.359> right<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.719> this<00:02:51.810> time<00:02:52.019> I'm<00:02:52.140> gonna

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
had all right and this time I'm gonna

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.339 
had all right and this time I'm gonna
turn<00:02:52.379> traction<00:02:52.890> control<00:02:53.219> off<00:02:54.109> just<00:02:55.109> so<00:02:55.260> you

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
turn traction control off just so you

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.190 
turn traction control off just so you
can<00:02:55.469> see<00:02:55.909> how<00:02:56.909> ridiculous<00:02:57.359> this<00:02:57.659> car<00:02:57.900> can<00:02:58.079> be

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
can see how ridiculous this car can be

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:11.190 
can see how ridiculous this car can be
when<00:02:58.409> you<00:02:58.500> really<00:02:58.829> mash<00:02:59.159> it

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.839

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
not surprisingly the wheels that really

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.699 
not surprisingly the wheels that really
spend<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.150> much<00:03:13.300> this<00:03:13.480> time

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
spend that much this time

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.619 
spend that much this time
