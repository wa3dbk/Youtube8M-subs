00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 Here it final federer djokovic-re 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.910
 tomorrow on the dubai side today 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.559
 federer unrolled against them that's 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.530
 pacory on the wound tchô reach otherwise I 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.509
 let me hear Benoît 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.180
 djokovic pained his side to beat 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.240
 daumas berdych then brings to simon 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.289
 equation is good federer is he favorite 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.420
 against djokovic 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.300
 we go right away on the central court 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:37.170
 benoit my equation is she beats benoît 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:39.719
 the cosine of the cutting edge but of what 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.780
 you speak you kill you betray me a 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.969
 equation tennis and well it falls satin 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.010
 yeah good equation which has federer 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.660
 unfolded against show reach and then 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.370
 djokovic started well 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.559
 fucking moment we know we got a little 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.660
 worried that deal with berdych whose federer 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.980
 favorite against djokovic but it's simple 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.070
 it's your equation here it's my 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.550
 equation and equations good jobs for 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.830
 a term like that my good einstein you 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 I think it's the language 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.990
 already you can not make a division in 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.840
 two numbers especially that an equation 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.000
 it does not give a favorite 1 should the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.479
 to know if you did not stop at the PC 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.450
 equation 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.680
 it gives a tie held a quality 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.259
 an equation with attention with x 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.150
 variables a good if so and at 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.920
 content of a known as they say but if 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.720
 you all know equations 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.060
 even you finally know that it's good 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.200
 not it's not very high as would say 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.540
 most famous pub the ssl d'almere little 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.159
 unequal mc2 of course and that's 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.439
 this time the price known there are two 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.509
 other than universal even if he is my 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.500
 physio he knew like this one 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.630
 artesian go the square root of the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.820
 variable of a neurasthenic sheep more 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.970
 a balloon for the world knows it gives it 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.970
 it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.450
 so there unknown to this equation well 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.009
 sure it's the hairdresser thiem what to do 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.179
 and then seeing the result we do not have the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.650
 all want to know him the quartet 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.840
 anne who remains unknown this one we want 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.850
 not see it but that's the first 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.110
 second the second decline and the one to 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.000
 look at this one because she is 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.970
 complicated as attention to my script 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.640
 on pole well vd / even trip line by the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.709
 variable of a seal at tp always 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.940
 been equal to ayew 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:39.630
 it is riou it is rémy riou it looks like 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.630
 rowed will be trained youyous of paimpol 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.560
 attention be careful attention to that 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.970
 it works this equation 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.670
 we must push him and the beast to the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.980
 super complicated I removed the dad from 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.110
 yoann who managed to do it 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.870
 Eric with good armelle de 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.570
 ban the seal has filed a complaint for 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.010
 sexual violence is disgusting 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.950
 while in Dubai people like to 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.160
 dubai we laugh at you or what 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.060
 djokovic federer but we know it by 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.209
 heart this equation 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.090
 it's the 37th time we've been offered 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.329
 on the circuit the 37th time up 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.489
 present federer he solved it 19 times 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.410
 djokovic 17 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.940
 as much to say it as to find the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.410
 result you will blacken the table 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:33.130
 in fact everything depends on the variables of the 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.989
 moment look good it's going to have to 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.070
 roger serve very well to play the 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.840
 no more possible 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.820
 as against John Rich there to suffocate 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.769
 djokovic will have to propose 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.110
 also unknown shutters and who 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.120
 multiply the poses to smother the 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.519
 family you see the thing because novak 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.239
 at the level of the pines it is well regulated 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.700
 also in forehand and backhand 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.470
 berdych he even took a few 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.430
 sumptuous volley 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.210
 not to mention the passings at the halls to a 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.920
 October 9 year 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:11.220
 so as the equation is simple 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:15.090
 it's a + 2 the world number one against 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.520
 the world number two x the four 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.989
 titles already won by djokovic at 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:25.890
 dubai of the aimed by maybe it's 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.900
 win in dubai by federer he has whose 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.300
 there is one certainty is that there is no 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.310
 Favorite Albert TV Touques and 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.880
 a favorite on a match like that you're a 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.580
 big sick 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.410
 the only unknown in history is 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.600
 is roger what cannibal 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.210
 de baal will be able to play at this 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.520
 level there against djokovic because 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.440
 since his return from vacation he has nothing 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.240
 made in this tournament he with poor 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.729
 mac is the only unknown 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.440
 benoît who will win give benoît there 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.389
 I do not want to see who will win 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.400
 benoît extra time 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.630
 no no no no time does not have the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.030
 extra time time there is only time 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.720
 who will win 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.370
 djokovic but it hurts to thieves 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.759
 1 supporters of the harbors 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.759
 to be happy
