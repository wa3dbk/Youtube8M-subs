because<00:03:10.010> that's<00:03:10.280> all<00:03:10.700> that's<00:03:10.760> out<00:03:11.209> there<00:03:11.560> my

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
because that's all that's out there my

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.699 
because that's all that's out there my
program<00:03:13.130> gives<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:14.359> this<00:03:14.780> alternative

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
program gives that this alternative

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.599 
program gives that this alternative
which<00:03:16.459> really<00:03:16.760> really<00:03:17.600> helps<00:03:17.989> given<00:03:18.889> the

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
which really really helps given the

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.199 
which really really helps given the
right<00:03:19.730> water<00:03:20.650> people<00:03:21.650> have<00:03:22.190> no<00:03:22.489> idea<00:03:22.940> what's

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
right water people have no idea what's

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.440 
right water people have no idea what's
right

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
right

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.309 
right
and<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.750> we<00:03:25.260> cover<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.800> as<00:03:25.860> well<00:03:27.140> when<00:03:28.140> you

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
and and we cover that as well when you

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.680 
and and we cover that as well when you
talk<00:03:28.530> about<00:03:28.640> blueprint<00:03:29.640> are<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.239> talking

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
talk about blueprint are you talking

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.470 
talk about blueprint are you talking
about<00:03:30.930> their<00:03:31.890> genetics<00:03:32.520> or<00:03:32.849> what<00:03:33.120> how<00:03:33.420> does

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
about their genetics or what how does

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.400 
about their genetics or what how does
that<00:03:33.810> work<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.410> little<00:03:34.709> bit<00:03:35.750> everyone<00:03:36.750> has<00:03:37.080> a

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
that work a little bit everyone has a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.250 
that work a little bit everyone has a
specific<00:03:38.130> DNA<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.599> a<00:03:40.440> genetic<00:03:40.470> build<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:42.260> no

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260

never<00:03:47.520> fits<00:03:48.390> all<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.400> so<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.730> am<00:03:51.540> working

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
never fits all and so I am working

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.150 
never fits all and so I am working

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
through a ancient art that I use called

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.229 
through a ancient art that I use called
dowsing<00:03:56.670> with<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.810> pendulum<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.650> I've<00:03:59.580> been

I spent two years going around the world

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.770 
I spent two years going around the world
to<00:04:24.720> find<00:04:25.020> first<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:26.400> all<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.639> integrity<00:04:27.270> of

two years to put my supplements together
it<00:04:41.370> is<00:04:42.380> phytonutrient<00:04:43.380> therapy<00:04:44.330> when<00:04:45.330> you

it is phytonutrient therapy when you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.460 
it is phytonutrient therapy when you

take a multivitamin and put it into your

phytonutrient or plant nutrient therapy
that<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.140> use<00:05:04.260> has<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:05.340> whole<00:05:05.640> food<00:05:05.880> intact<00:05:06.810> and

that I use has the whole food intact and

so it will safely excrete what it

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.570 
so it will safely excrete what it
doesn't<00:05:10.710> need<00:05:11.160> which<00:05:11.760> even<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:13.289> natural
