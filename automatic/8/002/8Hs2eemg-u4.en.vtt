00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
age but I started to experiment with

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.100 
age but I started to experiment with
maybe<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.190> bit<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.399> mascara<00:00:44.700> or<00:00:45.480> lip<00:00:46.079> gloss

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110

maybe a bit of blusher as well so it's a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.889 
maybe a bit of blusher as well so it's a
rather<00:00:49.350> natural<00:00:50.010> picture<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> eyebrows

definitely<00:01:51.659> over<00:01:51.780> plucked<00:01:52.079> them<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.439> March<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
definitely over plucked them to March I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.889 
definitely over plucked them to March I
think<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.520> actually<00:01:53.729> wearing<00:01:54.180> pink<00:01:54.570> eye

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
think I'm actually wearing pink eye

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.719 
think I'm actually wearing pink eye
shadow<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.500> picture<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:55.950> well<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.460> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
shadow in this picture as well so I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.429 
shadow in this picture as well so I
clearly<00:01:57.299> thought<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.990> matched<00:01:58.229> my

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
clearly thought that that matched my

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.859 
clearly thought that that matched my
dress<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.670> looking<00:01:59.969> back<00:02:00.119> maybe<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
dress but looking back maybe not the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.530 
dress but looking back maybe not the
best<00:02:00.899> eye<00:02:01.380> shadow<00:02:01.649> color<00:02:01.920> choice<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.969> come<00:02:03.420> on

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
best eye shadow color choice so come on

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
enough to rock the pink eyeshadow it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.360 
enough to rock the pink eyeshadow it
and<00:02:11.750> then<00:02:12.020> for<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.530> following<00:02:12.890> year<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.220> was

and then for the following year I was

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.210 
and then for the following year I was
lucky<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.670> be<00:02:13.910> invited<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.530> sixth-form

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.790 
lucky to be invited to the sixth-form
prom<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.910> again<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:17.900> went<00:02:18.170> for<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.380> pink<00:02:18.560> dress

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
prom and again I went for a pink dress

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.860 
prom and again I went for a pink dress
clearly<00:02:19.670> there's<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.910> theme<00:02:20.180> going<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:20.630> there

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
clearly there's a theme going on there

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.190 
clearly there's a theme going on there
and<00:02:21.080> curly<00:02:21.920> hair<00:02:21.950> again<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:23.180> tiara<00:02:23.900> this

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
and curly hair again and a tiara this

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.540 
and curly hair again and a tiara this
time<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.440> didn't<00:02:24.710> wear<00:02:24.830> one<00:02:24.860> they<00:02:25.190> give<00:02:25.400> before

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
time I didn't wear one they give before

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.270 
time I didn't wear one they give before
I<00:02:26.510> think<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.020> toned<00:02:27.290> down<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.680> makeup<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.040> little

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
I think I toned down the makeup a little

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.850 
I think I toned down the makeup a little
bit<00:02:28.430> from<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.940> year<00:02:29.240> but<00:02:30.020> again<00:02:30.590> it's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
bit from that year but again it's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.460 
bit from that year but again it's
definitely<00:02:31.430> with<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.480> eyebrows<00:02:32.930> there's<00:02:33.380> a

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
definitely with the eyebrows there's a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.760 
definitely with the eyebrows there's a
lot<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.800> black<00:02:34.640> eyeliner<00:02:34.910> going<00:02:35.570> on<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.960> pink

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
lot of black eyeliner going on and pink

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.230 
lot of black eyeliner going on and pink
lips<00:02:37.040> as<00:02:37.310> always

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
lips as always

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.090 
lips as always
so<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.930> next<00:02:39.110> one<00:02:39.290> brings<00:02:39.530> back<00:02:39.710> really<00:02:40.040> good

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
so the next one brings back really good

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.950 
so the next one brings back really good
memories<00:02:40.520> for<00:02:40.670> me<00:02:40.820> because<00:02:41.150> this<00:02:41.270> was<00:02:41.510> my<00:02:41.720> last

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
memories for me because this was my last

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.190 
memories for me because this was my last
day<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.260> school<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:44.630> reason<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.020> brings

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
day of school and the reason it brings

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.230 
day of school and the reason it brings
back<00:02:45.440> such<00:02:45.650> good<00:02:45.680> memories<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:46.340> because<00:02:47.000> I've

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
back such good memories is because I've

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.420 
back such good memories is because I've
as<00:02:47.780> I've<00:02:48.020> spoken<00:02:48.290> about<00:02:48.440> on<00:02:48.650> my<00:02:48.800> channel<00:02:48.830> had

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
as I've spoken about on my channel had

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.850 
as I've spoken about on my channel had
very<00:02:49.790> bad<00:02:49.940> skin<00:02:50.300> from<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.540> young<00:02:50.690> age<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.170> it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
very bad skin from a young age and it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.560 
very bad skin from a young age and it
started<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.310> clear<00:02:52.550> up<00:02:52.700> when<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:52.940> was<00:02:53.060> around<00:02:53.270> 16

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
started to clear up when I was around 16

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.950 
started to clear up when I was around 16
and<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.410> was<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.770> first<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.610> last<00:02:56.300> day<00:02:56.930> that

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
and this was the first and last day that

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.820 
and this was the first and last day that
I<00:02:57.200> ever<00:02:57.470> wore<00:02:58.190> no<00:02:58.490> foundation<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.180> school<00:02:59.830> but

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
I ever wore no foundation to school but

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.690 
I ever wore no foundation to school but
I<00:03:01.220> do<00:03:01.310> have<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.450> rather<00:03:02.630> strong<00:03:03.370> fake<00:03:04.370> tan

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
I do have a rather strong fake tan

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.060 
I do have a rather strong fake tan
because<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.480> was<00:03:05.600> our<00:03:05.720> prom<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.620> night<00:03:06.800> after

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
because it was our prom the night after

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.150 
because it was our prom the night after
I<00:03:07.310> think<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:08.270> this<00:03:08.690> was<00:03:08.900> me<00:03:09.110> very<00:03:09.620> happy<00:03:10.010> with

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
I think so this was me very happy with

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.650 
I think so this was me very happy with
myself<00:03:10.400> because<00:03:10.820> I<00:03:11.030> wasn't<00:03:11.180> wearing<00:03:11.390> any

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
myself because I wasn't wearing any

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.960 
myself because I wasn't wearing any
foundation<00:03:11.750> but<00:03:12.710> for<00:03:13.160> some<00:03:13.310> reason<00:03:13.550> I<00:03:13.640> decided

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
foundation but for some reason I decided

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.880 
foundation but for some reason I decided
to<00:03:14.240> stick<00:03:14.480> some<00:03:14.660> stars<00:03:14.990> and<00:03:15.290> things<00:03:15.470> around<00:03:15.650> my

as well looking back at this picture it

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.670 
as well looking back at this picture it
makes<00:04:20.060> me<00:04:20.299> really<00:04:20.540> remember<00:04:20.989> when<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.229> would<00:04:21.380> go

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
makes me really remember when I would go

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.980 
makes me really remember when I would go
to<00:04:21.710> boots<00:04:22.160> or<00:04:22.400> superdrug<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.570> had<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.780> kind

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
to boots or superdrug and I had to kind

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.570 
to boots or superdrug and I had to kind
of<00:04:24.080> be<00:04:24.290> able<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.560> buy<00:04:24.800> like<00:04:25.040> my<00:04:25.250> blue

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
of be able to buy like my blue

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.659 
of be able to buy like my blue
eyeliner<00:04:25.879> or<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.439> lipgloss<00:04:27.439> and<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:28.400> was<00:04:28.490> really

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
eyeliner or a lipgloss and it was really

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.219 
eyeliner or a lipgloss and it was really
exciting<00:04:29.210> for<00:04:29.240> me<00:04:29.539> back<00:04:29.720> then<00:04:29.930> that's

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
exciting for me back then that's

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.499 
exciting for me back then that's
basically<00:04:31.099> where<00:04:31.400> my<00:04:31.580> makeup<00:04:32.330> collection

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
basically where my makeup collection

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.990 
basically where my makeup collection
started<00:04:33.409> from<00:04:33.680> just<00:04:33.949> little<00:04:34.430> bits<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.759> pieces

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
started from just little bits and pieces

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.760 
started from just little bits and pieces
and<00:04:35.210> they<00:04:35.389> were<00:04:35.479> always<00:04:35.719> drugstore<00:04:36.439> products

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
and they were always drugstore products

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.679 
and they were always drugstore products
so<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:36.949> never<00:04:37.009> really<00:04:37.280> had<00:04:37.939> the<00:04:37.969> money<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.539> go

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:38.689 
so I never really had the money to go

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.320 
so I never really had the money to go
and<00:04:38.719> get<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.139> things<00:04:39.349> for<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.590> Mac<00:04:39.860> or<00:04:40.330> designer

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
and get the things for a Mac or designer

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.320 
and get the things for a Mac or designer
brands<00:04:42.069> but<00:04:43.069> I<00:04:43.370> think<00:04:43.729> that's<00:04:43.879> fine<00:04:44.150> when

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
brands but I think that's fine when

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.459 
brands but I think that's fine when
you're<00:04:44.449> younger<00:04:44.629> because<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:45.169> can<00:04:45.289> just

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:45.469 
you're younger because you can just

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.350 
you're younger because you can just
experiment<00:04:45.919> find<00:04:46.460> out<00:04:46.639> what's<00:04:46.819> right<00:04:47.030> for<00:04:47.210> you

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
experiment find out what's right for you

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.209 
experiment find out what's right for you
and<00:04:47.569> then<00:04:47.990> later<00:04:48.289> on<00:04:48.500> in<00:04:48.650> life<00:04:48.800> or<00:04:49.039> you<00:04:49.069> can

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:49.219 
and then later on in life or you can

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:51.159 
and then later on in life or you can
look<00:04:49.340> back<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:49.729> think<00:04:49.849> maybe<00:04:50.569> that<00:04:50.719> was<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:50.960> bit

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
look back and think maybe that was a bit

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.920 
look back and think maybe that was a bit
of<00:04:51.199> a<00:04:51.319> mistake<00:04:51.610> so<00:04:52.610> this<00:04:52.909> next<00:04:53.120> picture<00:04:53.629> is

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
of a mistake so this next picture is

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.719 
of a mistake so this next picture is
from<00:04:54.139> the<00:04:54.319> following<00:04:54.710> year<00:04:54.949> at<00:04:55.129> my<00:04:55.280> 18th

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
to make an effort as best I could

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.779

been<00:05:21.560> one<00:05:21.710> of<00:05:21.740> my<00:05:21.830> favorites<00:05:22.279> since<00:05:22.430> then

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
been one of my favorites since then

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.629 
been one of my favorites since then
because<00:05:23.330> of<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.569> memories<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.169> brings

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
because of the memories that it brings

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.879 
because of the memories that it brings
so<00:05:25.639> this<00:05:26.120> line<00:05:26.479> is<00:05:26.719> around<00:05:27.199> the<00:05:27.349> same<00:05:27.529> sort<00:05:27.800> of

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
so this line is around the same sort of

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.760 
so this line is around the same sort of
time<00:05:28.240> this<00:05:29.240> was<00:05:29.389> actually<00:05:29.569> when<00:05:29.930> I<00:05:30.259> was<00:05:30.620> in<00:05:30.710> a

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
time this was actually when I was in a

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.080 
time this was actually when I was in a
hotel<00:05:30.979> it<00:05:31.310> was<00:05:31.340> kind<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.669> like<00:05:31.759> a<00:05:31.819> birthday

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
hotel it was kind of like a birthday

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.570 
hotel it was kind of like a birthday
treat<00:05:32.599> to<00:05:32.779> go<00:05:32.990> to<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.199> spa<00:05:33.560> which<00:05:33.919> was<00:05:34.129> the<00:05:34.370> most

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
treat to go to a spa which was the most

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.860 
treat to go to a spa which was the most
exciting<00:05:35.060> thing<00:05:35.090> ever<00:05:35.330> because<00:05:35.659> I'd<00:05:35.719> never

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
exciting thing ever because I'd never

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.350 
exciting thing ever because I'd never
been<00:05:35.990> to<00:05:36.289> one<00:05:36.409> before<00:05:36.560> so<00:05:37.460> this<00:05:37.759> is<00:05:37.849> why<00:05:38.000> I<00:05:38.029> have

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
been to one before so this is why I have

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.490 
been to one before so this is why I have
a<00:05:38.569> robe<00:05:38.930> on<00:05:39.379> in<00:05:39.529> this<00:05:39.620> picture<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:41.199> it's<00:05:42.199> a

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
a robe on in this picture and it's a

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.930 
a robe on in this picture and it's a
fairly<00:05:42.830> natural<00:05:42.979> picture<00:05:43.520> there's<00:05:43.729> still

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
fairly natural picture there's still

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.230 
fairly natural picture there's still
some<00:05:44.750> rather<00:05:45.080> dubious<00:05:46.039> fake<00:05:46.339> tan<00:05:46.699> mistake

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
some rather dubious fake tan mistake

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.749 
some rather dubious fake tan mistake
that's<00:05:47.419> going<00:05:47.690> on<00:05:47.779> I<00:05:47.839> have<00:05:48.139> to<00:05:48.349> say<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:49.610> I've

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
that's going on I have to say and I've

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.659 
that's going on I have to say and I've
started<00:05:50.419> to<00:05:50.719> wear<00:05:50.900> blue<00:05:51.319> eyeliner<00:05:51.830> kind<00:05:52.370> of<00:05:52.490> in

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
started to wear blue eyeliner kind of in

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.510 
started to wear blue eyeliner kind of in
the<00:05:52.909> corners<00:05:53.629> of<00:05:53.810> my<00:05:53.839> eyes<00:05:54.169> for<00:05:54.889> some<00:05:55.069> reason

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
the corners of my eyes for some reason

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.350 
the corners of my eyes for some reason
and<00:05:56.180> I<00:05:57.080> can<00:05:57.289> see<00:05:57.529> that<00:05:57.770> I<00:05:57.919> was<00:05:58.610> wearing<00:05:59.000> a<00:05:59.180> bit

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
and I can see that I was wearing a bit

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.230 
and I can see that I was wearing a bit
more<00:05:59.629> eyeliner<00:06:00.589> and<00:06:00.949> mascara<00:06:01.069> and<00:06:01.729> my

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
more eyeliner and mascara and my

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.909 
more eyeliner and mascara and my
eyebrows<00:06:02.779> were<00:06:02.960> actually<00:06:03.379> getting<00:06:03.529> a<00:06:03.830> little

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
eyebrows were actually getting a little

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.309 
eyebrows were actually getting a little
bit<00:06:04.099> thicker<00:06:04.430> by<00:06:04.819> this<00:06:04.879> point<00:06:05.330> they're<00:06:06.050> not

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
bit thicker by this point they're not

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.829 
bit thicker by this point they're not
kind<00:06:06.589> of<00:06:06.740> as<00:06:06.919> thin<00:06:07.190> and<00:06:07.400> as<00:06:07.849> far<00:06:08.300> apart<00:06:08.389> even

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:08.839 
kind of as thin and as far apart even

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.350 
kind of as thin and as far apart even
though<00:06:09.199> they're<00:06:10.039> still<00:06:10.310> quite<00:06:10.430> bad<00:06:10.639> it's

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
though they're still quite bad it's

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.390 
though they're still quite bad it's
actually<00:06:11.479> quite<00:06:11.870> funny<00:06:12.139> that<00:06:12.440> I'm<00:06:12.650> at<00:06:13.009> a<00:06:13.039> spa

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
actually quite funny that I'm at a spa

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.570 
actually quite funny that I'm at a spa
but<00:06:13.759> I've<00:06:13.849> still<00:06:14.060> got<00:06:14.120> loads<00:06:14.389> of<00:06:14.509> makeup<00:06:14.900> on<00:06:15.110> I

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
but I've still got loads of makeup on I

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.240 
but I've still got loads of makeup on I
think<00:06:16.580> that's<00:06:16.909> always<00:06:17.120> been<00:06:17.569> me<00:06:17.810> I<00:06:18.080> feel<00:06:18.949> quiet

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
think that's always been me I feel quiet

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.159 
think that's always been me I feel quiet
I<00:06:19.520> don't<00:06:19.849> know<00:06:19.940> unconfident<00:06:20.539> without<00:06:20.930> makeup

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
I don't know unconfident without makeup

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.019 
I don't know unconfident without makeup
on<00:06:21.440> especially<00:06:21.800> when<00:06:22.190> I<00:06:22.219> was<00:06:22.370> a<00:06:22.460> bit<00:06:22.580> younger

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
on especially when I was a bit younger

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.320 
on especially when I was a bit younger
but<00:06:23.449> yeah<00:06:24.440> still<00:06:25.039> got<00:06:25.159> lots<00:06:25.310> of<00:06:25.520> makeup<00:06:25.849> on<00:06:26.060> and

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
but yeah still got lots of makeup on and

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.180 
but yeah still got lots of makeup on and
I'm<00:06:27.050> probably<00:06:27.379> about<00:06:27.620> to<00:06:27.860> go<00:06:27.949> in<00:06:28.039> the<00:06:28.099> swimming

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
I'm probably about to go in the swimming

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.040 
I'm probably about to go in the swimming
pool<00:06:28.550> which<00:06:28.729> makes<00:06:29.089> no<00:06:29.330> sense<00:06:29.569> at<00:06:29.719> all

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
pool which makes no sense at all

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.769 
pool which makes no sense at all
and<00:06:30.139> the<00:06:30.740> final<00:06:31.129> picture<00:06:31.279> that<00:06:31.819> I've<00:06:31.969> got<00:06:32.330> is

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:32.779 
and the final picture that I've got is

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.689 
and the final picture that I've got is
one<00:06:33.379> that's<00:06:33.529> actually<00:06:34.069> probably<00:06:34.219> the<00:06:34.520> most

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
one that's actually probably the most

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.629 
one that's actually probably the most
natural<00:06:35.060> out<00:06:35.479> of<00:06:35.599> all<00:06:35.779> of<00:06:35.810> them

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 
natural out of all of them

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.290 
natural out of all of them
because<00:06:36.969> as<00:06:37.210> you<00:06:37.449> can<00:06:37.629> see<00:06:37.960> I<00:06:38.400> am<00:06:39.400> very<00:06:39.819> powered

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
because as you can see I am very powered

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.379 
because as you can see I am very powered
not<00:06:40.509> relate<00:06:40.900> this<00:06:41.740> was<00:06:42.370> when<00:06:42.639> I<00:06:42.729> first<00:06:42.969> met<00:06:43.210> my

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
which is something that I haven't had

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.869 
which is something that I haven't had
