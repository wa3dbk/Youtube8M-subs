00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.020 

okay<00:01:35.720> stopping<00:01:36.740> with<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.770> pedal<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.550> neutral

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
okay stopping with the pedal in neutral

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
reason for pumping that brake is that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
reason for pumping that brake is that
there's<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.070> planetary<00:01:47.640> transmission

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.030

the petals the clamps down on one of the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.080 
the petals the clamps down on one of the
gears<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.119> got<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.360> lubricate<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.170> band

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090
