00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.689
 you're right let's start 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.810
 this time I took some time to make another video which is named 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.810
 stupid questions on yahoo answers 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.740
 good to start I want to say that I found several stupid questions 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.420
 but only buy some if the less grotesque xd 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.590
 first question 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.130
 because to give it good maradona 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.060
 to which they respond 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.680
 because who invented it who was seeing bogado saw pink elephants and 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.249
 purple dinosaurs 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:57.300

 hahaha who asks what good step we have to the next question 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.100
 because the moon more pursues 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.430
 because when we go in a car for example we are looking out the window 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.680
 it seems that it transmits to us 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.310
 it is not perceived that it is always there I can not believe there are such stupid people 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.960
 send your answers 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.200
 I can not believe that there are people like that from Toluca to leagues. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200

 I want to get one eye without drawing blood and I do not have very inside indhira 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.230
 I was afraid of biting my brain. Could you tell me how I do it? 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.560
 I recommend you not to use a knife once I did it and I must say 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.410
 it's nothing nice 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.320
 do not mame that question was rare I only have something to say without words 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.150
 because after the goal of evil 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.120
 that's because 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.550
 if the pigs fly every day it would seem ridiculous because 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.450
 My no 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.720
 to which she responds because you have not bathed 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.929

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.889

 how the force of a previous one is measured 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.089
 I have the doubt and ask 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.709
 and they respond 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.599
 would have to put a detector like those that use transit agents to measure 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.459
 speed a volume meter for rumble and as for textile standing 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.219
