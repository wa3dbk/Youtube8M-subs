chairs a little bit different that's not

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.410 
chairs a little bit different that's not
a<00:02:06.040> problem<00:02:06.340> gentlemen<00:02:06.729> there's<00:02:07.030> three

a problem gentlemen there's three

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.509 
a problem gentlemen there's three
different<00:02:08.019> positions<00:02:08.709> for<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:09.069> wheel<00:02:09.310> you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
different positions for this wheel you

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.300 
different positions for this wheel you
can<00:02:09.550> also<00:02:09.819> actually<00:02:10.509> tilt<00:02:11.139> the<00:02:11.349> wheel<00:02:11.560> itself

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
can also actually tilt the wheel itself

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.789 
can also actually tilt the wheel itself
the<00:02:12.519> actual<00:02:12.700> column<00:02:13.389> you<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.079> also<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.499> adjust

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
the actual column you can also to adjust

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:15.720 
the actual column you can also to adjust
position

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
position

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.970 
position
the<00:02:15.849> column<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.989> know<00:02:17.110> how<00:02:17.470> you<00:02:17.530> want<00:02:17.920> it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the column and you know how you want it

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.890 
the column and you know how you want it
to<00:02:18.129> be<00:02:18.280> horizontally<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.209> there's<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.450> lot<00:02:19.750> of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
to be horizontally so there's a lot of

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.869 
to be horizontally so there's a lot of
different<00:02:20.349> options<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.950> terms<00:02:21.159> of<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.849> know

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
different options in terms of you know

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.780 
different options in terms of you know
having<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.930> change<00:02:23.260> or<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:24.010> know<00:02:24.040> your<00:02:24.489> actual

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
having a change or you know your actual

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.699 
having a change or you know your actual
positioning<00:02:25.420> anything<00:02:26.170> like<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.590> it's

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
positioning anything like that and it's

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.039 
positioning anything like that and it's
also<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.220> very<00:02:27.459> easy<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.819> change<00:02:27.909> on<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.599> go

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
also it's very easy to change on the go

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.369 
also it's very easy to change on the go
now<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:30.459> stability<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.060> cannot<00:02:31.659> stress<00:02:32.049> the

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
now the stability I cannot stress the

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.500 
now the stability I cannot stress the
stability<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.099> wheel<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.580> worth<00:02:33.819> every

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
stability of this wheel is worth every

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.630 
stability of this wheel is worth every
single<00:02:34.540> penny<00:02:35.260> now<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.769> has<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.950> decent<00:02:36.489> way<00:02:36.610> to

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
single penny now it has a decent way to

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.820 
single penny now it has a decent way to
it<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.150> really<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:37.989> does<00:02:38.170> show<00:02:38.470> when<00:02:38.709> you're

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
it and really it does show when you're

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.470 
it and really it does show when you're
using<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:39.370> very<00:02:39.580> stable<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.180> ground

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
using and it's very stable to the ground

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.229 
using and it's very stable to the ground
I<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:41.590> not<00:02:41.860> once<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.459> know<00:02:42.579> had<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:43.000> wheel

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
I have not once you know had the wheel

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.910 
I have not once you know had the wheel
stand<00:02:43.629> you<00:02:43.810> know<00:02:43.840> start<00:02:44.200> moving<00:02:44.620> as<00:02:44.769> I'm

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
stand you know start moving as I'm

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.069 
stand you know start moving as I'm
driving<00:02:45.159> big<00:02:46.030> problem<00:02:46.540> when<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.720> had<00:02:46.959> the

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
driving big problem when I had the

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.509 
driving big problem when I had the
fanatic<00:02:47.500> below<00:02:47.739> because<00:02:47.829> I<00:02:47.980> had<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.400> know

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
fanatic below because I had you know

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.449 
fanatic below because I had you know
it's<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> really<00:02:48.910> just<00:02:49.420> overall<00:02:50.049> you<00:02:50.349> know

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
it's a really just overall you know

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.860 
it's a really just overall you know
unstable<00:02:51.459> table<00:02:51.760> on<00:02:52.120> there<00:02:52.329> so<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.480> could<00:02:52.720> never

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
unstable table on there so I could never

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.569 
unstable table on there so I could never
really<00:02:53.170> use<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.709> wheel<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.220> its<00:02:54.370> full

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
really use the wheel to its full

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.030 
really use the wheel to its full
potential<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.329> think<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.780> lot<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.290> real<00:02:56.530> owners

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
potential I think a lot of real owners

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.270 
potential I think a lot of real owners
you<00:02:57.489> know<00:02:57.640> lack<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:59.410> know<00:02:59.500> having<00:03:00.190> the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
you know lack that you know having the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.009 
you know lack that you know having the
wheel<00:03:00.519> on<00:03:00.819> your<00:03:01.030> full<00:03:01.299> potential<00:03:01.720> you're

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
wheel on your full potential you're

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.270 
wheel on your full potential you're
running<00:03:02.349> at<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.500> hundred<00:03:02.680> percent<00:03:02.859> force

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
running at a hundred percent force

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.699 
running at a hundred percent force
feedback<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:03.970> now<00:03:04.269> I<00:03:04.540> can<00:03:04.840> do<00:03:05.079> this<00:03:05.319> because

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
feedback and now I can do this because

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.710 
feedback and now I can do this because
of<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.859> wheel<00:03:06.010> stand<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.000> know<00:03:07.180> my<00:03:07.359> hat<00:03:07.569> is
