00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:12.599
 hello everyone and welcome to kbs tv 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.969
 today once is not custom a quarter of souls present you and to 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.430
 the test of a vehicle that in fact will never be marketed again in 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.380
 la France 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.690
 but for the most part it's not a big deal since it's actually a 7-hour leap 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.989
 fundata bar xixe clarity 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.879
 for it's a sort of technological showcase for its builder 

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:31.489
 it's the first vehicle 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.710
 6% and to distribute and market and that works with a battery to 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.850
 combustible 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.980
 to a fuel cell that is responsible for providing electricity to the engine 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.430
 companies that have been upset to clarify themselves look a little bit like 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.300
 little sister la honda insight 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.040
 if the hybrid vehicle of the range 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.600
 at the front side especially recognizes a little bit 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.390
 traits the feature 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.120
 a little step mother of a family 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.130
 at the template level we are dealing with a vehicle that is big enough 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.430
 more than a measure 4 to 84 2% 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.040
 at the width level at 84 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.260
 at the height it remains quite limited to 1 h 47 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.540
 it is therefore 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.080
 in a car that can be compared to albers the first nine type 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.630
 bmw series 5 hours 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.720
 a mercedes e-class or not at all the family in e2 so 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.890
 enough% by posing multiple citroen c5 or the passage 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.909
 stop explaining a little bit how it works 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:43.890
 the vehicle 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.680
 a truck of his motorization 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.070
 before everything starts here actually in the trunk 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.020
 so where is the tank% and hydrogen it serves as a fuel for 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.250
 fuel cells 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.510
 the fuel cells it is inside the vehicle 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.950
 since it is located 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.310
 between the two passengers before 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.270
 here at the level of color its own central 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.900
 in the tunnel 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.590
 this fuel cell 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.380
 charge to produce electricity 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.689
 it goes without saying to the electric motor that is located him 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.490
 traditionally as on one of the most classic 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.490
 at the front under the bonnet 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.809
 to fill the hydrogen tank it's pretty simple it actually looks like 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:32.599
 to gprs systems 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.040
 so we have this hanin roger company which is one of the few in germany 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.449
 % 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:39.320
 on the other hand 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.320
 the pipe 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.999
 and then we start filling the tank of time on his way 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.339
 so here we just finished filling the voice tank have 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.669
 fills up so we have eight a gain of 46 pounds 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.569
 of hydrogen in the tank 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.469
 for now it's a little bit difficult to talk about prayer for this 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.829
 which is hydrogen 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.959
 So what was decided in any case at this aspect of 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.379
 this station is to have a price equivalent to those of diesel 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.989
 that is to say that for with a kilo of hydrogen in route roughly 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.719
 so kilometers time 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.539
 to make 50 km we would have needed 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:19.009
 the man is at least 7 liters of diesel so we get paid pretty much 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:20.989
 the equivalent of 7 liters of diesel 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.989
 gold today so the price is 8 euros 80 for martin kilos to 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.989
 hydrogen and in the tank we can put up to him 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.519
 so it's driving this fight fcx clarity 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.709
 there is not much to say in fact driving exactly the same 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.319
 a classic automatic car only 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.279
