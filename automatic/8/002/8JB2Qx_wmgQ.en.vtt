the board using span D's and being sure
to<00:01:11.700> line<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.390> wood<00:01:12.600> grain<00:01:12.840> i<00:01:13.170> cut<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to line up the wood grain i cut the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.010 
to line up the wood grain i cut the
board<00:01:14.520> down<00:01:14.790> into<00:01:15.240> smaller<00:01:15.630> manageable

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
board down into smaller manageable

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.160 
board down into smaller manageable
pieces<00:01:16.610> then<00:01:17.610> cut<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.030> each<00:01:18.390> letter<00:01:18.659> using<00:01:19.080> my

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
pieces then cut out each letter using my

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.920 
pieces then cut out each letter using my
scroll<00:01:19.470> saw<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:20.729> takes<00:01:20.970> some<00:01:21.119> practice<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.720> cut

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
scroll saw it takes some practice to cut

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
scroll saw it takes some practice to cut
closely<00:01:22.470> along<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> lines<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.580> round<00:01:23.790> curves

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
closely along the lines and round curves

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.719 
closely along the lines and round curves
but<00:01:25.110> after<00:01:25.530> some<00:01:25.710> practice<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> feel

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
but after some practice you get a feel

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
but after some practice you get a feel
for<00:01:26.939> how<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> make<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> blade<00:01:27.750> cut<00:01:28.229> where<00:01:28.500> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
for how to make the blade cut where you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.760 
for how to make the blade cut where you
want<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.150> flow<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.390> interior<00:01:31.049> cuts<00:01:31.320> such

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
want it to flow the interior cuts such

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.319 
want it to flow the interior cuts such
as<00:01:32.040> holes<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> letters<00:01:33.930> O<00:01:34.110> II<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.130> Pete<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
as holes and the letters O II and Pete I

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.450 
as holes and the letters O II and Pete I
drilled<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.409> starter<00:01:37.829> hole<00:01:38.040> where<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.369> could

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
drilled a starter hole where I could

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.679 
drilled a starter hole where I could
insert<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> blade<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:40.049> begin<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> cut<00:01:41.689> it

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
insert the blade to begin the cut it

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.440 
insert the blade to begin the cut it
took<00:01:43.049> me<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.500> two<00:01:43.860> hours<00:01:43.890> total<00:01:44.820> time<00:01:45.090> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
cut all of the pieces for the sign after

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.429

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.859 
I sanded it smooth and then use some
blue<00:01:58.619> tape<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.280> mask<00:01:59.579> off<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.240> border<00:02:00.750> around

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
blue tape to mask off a border around

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.190 
blue tape to mask off a border around
the<00:02:01.170> edges<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.070> then<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.420> spray<00:02:03.840> painted

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the edges and then I just spray painted

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.650 
the edges and then I just spray painted
it<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.530> some<00:02:04.890> flat<00:02:05.280> blacks<00:02:05.759> right

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
it with some flat blacks right

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.330 
it with some flat blacks right
that<00:02:07.660> border<00:02:08.050> was<00:02:08.229> really<00:02:08.560> easy<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:08.890> create

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
that border was really easy to create

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.760 
that border was really easy to create
and<00:02:09.580> it<00:02:09.820> really<00:02:10.030> adds<00:02:10.240> a<00:02:10.479> nice<00:02:10.660> design<00:02:11.200> element

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
and it really adds a nice design element

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.830 
and it really adds a nice design element
to<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.070> sign<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:15.730> long<00:02:15.910> as<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.180> don't<00:02:16.330> use<00:02:16.630> too

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
to the sign as long as you don't use too

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.080 
to the sign as long as you don't use too
much<00:02:16.870> spray<00:02:17.320> adhesive<00:02:17.890> your<00:02:18.400> template<00:02:18.880> should

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
much spray adhesive your template should

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.840 
much spray adhesive your template should
peel<00:02:19.360> off<00:02:19.570> pretty<00:02:19.840> easily<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.280> doesn't<00:02:21.730> you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
peel off pretty easily if it doesn't you

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.090 
peel off pretty easily if it doesn't you
can<00:02:21.880> always<00:02:22.060> rub<00:02:22.840> some<00:02:23.110> mineral<00:02:23.500> spirits<00:02:23.920> on

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
can always rub some mineral spirits on

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.860 
can always rub some mineral spirits on
it<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.880> will<00:02:24.970> help<00:02:25.150> get<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.510> template

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
it and that will help get the template

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.650 
it and that will help get the template
off<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:27.160> scroll<00:02:27.430> saw<00:02:27.490> cut<00:02:28.000> pretty<00:02:28.240> smoothly

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
off the scroll saw cut pretty smoothly

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.470 
off the scroll saw cut pretty smoothly
so<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.110> didn't<00:02:29.440> have<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.680> stand<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.040> much<00:02:30.480> just

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
so I didn't have to stand that much just

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.690 
so I didn't have to stand that much just
a<00:02:31.660> little<00:02:31.900> hand<00:02:32.170> sanding<00:02:32.680> on<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.220> edges<00:02:33.550> to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
a little hand sanding on the edges to

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.820 
a little hand sanding on the edges to
get<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.000> little<00:02:34.240> fuzzies<00:02:34.600> off<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.440> make<00:02:35.590> sure

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
get the little fuzzies off to make sure

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.830 
get the little fuzzies off to make sure
each<00:02:36.070> piece<00:02:36.400> was<00:02:36.700> glued<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.450> correct

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
each piece was glued in the correct

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.830 
each piece was glued in the correct
location<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.830> take<00:02:39.400> my<00:02:39.610> template<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.690> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
location I take my template on to the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.080 
location I take my template on to the
backer<00:02:41.020> board<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.620> trace<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.580> letters<00:02:42.880> for

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
backer board and trace the letters for

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.720 
backer board and trace the letters for
the<00:02:43.150> pencil<00:02:43.600> this<00:02:44.380> made<00:02:44.680> some<00:02:45.010> faint<00:02:45.340> lines

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the pencil this made some faint lines

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.600 
the pencil this made some faint lines
appear<00:02:46.570> in<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.020> flat<00:02:47.290> black<00:02:47.650> painted<00:02:48.250> surface

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
appear in the flat black painted surface

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.520 
appear in the flat black painted surface
and<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:49.480> helped<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.810> lot<00:02:49.840> with<00:02:50.020> getting

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
and it helped a lot with getting

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.300 
and it helped a lot with getting
everything<00:02:50.740> glued<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.490> right<00:02:51.700> place<00:02:53.310> now

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
everything glued in the right place now

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.970 
everything glued in the right place now
for<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.730> fun<00:02:54.880> part<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.480> use<00:02:56.140> wood<00:02:56.410> glue<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.830> glue

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
for the fun part I use wood glue to glue

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.980 
for the fun part I use wood glue to glue
each<00:02:57.310> piece<00:02:57.640> onto<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.180> backer<00:02:58.360> board<00:02:58.510> I

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
each piece onto the backer board I

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.410 
each piece onto the backer board I
wasn't<00:02:59.680> sure<00:02:59.830> if<00:03:00.070> wood<00:03:00.340> glue<00:03:00.610> would<00:03:00.820> bond<00:03:01.120> well

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
wasn't sure if wood glue would bond well

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.170 
wasn't sure if wood glue would bond well
to<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.780> paint<00:03:02.050> but<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.830> did<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.250> test<00:03:03.640> piece<00:03:03.910> and

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
to the paint but I did a test piece and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.050 
to the paint but I did a test piece and
it<00:03:04.270> holds<00:03:04.510> really<00:03:04.600> well<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:05.320> think<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
it holds really well I think this is the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.850 
it holds really well I think this is the
first<00:03:07.270> time<00:03:07.510> I've<00:03:07.750> ever<00:03:07.780> seen<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.290> top<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.680> my

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
first time I've ever seen the top of my

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.530 
first time I've ever seen the top of my
head<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:10.800> attach<00:03:11.800> to<00:03:12.160> small<00:03:12.520> eye<00:03:12.760> screws<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.420> the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
head I attach to small eye screws to the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.080 
head I attach to small eye screws to the
side<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.230> then<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:14.920> just<00:03:15.250> hung<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.550> up<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:15.850> my

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.780 
side and then I just hung it up on my
peg<00:03:16.420> for<00:03:16.690> using<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.980> couple<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.580> pegboard
