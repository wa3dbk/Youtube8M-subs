00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
till it comes together okay and then you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.389 
till it comes together okay and then you
will<00:01:41.340> make<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> bit<00:01:42.420> out<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.710> that

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
will make a bit out of it out was that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.030 
will make a bit out of it out was that
so<00:01:44.610> how<00:01:44.759> long<00:01:44.970> does<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:45.630> about<00:01:46.470> 20

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
so how long does it take about 20

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.060 
so how long does it take about 20
minutes<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.549> whole<00:01:47.750> procedure<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.500> since<00:01:49.860> we

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
