00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.560 
by itself so you don't have to use like
an<00:01:36.810> eyelash<00:01:37.110> curler<00:01:37.409> anymore<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.909> don't

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
an eyelash curler anymore and I don't

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810 
an eyelash curler anymore and I don't
know<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.170> naturally<00:01:40.710> curled<00:01:41.159> lashes<00:01:41.460> like

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
know I have naturally curled lashes like

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.550 
know I have naturally curled lashes like
I<00:01:41.970> don't<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.390> limp<00:01:42.869> lashes<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
I don't really have limp lashes so I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.649 
I don't really have limp lashes so I
don't<00:01:43.799> really<00:01:43.860> think<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:45.329> give<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
don't really think that I can give you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.130 
don't really think that I can give you
like<00:01:45.810> an<00:01:45.930> unbiased<00:01:46.409> opinion<00:01:46.770> um<00:01:47.780> but<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> think

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
like an unbiased opinion um but I think

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.319 
like an unbiased opinion um but I think
it<00:01:49.229> does<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> pretty<00:01:49.590> good<00:01:49.740> job<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.220> guess<00:01:50.399> um<00:01:50.880> my

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
it does a pretty good job I guess um my

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.030 
it does a pretty good job I guess um my
eyelashes<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:51.960> always<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.649> standing

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
eyelashes are always just like standing

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.950 
eyelashes are always just like standing
up<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.270> curled<00:01:54.540> them<00:01:54.750> or

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
up like that just like I curled them or

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.170 
up like that just like I curled them or
something<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.310> only<00:01:56.790> thing<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.149> I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
something and the only thing that I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.459 
something and the only thing that I
don't<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.450> about<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.840> though<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
don't like about this though is that the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.560 
don't like about this though is that the
formula<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:58.890> really<00:01:59.430> wet<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.210> takes<00:02:00.390> a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
formula is really wet and so it takes a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.929 
formula is really wet and so it takes a
while<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.020> dry<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:02.189> gives<00:02:02.490> me<00:02:02.610> more<00:02:02.880> time

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
while to dry and that gives me more time

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.800 
while to dry and that gives me more time
to<00:02:03.149> smudge<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.990> all<00:02:04.259> along<00:02:04.860> my<00:02:05.430> eye<00:02:05.759> if<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.570> open

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
to smudge it all along my eye if I open

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.690 
to smudge it all along my eye if I open
my<00:02:06.899> eyes<00:02:06.930> too<00:02:07.380> wide<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> only

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
my eyes too wide so that's the only

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.339 
my eyes too wide so that's the only
thing<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.000> don't<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.239> about<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
thing that I don't like about this the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.280 
thing that I don't like about this the
formula<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:11.039> too

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
formula is a little too

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.720 
formula is a little too
met<00:02:11.379> but<00:02:11.709> other<00:02:11.890> than<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.129> I<00:02:12.250> think<00:02:12.430> it's<00:02:12.670> a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
met but other than that I think it's a

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.780 
met but other than that I think it's a
really<00:02:12.909> good<00:02:13.000> mascara<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.930> i<00:02:14.409> would<00:02:15.370> probably

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
really good mascara and i would probably

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.429 
really good mascara and i would probably
repurchase<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.390> because<00:02:16.569> i<00:02:16.750> like<00:02:17.079> it<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.290> lot

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
repurchase it because i like it a lot

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.229 
repurchase it because i like it a lot
but<00:02:17.769> i<00:02:17.829> like<00:02:18.129> anything<00:02:18.579> from<00:02:18.760> benefit
