00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello I 'm looks and today is the day of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.530
 review the come phone 21 to get started 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.230
 this analysis I'm going to talk about the price 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.809
 a thing that many people expected more 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.660
 because I 'll start with prices on phone 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.529
 cost 2,500 reais would not be 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.539
 spooky 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.130
 it is clear that prices very conditions 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.050
 with the reality of Brazil because it has 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.180
 too much tax and etc. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.820
 but if we compare with the iphone 6 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.430
 which was launched in 2003 and today real 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.100
 costs three thousand four hundred would not 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.960
 so abnormal in phone 2 will cost two thousand and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.820
 five hundred reais taking into account 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.000
 the resources it has and comparing it to the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.680
 samsung that is at 2,500 reais in the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.190
 last poll I did 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.579
 LePhone comes out ahead 32 per thousand gigas 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.149
 and five hundred reais and the one of 16 gigas 1,300 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.850
 real 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.600
 the two come with four gigabytes of memory 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.010
 ram 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.840
 now talking about the device the first 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.780
 what you have is that it's even 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.600
 very big draws a lot of attention and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.119
 compared to the iphone 6 it is a good screen 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.950
 great to bring the curve helps in the footprint 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 and it gets safer in your hand but 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.840
 When you're going to type a text, it 's with 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.330
 the two hands is not so practical anymore 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.610
 so I who have a bigger hand already 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.979
 I felt a little trouble so it 's 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.439
 I need to change my habits a bit when 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.210
 You pick up the biggest cell phone in the phone. 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.250
 I do not like it at the top and it's a 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.710
 negative the same thing I complained about 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.259
 in the motorola apparatus is a detail 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.930
 which mainly in the apparatus of 5.5 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.180
 and this makes a lot of difference 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.979
 the volume button is behind the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.979
 which may seem a bit strange in the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.409
 beginning but after you use enough 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.840
 You understand why it 's there and it stays 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.090
 well- designed and 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.579
 strong has no doubt that as you 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.680
 device is very resistant to 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.320
 plastic back she emits a bow 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.360
 but she is very sturdy and reliable 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.640
 it comes with two chips that's pretty cool 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.600
 for those who want to save up to two 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.240
 operators 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.399
 now let's talk about the system I used on uai 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.710
 I do not want to go deep into it 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.960
 has many legal resources like access to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.300
 camera making 16 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.190
 the screen two rings it locks and 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.010
 lock screen sometimes does not work 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.260
 another blow to solve this gives you 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.000
 make a video talking only from zero then 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.140
 if you want a special video talking 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.300
 of the system 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.400
 leave in comments but could not 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.800
 stop talking about performance one thing 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.290
 that I do not accept on android yet 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.930
 I managed to understand is the memory management 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.940
 ram is a user manual cozzi management 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.710
 You have to worry about that, but since 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.990
 We have to worry about the four 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.100
 hansen gig handset two make you 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.890
 forget about it 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.960
 you can do multiple tasks 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.580
 without it locking or be very clear that 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.530
 You'll have to do this work. 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.900
 Because you are working with android 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.810
 so it requires you lippi many 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.790
 10 things haiti helps to do this 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.280
 memory management you close the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.060
 application all the time you can 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.270
 to worry 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.970
 I used the phone quite the hearing 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.490
 music on twitter playing changing from 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.680
 window and I'm not in the habit of staying 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.350
 closing after I remembered that I 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.930
 It should close there but it had no problem. 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.910
 none of window swipe slows down 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.400
 game question I tested the module 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.320
 combat 5 and you can see a 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.190
 graph downgrade relative to the 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.320
 iphone 6 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.620
 remembering that apple has a mere 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.540
 which is one up only for games then no 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.130
 You do not even have to compare the camera 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.960
 I found it very interesting but at the beginning 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.150
 I was a little worried about the 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.640
 image quality by sheila well plus 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.140
 very bad it there the event was take out 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.870
 some doubts, especially the staff 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.090
 it was there that when you take photo 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.340
 it does not appear in real time on the screen 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.260
 so you have to take a picture and then 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.480
 you will see the final result 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.970
 there on the album and that's very interesting and 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.600
 to take a picture there in manual mode and 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.210
 You can see here but have the link here. 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.880
 French down comes is the best resolution 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.340
 Little video may not stay the same 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.730
 thing then I found the camera very good 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.040
 even this manual mode helps a lot in the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.870
 time to take a picture and you 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.640
 is that all 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.549
 kind of thing has enough filter that 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.190
 You can use it there in your photos and 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.959
 a photo taking system in the dark 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.850
 well cool it was worth the test 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.680
 What bothered me a bit was a 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.780
 slowness on the screen when you go to take 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.570
 photo in a move 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.340
 You see that gives 1 leg gives a lock 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.979
 I'm full of memory management 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.919
 horrible this will probably be 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.710
 software but it's one thing 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.020
 you already see difference in iphone 6 he 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.479
 even with a jig of ram 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.270
 he can make you movie is 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.360
 and having the result there on the screen in time 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.970
 of a movie at 60 frames per second. 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.289
 second is a much better management 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.840
 I think they'll think a little 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.120
 In this the asus upgrade system is 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.970
 very frequent this is good because it avoids 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.600
 those packages of 1 gig each 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.010
 months 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.410
 the front camera has a good feature 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.990
 interesting is the timer for 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.729
 You take it self, I find it very 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.340
 has a son named embelleze that I 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.039
 I did not like it so much the front camera is not 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.800
 Great but it 's ok for about 20 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.770
 days I tested the iphone 2 on my day a 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.510
 day I 'll be there fans and loks crisis 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.160
 so if you want advice on this 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.260
 leave in the comments that I make one 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.450
 video just talking about that iphone 2 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.910
 powerful handset with an excellent price 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.889
 the resources and stability that you 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.530
 delivery I liked it so much that the points 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.419
 negative are details and nothing influences 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.400
 your experience with the device I am 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.710
 user from the west for a long time I have 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.539
 my habits have my perceptions of 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.910
 system but does not miss anything 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.370
 I rarely got annoyed with the 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.020
 or with some slowness if I 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.690
 to buy a top of the line android 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.260
 would be the iphone 2 or the laws where two 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.740
 bids that comes with 128gb edit two thousand 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.870
 real 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.849
 a beautiful device that should be listed 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.410
 as the top of the market does not 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.180
 forget me on social networks and 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.400
 download the application to receive all 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.949
 notifications sign up for the channel if 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.220
 you're not written I'm lux and that's 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.220
 my world
