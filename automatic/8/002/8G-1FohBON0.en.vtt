because<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.660> think<00:02:38.870> he<00:02:38.960> does<00:02:39.110> an<00:02:39.260> outstanding

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
because I think he does an outstanding

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.410 
because I think he does an outstanding
job<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.250> he's<00:02:40.370> nowhere<00:02:40.550> near<00:02:40.730> as<00:02:40.940> resourced

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
job and he's nowhere near as resourced

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.570 
job and he's nowhere near as resourced
as<00:02:41.540> others<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.620> think<00:02:42.860> compiling<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
as others and and I think compiling the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.340 
as others and and I think compiling the
North<00:02:43.760> Melbourne<00:02:43.970> list<00:02:44.300> when<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:44.990> was<00:02:45.080> emptied

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
North Melbourne list when it was emptied

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.930 
North Melbourne list when it was emptied
out<00:02:45.470> five<00:02:45.710> years<00:02:45.740> ago<00:02:46.130> he<00:02:46.610> has<00:02:46.730> been

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
out five years ago he has been

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.120 
out five years ago he has been
exceptional<00:02:47.480> price<00:02:47.960> if<00:02:48.470> Bryce<00:02:48.770> has<00:02:48.950> got<00:02:49.100> a

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
exceptional price if Bryce has got a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.860 
exceptional price if Bryce has got a
problem<00:02:49.340> with<00:02:49.460> if<00:02:49.580> he<00:02:49.640> used<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.150> reread<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.690> I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
problem with if he used to reread it I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:05.640 
problem with if he used to reread it I
think<00:02:51.680> he<00:02:51.770> knows<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:54.560> Rose<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.490> context

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.020 

it<00:03:06.650> takes<00:03:06.920> more<00:03:07.160> than<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.490> minor<00:03:07.700> disagreement

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
it takes more than a minor disagreement

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.820 
it takes more than a minor disagreement
to<00:03:08.540> break<00:03:08.750> up<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.550> mistake<00:03:14.290> coming<00:03:15.290> here<00:03:15.590> and
