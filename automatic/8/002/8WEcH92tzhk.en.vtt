00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.590
 good afternoon my name is Larisa put forward and 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.920
 we are in my manual office 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.010
 plasticity and fitness faces and today I want 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 introduce you to the possibilities 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.780
 physiological because in questions 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.220
 aesthetic face correction and 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.580
 today we will adjust this 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.650
 common problem like 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.359
 nasolabial formation case 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.699
 volume in so much 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.439
 nasolabial folds very often 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.200
 blame local edema 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.480
 given place and therefore use 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.750
 lymph drainage tracks in this zone will be 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.280
 very effective 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.309
 lymphatic drainage rhythmic drainage you 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.739
 is a strip cut off from 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 common frame kinesio logical type 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 which corresponds to the length of the distance 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.820
 from why again lymph node to 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.890
 problem zone in this case is in the zone 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.380
 Santa's nosogubki 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.600
 is a base from which we 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.539
 disconnect 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.799
 the paper on which it is glued and separately 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:18.799
 cut vase ribbons we 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.909
 set on the submandibular 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:27.659
 lymph node and ribbons we 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:32.009
 alternately holds the problem area with 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.939
 very slight tension 5-10 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.230
 percent and maybe even completely without 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.560
 stretch 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:46.320
 me so we lead the ribbons and even 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.780
 we manage to capture here under 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:55.080
 the main zone is another tag we will put on 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.180
 parotid lymph node the thing is 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.230
 that the removal of lymph from the nasolabial zone 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.780
 folds 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.670
 iq is often also underway well 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.310
 lymphatic at the node we set 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.760
 also base on about ear node and 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.180
 cross because gold 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.390
 nasolabial folds of ribbon of the same type 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.570
 between each other should not intersect 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.230
 time as cells coming from different 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.060
 types can cross crosswise 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:36.090
 it even increases their effectiveness and 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.440
 to complete this statement, we can still 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.500
 one type 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.420
 the base of which is set to subclavian 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.300
 lymph node the thing is that the whole 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.760
 lymph from our face is transported 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.510
 it is in the supraclavicular lymph node 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.350
 and from him we will be lucky ribbons in 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.870
 submandibular lymph node and 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:06.870
 to the parotid lymph nodes 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:13.650
 thus stimulates the movement of lymph 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:17.000
 from the problem areas of our face when 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.770
 better to put this and for how long 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.200
 certainly better if you have the opportunity 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.510
 put the pace in the daytime a little 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.239
 physical activity and lymphatic 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.099
 your system is also active but if you 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.099
 no such opportunity you can 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.650
 would you put on the night and then when you 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.800
 wake up in the morning and take off you 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.200
 find that the nasa sponge zone is yours 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.890
 it has become much less besides 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.530
 a pleasant extra surprise will be 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.799
 improvement of the oval line because those 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.879
 lymphatic stasis which we also observe 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.200
 submandibular zone associated with 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.670
 not good work 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.480
 submandibular lymph nodes 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:05.590
 will also be unloaded and the oval zone will be 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.440
 look more aesthetic and single 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.239
 small detail when you shoot 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.209
 lymphatic typs 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.069
 ribbons must be removed by 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:20.700
 towards a non party knot 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:22.889
 just as the lymph moves from the center 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.400
 to the periphery 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.400
 lymph nodes
