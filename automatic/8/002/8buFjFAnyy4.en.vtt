all<00:05:44.700> kinds<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.150> different<00:05:45.300> features<00:05:45.720> about

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
all kinds of different features about

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.420 
all kinds of different features about
your<00:05:46.170> device<00:05:46.410> so<00:05:46.710> for<00:05:46.890> example<00:05:47.160> I<00:05:47.190> can<00:05:47.310> see

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
your device so for example I can see

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.670 
your device so for example I can see
memory<00:05:47.730> usage<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.660> go<00:05:49.050> ahead<00:05:49.170> and<00:05:49.290> see<00:05:49.410> how<00:05:49.530> my

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
memory usage and go ahead and see how my

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.520 
memory usage and go ahead and see how my
SSD<00:05:50.010> is<00:05:50.250> doing<00:05:50.640> what<00:05:51.090> kind<00:05:51.240> of<00:05:51.390> programs<00:05:52.350> are

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
SSD is doing what kind of programs are

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.780 
SSD is doing what kind of programs are
needing<00:05:52.800> to<00:05:52.830> take<00:05:53.040> up<00:05:53.190> you<00:05:53.280> know<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.490> read<00:05:53.640> and

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
needing to take up you know the read and

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.570 
needing to take up you know the read and
write<00:05:53.940> speeds<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:54.990> see<00:05:55.260> CPU<00:05:55.740> usage<00:05:56.250> I<00:05:56.400> mean<00:05:56.520> I

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
write speeds and see CPU usage I mean I

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.920 
write speeds and see CPU usage I mean I
can<00:05:56.670> see<00:05:56.760> all<00:05:56.910> kinds<00:05:57.240> of<00:05:57.300> these<00:05:57.450> really<00:05:57.750> nice

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
can see all kinds of these really nice

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.660 
can see all kinds of these really nice
little<00:05:58.170> things<00:05:58.470> I<00:05:58.650> can<00:05:58.950> take<00:05:59.130> a<00:05:59.160> look<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.460> see

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
little things I can take a look and see

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.820 
little things I can take a look and see
you<00:05:59.910> know<00:06:00.240> for<00:06:00.420> example<00:06:00.480> my<00:06:00.930> CPU<00:06:01.320> temperatures

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
you know for example my CPU temperatures

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.250 
you know for example my CPU temperatures
over<00:06:02.310> time<00:06:02.610> but<00:06:03.540> you<00:06:03.630> know<00:06:03.720> getting<00:06:03.990> really

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
over time but you know getting really

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.840 
over time but you know getting really
kind<00:06:04.440> of<00:06:04.470> drill<00:06:04.770> down<00:06:04.980> into<00:06:05.250> the<00:06:05.430> memory<00:06:05.670> and

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
kind of drill down into the memory and

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.310 
kind of drill down into the memory and
the<00:06:06.270> graphics<00:06:06.690> and<00:06:06.780> all<00:06:06.870> kinds<00:06:07.200> of<00:06:07.260> really

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
the graphics and all kinds of really

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.380 
the graphics and all kinds of really
cool<00:06:07.620> stuff<00:06:07.830> so<00:06:08.220> I<00:06:08.460> status<00:06:09.000> actually<00:06:09.240> one<00:06:09.360> of

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
cool stuff so I status actually one of

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.480 
cool stuff so I status actually one of
my<00:06:09.480> favorite<00:06:09.960> parts<00:06:10.200> of<00:06:10.320> using<00:06:10.560> OS<00:06:10.800> 10<00:06:11.070> weirdly

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
my favorite parts of using OS 10 weirdly

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.550 
my favorite parts of using OS 10 weirdly
enough<00:06:11.760> for<00:06:12.330> my<00:06:12.450> gaming<00:06:12.630> PC<00:06:12.780> had<00:06:13.290> actually

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
enough for my gaming PC had actually

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.750 
enough for my gaming PC had actually
already<00:06:13.740> done<00:06:13.950> a<00:06:14.010> video<00:06:14.310> going<00:06:14.580> over

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
already done a video going over

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.310 
already done a video going over
everything<00:06:15.120> so<00:06:15.570> you<00:06:15.630> guys<00:06:15.750> can<00:06:15.960> check<00:06:15.990> that

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
everything so you guys can check that

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.690 
everything so you guys can check that
out<00:06:16.440> if<00:06:16.590> you<00:06:16.680> want<00:06:16.710> to<00:06:16.860> see<00:06:16.950> things<00:06:17.160> like<00:06:17.280> specs

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
out if you want to see things like specs

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.490 
out if you want to see things like specs
but<00:06:18.240> for<00:06:18.390> now<00:06:18.510> I<00:06:18.540> pretty<00:06:18.810> much<00:06:18.930> use<00:06:19.200> it<00:06:19.230> as<00:06:19.470> a

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
but for now I pretty much use it as a

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.740 
but for now I pretty much use it as a
steam<00:06:19.800> box<00:06:19.980> so<00:06:20.730> I<00:06:20.760> have<00:06:20.880> a<00:06:20.940> fair<00:06:21.180> few<00:06:21.330> games<00:06:21.600> in

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
steam box so I have a fair few games in

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.750 
steam box so I have a fair few games in
my<00:06:21.840> Steam<00:06:22.110> library<00:06:22.140> so<00:06:23.010> now<00:06:23.160> all<00:06:23.370> of<00:06:23.400> them<00:06:23.640> are

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
my Steam library so now all of them are

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.910 
my Steam library so now all of them are
installed<00:06:24.150> but<00:06:24.480> I've<00:06:24.900> collected<00:06:25.200> quite<00:06:25.560> a<00:06:25.680> few

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
installed but I've collected quite a few

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.440 
installed but I've collected quite a few
games<00:06:26.070> over<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:26.490> last<00:06:26.520> four<00:06:26.880> or<00:06:26.910> five<00:06:27.090> years

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
games so I actually missed the last of

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.290 
games so I actually missed the last of
us<00:06:31.260> when<00:06:31.410> it<00:06:31.470> came<00:06:31.620> out<00:06:31.800> for<00:06:31.919> ps3<00:06:32.190> so<00:06:33.090> with<00:06:33.180> the

remastered version for ps4 I've actually
been<00:06:35.280> really<00:06:35.580> enjoying<00:06:36.120> not<00:06:36.270> only<00:06:36.450> the<00:06:36.540> single

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
been really enjoying not only the single

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.480 
been really enjoying not only the single
player<00:06:37.080> but<00:06:37.470> the<00:06:37.590> multiplayer<00:06:38.009> is<00:06:38.160> actually

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
player but the multiplayer is actually

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.820 
player but the multiplayer is actually
pretty<00:06:38.669> fun<00:06:38.910> as<00:06:39.030> well<00:06:39.240> the<00:06:40.110> game<00:06:40.410> is<00:06:40.590> Just

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
pretty fun as well the game is Just

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.260 
pretty fun as well the game is Just
Cause<00:06:40.979> 2<00:06:41.340> so<00:06:41.729> this<00:06:41.820> is<00:06:41.970> one<00:06:42.120> of<00:06:42.150> the

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
Cause 2 so this is one of the

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.570 
Cause 2 so this is one of the
PlayStation<00:06:42.810> now<00:06:42.930> streaming<00:06:43.350> titles<00:06:43.830> mostly

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
PlayStation now streaming titles mostly

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.980 
PlayStation now streaming titles mostly
been<00:06:44.699> playing<00:06:44.910> this<00:06:45.060> just<00:06:45.330> kind<00:06:45.539> of<00:06:45.570> test<00:06:45.810> out

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
been playing this just kind of test out

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.960 
been playing this just kind of test out
how<00:06:46.169> PlayStation<00:06:46.770> now<00:06:46.889> is<00:06:47.100> and<00:06:47.490> I<00:06:47.639> might

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
how PlayStation now is and I might

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.430 
how PlayStation now is and I might
actually<00:06:48.090> end<00:06:48.270> up<00:06:48.509> making<00:06:48.570> a<00:06:48.870> video<00:06:49.139> on<00:06:49.289> it

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
actually end up making a video on it

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.070 
actually end up making a video on it
resogun<00:06:50.400> is<00:06:50.759> a<00:06:50.789> really<00:06:51.330> fun<00:06:51.570> spaceship

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
resogun is a really fun spaceship

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.749 
resogun is a really fun spaceship
shooter<00:06:52.440> not<00:06:53.009> gonna<00:06:53.160> lie<00:06:53.310> this<00:06:53.340> is<00:06:53.520> actually

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 
shooter not gonna lie this is actually

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.249 
shooter not gonna lie this is actually
probably<00:06:53.910> the<00:06:54.120> most<00:06:54.270> played<00:06:54.570> game<00:06:54.780> on<00:06:54.930> the<00:06:55.020> ps4

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 
probably the most played game on the ps4

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:56.810 
probably the most played game on the ps4
I've<00:06:55.530> had<00:06:55.710> just<00:06:56.039> because<00:06:56.310> it's<00:06:56.460> just<00:06:56.729> really

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
I've had just because it's just really

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.719 
I've had just because it's just really
really<00:06:57.330> fun<00:06:57.750> and<00:06:58.050> also<00:06:58.680> watchdogs<00:06:59.190> so<00:06:59.639> I've

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
really fun and also watchdogs so I've

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.129 
really fun and also watchdogs so I've
actually<00:06:59.850> played<00:07:00.060> more<00:07:00.300> watchdogs<00:07:00.810> on<00:07:01.020> the

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 
actually played more watchdogs on the

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.620 
actually played more watchdogs on the
ps4<00:07:01.410> than<00:07:01.770> anything<00:07:02.009> else<00:07:02.250> mostly<00:07:03.150> because<00:07:03.300> it

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
ps4 than anything else mostly because it

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.560 
ps4 than anything else mostly because it
had<00:07:03.780> a<00:07:03.810> definitely<00:07:04.770> trouble<00:07:05.280> punch<00:07:05.729> on<00:07:06.000> the<00:07:06.060> PC

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
had a definitely trouble punch on the PC

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.480 
had a definitely trouble punch on the PC
so<00:07:06.870> ps4<00:07:07.410> versions<00:07:07.800> seem<00:07:07.949> to<00:07:08.039> be<00:07:08.160> a<00:07:08.190> little<00:07:08.400> bit

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
so ps4 versions seem to be a little bit

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.219 
so ps4 versions seem to be a little bit
better<00:07:08.639> sorted<00:07:09.060> at<00:07:09.150> the<00:07:09.210> beginning<00:07:09.600> anyway<00:07:09.690> I

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
better sorted at the beginning anyway I

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.110
