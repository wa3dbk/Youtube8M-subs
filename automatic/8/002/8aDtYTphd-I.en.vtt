00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.650
 hello is coming beautiful 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.260
 wedding season and many of you have already started 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.360
 look after dress decoration options 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.550
 hairstyles and of course they think what 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.220
 manicure is better for this 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.320
 solemn event I myself was 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.230
 a bride and I remember very well how 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.509
 stared at all even 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.460
 apparent trifles so today we 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.199
 offer you an option 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.960
 nail design which can 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.070
 even beginners can handle it and 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.920
 lovers 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.050
 to create a wedding design today 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.510
 we will need the base and top 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.160
 cover stamp stamp e us also shops 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.850
 beige 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.820
 white for the stamp 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.879
 fixing the result to where without rhinestones 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.879
 and necessarily white color the first step is 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.370
 basic coating 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:05.440
 which protects your nails from 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.440
 penetration of coloring pigments 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.440
 to overlap the color of the nail plate i 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.960
 I will use the color number 933 of 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.710
 color club collections 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:25.000
 cover all the legs with the base color 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.000
 which I showed you 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.750
 we decided to draw french chic today 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.630
 on the little fingers forefinger and big and on 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.840
 3 middle fingers we will do the design 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.180
 with the help of stamps and not a french we 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.780
 we will draw today normal 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.759
 such water based paints now 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.670
 I will show you how this can be done easily. 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.800
 a little bit 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.180
 paint put on the foil 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:01.759
 can take a file moisten thin 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:05.540
 brush in water and then blot 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.670
 in paint paint fast enough 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.190
 dries up 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.470
 so you need to work a little bit 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.910
 faster than for example than with 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.980
 gel polish well here is what gel polishes convenient 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.130
 until the proceeds to the lamp help you 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.180
 gel polish does not polymerize 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:29.570
 but here we have colors right away 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.510
 dense color in gel polishes we are talking about 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.290
 sometimes even up to three 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.620
 coverings 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.360
 up to three layers by coating to get 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.269
 dense color as soon as 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.820
 thick layer can not be applied to smile 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.600
 nights not over polymerized can it frowns 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.870
 and then she can quickly enough 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.700
 pads like this we drew 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.760
 french chic here is very short 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.769
 loose edges so i'm easy to thin 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.910
 a brush with one layer but with him 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.980
 On the right you can in the same way 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.070
 put a french on and on long on to 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.760
 point just draw smile first 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.130
 paints 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.590
 they are a little more comfortable in the sense that 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.220
 you can with a donut dipped in water 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:20.290
 remove it does not damage the base coat 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.290
 without overlapping it several times 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.170
 to make a drawing with stamps and 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.090
 you need us from the back side 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.960
 here such as rubber soft 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.330
 apply a base on the selected pattern 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.960
 selected color but in our case it is 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.270
 there will be a classic white color on not 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.390
 flew flip stamp and 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:47.500
 neatly imprinted a leaf 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.260
 excess varnish itself if necessary 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.800
 can with the help of pushers either 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.760
 orange sticks remove all excess 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:02.890
 colored varnish around the picture further 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.790
 wait literally ten seconds on 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:11.080
 selected site on co. 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:14.530
 best place flowers 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.390
 the middle of the nail but rather from the direction 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.850
 corners on co. 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:24.810
 to the inside corner like this 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.740
 attach 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.390
 selected drawing in one motion not 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.640
 rolling it literally pressed 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:38.470
 held for a few seconds and let go 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.350
 such a gentle picture remains with 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.000
 us nanako. 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.860
 on the next on to the point you can 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.630
 to portray 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.669
 composition for example of two identical 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.550

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.030
 seconds and the second drawing i will

 parallel to the free edge 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.169
 i.e. smile lines 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:02.229
