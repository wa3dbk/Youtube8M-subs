00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:30.839 
which is just insane I mean um I said
this<00:00:28.779> some<00:00:29.470> similar<00:00:29.890> things<00:00:30.159> a<00:00:30.400> while<00:00:30.609> back

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
this some similar things a while back

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.119 
this some similar things a while back
but<00:00:31.119> in<00:00:31.689> my<00:00:31.779> most<00:00:32.020> recent<00:00:32.200> update<00:00:32.649> video<00:00:32.920> I

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
but in my most recent update video I

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.619 
but in my most recent update video I
said<00:00:33.489> a<00:00:33.520> lot<00:00:33.699> of<00:00:33.879> things<00:00:33.969> that<00:00:34.210> are<00:00:34.300> actually

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
said a lot of things that are actually

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.840 
said a lot of things that are actually
coming<00:00:34.809> which<00:00:35.379> is<00:00:35.559> pretty<00:00:35.980> crazy<00:00:36.309> because<00:00:36.609> it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
coming which is pretty crazy because it

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.790 
coming which is pretty crazy because it
means<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.149> they<00:00:37.629> either<00:00:37.750> watch<00:00:38.020> my<00:00:38.260> video<00:00:38.530> or

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
means that they either watch my video or

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.069 
means that they either watch my video or
they<00:00:39.550> just<00:00:39.579> saw<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:39.969> lot<00:00:40.300> of<00:00:40.329> the<00:00:40.510> same<00:00:40.660> ideas

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
they just saw a lot of the same ideas

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.840 
they just saw a lot of the same ideas
out<00:00:41.260> there<00:00:41.289> either<00:00:41.710> one<00:00:42.010> is<00:00:42.280> great<00:00:42.609> because

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
out there either one is great because

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.700 
out there either one is great because
either<00:00:43.239> way<00:00:43.359> we're<00:00:43.629> getting<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:44.050> update<00:00:44.530> I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
either way we're getting the update I

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.040 
either way we're getting the update I
think<00:00:44.920> that<00:00:45.000> stuff<00:00:46.000> like<00:00:46.179> Leslie<00:00:46.629> directed<00:00:46.960> at

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
think that stuff like Leslie directed at

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.630 
think that stuff like Leslie directed at
anyone<00:00:47.079> a<00:00:47.500> new<00:00:47.620> joint<00:00:47.800> level<00:00:48.129> drug<00:00:48.250> literature

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
anyone a new joint level drug literature

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.130 
anyone a new joint level drug literature
level<00:00:48.879> that<00:00:48.969> it<00:00:49.090> goes<00:00:49.210> should<00:00:49.329> be<00:00:49.390> an<00:00:49.600> had

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
level that it goes should be an had

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.630 
level that it goes should be an had
additional<00:00:50.320> level<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:50.829> also<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.309> minds<00:00:51.519> of

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
additional level and also the minds of

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.520 
additional level and also the minds of
course<00:00:51.850> nvm<00:00:52.420> also<00:00:52.870> collected<00:00:53.199> I<00:00:53.260> think<00:00:53.440> he's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
course nvm also collected I think he's

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.900 
course nvm also collected I think he's
really<00:00:53.800> really<00:00:53.920> need<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.219> level<00:00:54.339> if<00:00:54.640> I<00:00:54.699> could<00:00:54.820> go

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
really really need a level if I could go

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.239

end throw in some more ideas that I

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.510 
end throw in some more ideas that I
think<00:01:13.570> they<00:01:13.659> should<00:01:13.840> add<00:01:13.960> in<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.470> next<00:01:14.920> one<00:01:15.100> so

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
think they should add in the next one so

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.069 
think they should add in the next one so
a<00:01:15.549> lot<00:01:15.939> of<00:01:15.970> people<00:01:16.060> thought<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.630> another

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
a lot of people thought and another

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.450 
a lot of people thought and another
update<00:01:17.409> wasn't<00:01:17.680> going<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:17.860> come<00:01:18.040> for<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:18.250> while

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
update wasn't going to come for a while

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.190 
update wasn't going to come for a while
and<00:01:18.790> I<00:01:19.090> thought<00:01:19.119> that<00:01:19.329> was<00:01:19.509> silly<00:01:19.750> because<00:01:19.960> I

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
and I thought that was silly because I

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.020 
and I thought that was silly because I
knew<00:01:20.380> there's<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.649> winter<00:01:20.979> update<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.850> knew

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
knew there's a winter update and I knew

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.429 
knew there's a winter update and I knew
that<00:01:22.060> they<00:01:22.299> couldn't<00:01:22.479> be<00:01:22.630> working<00:01:22.960> on<00:01:23.049> nothing

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
that they couldn't be working on nothing

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.660 
that they couldn't be working on nothing
like<00:01:23.590> I<00:01:23.710> knew<00:01:23.860> there<00:01:24.009> wasn't<00:01:24.220> just<00:01:24.369> going<00:01:24.579> to

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
like I knew there wasn't just going to

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.399 
like I knew there wasn't just going to
be<00:01:24.759> a<00:01:24.790> few<00:01:25.060> pumpkins<00:01:25.390> or<00:01:25.659> whatever<00:01:25.899> added<00:01:26.259> I

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
be a few pumpkins or whatever added I

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.560 
be a few pumpkins or whatever added I
knew<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.189> they<00:01:27.280> needed<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.790> add<00:01:28.000> some<00:01:28.390> more

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
knew that they needed to add some more

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.880 
knew that they needed to add some more
things<00:01:28.869> because<00:01:29.229> they<00:01:29.350> need<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.619> keep<00:01:29.770> the

collectors which will be available at
town<00:02:05.740> hall<00:02:05.770> 8<00:02:06.159> so<00:02:06.789> this<00:02:07.149> was<00:02:07.299> something<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.719> said

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
town hall 8 so this was something I said

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.080 
town hall 8 so this was something I said
a<00:02:07.990> while<00:02:08.229> ago<00:02:08.280> adding<00:02:09.280> more<00:02:09.429> loot<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.879> game

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
a while ago adding more loot to the game

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.180 
a while ago adding more loot to the game
and<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:11.140> said<00:02:11.349> that<00:02:11.500> they<00:02:11.590> needed<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:12.010> new

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
and I said that they needed a new

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.300 
and I said that they needed a new
collector<00:02:12.640> level

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
collector level

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.430 
collector level
so<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:14.150> reason<00:02:14.300> why<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.599> felt<00:02:15.080> like<00:02:15.230> they

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
so the reason why I felt like they

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.339 
so the reason why I felt like they
needed<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:15.860> was<00:02:16.160> because<00:02:16.810> first<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.959> all<00:02:18.080> you

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
needed this was because first of all you

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.170 
needed this was because first of all you
can<00:02:18.500> max<00:02:18.709> out<00:02:18.860> your<00:02:18.920> collectors<00:02:19.489> I<00:02:19.790> can't

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
can max out your collectors I can't

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.750 
can max out your collectors I can't
remember<00:02:20.360> how<00:02:20.690> early<00:02:20.930> but<00:02:21.290> very<00:02:21.560> early<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.730> you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
remember how early but very early so you

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.910 
remember how early but very early so you
almost<00:02:23.000> never<00:02:23.330> touch<00:02:23.630> them<00:02:23.840> again<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.680> felt

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
almost never touch them again and I felt

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.320 
almost never touch them again and I felt
like<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.190> was<00:02:25.340> kind<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.610> lame<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.030> felt<00:02:26.239> when

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
like that was kind of lame I felt when

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.059 
like that was kind of lame I felt when
you<00:02:26.450> get<00:02:26.599> up<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.900> higher<00:02:27.080> levels<00:02:27.440> I'm<00:02:27.590> you

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
you get up to the higher levels I'm you

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.589 
you get up to the higher levels I'm you
should<00:02:28.099> be<00:02:28.280> able<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.730> get<00:02:28.910> more<00:02:29.060> loot<00:02:29.300> than<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
should be able to get more loot than the

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.210 
should be able to get more loot than the
lower<00:02:29.750> levels<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:30.470> makes<00:02:30.650> sense<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.099> me

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
lower levels that just makes sense to me

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.809 
lower levels that just makes sense to me
so<00:02:31.640> for<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.450> certain<00:02:33.019> town<00:02:33.410> hall<00:02:33.680> lower<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.610> get

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
so for a certain town hall lower to get

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.190 
so for a certain town hall lower to get
to<00:02:35.180> be<00:02:35.300> able<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.510> get<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> same<00:02:35.840> amount<00:02:35.900> of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
to be able to get the same amount of

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.809 
to be able to get the same amount of
loot<00:02:36.319> from<00:02:36.440> collectors<00:02:36.860> as<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.280> are<00:02:37.459> as<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
loot from collectors as you are as the

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.630 
loot from collectors as you are as the
Town<00:02:38.000> Hall<00:02:38.030> 10<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:39.650> can<00:02:39.830> see<00:02:40.010> why<00:02:40.220> that's<00:02:40.400> not

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
Town Hall 10 you can see why that's not

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.100 
Town Hall 10 you can see why that's not
really<00:02:40.910> fair<00:02:41.120> because<00:02:41.180> everything<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.080> so

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
really fair because everything is so

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.290 
really fair because everything is so
much<00:02:42.470> more<00:02:42.500> expensive<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.310> i<00:02:43.700> know<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:43.880> it's

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
much more expensive and i know that it's

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.699 
much more expensive and i know that it's
more<00:02:44.450> expensive<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.110> should<00:02:45.230> be<00:02:45.260> harder

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
more expensive so it should be harder

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.160 
more expensive so it should be harder
but<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:46.700> exponentially<00:02:47.540> harder<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.140> not

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
but it's exponentially harder and not

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.190 
but it's exponentially harder and not
not<00:02:49.040> sort<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.400> comparative<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:50.569> yeah<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:51.049> is

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
not sort of comparative so yeah that is

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.420 
not sort of comparative so yeah that is
awesome<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.739> means<00:02:51.920> there's<00:02:52.160> going<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.340> be<00:02:52.370> a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
awesome that means there's going to be a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.160 
awesome that means there's going to be a
ton<00:02:52.670> more<00:02:52.880> loot<00:02:53.150> available<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.780> mean<00:02:53.930> if<00:02:54.049> you're

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
ton more loot available I mean if you're

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.809 
ton more loot available I mean if you're
finding<00:02:54.350> any<00:02:54.620> basis<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.190> our<00:02:55.280> town<00:02:55.489> hall<00:02:55.670> 8

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
finding any basis that our town hall 8

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.100 
finding any basis that our town hall 8
or<00:02:56.060> above<00:02:56.269> there's<00:02:56.480> going<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.660> be<00:02:56.690> lots<00:02:56.930> more

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
or above there's going to be lots more

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.259 
or above there's going to be lots more
loot<00:02:57.470> available<00:02:58.010> I'm<00:02:58.610> really<00:02:58.880> excited<00:02:59.090> for

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
loot available I'm really excited for

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.430 
loot available I'm really excited for
this<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.660> I'm<00:02:59.720> assuming<00:03:00.049> it's<00:03:00.140> gonna<00:03:00.290> be

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
this and I'm assuming it's gonna be

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.500 
this and I'm assuming it's gonna be
basically<00:03:00.620> double<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:01.700> that's<00:03:01.970> my<00:03:02.180> assumption

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
basically double so that's my assumption

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.270 
basically double so that's my assumption
anyway<00:03:02.930> if<00:03:03.080> it's<00:03:03.230> not<00:03:03.410> double<00:03:03.799> then<00:03:03.950> I'd<00:03:04.069> say

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
anyway if it's not double then I'd say

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.580 
anyway if it's not double then I'd say
it's<00:03:04.459> an<00:03:04.580> extra<00:03:04.910> third<00:03:05.230> which<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.349> going<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.530> be

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
it's an extra third which is going to be

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.460 
it's an extra third which is going to be
great<00:03:06.860> I'm<00:03:07.430> very<00:03:07.489> excited<00:03:07.880> for<00:03:08.299> that

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
great I'm very excited for that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.420 
great I'm very excited for that
basically<00:03:09.470> every<00:03:09.799> time<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.099> collect<00:03:10.220> your

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
basically every time you collect your

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.860 
basically every time you collect your
collectors<00:03:10.849> now<00:03:11.030> they'll<00:03:11.269> be<00:03:11.420> able<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.630> give

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
collectors now they'll be able to give

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.170 
collectors now they'll be able to give
you<00:03:12.049> you<00:03:12.319> know<00:03:12.349> instead<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.099> like<00:03:13.250> 30,000<00:03:14.060> on

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
you you know instead of like 30,000 on

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.360 
you you know instead of like 30,000 on
average<00:03:14.540> maybe<00:03:14.840> 60,000<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.130> would<00:03:16.250> be

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
average maybe 60,000 so that would be

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.819 
average maybe 60,000 so that would be
really<00:03:16.580> exciting<00:03:17.150> just<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:18.019> lot<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.320> extra<00:03:18.620> loot

really exciting just a lot of extra loot

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.009 
really exciting just a lot of extra loot
to<00:03:18.980> be<00:03:19.130> had<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.850> also<00:03:20.090> means<00:03:20.510> guys<00:03:20.810> that

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
to be had but it also means guys that

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.120 
to be had but it also means guys that
when<00:03:21.109> you're<00:03:21.230> attacking<00:03:21.739> there's<00:03:21.920> going<00:03:22.070> to

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
when you're attacking there's going to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.569 
when you're attacking there's going to
be<00:03:22.190> more<00:03:22.430> loot<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.090> no<00:03:23.570> more<00:03:23.840> of<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.440> know

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
be more loot so no more of this you know

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.890 
be more loot so no more of this you know
small<00:03:25.579> stuff<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.209> you're<00:03:26.329> finding<00:03:26.600> all<00:03:26.750> the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
small stuff that you're finding all the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.330 
small stuff that you're finding all the
time<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.290> hitting<00:03:27.530> next<00:03:27.680> all<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.010> time<00:03:28.190> I

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
time and hitting next all the time I

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.520 
time and hitting next all the time I
feel<00:03:28.790> like<00:03:29.090> even<00:03:29.569> accounts<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.290> haven't

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
feel like even accounts that haven't

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.110 
feel like even accounts that haven't
been<00:03:30.620> playing<00:03:30.859> for<00:03:31.069> a<00:03:31.100> few<00:03:31.310> hours<00:03:31.340> rather<00:03:31.970> than

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
been playing for a few hours rather than

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.120 
been playing for a few hours rather than
a<00:03:32.269> few<00:03:32.510> days<00:03:32.720> will<00:03:33.230> still<00:03:33.500> have<00:03:33.650> enough<00:03:33.890> loot

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
a few days will still have enough loot

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.620 
a few days will still have enough loot
for<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.549> be<00:03:34.640> worth<00:03:34.819> attacking<00:03:35.359> which<00:03:35.480> is

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
for it to be worth attacking which is

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.569 
for it to be worth attacking which is
going<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.810> be<00:03:35.870> fantastic<00:03:36.109> so<00:03:36.859> super<00:03:37.489> excited

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
going to be fantastic so super excited

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.650 
going to be fantastic so super excited
for<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.180> was<00:03:38.299> something<00:03:38.450> I've<00:03:38.630> been

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
for that that was something I've been

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.539 
for that that was something I've been
asking<00:03:39.019> for<00:03:39.230> for<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.440> long<00:03:39.500> time<00:03:39.829> now<00:03:39.859> another

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
asking for for a long time now another

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.069 
asking for for a long time now another
thing<00:03:40.670> they<00:03:40.940> announced<00:03:41.299> which<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.720> me<00:03:41.840> was<00:03:42.019> a

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
thing they announced which to me was a

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.449 
thing they announced which to me was a
little<00:03:42.350> bit<00:03:42.470> weird<00:03:42.709> of<00:03:42.980> something<00:03:43.310> to

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
little bit weird of something to

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.770 
little bit weird of something to
announce<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.970> felt<00:03:44.180> like<00:03:44.239> this<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:44.600> probably

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
announce I felt like this is probably

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.210 
announce I felt like this is probably
something<00:03:45.019> they<00:03:45.319> should<00:03:45.530> have<00:03:45.650> just<00:03:45.829> done<00:03:45.920> on

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
something they should have just done on

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.920 
something they should have just done on
the<00:03:46.370> side<00:03:46.579> I<00:03:46.970> think<00:03:47.480> there's<00:03:47.660> other<00:03:47.840> things

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
the side I think there's other things

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.990 
the side I think there's other things
they<00:03:48.230> could<00:03:48.410> have<00:03:48.500> sneak<00:03:49.130> peek<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.850> would

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
they could have sneak peek that would

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000 
they could have sneak peek that would
have<00:03:50.090> been<00:03:50.150> more<00:03:50.359> worthwhile<00:03:50.739> but<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:51.829> is

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
have been more worthwhile but this is

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.229 
have been more worthwhile but this is
that<00:03:52.160> Archer<00:03:52.519> towers<00:03:52.819> are<00:03:52.940> now<00:03:53.060> shooting

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
that Archer towers are now shooting

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.250 
that Archer towers are now shooting
twice<00:03:53.600> as<00:03:53.840> fast<00:03:54.019> with<00:03:54.350> half<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.859> damage<00:03:55.069> so<00:03:55.790> um

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
twice as fast with half the damage so um

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.750 
twice as fast with half the damage so um
basically<00:03:57.260> if<00:03:57.859> you<00:03:58.010> guys<00:03:58.160> don't<00:03:58.280> understand

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
basically if you guys don't understand

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.280 
basically if you guys don't understand
what<00:03:58.850> this<00:03:58.940> means<00:03:59.209> i<00:03:59.420> mean<00:03:59.569> when<00:03:59.840> i<00:03:59.870> first<00:04:00.139> read

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
what this means i mean when i first read

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.900 
what this means i mean when i first read
that<00:04:00.319> i<00:04:00.470> was<00:04:00.560> like<00:04:00.680> okay<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.069> nothing<00:04:01.430> changed

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
that i was like okay so nothing changed

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.210 
that i was like okay so nothing changed
but<00:04:02.569> it<00:04:02.690> does<00:04:02.840> actually<00:04:03.019> makes<00:04:03.380> a<00:04:03.620> little<00:04:04.010> bit

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
but it does actually makes a little bit

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.280 
but it does actually makes a little bit
of<00:04:04.310> sense<00:04:04.569> basically<00:04:05.569> since<00:04:05.900> bartsch<00:04:06.200> has

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
of sense basically since bartsch has

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.620 
of sense basically since bartsch has
gotten<00:04:06.680> really<00:04:06.920> popular<00:04:07.069> lately<00:04:07.790> especially

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
gotten really popular lately especially

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.349 
gotten really popular lately especially
with<00:04:08.959> townhall<00:04:09.230> sniping<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:09.920> stuff

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
with townhall sniping and stuff

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.789 
with townhall sniping and stuff
basically<00:04:11.359> what<00:04:11.510> this<00:04:11.690> does<00:04:11.989> is<00:04:12.380> since<00:04:12.709> the

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
basically what this does is since the

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.140 
basically what this does is since the
archer<00:04:13.130> towers<00:04:13.459> are<00:04:13.639> going<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.850> be<00:04:13.940> able<00:04:14.000> to

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
archer towers are going to be able to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.420 
archer towers are going to be able to
shoot<00:04:14.299> twice<00:04:14.600> as<00:04:14.840> fast<00:04:14.989> if<00:04:15.350> they're<00:04:15.920> damaged

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
shoot twice as fast if they're damaged

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.699 
shoot twice as fast if they're damaged
is<00:04:16.639> enough<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.359> kill<00:04:17.570> a<00:04:17.630> barbarian<00:04:18.109> or<00:04:18.229> archer

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
is enough to kill a barbarian or archer

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.690 
is enough to kill a barbarian or archer
it<00:04:19.010> means<00:04:19.220> they<00:04:19.370> can<00:04:19.489> kill<00:04:19.729> them<00:04:19.910> faster<00:04:20.630> so<00:04:21.109> um

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
it means they can kill them faster so um

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.190 
it means they can kill them faster so um
again<00:04:22.700> it<00:04:22.970> won't<00:04:23.210> make<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.390> big<00:04:23.630> difference<00:04:23.840> for

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
again it won't make a big difference for

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.020 
again it won't make a big difference for
like<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.409> pecka<00:04:24.740> or<00:04:25.039> a<00:04:25.099> giant<00:04:25.550> because<00:04:25.729> it's

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
like a pecka or a giant because it's

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.310 
like a pecka or a giant because it's
going<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.210> be<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.450> same<00:04:26.630> deal

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
going to be the same deal

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.620 
going to be the same deal
but<00:04:27.770> on<00:04:27.860> small<00:04:28.250> troops<00:04:28.610> if<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.150> archer<00:04:29.450> tower

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
but on small troops if the archer tower

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.870 
but on small troops if the archer tower
is<00:04:29.870> strong<00:04:30.140> enough<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.590> one<00:04:30.770> hit<00:04:31.040> them<00:04:31.250> then<00:04:31.730> it

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
is strong enough to one hit them then it

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.120 
is strong enough to one hit them then it
will<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.480> it<00:04:32.600> will<00:04:32.690> do<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.050> twice<00:04:33.320> as<00:04:33.560> fast<00:04:33.770> so

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
will and it will do it twice as fast so

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.070 
will and it will do it twice as fast so
that's<00:04:34.340> that's<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:35.030> big<00:04:35.240> change<00:04:35.510> if<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.780> think

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
that's that's a big change if you think

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.300 
that's that's a big change if you think
about<00:04:36.170> it<00:04:36.350> so<00:04:36.710> it's<00:04:36.830> going<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:36.980> make<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.160> big

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
about it so it's going to make a big

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.860 
about it so it's going to make a big
difference<00:04:37.520> if<00:04:37.910> you're<00:04:38.060> trying<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.420> push<00:04:38.630> with

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
difference if you're trying to push with

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.990 
difference if you're trying to push with
bartsch<00:04:39.080> or<00:04:39.320> if<00:04:39.740> you're<00:04:39.890> just<00:04:39.950> farming<00:04:40.550> it

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
bartsch or if you're just farming it

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.880 
bartsch or if you're just farming it
will<00:04:41.150> make<00:04:41.330> quite<00:04:41.660> a<00:04:41.840> difference<00:04:41.870> for<00:04:42.470> farming

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
will make quite a difference for farming

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.550 
will make quite a difference for farming
as<00:04:42.980> well<00:04:43.160> but<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.090> sort<00:04:44.330> of<00:04:44.390> balance<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:45.080> in<00:04:45.410> a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
as well but to sort of balance that in a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.740 
as well but to sort of balance that in a
way<00:04:45.710> they've<00:04:46.160> added<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.700> new<00:04:46.850> giant<00:04:47.090> level<00:04:47.540> so<00:04:47.720> I

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
way they've added a new giant level so I

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.540 
way they've added a new giant level so I
actually<00:04:47.990> said<00:04:48.380> this<00:04:48.500> in<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.770> last<00:04:48.950> update<00:04:49.400> I

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
actually said this in the last update I

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.550 
actually said this in the last update I
said<00:04:50.030> new<00:04:50.240> giant<00:04:50.450> level<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.110> new<00:04:51.260> balloon

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
said new giant level and new balloon

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.290 
said new giant level and new balloon
level<00:04:51.920> and<00:04:52.100> they<00:04:52.250> did<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.550> giant<00:04:52.880> level<00:04:53.090> part

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
level and they did the giant level part

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.120 
level and they did the giant level part
which<00:04:53.480> is<00:04:53.600> awesome<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:54.200> always<00:04:54.620> felt<00:04:54.830> like<00:04:54.980> we

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
which is awesome I always felt like we

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.470 
which is awesome I always felt like we
needed<00:04:55.280> a<00:04:55.520> new<00:04:55.670> giant<00:04:55.850> level<00:04:56.210> so<00:04:56.330> that's

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
needed a new giant level so that's

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.200 
needed a new giant level so that's
really<00:04:56.840> really<00:04:57.020> cool<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.880> giant

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
really really cool and the giant

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.820 
really really cool and the giant
actually<00:04:59.420> looks<00:04:59.600> badass<00:04:59.780> so<00:05:00.230> I'm<00:05:00.500> super

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
actually looks badass so I'm super

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.200 
actually looks badass so I'm super
excited<00:05:00.920> for<00:05:01.310> that<00:05:01.430> it's<00:05:01.940> going<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.090> make

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
excited for that it's going to make

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.120 
excited for that it's going to make
farming<00:05:02.510> a<00:05:02.690> lot<00:05:02.840> easier<00:05:03.020> if<00:05:03.680> you're<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:03.890> higher

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
farming a lot easier if you're a higher

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.890 
farming a lot easier if you're a higher
level<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.550> you<00:05:04.670> actually<00:05:04.940> can<00:05:05.420> have<00:05:05.630> the

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
level and you actually can have the

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.230 
level and you actually can have the
giant<00:05:06.590> but<00:05:07.310> it's<00:05:07.430> also<00:05:07.610> going<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:07.940> mean<00:05:08.120> you

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
giant but it's also going to mean you

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.970 
giant but it's also going to mean you
can<00:05:08.420> maybe<00:05:08.570> start<00:05:08.900> incorporating<00:05:09.230> it<00:05:09.800> in

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
can maybe start incorporating it in

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.100 
can maybe start incorporating it in
higher<00:05:10.250> level<00:05:10.610> attacks<00:05:10.940> before<00:05:11.480> I<00:05:11.690> just<00:05:11.960> felt

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
higher level attacks before I just felt

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.330 
higher level attacks before I just felt
like<00:05:12.170> the<00:05:12.320> Giants<00:05:12.650> were<00:05:12.710> underpowered<00:05:13.100> and

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
like the Giants were underpowered and

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.010 
like the Giants were underpowered and
they<00:05:13.460> died<00:05:13.640> really<00:05:13.940> quickly<00:05:14.330> on<00:05:14.510> maxed<00:05:14.900> out

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
they died really quickly on maxed out

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.540 
they died really quickly on maxed out
basis<00:05:15.440> especially<00:05:15.710> in<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.160> higher<00:05:16.280> town

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
basis especially in the higher town

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.790 
basis especially in the higher town
halls<00:05:16.790> so<00:05:17.300> this<00:05:17.570> this<00:05:18.080> updates<00:05:18.470> going<00:05:18.650> to<00:05:18.710> be

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
halls so this this updates going to be

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.410 
halls so this this updates going to be
pretty<00:05:19.010> awesome<00:05:19.250> I<00:05:19.550> think<00:05:19.940> that<00:05:20.000> was<00:05:20.210> needed

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
pretty awesome I think that was needed

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.270 
pretty awesome I think that was needed
and<00:05:20.780> like<00:05:21.020> I<00:05:21.050> mean<00:05:21.440> I<00:05:21.530> said<00:05:21.770> it<00:05:21.920> anyway<00:05:22.220> so

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
and like I mean I said it anyway so

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.160 
and like I mean I said it anyway so
that's<00:05:22.910> great<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.390> they're<00:05:23.540> adding<00:05:23.810> that<00:05:23.930> a

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
that's great that they're adding that a

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.840 
that's great that they're adding that a
few<00:05:24.590> things<00:05:24.710> that<00:05:24.950> you<00:05:24.980> guys<00:05:25.280> were<00:05:25.460> asking<00:05:25.550> for

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
few things that you guys were asking for

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.220 
few things that you guys were asking for
in<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.000> last<00:05:26.180> update<00:05:26.540> which<00:05:26.660> I<00:05:26.780> thought<00:05:26.990> you

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
in the last update which I thought you

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.290 
in the last update which I thought you
know<00:05:27.320> aren't<00:05:27.620> really<00:05:27.800> necessary<00:05:27.950> but<00:05:28.490> if<00:05:29.150> they

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
know aren't really necessary but if they

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.580 
know aren't really necessary but if they
can<00:05:29.450> make<00:05:29.480> some<00:05:29.780> of<00:05:29.900> you<00:05:29.990> guys<00:05:30.080> happy<00:05:30.440> then

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
can make some of you guys happy then

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.860 
can make some of you guys happy then
that's<00:05:30.710> cool<00:05:30.830> as<00:05:31.130> well<00:05:31.340> is<00:05:32.120> that<00:05:32.180> you<00:05:32.510> can<00:05:32.630> save

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
that's cool as well is that you can save

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.600 
that's cool as well is that you can save
multiple<00:05:33.110> layouts<00:05:33.500> now<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.160> you<00:05:34.250> can<00:05:34.460> have

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
multiple layouts now so you can have

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.190 
multiple layouts now so you can have
multiple<00:05:34.790> village<00:05:35.360> layouts<00:05:35.660> and<00:05:35.810> multiple

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
multiple village layouts and multiple

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.110 
multiple village layouts and multiple
war<00:05:36.410> basis<00:05:36.830> which<00:05:37.490> means<00:05:37.700> you<00:05:37.790> can<00:05:37.880> sort<00:05:38.030> of

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
war basis which means you can sort of

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.640 
war basis which means you can sort of
switch<00:05:38.300> between<00:05:38.480> them<00:05:38.690> now<00:05:38.900> although<00:05:39.260> I<00:05:39.470> do

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
switch between them now although I do

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.380 
switch between them now although I do
like<00:05:39.980> that<00:05:40.040> I<00:05:40.460> don't<00:05:40.850> really<00:05:41.030> think<00:05:41.180> it's

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
like that I don't really think it's

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.280 
like that I don't really think it's
necessary<00:05:41.450> I<00:05:42.020> mean<00:05:42.320> I<00:05:43.060> fun<00:05:44.140> redesigning<00:05:45.140> a

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
necessary I mean I fun redesigning a

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.710 
necessary I mean I fun redesigning a
base<00:05:45.440> every<00:05:45.710> now<00:05:45.830> and<00:05:45.980> again<00:05:46.010> but<00:05:46.220> if<00:05:47.150> you<00:05:47.570> guys

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
base every now and again but if you guys

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.910 
base every now and again but if you guys
like<00:05:47.960> switching<00:05:48.320> between<00:05:48.410> them<00:05:48.710> I<00:05:48.770> guess

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
like switching between them I guess

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.350 
like switching between them I guess
that's<00:05:49.100> cool<00:05:49.280> anyway<00:05:49.610> so<00:05:50.030> I'm<00:05:50.090> really<00:05:50.240> looking

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
that's cool anyway so I'm really looking

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.450 
that's cool anyway so I'm really looking
forward<00:05:50.630> to<00:05:50.960> either<00:05:51.140> a<00:05:51.320> new<00:05:51.620> balloon<00:05:51.890> level<00:05:52.250> or

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
forward to either a new balloon level or

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.340 
forward to either a new balloon level or
for<00:05:52.700> them<00:05:52.820> to<00:05:52.970> just<00:05:53.000> decrease<00:05:53.660> of<00:05:53.960> air

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
for them to just decrease of air

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.070 
for them to just decrease of air
defenses<00:05:55.040> because<00:05:55.400> I've<00:05:56.270> seen<00:05:56.300> a<00:05:56.720> few

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
defenses because I've seen a few

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.110 
defenses because I've seen a few
comments<00:05:57.620> about<00:05:57.680> lower<00:05:58.040> levels<00:05:58.460> where<00:05:58.700> dragon

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
comments about lower levels where dragon

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.510 
comments about lower levels where dragon
attacks<00:05:59.420> are<00:05:59.600> really<00:05:59.780> viable<00:05:59.990> but<00:06:00.770> that's

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
attacks are really viable but that's

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.770 
attacks are really viable but that's
sort<00:06:01.640> of<00:06:01.760> understandable<00:06:02.330> I<00:06:02.480> mean<00:06:02.630> they're

sort of understandable I mean they're

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.380 
sort of understandable I mean they're
really<00:06:03.200> expensive<00:06:03.590> it's<00:06:04.190> about<00:06:04.550> as<00:06:04.880> expensive

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390

pretty<00:06:08.990> heart<00:06:09.290> attack<00:06:09.590> but<00:06:10.160> in<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.610> later

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
pretty heart attack but in the later

pretty heart attack but in the later
levels<00:06:11.090> dragons<00:06:11.780> just<00:06:12.170> die<00:06:12.410> like<00:06:13.010> flies<00:06:13.520> like

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
levels dragons just die like flies like

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.000 
levels dragons just die like flies like
I<00:06:14.240> mean<00:06:14.510> they<00:06:14.630> just<00:06:14.840> die<00:06:14.990> so<00:06:15.260> quick<00:06:15.530> it<00:06:15.710> doesn't

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
I mean they just die so quick it doesn't

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.880 
I mean they just die so quick it doesn't
matter<00:06:16.210> even<00:06:17.210> if<00:06:17.450> the<00:06:17.630> base<00:06:17.780> has<00:06:18.050> multi<00:06:18.590> set

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
matter even if the base has multi set

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.350 
matter even if the base has multi set
infra<00:06:19.400> notes<00:06:19.670> it<00:06:19.820> doesn't<00:06:20.090> matter<00:06:20.240> that

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
infra notes it doesn't matter that

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.290 
infra notes it doesn't matter that
dragons<00:06:20.930> will<00:06:21.140> die<00:06:21.320> and<00:06:21.620> I<00:06:22.520> felt<00:06:23.000> the<00:06:23.120> same

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
dragons will die and I felt the same

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.360 
dragons will die and I felt the same
with<00:06:23.450> balloons<00:06:23.780> too<00:06:24.080> so<00:06:24.590> a<00:06:24.920> few<00:06:25.310> people

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
with balloons too so a few people

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.100 
with balloons too so a few people
suggested<00:06:26.090> this<00:06:26.210> in<00:06:26.360> the<00:06:26.450> comments<00:06:26.870> which<00:06:26.930> was

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
suggested this in the comments which was

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.410 
suggested this in the comments which was
actually<00:06:27.440> just<00:06:27.590> a<00:06:27.740> sort<00:06:28.520> of<00:06:28.580> nerve<00:06:28.910> the<00:06:29.240> air

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
actually just a sort of nerve the air

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.450 
actually just a sort of nerve the air
defenses<00:06:29.990> and<00:06:30.170> that<00:06:30.590> makes<00:06:30.800> more<00:06:30.950> sense<00:06:31.010> to<00:06:31.370> me

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
defenses and that makes more sense to me

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.860 
defenses and that makes more sense to me
than<00:06:31.490> adding<00:06:31.940> new<00:06:32.060> levels<00:06:32.390> because<00:06:32.690> some

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
than adding new levels because some

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.090 
than adding new levels because some
people<00:06:33.140> might<00:06:33.230> feel<00:06:33.410> like<00:06:33.590> the<00:06:33.710> new<00:06:33.830> levels

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
people might feel like the new levels

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.010 
people might feel like the new levels
are<00:06:34.190> overpowered<00:06:34.670> but<00:06:35.120> honestly<00:06:35.300> if<00:06:35.780> they're

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
are overpowered but honestly if they're

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.230 
are overpowered but honestly if they're
just<00:06:36.050> for<00:06:36.410> Town<00:06:36.560> Hall<00:06:36.740> 10<00:06:36.980> then<00:06:37.430> a<00:06:37.760> new<00:06:37.970> balloon

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
out of the realm of possibility i think

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.390 
out of the realm of possibility i think
that's<00:06:42.630> totally<00:06:43.020> fine<00:06:43.170> i<00:06:43.770> don't<00:06:43.980> know<00:06:44.250> if<00:06:44.310> they

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400

wasn't<00:07:14.280> too<00:07:14.430> bad<00:07:14.610> but<00:07:14.780> in<00:07:15.780> the<00:07:15.930> past<00:07:16.080> there's

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
wasn't too bad but in the past there's

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.810 
wasn't too bad but in the past there's
definitely<00:07:16.650> been<00:07:16.740> instances<00:07:17.250> where<00:07:17.430> it<00:07:17.700> was

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820 
definitely been instances where it was

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.120 
definitely been instances where it was
just<00:07:18.000> way<00:07:18.210> too<00:07:18.270> many<00:07:18.600> next<00:07:18.990> button<00:07:19.290> pushes<00:07:19.650> so
