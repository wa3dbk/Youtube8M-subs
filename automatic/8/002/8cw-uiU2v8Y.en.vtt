that this week in the story I had a bit

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.729 
that this week in the story I had a bit
of<00:02:08.080> problem<00:02:08.440> with<00:02:08.649> one<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.190> instances<00:02:09.549> and

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
so after doing that I fancied something

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.559 
so after doing that I fancied something
a<00:02:15.160> bit<00:02:15.250> different<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.700> jumped<00:02:15.940> into<00:02:16.060> pvp<00:02:16.420> I

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
a bit different so I jumped into pvp I

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.039 
a bit different so I jumped into pvp I
wanted<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.959> do<00:02:17.140> world<00:02:17.890> versus<00:02:18.400> world<00:02:19.049> because

knowing the characters know in the map

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.320 
knowing the characters know in the map
knowing<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> skills<00:04:24.680> can<00:04:25.680> do<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.060> point

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
knowing the skills can do to the point

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.240
