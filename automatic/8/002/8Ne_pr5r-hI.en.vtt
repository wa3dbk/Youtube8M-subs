00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.160
 d 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.500
 this offensive movement is a play 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.960
 between lines starting from a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.800
 positioning of 4 let's see the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.800
 full movement 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.170
 let's analyze the play is a movement 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.790
 offensive very basic but with it he 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.680
 manages to gain the free space that 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.570
 the four attackers remain on the court 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.880
 on the court totally for 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.530
 hinder the defense against the 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.270
 blue circles indicate the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.550
 free spaces that can be occupied 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.920
 to take advantage of the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.140
 defenders the ball player passes it 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.120
 to his closest companion this does 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.370
 move quickly to the opposite wing and 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.410
 starting from the green circle that is the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.270
 space in principle that we want to win 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.340
 once the player enters the attack 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.230
 there will be a pass line behind him 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.480
 From this moment the movement 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.190
 the player with the ball is very simple 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.560
 make a wall with the partner 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.910
 located between lines to go up 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.040
 side and finish the movement 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.630
 let's watch the movement first to 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.750
 cross speed gone and then speed 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.750
 normal 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.390
 I always like to finish the video with 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.700
 a technical gesture today is the turn of rafa 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.090
 usÃ­n moving with the ball in the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.090
 plant 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.689
 Y 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 or
