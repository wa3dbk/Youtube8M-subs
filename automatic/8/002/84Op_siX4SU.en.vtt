00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
shape it or anything yet so it's a

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.539

so you may even want to take your hand
and<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.549> your<00:03:29.669> bangs<00:03:29.879> it's<00:03:30.479> gonna

and do this on your bangs it's gonna

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.449 
and do this on your bangs it's gonna
make<00:03:30.810> them<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.989> bit<00:03:31.109> longer<00:03:31.379> so<00:03:32.129> just<00:03:32.310> keep<00:03:32.430> that

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
make them a bit longer so just keep that

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.020 
make them a bit longer so just keep that
in<00:03:32.609> mind

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
in mind

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.939 
in mind
but<00:03:33.479> like<00:03:33.659> I<00:03:33.840> said<00:03:33.900> before<00:03:34.229> you<00:03:34.590> want<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.769> make

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
but like I said before you want to make

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.170 
but like I said before you want to make
sure<00:03:34.979> you<00:03:35.280> check<00:03:35.400> out<00:03:35.609> your<00:03:35.699> bangs<00:03:35.909> dry

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
sure you check out your bangs dry

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.059 
sure you check out your bangs dry
because<00:03:36.569> if<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.930> cut<00:03:37.109> them<00:03:37.229> wet

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
because if you cut them wet

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.949 
because if you cut them wet
you<00:03:38.549> may<00:03:38.699> get<00:03:38.879> a<00:03:38.939> better<00:03:39.090> sense<00:03:39.449> of<00:03:39.629> how<00:03:39.780> your

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
hair is gonna fall and you may be easier

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.179 
hair is gonna fall and you may be easier

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
hair draws up a lot when it dries so

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.679 
hair draws up a lot when it dries so
it's<00:03:46.979> going<00:03:47.159> to<00:03:47.280> be<00:03:47.370> difficult<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.970> mount

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
like to remember also something to

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.399
