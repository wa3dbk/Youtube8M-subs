00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
about it to be honest I wouldn't be
surprised<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.690> activision<00:00:45.690> did<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> same

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
surprised if activision did the same

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.680 
surprised if activision did the same
thing<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> teach<00:00:46.770> PS<00:00:47.100> 5<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.670> EA<00:00:48.000> did<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.510> the

thing to teach PS 5 as EA did to the
sims<00:00:48.930> 4<00:00:49.200> EA<00:00:50.100> did<00:00:50.489> not<00:00:50.670> provide<00:00:51.000> any<00:00:51.239> review

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
probably so that the game could sell

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
negative response which it by the way

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
negative response which it by the way
was<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> game<00:01:02.219> still<00:01:02.550> sold<00:01:02.850> well<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.090 
anything like that in any game store I
guess<00:01:45.299> Activision<00:01:45.869> completely<00:01:46.619> rely<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:46.920> the
