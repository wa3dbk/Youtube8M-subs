00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.169
 It is curious to know that there is a 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.359
 species of bird called swift that is 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:10.120
 very common in the areas of Europe and Asia 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:14.230
 that is able to sleep flying and that 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.889
 it never lands, that is, it spends all its 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.830
 lifetime 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:21.310
 flying even when he sleeps he has 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.910
 made a study of these birds and they pass 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.519
 to flap about ten times a 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.550
 ten times per second to beat seven 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:36.570
 times per second that is capable 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.570
 to stay while they sleep flying 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.980
 incredible no I mean I do not know how 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.010
 do these birds as they are capable of 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.030
 fly while they sleep how do they 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.730
 dodge obstacles I do not know 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.739
 I do not know is a mystery yet 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.500
 already scientific studies have shown 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.540
 that this is so and that the swift 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.269
 consider as the bird that more time 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.330
 fly by of all the birds that 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:07.090
 they exist throughout a life only 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.159
 land to lay the eggs and in the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.920
 case it lands for example in the 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.110
 soil by accident many swifts do not 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.840
 are able to fly again unless it is 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.390
 to help them because the fact of 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.590
 take so many years 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.330
 flying and flying and flying without 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.009
 rest because it has made also 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.979
 Genetics evolves in a way 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.170
 quite unfavorable indeed its legs 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.630
 are so weak that most of the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.179
 sometimes perching on somewhere you 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.000
 it is very difficult to climb the flight 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:43.119
 we are talking about birds that by cojones 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.830
 they already have you have to be 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.910
 flying most of his life 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.830
 and landing is a challenge for them 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.790
 challenge for your weak and fragile 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.270
 legs 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.430
 once able to fly while sleeping 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.430
 something really incredible
