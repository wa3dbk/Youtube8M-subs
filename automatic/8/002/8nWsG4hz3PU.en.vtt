00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.629
 a person that I was here considered to be in this video lesson 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.929
 teaching you how to make your accountant faster 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.009
 hence gain so use dut all without fining needing tea and programs 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.960
 call me jihadist 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.600
 so this is the theme of the cbd 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.130
 Why is not my contact always right? 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.020
 so come on and on 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.950
 the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.220
 see here the run 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.430
 gita 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.740
 ls 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.740
 your son 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.230
 click ok 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.530
 I still want to be the would seem to be system configuration utility 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 know that she has made almost 16 gasoline initialize 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.280
 who are the programs you dreaded together with windows 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.290
 So 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.950
 one you see in the salt shaker with the necessary and unnecessary programs 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.240
 here you want, right? 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.480
 kissinger cum 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.380
 I do not 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.860
 in the conservation of imc 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.610
 in me these programs there unnecessary since you can 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 session and then 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.570
 ayala in a city program 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.470
 I'd already fainted on the mat 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.090
 thing so there it is clear you are that it is all the programs that started 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.890
 a stump and we then the more we have marked here there is what this leap of 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.380
 air programs 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.249
 started along with the windows there you will mark what you do not want 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.550
 applicable coins want to start the computer 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.440
 so this is a way 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.430
 I'd let it go faster 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.700
 the other 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.540
 It is you to do a risky experimentation. 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.379
 let's observe here in control panel 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.319
 administrative tools 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:24.089
 I tried searching for defragmenting the disk 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.049
 if I were afraid of the organ assuming to criticize 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.769
 there is no system 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.409
 i messed too 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.279
 no senate 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.209
 I will not go 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.209
 search for extraterrestrials 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.219
 it is 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.340
 Lula sought this is the time to discuss accessories 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.549
 in the system tools 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:03.819
 Do you come here? 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.139
 the fragments 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.289
 Carrier of Palm Scratching the Path 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:12.609
 benefit all programs sound advice and discovery 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.859
 with the rush with her 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.859
 disk defragmenter system tools 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:22.669
 to reopen what I said was lamented risk 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.569
 Then you'll ask to do a senate review. 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.569
 misses analyzing the 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.719
 is channeled 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.769
 then this one that all acts are eight kilos music files have success 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.809
 everyone here in the chat 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.809
 ef 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.489
 and those blanks that the action 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.349

 I'm walking 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.459
 the bolatti 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.459
 it takes longer the more white space I have here 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:07.649
 but the delay at night then you have to make you go from the 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.649
 fragmentations if click here 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.299
 he was already lizandra again 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.879
 the freedom to experience the team will do 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:23.769
 all these files here that was far from each other he will let her 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.559
 so power 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:33.759
 the orion and goes if you were the breath was to see the progress of the process in the sand 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.779
 all these services 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:43.440
 these files here or approaching takai so I started to make the one and only 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.009
 the computer started by them 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.110
 the duct will be faster 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.999
 including that me 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:53.939
 by the configuration m the actual cured conferences and the speed in it and 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.710
 also in 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.340
 understood that the hi-fi celso previdelli sound for you that manufactures itabom 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.779
 Have you dreamed? 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.919

 in itapevi also in the configuration of your computer is inadequate kept 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.999
 boring is more memory and a faster processor 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.110
