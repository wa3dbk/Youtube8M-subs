and<00:02:26.799> this<00:02:27.190> wing<00:02:27.430> has<00:02:27.640> another<00:02:28.000> three<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:29.349> two

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
and this wing has another three one two

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.030 
and this wing has another three one two
three<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.790> that's<00:02:31.030> ten<00:02:31.780> apartments<00:02:32.079> per<00:02:32.680> floor

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
three so that's ten apartments per floor

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.150 
three so that's ten apartments per floor
each<00:02:33.370> with<00:02:33.790> about<00:02:33.970> five<00:02:34.450> people<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.739> run<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
each with about five people this run the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.229 
each with about five people this run the
24th<00:02:36.670> floor<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.180> 34<00:02:37.870> 34<00:02:38.620> floors<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:40.060> is

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
24th floor of 34 34 floors and this is

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.490 
24th floor of 34 34 floors and this is
one<00:02:40.540> wing<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:42.180> 2-1<00:02:43.180> branch<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.660> two<00:02:44.230> branch

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
one wing of a 2-1 branch of two branch

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.069 
one wing of a 2-1 branch of two branch
building<00:02:45.329> so<00:02:46.329> every<00:02:46.600> floor<00:02:46.810> would<00:02:46.959> have

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
building so every floor would have

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.000 
building so every floor would have
double<00:02:47.440> than<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.880> looking<00:02:48.880> out<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.209> window

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
double than that looking out this window

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.349 
double than that looking out this window
another<00:02:51.010> condo<00:02:51.400> tower<00:02:51.639> with<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> similar

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
another condo tower with a similar

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.780 
another condo tower with a similar
arrangement<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:53.889> is<00:02:54.010> just<00:02:54.130> one<00:02:54.430> branch

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
arrangement so this is just one branch

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.720 
arrangement so this is just one branch
of<00:02:55.030> two<00:02:55.239> branches<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.319> set<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.859> condo<00:02:57.340> towers

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
of two branches of a set of condo towers

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.300 
of two branches of a set of condo towers
to<00:02:58.690> try<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.959> do<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.200> math<00:02:59.350> that's<00:02:59.410> quite<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.069> lot

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
to try to do the math that's quite a lot

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.550 
to try to do the math that's quite a lot
that's<00:03:00.579> quite<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.819> lot<00:03:01.060> there<00:03:01.299> 10<00:03:01.690> times<00:03:01.720> 5

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
that's quite a lot there 10 times 5

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.690 
that's quite a lot there 10 times 5
times<00:03:02.639> 2<00:03:03.639> has<00:03:04.510> 100<00:03:05.319> people<00:03:05.739> about<00:03:06.040> per<00:03:06.280> floor

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
times 2 has 100 people about per floor

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.559 
times 2 has 100 people about per floor
on<00:03:06.940> 34<00:03:07.420> floor<00:03:08.370> 3400<00:03:09.370> people<00:03:09.420> some<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.510> the

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
on 34 floor 3400 people some of the

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.970 
on 34 floor 3400 people some of the
apartment<00:03:10.900> buildings<00:03:11.260> even<00:03:11.470> have<00:03:11.590> more<00:03:11.829> than

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
apartment buildings even have more than

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.580 
apartment buildings even have more than
that<00:03:12.160> actually<00:03:12.609> no<00:03:12.730> 5<00:03:13.030> it's<00:03:13.269> about<00:03:13.420> five<00:03:13.660> so

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
that actually no 5 it's about five so

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.319 
that actually no 5 it's about five so
about<00:03:14.889> three<00:03:15.130> thousand<00:03:15.609> people<00:03:15.760> per<00:03:15.910> tower

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
about three thousand people per tower

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.190 
about three thousand people per tower
and<00:03:16.660> there's<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.739> lot<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.190> towers<00:03:18.849> a<00:03:19.030> lot<00:03:19.930> and

this is a suburban area actually to

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.470 
this is a suburban area actually to
believe<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.739> or<00:03:23.829> not

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
what these branches will look so they'll

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.319 
what these branches will look so they'll
be<00:03:43.299> in<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.450> second<00:03:43.780> part<00:03:43.959> okay
