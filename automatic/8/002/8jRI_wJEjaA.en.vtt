00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 by jean who we will win a 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.980
 analyzed earrings ears Walkom 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.250
 this to make a pair of loops 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.460
 like this one you need 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.170
 small rice hooks that can be 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.980
 find on the internet 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.590
 or then in the leisure stores 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.470
 creative other little hooks like 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.789
 this or so if you can not find one 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:34.910
 of the film like this is the son who 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.850
 is wired golden we will bend 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.469
 and then so in his method for with 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.469
 the movie you just have to pass it 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.390
 like this cut you to length and 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.410
 you will spend your teeth term at the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.360
 unhooked place so the hook the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.239
 pearls or you want there I you 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.219
 gives a simple model with a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.600
 only pair them and then later when 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.320
 I may have to others sooner 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.010
 with models a little more complicated 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.950
 so here and then tongs on 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.659
 start with the brackets so I'm going 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.100
 to do just for one ear knowing 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.619
 that it's the same for both 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.689
 ticket additions a little an accessory if 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.920
 we lose them dig and we are 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.780
 small beads that are the size of 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.369
 beads but they are in 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.220
 metal and it allows to be able to 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.890
 crush to keep up poles 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.470
 and the others so we take the hook 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.130
 right at the louvre has a little bit a 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:39.720
 first calf of the loop is going then 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:41.930
 enter here in the ring hook or 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.649
 so we do not have a son who is double 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.720
 and so we pass the earring 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.560
 then we pass the pearl in they 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.189
 these and after I will take more 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.189
 she crushed 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:11.660
 that I will spend in my son or in 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.989
 my hook like these then to the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.989
 designate 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.910
 here is then using my clip him 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.120
 crush mattern good for easter 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:31.250
 this way it crashes 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.650
 so we get the earring and 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.349
 after we have just with the help of a clip 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:43.910
 cutting cut the water or the ppi which 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:47.410
 exceeds and that's the small category 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.410
 this is goodbye
