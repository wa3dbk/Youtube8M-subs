00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.250
 Hi guys all right 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.130
 Today I'll teach, so will you do it? 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.320
 with the tip there that is in shape 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.300
 we do this. 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.630
 border then you will need 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.720
 cut in the squares in see the one of name 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.510
 centimeters by 9 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.170
 There you will do the following I'll come. 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.320
 here you will measure whether in the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.770
 diagonal from one end to the other only for 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.410
 You know where an email is in my case. 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:51.660
 I'm measuring here I will not measure what 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:56.100
 from this end to the other end only 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.510
 certify where I went wrong where the center is 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.449
 of my square is here and now and then 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.409
 Did you make the markup? 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.750
 You'll get the scissors that will start. 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.260
 to cut out on the diagonals 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.950
 it's on the four ends 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.420
 You'll start cropping up well. 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.420
 close to downtown 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.530
 You'll do it on every tip. 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:41.290
 Now you're going to hang glue here in the middle. 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:44.980
 and you have four parts like that 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:51.140
 cut dinho is then you will get 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:53.300
 one end and will lead to the middle or 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.100
 use pencil tip to press 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.100
 here in the hot glue for the mickey 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.550
 then you have a little bit more 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.350
 Here then you will take the first 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:14.120
 tip of the next bit and will take 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.100
 until the middle and will press to stick there 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.860
 on the other side cut you money 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:24.890
 will take the first part and will make the 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.350
 same thing and now here we have the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.410
 last part of the line you're going to pick up 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.900
 the first tip 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.020
 He goes to the center. 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.540
 or else this first weathervane here 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.230
 this first part is ready 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.150
 Now just pay attention to that detail is 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.280
 What I'm going to tell you 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.150
 You'll get this one already. 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.920
 cut dinho is like the other then 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.110
 You'll get your weathervane and go. 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.390
 put him here on top of the other 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:03.050
 then you will realize that op is a 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.480
 of the parties if that part you started 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.880
 This is it for the first one you did. 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.160
 You started with that tip. 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:16.340
 so now you start with the other 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.790
 So is the first weathervane that 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.360
 You made you started this little sidewalk. 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:26.620
 Now you'll start with the other and you. 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.620
 You'll see why. 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.540
 ready people finished the question the two 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.450
 winches now you will join them 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.030
 that's why you have to start with 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.730
 the tip and the other and 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.190
 you get the tip contrary to that 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:53.330
 when you need to put the two 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.330
 the tips that fit right 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.859
 then we will paste all 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.060
 Let's join all the tips in the 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.239
 wind vane 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.329
 but let's just leave some in necklace 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.359
 okay everyone else 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.570
 You will join these bridges lines 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.919
 ready 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.260
 glued're all very tips of the weathervane 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.660
 I left only one open which is where the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.300
 People are going to put the pencil in the 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:37.020
 people will ask the opposition that we 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:41.190
 want and will pass hot glue here 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.220
 and will fix the pencil and there we will now 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.629
 You can already pass the line to close 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:51.169
 the tip that the weathervane is 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:55.199
 ready people already cooley 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:58.110
 Now we'll get a cooked one. 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.610
 so send and go put in the middle of 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.639
 two sides right 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.620
 just to give the finished now to 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.919
 to finish 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.849
 if you want of course you can too 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.169
 put one more button on something 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.669
 so prefect 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:21.210
 the weathervane can put here in the middle 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:23.699
 one more detail and you will do 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.470
 this on both sides because our 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.840
 weathervane it is double 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.009
 then our weathervane has front and 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.539
 verse 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.539
 So 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.259
 any side by pencil turn the 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.840
 weathervane will be decorated 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:43.360
