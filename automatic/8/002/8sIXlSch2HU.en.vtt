00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.010 
strange and I think I need to show the
mouse<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:20.150> there's<00:01:21.150> another<00:01:21.360> setting<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.960> I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020

actually<00:02:05.240> well<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:06.480> need<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.690> find<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.900> solution

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
actually well we need to find a solution

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.290 
actually well we need to find a solution
for<00:02:07.440> it's<00:02:07.740> probably<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.880> or<00:02:09.000> two<00:02:09.030> minor

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
for it's probably just one or two minor

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.540 
for it's probably just one or two minor
settings<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.080> I'll<00:02:10.350> fix<00:02:10.650> it<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:10.950> that's<00:02:11.340> been

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
settings and I'll fix it but that's been

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.070 
settings and I'll fix it but that's been
a<00:02:11.580> new<00:02:11.730> expert<00:02:12.090> version<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> couple<00:02:13.020> of

that's one of the main problems why

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.790 
that's one of the main problems why
doesn't<00:02:18.330> work<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:18.900> we'll<00:02:19.080> fix<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.380> after<00:02:19.530> the
