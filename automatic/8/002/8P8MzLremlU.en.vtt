00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.839
 I am posting Gunpla production videos . 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.839
 I would like to create a new Gundam fin funnel this time 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:22.130
 Quite Kedomo here now I've been out a large part of Pinpaneru 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:27.680
 Art is lined up and similar parts are similar, so the pin funnel is inclined forward 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:32.800
 There are 6 so there are 6 party speakers for chocolate parser 4 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.800
 Necho This area is around this area 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:53.440
 It was coloring using Vovrey's garden garden car parker 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.440
 I will 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.870
 m-remaster is a part of cars in cars 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.489
 Colored head-kun of cattle 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.170
 It feels like you give a little sense of unity 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:12.350
 I hope to do it 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.550
 US colored I but think whether the shape of the part has become somewhat easier to understand 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.580
 I will 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.670
 The rest is just a perfume 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.220
 If it is this party for six minutes 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.220
 I will do it is 12 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.990
 Coloring with Weathering Master is complete 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.619
 Boo 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.040
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.950
 ame 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 Hmm 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.830
 me 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.830
 me 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.830
 Hmm 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:03:01.430
 I end assembly Mu Ude amount about half 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:06.490
 The assembled parts are like this 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:11.040
 After that it is the lower part of this, the same heart as the upper part of this a 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.040
 I think that I want to produce it for six 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.850
 Whoa Shah 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.190
 It is a total of six 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.770
 A pair of fin funnels 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.340
 It has completed 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:49.819
 It is quite painful still is the repetition of the work of the same thing 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.780
 It was good that the card was also assembled safely 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.250
 Hmm 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:59.540
 I 've completed six searches for fin funnels 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.200
 Here It is one of 1234 place 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.790
 Here 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.960
 I'm going to put Vitz transcription type decals, so I want to put that too 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.800
 I'm sorry 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.670
 It is mark setter to use with mark setter 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.670
 It's water 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:23.160
 At first place mark setter in place to put decal 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.090
 And then curl 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.700
 It is on a horseback 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.020
 You can go 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.500
 To after I 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.190
 Unnecessary 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.050
 c bar 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.930
 Suck it off with a cotton swab 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:42.940
 It's done when it's sunny like this 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.569
 So I think would like to other parts also Janja 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.050
 As we finished fin Funnel decal 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:51.159
 It was completed 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.159
 It turned out to be something like this 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.580
 In such a feeling in the act article but I feel that stretched now 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.560
 I am 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.580
 It feels like it's going to fly around and surround you 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.030
 When storing it further 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.320
 Yes I will store even if stretched 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:19.520
 It will feel like going to attached to the two folding phosphorus to back 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:24.630
 So I am super here to be attached to the back of the New Gundam 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:28.790
 I kinda think that I want to coalescing It's all here 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:34.480
 It became such feeling when assembling it according to the manual 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.480
 I contrast is quite good in this dark blue and white 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.889
 After all 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.889
 After all this design is cool- 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:06:00.040
 Than this time Pinpaneru was completed 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:03.220
 All parts were completed for the long production of New Gundam 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:08.290
 Next time, here is the fin funnel 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:12.780
 And by the funeral to various equipment It is the other maps Perth for admission 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.780
 I want to complete even breast cancer 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.850
 Good good
