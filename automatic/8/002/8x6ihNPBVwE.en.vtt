00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.420 

since<00:00:04.640> the<00:00:04.850> thermocouple<00:00:05.420> wire<00:00:05.630> is

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430 
since the thermocouple wire is

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.280 
since the thermocouple wire is
mechanically<00:00:07.430> fastened<00:00:07.580> at<00:00:08.480> this<00:00:08.750> point<00:00:09.049> I

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
mechanically fastened at this point I

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.699 
mechanically fastened at this point I
wanted<00:00:09.740> to<00:00:10.150> take<00:00:11.150> some<00:00:11.480> of<00:00:11.510> the<00:00:11.660> wire<00:00:11.840> and<00:00:12.230> then

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:12.709 
wanted to take some of the wire and then

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.039 
wanted to take some of the wire and then
put<00:00:12.889> a<00:00:12.920> wire<00:00:13.129> tied<00:00:13.430> to<00:00:13.850> a<00:00:13.879> location<00:00:14.240> that<00:00:14.480> would

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
put a wire tied to a location that would

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.230 
put a wire tied to a location that would
allow<00:00:15.320> this<00:00:15.619> to<00:00:15.830> be<00:00:15.860> stable<00:00:16.580> and<00:00:16.730> this<00:00:17.060> would

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
allow this to be stable and this would

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.380 
allow this to be stable and this would
never<00:00:17.449> move<00:00:17.810> so<00:00:18.400> this<00:00:19.400> mechanical<00:00:19.940> fastening

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
never move so this mechanical fastening

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.570 
never move so this mechanical fastening
will<00:00:20.690> not<00:00:20.870> never<00:00:21.200> be<00:00:21.350> strained<00:00:21.740> part<00:00:22.310> above

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
will not never be strained part above

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.220 
will not never be strained part above
can<00:00:22.970> move<00:00:23.180> but<00:00:23.390> it<00:00:23.480> really<00:00:23.660> doesn't<00:00:23.870> need<00:00:24.050> to

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
can move but it really doesn't need to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.500 
can move but it really doesn't need to
just<00:00:24.860> to<00:00:24.950> keep<00:00:25.100> it<00:00:25.250> nice<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:25.670> stable<00:00:26.090> these

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
just to keep it nice and stable these

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.330 
just to keep it nice and stable these
thermocouple<00:00:27.140> wires<00:00:27.350> are<00:00:27.620> polarized<00:00:28.130> which

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
thermocouple wires are polarized which

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.400 
thermocouple wires are polarized which
means<00:00:28.610> that<00:00:28.760> one<00:00:29.270> is<00:00:29.480> negative<00:00:29.690> and<00:00:30.050> one<00:00:30.230> is

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
means that one is negative and one is

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.350 
means that one is negative and one is
positive<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.280> we'll<00:00:31.670> have<00:00:31.760> to<00:00:31.910> make<00:00:32.059> sure<00:00:32.119> that

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
positive so we'll have to make sure that

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.810 
positive so we'll have to make sure that
we<00:00:32.450> get<00:00:32.629> the<00:00:32.689> red<00:00:33.260> side<00:00:33.680> on<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.340> negative<00:00:34.579> side

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
we get the red side on the negative side

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.270 
we get the red side on the negative side
of<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.719> or<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.380> negative<00:00:36.500> terminal<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:37.220> the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
of the or the negative terminal and the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.280 
of the or the negative terminal and the
yellow<00:00:37.820> on<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.150> positive<00:00:38.600> terminal<00:00:38.720> will

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
yellow on the positive terminal will

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.420 
yellow on the positive terminal will
take<00:00:39.560> the<00:00:39.800> red<00:00:40.430> connect<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.510> negative<00:00:42.430> and

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
take the red connect to negative and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.729 
take the red connect to negative and
yellow<00:00:44.000> connected<00:00:44.450> to<00:00:44.510> positive<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.590> now

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
yellow connected to positive so now

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.680 
yellow connected to positive so now
we're<00:00:45.890> going<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:46.040> connect<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.690> resistor

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
we're going to connect the resistor

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.620 
we're going to connect the resistor
wires<00:00:48.320> which<00:00:48.710> are<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:49.329> this<00:00:50.329> is<00:00:50.450> for<00:00:50.600> the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
wires which are the this is for the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.139 
wires which are the this is for the
heater<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.230> power<00:00:51.440> resistors<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.430> create<00:00:53.030> the

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
heater the power resistors to create the

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.450 
heater the power resistors to create the
heat<00:00:53.300> these<00:00:54.110> don't<00:00:54.320> have<00:00:54.590> polarity<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.340> they

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
heat these don't have polarity so they

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.660 
heat these don't have polarity so they
can<00:00:55.640> be<00:00:55.730> put<00:00:56.390> into<00:00:56.510> either<00:00:57.260> either<00:00:57.980> terminal

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
can be put into either either terminal

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.060 
can be put into either either terminal
that<00:00:59.480> is<00:00:59.600> labeled<00:00:59.930> for<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.170> heater<00:01:00.350> I'm<00:01:00.860> going

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
that is labeled for the heater I'm going

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.859 
that is labeled for the heater I'm going
to<00:01:01.219> measure<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.870> terminal<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:04.750> cut<00:01:05.750> it

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
to measure it to the terminal and cut it

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.749 
to measure it to the terminal and cut it
and<00:01:05.990> about<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:06.979> location<00:01:07.399> so<00:01:07.520> i<00:01:07.579> don't<00:01:07.729> have

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
and about that location so i don't have

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.550 
and about that location so i don't have
too<00:01:07.939> much<00:01:08.060> wire<00:01:08.270> going<00:01:08.630> going<00:01:09.200> everywhere

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
too much wire going going everywhere

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.190 
too much wire going going everywhere
I'll<00:01:10.399> just<00:01:10.639> cut<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:10.969> right<00:01:10.999> about<00:01:11.630> there<00:01:14.200> there

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
I'll just cut it right about there there

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.800 
I'll just cut it right about there there
was<00:01:15.350> too<00:01:15.709> much<00:01:16.060> thermocouple<00:01:17.060> wire<00:01:17.299> coming

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
was too much thermocouple wire coming

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.749 
was too much thermocouple wire coming
out<00:01:17.959> here<00:01:18.139> I<00:01:18.170> had<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.499> this<00:01:18.590> pool<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.490> what<00:01:19.729> I

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
out here I had in this pool and what I

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.940 
out here I had in this pool and what I
did<00:01:19.969> is<00:01:19.999> I<00:01:20.209> shortened<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.020> this<00:01:21.109> is<00:01:21.259> ok<00:01:21.560> to

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
did is I shortened it and this is ok to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.629 
did is I shortened it and this is ok to
do<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.670> what<00:01:23.029> I<00:01:23.060> did<00:01:23.179> is<00:01:23.359> I<00:01:23.840> took<00:01:24.229> a<00:01:25.039> couple<00:01:25.340> heat

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
do so what I did is I took a couple heat

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:28.300 
do so what I did is I took a couple heat
shrink<00:01:25.969> so<00:01:26.179> I<00:01:26.209> got<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:27.079> know<00:01:27.200> color<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:27.920> red

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
shrink so I got you know color of red

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.849 
shrink so I got you know color of red
and<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.020> green<00:01:30.020> which<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.409> you<00:01:30.740> know

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
and and green which is a you know

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.699 
and and green which is a you know
something<00:01:31.399> different<00:01:32.060> than<00:01:32.149> red<00:01:32.380> heat<00:01:33.380> shrunk

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
something different than red heat shrunk

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.309 
something different than red heat shrunk
those<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.279> to<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.060> wire<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.479> then<00:01:35.659> I<00:01:35.689> put<00:01:36.200> an

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
those on to the wire and then I put an

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.859 
those on to the wire and then I put an
outer<00:01:36.859> heat<00:01:37.310> shrink<00:01:37.639> just<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.689> wires

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
outer heat shrink just so the wires

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.080 
outer heat shrink just so the wires
would<00:01:39.049> be<00:01:39.229> separated<00:01:40.189> from<00:01:40.310> each<00:01:40.459> other<00:01:40.609> you

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
would be separated from each other you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.730 
would be separated from each other you
wouldn't<00:01:41.389> be<00:01:41.569> able<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.749> miss<00:01:41.899> or<00:01:42.349> they

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
wouldn't be able to miss or they

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.910 
wouldn't be able to miss or they
wouldn't<00:01:42.979> be<00:01:43.069> touching<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.529> and<00:01:45.529> so<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:45.799> know

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
wouldn't be touching and and so I know

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.330 
wouldn't be touching and and so I know
the<00:01:46.159> polarity<00:01:46.929> so<00:01:47.929> these<00:01:48.169> will<00:01:48.380> be<00:01:48.560> connected

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
the polarity so these will be connected

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.809 
the polarity so these will be connected
to<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:50.229> extruder<00:01:51.229> controller<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.639> red

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
to the extruder controller so the red

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.149 
to the extruder controller so the red
goes<00:01:56.029> in<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.240> negative<00:01:56.599> any<00:01:56.950> yellow<00:01:57.950> which

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
goes in the negative any yellow which

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.949 
goes in the negative any yellow which
Green<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.669> in<00:01:58.819> this<00:01:58.939> case<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.539> yellow<00:01:59.719> goes

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
Green is in this case the yellow goes

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.550 
Green is in this case the yellow goes
into<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.289> positive<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:01.249> heater<00:02:01.489> can<00:02:01.789> now<00:02:01.939> be

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
into the positive the heater can now be

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.670 
into the positive the heater can now be
screwed<00:02:03.560> into<00:02:03.709> the<00:02:03.889> terminals

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.530 

okay<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.899> last<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:13.190> now<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:15.060> heater

the extruder controller the thermocouple
wires<00:02:21.690> are<00:02:21.960> there<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.710> heater<00:02:22.950> wires<00:02:23.130> are

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
wires are there and the heater wires are

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.960 
wires are there and the heater wires are
here<00:02:23.730> attached<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> screw<00:02:25.470> terminals

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
here attached to the screw terminals

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.640 
here attached to the screw terminals
we're<00:02:26.970> not<00:02:27.090> ready<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.480> connect<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.900> stepping

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
we're not ready to connect the stepping

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.710 
we're not ready to connect the stepping
motor<00:02:28.680> driver<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.580> signal<00:02:29.940> wires<00:02:30.180> from<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
motor driver the signal wires from the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.980 
motor driver the signal wires from the
motherboard<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.590> these<00:02:31.920> wires<00:02:32.750> need<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.870> be

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
motherboard but these wires need to be

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.590 
motherboard but these wires need to be
separated<00:02:34.200> from<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.280> higher<00:02:35.580> voltage<00:02:36.450> and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
separated from the higher voltage and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.870 
separated from the higher voltage and
higher<00:02:36.690> current<00:02:37.140> wire<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.670> going<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
higher current wire so it's going to

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.420 
higher current wire so it's going to
have<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.959> can't<00:02:40.410> get<00:02:40.560> any<00:02:40.620> cannot<00:02:41.250> get

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
have to be it can't get any cannot get

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.090 
have to be it can't get any cannot get
close<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.750> these<00:02:42.959> types<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.380> wires<00:02:43.620> here

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
close to like these types of wires here

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.880 
close to like these types of wires here
which<00:02:44.430> come<00:02:44.640> from<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.850> motor<00:02:45.060> which<00:02:45.890> activate

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
which come from the motor which activate

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.979 
which come from the motor which activate
the<00:02:47.010> coils<00:02:47.400> within<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.760> motor<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.420> what<00:02:48.870> I'm

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
the coils within the motor so what I'm

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.140 
the coils within the motor so what I'm
thinking<00:02:49.410> about<00:02:49.440> doing<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:50.070> taking<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.940> wire

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
thinking about doing is taking the wire

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.050 
thinking about doing is taking the wire
and<00:02:51.540> taking<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.650> maybe<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.489> point<00:02:53.820> and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and taking it to maybe this point and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.760 
and taking it to maybe this point and
then<00:02:54.209> it'll<00:02:54.420> go<00:02:54.630> back<00:02:54.930> since<00:02:55.470> there<00:02:55.650> are<00:02:55.739> a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
then it'll go back since there are a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.680 
then it'll go back since there are a
couple<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.130> wires<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.520> need<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.790> taken<00:02:57.510> to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
couple of wires that need to be taken to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.750 
couple of wires that need to be taken to
the<00:02:57.780> motherboard<00:02:58.190> including<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.310> stepping

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
wire or the cable those wires can be

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.180 
wire or the cable those wires can be
bundled<00:03:08.400> up<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.209> be<00:03:09.330> mounted<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:10.010> tied<00:03:11.010> to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
bundled up it can be mounted to tied to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.949 
bundled up it can be mounted to tied to
this<00:03:11.280> location<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.940> then<00:03:12.239> tied<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.630> this

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
location as long as it's a good boat

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.560 
location as long as it's a good boat
should<00:03:16.830> be<00:03:16.890> fine<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.549> then<00:03:17.880> run<00:03:18.120> down<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.360> the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
should be fine and then run down to the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.380 
should be fine and then run down to the
motherboard<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:19.950> side<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.459> now<00:03:21.269> I'm

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
motherboard on this side so now I'm

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.940 
motherboard on this side so now I'm
going<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.600> take<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.019> stepping<00:03:22.560> motor<00:03:22.590> wire

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
going to take the stepping motor wire

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.479 
going to take the stepping motor wire
and<00:03:23.250> use<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.209> Ethernet<00:03:25.019> cable<00:03:25.500> for<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.010> RS

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
and use this Ethernet cable for the RS

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.570 
and use this Ethernet cable for the RS
45<00:03:26.910> 40<00:03:27.690> I'm<00:03:28.470> going<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.709> string<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.070> up<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.430> this

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
45 40 I'm going to string it up to this

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.240 
45 40 I'm going to string it up to this
location<00:03:29.970> here<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.620> won't<00:03:31.830> get<00:03:31.980> caught

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
location here so it won't get caught

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.330 
location here so it won't get caught
with<00:03:32.489> something<00:03:32.820> like<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:34.160> all<00:03:35.160> right

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
with something like this all right

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.990 
with something like this all right
that's<00:03:35.730> good<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.870> won't<00:03:37.049> move<00:03:37.769> at<00:03:37.980> all<00:03:38.070> it

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
that's good this won't move at all it

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.600 
that's good this won't move at all it
won't<00:03:39.299> come<00:03:39.780> loose<00:03:39.989> from<00:03:40.049> these<00:03:40.410> locations

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
won't come loose from these locations

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.520 
won't come loose from these locations
then<00:03:41.610> I'll<00:03:41.760> take<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.360> this<00:03:42.720> location<00:03:43.019> here

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.220 

so<00:03:46.530> if<00:03:46.680> i<00:03:46.860> move<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.400> axis

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:59.050 

this<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.380> going<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.650> be<00:03:52.890> tighter<00:03:53.160> here<00:03:53.900> okay

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.270 

and<00:04:00.060> when<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:00.810> raise<00:04:01.170> this<00:04:01.530> it's<00:04:01.860> going<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.100> need

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
and when I raise this it's going to need

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:10.640 
and when I raise this it's going to need
a<00:04:02.310> little<00:04:02.610> bit<00:04:02.790> more<00:04:03.000> slack<00:04:08.450> okay<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.350> if<00:04:10.530> I

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
a little bit more slack okay so if I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.320 
a little bit more slack okay so if I
have<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:10.830> at<00:04:11.040> this<00:04:11.190> point<00:04:11.460> it<00:04:12.000> looks<00:04:12.060> like

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
have it at this point it looks like

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.390 
have it at this point it looks like
it'll<00:04:12.480> be<00:04:12.600> okay<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:12.900> i<00:04:13.080> can<00:04:13.320> go<00:04:13.470> ahead<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.710> wire

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
it'll be okay so i can go ahead and wire

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:27.770 
it'll be okay so i can go ahead and wire
tie<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.970> this<00:04:15.120> position<00:04:26.000> okay<00:04:27.000> bring<00:04:27.720> it

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
tie it to this position okay bring it

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.870 
tie it to this position okay bring it
down<00:04:33.920> looks<00:04:34.920> like<00:04:35.040> i<00:04:35.100> can<00:04:35.130> use<00:04:35.430> another<00:04:35.670> wire

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
down looks like i can use another wire

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:50.300 
down looks like i can use another wire
tire<00:04:36.180> here<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:49.260> can<00:04:49.380> also<00:04:49.530> consider<00:04:49.860> using<00:04:50.100> a

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
tire here you can also consider using a

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.640 
tire here you can also consider using a
conduit<00:04:50.730> as<00:04:50.970> well<00:04:51.660> as<00:04:51.780> these<00:04:51.930> wire<00:04:52.140> ties<00:04:52.410> to

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
conduit as well as these wire ties to

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:11.280 
conduit as well as these wire ties to
keep<00:04:52.800> these<00:04:52.980> together

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.170 

it<00:05:12.290> still<00:05:12.560> works<00:05:12.800> in<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.040> lower<00:05:13.220> position<00:05:13.790> as

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
it still works in the lower position as

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.760 
it still works in the lower position as
well<00:05:14.420> we'll<00:05:14.930> go<00:05:15.050> ahead<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.230> use<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.530> same

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
well we'll go ahead and use the same

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.050 
well we'll go ahead and use the same
wire<00:05:16.010> tie<00:05:16.250> as<00:05:16.570> we<00:05:17.570> used<00:05:17.750> in<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.080> prior

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
wire tie as we used in the prior

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.240 
wire tie as we used in the prior
stepping<00:05:20.060> motors<00:05:20.620> looks<00:05:21.620> like<00:05:21.800> this<00:05:21.950> will<00:05:22.100> be

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
stepping motors looks like this will be

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.490 
stepping motors looks like this will be
around<00:05:23.110> we'll<00:05:24.110> just<00:05:24.290> plug<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.950> oops<00:05:26.500> we'll

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
around we'll just plug the oops we'll

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.290 
around we'll just plug the oops we'll
plug<00:05:27.740> this<00:05:27.950> into<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.660> 485<00:05:29.830> Jesus<00:05:30.830> here<00:05:31.300> and

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
plug this into the 485 Jesus here and

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.420 
plug this into the 485 Jesus here and
we'll<00:05:32.450> add<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:32.720> character<00:05:33.440> for<00:05:33.650> to<00:05:33.950> the

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
we'll add a character for to the

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.550 
we'll add a character for to the
stepping<00:05:34.850> motor<00:05:34.880> driver<00:05:35.300> okay<00:05:36.200> so<00:05:36.260> I'm

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
stepping motor driver okay so I'm

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.380 
stepping motor driver okay so I'm
putting<00:05:36.860> on<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.430> connector<00:05:38.180> for<00:05:38.360> the

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
putting on the connector for the

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.240 
putting on the connector for the
stepping<00:05:38.750> motor<00:05:38.780> driver<00:05:39.170> the<00:05:39.770> extruder<00:05:40.600> and

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
stepping motor driver the extruder and

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.230 
stepping motor driver the extruder and
then<00:05:43.250> plug<00:05:43.460> it<00:05:43.580> into<00:05:43.700> the<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.570> a-axis<00:05:46.240> still

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
then plug it into the the a-axis still

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.560 
then plug it into the the a-axis still
have<00:05:47.360> a<00:05:47.420> little<00:05:47.510> bit<00:05:47.660> of<00:05:47.720> stock<00:05:47.960> which<00:05:48.140> is<00:05:48.260> good

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
have a little bit of stock which is good

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.650 
have a little bit of stock which is good
so<00:05:50.570> we've<00:05:50.930> put<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.680> extruder<00:05:52.670> stepping<00:05:53.450> motor

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
so we've put the extruder stepping motor

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.830 
so we've put the extruder stepping motor
driver<00:05:54.140> on<00:05:54.470> the<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:54.890> axis<00:05:55.190> we<00:05:55.730> have<00:05:55.760> the<00:05:56.170> for<00:05:57.640> 485

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
driver on the a axis we have the for 485

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.020 
driver on the a axis we have the for 485
rs-485<00:05:59.840> cable<00:06:00.590> plugged<00:06:00.800> in<00:06:00.980> it's<00:06:01.460> routed

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
rs-485 cable plugged in it's routed

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.300 
rs-485 cable plugged in it's routed
through<00:06:02.660> this<00:06:02.900> wire<00:06:03.380> type<00:06:03.710> that<00:06:04.040> will<00:06:04.160> be

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
through this wire type that will be

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.550 
through this wire type that will be
tightened<00:06:04.670> later<00:06:04.820> and<00:06:05.060> then<00:06:05.690> up<00:06:06.110> to<00:06:06.440> this

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
tightened later and then up to this

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.220 
tightened later and then up to this
point<00:06:06.830> here<00:06:07.220> so<00:06:07.730> it'll<00:06:07.880> get<00:06:08.090> given<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.720> slack<00:06:08.990> to

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
point here so it'll get given a slack to

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.970 
point here so it'll get given a slack to
for<00:06:09.800> all<00:06:09.830> of<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:10.250> motion<00:06:10.670> with<00:06:11.390> the<00:06:11.420> machine

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
for all of the motion with the machine

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.310 
for all of the motion with the machine
and<00:06:12.980> going<00:06:13.490> up<00:06:13.700> and<00:06:13.880> down<00:06:13.970> now<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:14.690> stepping

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
and going up and down now the stepping

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.530 
and going up and down now the stepping
motor<00:06:15.350> for<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.340> extruder<00:06:16.760> is<00:06:16.790> wired<00:06:17.270> to<00:06:17.390> the

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
motor for the extruder is wired to the

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.500 
motor for the extruder is wired to the
