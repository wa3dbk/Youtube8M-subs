00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
and we do it all again that's our life

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.940 
and we do it all again that's our life
but<00:02:39.750> when<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.020> look<00:02:40.170> at<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.410> grand<00:02:40.650> scheme<00:02:40.710> of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
but when you look at the grand scheme of

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.820 
but when you look at the grand scheme of
things<00:02:41.780> they're<00:02:42.780> only<00:02:42.960> little<00:02:43.380> for<00:02:43.440> such<00:02:43.800> a

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
things they're only little for such a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.560 
things they're only little for such a
short<00:02:44.130> time<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.520> mean<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.240> hard<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.480> believe

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
short time I mean it's hard to believe

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.760 
short time I mean it's hard to believe
now<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.140> she's<00:02:46.290> almost<00:02:46.470> 15<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:48.030> yeah<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.080> has

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
now that she's almost 15 and yeah it has

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.310 
now that she's almost 15 and yeah it has
hard<00:02:50.040> yards<00:02:50.220> but<00:02:50.660> she's<00:02:51.660> not<00:02:52.080> going<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.230> be

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
hard yards but she's not going to be

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.420 
hard yards but she's not going to be
long<00:02:52.410> before<00:02:52.440> she's<00:02:52.830> gone<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.250> she'll<00:02:53.340> be

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
long before she's gone and she'll be

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.910 
long before she's gone and she'll be
doing<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.700> all<00:02:53.790> herself
