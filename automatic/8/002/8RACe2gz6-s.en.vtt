can see from the blue ball trails is at
the<00:00:38.510> first<00:00:38.720> player<00:00:38.990> whom<00:00:39.230> we<00:00:39.380> have<00:00:39.440> given<00:00:39.710> high

the first player whom we have given high

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.160 
the first player whom we have given high
skill<00:00:40.280> gets<00:00:40.970> the<00:00:41.090> ball<00:00:41.240> relatively<00:00:41.750> close<00:00:41.960> to

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
skill gets the ball relatively close to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.380 
skill gets the ball relatively close to
the<00:00:42.260> target<00:00:42.440> not<00:00:43.040> perfect<00:00:43.550> well<00:00:43.700> obviously<00:00:44.120> as

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
the target not perfect well obviously as

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.880 
the target not perfect well obviously as
this<00:00:44.570> is<00:00:44.750> still<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:44.960> pretty<00:00:45.230> difficult<00:00:45.470> past

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
this is still a pretty difficult past

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.650 
this is still a pretty difficult past
but<00:00:46.430> close<00:00:46.610> enough<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.150> receiver<00:00:47.510> should

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
but close enough of the receiver should

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.870 
but close enough of the receiver should
be<00:00:47.870> able<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.110> get<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.530> bowl<00:00:48.740> the<00:00:49.550> second

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
be able to get to the bowl the second

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.490 
be able to get to the bowl the second
player<00:00:50.030> however<00:00:50.420> has<00:00:50.570> low<00:00:50.810> skill<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.320> you<00:00:51.380> can

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
player however has low skill and you can

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.900 
player however has low skill and you can
see<00:00:51.650> that<00:00:51.680> he<00:00:51.950> is<00:00:51.980> not<00:00:52.250> able<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.580> control<00:00:52.790> the

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
see that he is not able to control the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.640 
see that he is not able to control the
pasta<00:00:53.210> nearly<00:00:53.570> as<00:00:53.660> well<00:00:53.840> this<00:00:54.500> is<00:00:54.620> a

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
pasta nearly as well this is a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.740 
pasta nearly as well this is a
significant<00:00:55.310> change<00:00:55.550> for<00:00:55.760> FIFA<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.450> one<00:00:56.600> that

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
significant change for FIFA and one that

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.150 
significant change for FIFA and one that
we<00:00:56.810> believe<00:00:57.110> will<00:00:57.140> add<00:00:57.410> more<00:00:57.560> depth<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:57.980> the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
we believe will add more depth to the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.620 
we believe will add more depth to the
game<00:00:58.340> but<00:00:58.520> fortunately<00:00:58.970> think<00:00:59.240> more<00:00:59.540> about

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
game but fortunately think more about

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.780 
game but fortunately think more about
how<00:00:59.930> you<00:00:59.960> can<00:01:00.080> build<00:01:00.410> up<00:01:00.590> play<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.400> who<00:01:01.580> you're

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
how you can build up play and who you're

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.660 
how you can build up play and who you're
making<00:01:02.090> passes<00:01:02.480> with<00:01:03.100> I'm<00:01:04.100> now<00:01:04.280> going<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.549> show

by side and you can see that we have two
players<00:01:09.679> one<00:01:10.429> high<00:01:10.670> skill<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.240> one<00:01:11.960> lower

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
players one high skill and one lower

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.069 
players one high skill and one lower
skill<00:01:12.649> both<00:01:13.490> having<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:13.909> same<00:01:13.999> show<00:01:14.450> over<00:01:14.929> and

over aiming for the top left corner the
red<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:17.719> blue<00:01:17.929> boxes<00:01:18.439> indicate<00:01:18.590> where<00:01:19.009> the

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
red and blue boxes indicate where the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.620 
red and blue boxes indicate where the
ball<00:01:19.280> crosses<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.670> goal<00:01:19.909> line<00:01:19.969> and<00:01:20.359> you<00:01:20.509> can

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
ball crosses the goal line and you can

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.849 
ball crosses the goal line and you can
see<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.049> variance<00:01:21.439> of<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.710> high

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:23.770 
see that the variance of the high
skilled<00:01:22.189> player<00:01:22.399> is<00:01:22.579> much<00:01:22.789> lower<00:01:22.999> also<00:01:23.659> the

skilled player is much lower also the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.660 
skilled player is much lower also the
accuracy<00:01:24.319> of<00:01:24.469> the<00:01:24.859> high<00:01:24.979> school<00:01:25.249> players<00:01:25.490> much
