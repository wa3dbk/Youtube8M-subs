you about pruning and Enki anthis in key
anthis<00:00:16.750> is<00:00:17.110> in<00:00:17.320> the<00:00:17.410> category<00:00:18.010> of<00:00:18.130> tree<00:00:18.760> like

the<00:00:28.269> size<00:00:28.509> you<00:00:29.320> get<00:00:29.439> a<00:00:29.470> whole<00:00:29.710> bunch<00:00:29.740> of<00:00:29.980> water

impossible to get rid of shoots that
grow<00:00:36.070> when<00:00:36.940> you<00:00:36.970> prune<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.480> wrong<00:00:37.720> way<00:00:38.050> or<00:00:38.410> too

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
grow when you prune the wrong way or too

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.210 
grow when you prune the wrong way or too
much<00:00:39.130> you<00:00:39.970> can<00:00:40.330> open<00:00:40.840> up<00:00:40.990> your<00:00:41.050> Anki<00:00:41.560> anthis<00:00:41.980> so

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
much you can open up your Anki anthis so

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.850 
much you can open up your Anki anthis so
that<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.460> has<00:00:42.610> kind<00:00:42.880> of<00:00:43.030> layers<00:00:43.360> like<00:00:44.290> this<00:00:44.590> one

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
that it has kind of layers like this one

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.820 
that it has kind of layers like this one
you<00:00:45.790> have<00:00:45.880> to<00:00:45.940> be<00:00:46.060> careful<00:00:46.480> that<00:00:46.600> you<00:00:46.660> don't

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
you have to be careful that you don't

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.800 
you have to be careful that you don't
thin<00:00:47.830> out<00:00:48.010> too<00:00:48.340> much<00:00:48.520> because<00:00:49.150> you<00:00:49.420> will<00:00:49.540> also

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
thin out too much because you will also

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.440 
thin out too much because you will also
get<00:00:50.260> those<00:00:50.530> straight<00:00:50.740> skinny<00:00:51.130> shoots<00:00:51.610> if<00:00:51.910> you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
get those straight skinny shoots if you

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.590 
get those straight skinny shoots if you
are<00:00:52.660> over<00:00:53.080> prune<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.640> if<00:00:54.820> you<00:00:54.940> have<00:00:55.270> those

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
are over prune and if you have those

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.800 
are over prune and if you have those
straight<00:00:56.020> skinny<00:00:56.410> shoots<00:00:56.940> leave<00:00:57.940> them<00:00:58.360> alone

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
straight skinny shoots leave them alone

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.320 
straight skinny shoots leave them alone
that's<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.890> way<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.160> plant<00:01:00.460> increases<00:01:01.180> in

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
that's the way the plant increases in

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.710 
that's the way the plant increases in
size<00:01:01.630> and<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.710> straight<00:01:03.160> skinny<00:01:03.520> shoot<00:01:04.030> will

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
size and that straight skinny shoot will

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.840 
size and that straight skinny shoot will
eventually<00:01:05.290> put<00:01:05.500> on<00:01:05.590> side<00:01:05.950> branches<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.670> turn

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
eventually put on side branches and turn

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.450 
eventually put on side branches and turn
into<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.150> pretty<00:01:07.450> branch<00:01:07.840> if<00:01:08.290> you<00:01:08.860> see<00:01:09.220> those

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
into a pretty branch if you see those

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.880 
into a pretty branch if you see those
skinny<00:01:09.939> water<00:01:10.210> sprouts<00:01:10.689> that<00:01:11.140> means<00:01:11.740> you've

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
skinny water sprouts that means you've

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.219 
skinny water sprouts that means you've
done<00:01:12.100> too<00:01:12.340> much<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.939> you<00:01:13.359> need<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.689> do<00:01:13.840> less

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
done too much and you need to do less

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.270 
done too much and you need to do less
not<00:01:15.159> more<00:01:15.189> in<00:01:15.939> the<00:01:16.240> future<00:01:16.829> maybe<00:01:17.829> you<00:01:18.039> want<00:01:18.219> to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
not more in the future maybe you want to

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.499 
not more in the future maybe you want to
narrow<00:01:18.579> down<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.939> number<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.780> water<00:01:20.079> sprouts

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
narrow down the number of water sprouts

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.090 
narrow down the number of water sprouts
you<00:01:22.509> can<00:01:22.659> say<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:22.899> can<00:01:23.140> say<00:01:23.409> you<00:01:23.469> can<00:01:23.710> take<00:01:23.890> off

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
you can say I can say you can take off

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.359 
you can say I can say you can take off
about<00:01:24.249> a<00:01:24.670> sixteenth<00:01:25.390> of<00:01:25.719> the<00:01:26.020> foliage<00:01:26.439> using

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
about a sixteenth of the foliage using

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.510 
about a sixteenth of the foliage using
true<00:01:27.670> thinning<00:01:28.149> cuts<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:29.710> means<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.219> prune

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
true thinning cuts which means you prune

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.789 
true thinning cuts which means you prune
something<00:01:30.999> back<00:01:33.149> to<00:01:34.149> a<00:01:34.179> side<00:01:34.509> branch<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.679> if

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
something back to a side branch so if

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.980 
something back to a side branch so if
you<00:01:35.920> took<00:01:36.100> this<00:01:36.399> one<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.950> was<00:01:39.100> too<00:01:39.340> clogged

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
you took this one and it was too clogged

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.230 
you took this one and it was too clogged
you<00:01:40.990> would<00:01:41.170> locate<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:42.310> Brent<00:01:42.579> your<00:01:42.759> target

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
you would locate the Brent your target

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.129 
you would locate the Brent your target
branch<00:01:43.569> and<00:01:44.109> you<00:01:44.710> follow<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.249> down<00:01:46.210> someplace

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:47.139 
branch and you follow it down someplace

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.349 
branch and you follow it down someplace
inside<00:01:47.439> to<00:01:48.039> where<00:01:48.219> it<00:01:48.340> meets<00:01:48.520> up<00:01:48.759> with<00:01:48.969> a<00:01:48.999> side

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
inside to where it meets up with a side

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.969 
inside to where it meets up with a side
branch<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.670> could<00:01:52.389> conceivably<00:01:52.840> cut<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.530> here

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
branch I could conceivably cut it here

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.779 
branch I could conceivably cut it here
and<00:01:54.359> now<00:01:55.359> it's<00:01:55.569> shorter<00:01:56.079> or<00:01:56.289> if<00:01:57.249> I<00:01:57.340> wanted<00:01:57.729> to

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
and now it's shorter or if I wanted to

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.779 
and now it's shorter or if I wanted to
thin<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.149> out<00:01:58.389> I<00:01:58.899> would<00:01:59.259> follow<00:01:59.829> it<00:02:00.100> clear<00:02:00.520> back

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
thin it out I would follow it clear back

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.819 
thin it out I would follow it clear back
to<00:02:01.060> where<00:02:01.209> it<00:02:01.329> met<00:02:01.539> up<00:02:01.659> with<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.840> bigger<00:02:02.409> branch

to where it met up with a bigger branch

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.760 
to where it met up with a bigger branch
and<00:02:03.450> cut<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:04.569> out<00:02:04.689> there<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:05.350> now<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:05.619> can

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
and cut it out there and now you can

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.520 
and cut it out there and now you can
kind<00:02:06.249> of<00:02:06.340> see<00:02:06.579> through<00:02:06.819> it<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.299> want<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.289> spend

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
kind of see through it you want to spend

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.160 
kind of see through it you want to spend
most<00:02:08.770> of<00:02:09.009> your<00:02:09.100> pruning<00:02:09.459> budget<00:02:10.060> cleaning<00:02:10.990> out
