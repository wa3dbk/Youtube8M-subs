00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.309
 we have a package from asus here 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.700
 get into the test lab we know in there 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.870
 The roc raida ssds is not a normal one 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.460
 is therefore also particularly 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.330
 exciting we make a small extra 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.820
 unboxing video because it is 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.170
 doing something similar to a pci express ssd 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:30.359
 like the us asset revo drives 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.690
 ssd on a pci express card and that 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.540
 is the good piece you see so directly 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.410
 made for speed demon 240 gb the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.020
 software damn it is not 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.340
 war tool obviously arctic that is 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 something like a ssd caching for you 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.570
 raider can also use kaspersky well 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.600
 Everyone has to know about anti-virus 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.989
 Crystal is a well known one of us 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.220
 seldom used benchmark and dual mode 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.250
 or domo tribut we'll see here 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.250
 purely 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.970
 you do not see much there 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.939
 and that's the good thing again 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.640
 boundaries of the packaging so a pci 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:30.979
 express x4 card the way it looks or 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.520
 x2 x2 in asus republic of gamers 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.439
 branding to take Let's just here 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.399
 I hope they are send out 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:46.869
 interventions so raider is on it looks 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.009
 that also lights up the rear 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.060
 metal sign so you can not see 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.159
 that, for he has built there now 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.659
 a small switch port switch or 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:05.479
 led and that you already see it in here 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.709
 You can see what we are good at 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.319
 I can read it before I read it 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:12.620
 toshiba so the flash memory 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:17.060
 confrontational and a relatively large one 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.310
 heat sink of the two flash 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.030
 controller and probably used 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.850
 bridge chip face down and look 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.370
 look closer now 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.140
 more about asus rog raider express ssd 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.120
 there is then in the test and in the associated 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.420
 test video which of course synonymous with pc 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.420
 decide
