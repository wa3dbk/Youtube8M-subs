 the new video and today I'm with a new 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.109
 teaser that 10% of the world has already passed in. 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.480
 not interesting or exaggerated but the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.670
 People know that they do not sleep in the afternoon. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.619
 I totally owe it but I already cut it 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.640
 suspiciously went straight right scott 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.520
 environment 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 so I the man who shines I 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.820
 just loved the brightness 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.270
 light and move a little 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.420
 contrast and there are even those who say 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.309
 it's only because it started because 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.629
 was that I think it's quite possible to 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.940
 they do not have to do all this for the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.539
 unavoidable does not like to lose a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:03.050
 in Galicia which said that 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.050
 treats 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:12.190
 It's still good, right? 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:15.190
 this is not atypical for sure 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:20.110

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:52.930
 that we can use his type like that 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:58.710
 The site is either no one but me 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.710
 because we can use the boni 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.459
 so raised yesterday personal account 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.069
 I know that the son's car now a 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.670
 part of the plan 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:29.159
 with whom you will speak of this combination 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.159
 of milan pressure was good 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.910
 we can see that it is something for free or 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.910
 prescribed 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.440
 this is the same 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.830
 ah 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:07.140

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.120
 fred and what happens when he plays 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.159
 Your a myth will be much more than 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.599
 that is what discovered his 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.640
 interest here you will vote against the 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.090
 Golden set with no one but the goal 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.190
 and fred with other fantasies and I do not 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.900

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.010

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.859
 even if I liked it because there were people 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.540
 It gets a lot then my assessment. 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.959
 opinion this is the beginning of a take as 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.829
 his coach he is not ethical and is not 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.829
 it's not the fever that 's the fat these two 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:56.190
 Heaven, it's fed, it's over. 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.680

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.170
