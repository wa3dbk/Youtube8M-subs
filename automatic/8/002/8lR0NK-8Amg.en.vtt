00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
his life I've seen things on the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.200 
his life I've seen things on the
television<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.489> best<00:00:41.670> thing<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.120> if

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
television but the best thing to do if

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.119 
television but the best thing to do if
you're<00:00:42.360> attacked<00:00:42.600> by<00:00:42.719> animals<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.680> predatory

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you're attacked by animals or predatory

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.580 
you're attacked by animals or predatory
animals<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.550> stay<00:00:44.760> still<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> play<00:00:45.809> dead<00:00:48.590> so

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
animals to stay still and play dead so

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.770 
animals to stay still and play dead so
that's<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> did<00:00:49.950> Troy<00:00:50.730> stays<00:00:51.090> tools<00:00:51.420> comes

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that's what I did Troy stays tools comes

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
that's what I did Troy stays tools comes
collected<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.590> food<00:00:52.829> because<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.309> knew<00:00:53.399> won't

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
collected as I food because I knew won't

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.279 
collected as I food because I knew won't
be<00:00:53.730> able<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.940> move<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:55.110> they're

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
be able to move into it because they're

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.979 
be able to move into it because they're
laying<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.800> me<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.100> 18<00:00:56.510> holding<00:00:57.510> my<00:00:57.570> shoulder

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
laying on me and 18 holding my shoulder

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.170 
laying on me and 18 holding my shoulder
so<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.859> hopefully<00:00:59.309> would<00:00:59.640> lose<00:00:59.789> interest

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
so they hopefully would lose interest

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.260 
so they hopefully would lose interest

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.390 

it's<00:01:11.900> a<00:01:11.990> tactic<00:01:12.410> that<00:01:12.440> seems<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:13.070> us<00:01:13.160> eight

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.940 

when<00:01:41.979> fighting<00:01:42.280> back<00:01:42.640> failed<00:01:42.969> he<00:01:43.600> froze<00:01:43.950> at

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.640 

the<00:01:55.820> same<00:01:56.090> tactic<00:01:56.510> had<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.840> same<00:01:57.050> effect<00:01:57.440> of

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
the same tactic had the same effect of

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.850 
the same tactic had the same effect of
the<00:01:57.770> zoo<00:01:57.950> lions<00:01:58.370> as<00:01:58.610> Bob<00:01:59.420> froze<00:01:59.750> they<00:02:00.500> became

the zoo lions as Bob froze they became

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.300 
the zoo lions as Bob froze they became
less<00:02:01.250> aggressive<00:02:01.790> that<00:02:02.390> sometimes<00:02:03.350> but<00:02:03.979> and

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
less aggressive that sometimes but and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.430 
less aggressive that sometimes but and
you're<00:02:04.820> not<00:02:05.030> moving<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.780> much<00:02:05.930> their

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
you're not moving that much their

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.800 
you're not moving that much their
recommended<00:02:08.890> interesting

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.960 

the<00:02:16.440> Lions<00:02:16.739> weren't<00:02:16.950> experience<00:02:17.489> in<00:02:17.640> actually

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
the Lions weren't experience in actually

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.339 
the Lions weren't experience in actually
bringing<00:02:18.239> something<00:02:18.660> that's<00:02:18.930> probably<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
bringing something that's probably the

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.920 
bringing something that's probably the
first<00:02:19.560> time<00:02:19.770> they<00:02:19.950> brought<00:02:20.400> something<00:02:20.819> down

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
first time they brought something down

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
first time they brought something down
Peleg<00:02:22.709> would<00:02:22.980> probably<00:02:23.459> have<00:02:23.640> killed<00:02:23.909> him<00:02:24.120> I

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
Peleg would probably have killed him I

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.130 
Peleg would probably have killed him I
think<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.040> had<00:02:26.159> probably<00:02:26.579> been<00:02:26.700> dead<00:02:26.959> now<00:02:27.959> hit

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
think it had probably been dead now hit

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.869 
think it had probably been dead now hit
a<00:02:28.170> problem<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.650> debt<00:02:28.829> because<00:02:29.549> it<00:02:29.730> triggers

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
a problem in debt because it triggers

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.500 
a problem in debt because it triggers
more<00:02:30.180> switches<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:31.200> they<00:02:31.980> just<00:02:32.159> keep<00:02:32.310> going

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.929 

it's<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.170> little<00:02:36.290> bit<00:02:36.439> like<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.890> snake<00:02:37.159> grabbing

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
it's a little bit like a snake grabbing

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.970 
it's a little bit like a snake grabbing
a<00:02:38.030> mouse<00:02:38.209> they<00:02:39.049> wrap<00:02:39.260> around<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.829> more

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
a mouse they wrap around and the more

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.440 
a mouse they wrap around and the more
movement<00:02:40.579> you<00:02:40.730> get<00:02:40.939> from<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.239> mouse<00:02:41.420> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
movement you get from the mouse the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.170 
movement you get from the mouse the
tighter<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.170> snake<00:02:42.439> gets<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:43.069> I<00:02:43.670> think<00:02:43.879> you

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
tighter the snake gets and I think you

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.970 
tighter the snake gets and I think you
know<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.450> less<00:02:44.599> movement<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:45.110> have<00:02:45.170> with<00:02:45.950> a

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
know the less movement you have with a

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.580 
know the less movement you have with a
line<00:02:46.099> when<00:02:46.459> you're<00:02:46.549> doing<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.849> is<00:02:47.379> help<00:02:48.379> them

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
line when you're doing that is help them

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.020 
line when you're doing that is help them
stay<00:02:49.220> alive

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030
