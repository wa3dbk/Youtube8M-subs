okay<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.550> tutorial<00:00:02.970> on<00:00:03.389> how<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.600> create

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
okay this is a tutorial on how to create

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.170 
okay this is a tutorial on how to create
a<00:00:04.140> la<00:00:04.650> Villette<00:00:05.069> farm<00:00:05.430> like<00:00:05.790> they<00:00:05.940> want<00:00:06.120> to

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
a la Villette farm like they want to

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.360 
a la Villette farm like they want to
have<00:00:06.299> over<00:00:06.540> there<00:00:06.830> as<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.950> can<00:00:07.980> see<00:00:08.069> the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
have over there as you can see the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.240 
have over there as you can see the
ceiling<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.330> completely<00:00:09.780> made<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.230> glass<00:00:10.889> and

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
ceiling is completely made of glass and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.810 
ceiling is completely made of glass and
then<00:00:12.090> two<00:00:13.080> buckets<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.620> lava<00:00:13.799> actually<00:00:14.519> three

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
then two buckets of lava actually three

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.700 
then two buckets of lava actually three
I<00:00:15.000> miscalculated<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.049> length<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.470> had<00:00:16.590> to

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
I miscalculated the length that I had to

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.189 
I miscalculated the length that I had to
add<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> little<00:00:17.130> bit<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.369> there<00:00:17.779> cover<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
add a little bit on there cover the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.429 
add a little bit on there cover the
entire<00:00:19.650> thing<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.310> lava<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.930> way<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> did

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
entire thing with lava and the way I did

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.710 
entire thing with lava and the way I did
it<00:00:22.560> as<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.830> made<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> structure<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.210> out

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
it as I made a structure like this out

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.220 
it as I made a structure like this out
of<00:00:24.960> wood<00:00:25.580> now<00:00:26.580> if<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.090> don't<00:00:27.330> use<00:00:27.539> wood<00:00:27.869> you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
of wood now if you don't use wood you

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.529 
of wood now if you don't use wood you
run<00:00:28.349> into<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> problem<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:29.269> it's<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> lava

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
run into a problem because it's the lava

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.569 
run into a problem because it's the lava
flows<00:00:30.840> off<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> edge<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:32.130> only<00:00:32.279> goes<00:00:32.550> through

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
flows off the edge it only goes through

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.910 
flows off the edge it only goes through
spaces<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.630> goes<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:33.930> two<00:00:34.260> three<00:00:34.649> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
spaces so it goes one two three and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.060 
spaces so it goes one two three and
stops<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.630> entire<00:00:36.989> center<00:00:37.530> area<00:00:37.829> will

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
stops and this entire center area will

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.130 
stops and this entire center area will
have<00:00:38.219> no<00:00:38.340> lava<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.660> will<00:00:39.840> not<00:00:39.989> be

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
have no lava and that will not be

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.760 
have no lava and that will not be
conducive<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.800> growing<00:00:41.010> your<00:00:41.160> crops<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:43.260> what

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
conducive to growing your crops so what

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.060 
conducive to growing your crops so what
you<00:00:43.920> want<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:45.680> is<00:00:46.789> build<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.969> platform

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
you want to do is build a platform

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.880 
you want to do is build a platform
starting<00:00:50.070> from<00:00:50.340> two<00:00:50.670> spaces<00:00:50.969> from<00:00:51.360> either<00:00:51.510> end

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
starting from two spaces from either end

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.389 
starting from two spaces from either end
right<00:00:52.890> there<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:54.530> go<00:00:55.530> three<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.160> one

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
right there and go three and then one

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
right there and go three and then one
and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:56.789> three<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.750> reason<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.140> want<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and then three the reason you want to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.279 
and then three the reason you want to
have<00:00:58.500> two<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.949> these<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.989> besides<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> fact

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
have two of these here besides the fact

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.330 
have two of these here besides the fact
that<00:01:01.410> you're<00:01:01.590> gonna<00:01:01.649> make<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.190> way

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that you're gonna make it that way

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.750 
that you're gonna make it that way
anyway<00:01:02.730> that's<00:01:02.969> much<00:01:03.809> easier<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.260> create<00:01:04.760> is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
anyway that's much easier to create is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.170 
anyway that's much easier to create is
as<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.780> lava<00:01:07.020> flows<00:01:07.320> down<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:08.520> could<00:01:08.909> burn

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
as the lava flows down it could burn

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.149 
as the lava flows down it could burn
through<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> wood<00:01:10.260> before<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.860> has<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> chance

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
through the wood before it has a chance

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.330 
through the wood before it has a chance
to<00:01:11.760> pour<00:01:12.450> over<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.750> edge<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.220> won't

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to pour over the edge and then it won't

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700 
to pour over the edge and then it won't
reach<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.850> end<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.290> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:16.619> sure

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
reach the end so you want to make sure

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.830 
reach the end so you want to make sure
there's<00:01:16.920> two<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.310> each<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.640> those<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
there's two on each of those and in the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.380 
there's two on each of those and in the
center<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.850> want<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.090> sure<00:01:21.119> that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
center you want to make sure that

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
center you want to make sure that
there's<00:01:21.600> an<00:01:21.750> extra<00:01:22.170> line<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.070> way<00:01:23.159> down

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
there's an extra line all the way down

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.420 
there's an extra line all the way down
the<00:01:23.490> middle<00:01:24.439> otherwise<00:01:25.439> I've<00:01:25.799> noticed<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the middle otherwise I've noticed that

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.910 
the middle otherwise I've noticed that
when<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.939> gets<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.479> corner<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.439> any<00:01:28.770> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
when it gets to this corner or any of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.810 
when it gets to this corner or any of
the<00:01:29.009> corners<00:01:29.509> it'll<00:01:30.829> actually<00:01:31.829> burn<00:01:32.400> through

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the corners it'll actually burn through

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
the corners it'll actually burn through
and<00:01:33.320> only<00:01:34.320> come<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.840> instead

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and only come out to about here instead

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.120 
and only come out to about here instead
of<00:01:36.930> reaching<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.380> corner<00:01:37.740> where<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.950> want

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
of reaching this corner where you want

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.179 
of reaching this corner where you want
it<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:39.409> then<00:01:40.409> after<00:01:40.650> you've<00:01:40.770> built<00:01:40.920> those

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
it to be then after you've built those

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.300 
it to be then after you've built those
platforms

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.400 

then<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.550> built<00:01:46.790> these<00:01:47.030> triangles<00:01:47.660> basic

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
then you built these triangles basic

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.110 
then you built these triangles basic
staircases<00:01:48.920> up<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:49.400> down<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:49.760> up<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:49.910> down

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
staircases up and down and up and down

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.420 
staircases up and down and up and down
you<00:01:50.990> could<00:01:51.170> just<00:01:51.380> do<00:01:51.530> one<00:01:51.770> if<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.010> wanted<00:01:52.280> to

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
you could just do one if you wanted to

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.800 
you could just do one if you wanted to
it'd<00:01:52.550> be<00:01:52.640> really<00:01:52.790> high<00:01:53.030> but<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.390> only<00:01:53.480> been<00:01:53.690> one

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
it'd be really high but it only been one

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.720 
it'd be really high but it only been one
bucket<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.230> lava<00:01:54.350> or<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:55.130> could<00:01:55.280> do<00:01:55.370> several

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
bucket of lava or you could do several

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.550 
bucket of lava or you could do several
of<00:01:55.940> them<00:01:56.180> based<00:01:56.630> on<00:01:56.780> how<00:01:56.840> many<00:01:57.140> buckets<00:01:57.290> of

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
of them based on how many buckets of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.650 
of them based on how many buckets of
lava<00:01:57.650> you<00:01:57.800> want<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.160> actually<00:01:58.310> use<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:59.000> like<00:01:59.540> to

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
lava you want to actually use I like to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.360 
lava you want to actually use I like to
use<00:01:59.780> two<00:02:00.020> because<00:02:00.440> then<00:02:00.590> it's<00:02:00.770> not<00:02:00.920> too<00:02:01.160> high

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
use two because then it's not too high

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.900 
use two because then it's not too high
and<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.760> doesn't<00:02:02.060> look<00:02:02.180> too<00:02:02.780> ridiculous<00:02:03.910> and

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
and it doesn't look too ridiculous and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.400 
and it doesn't look too ridiculous and
it<00:02:05.180> also<00:02:05.330> doesn't<00:02:05.600> need<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:05.990> much<00:02:06.170> work<00:02:06.380> for

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
it also doesn't need that much work for

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.520 
it also doesn't need that much work for
hall<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.250> lava<00:02:07.430> all<00:02:07.670> over<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.970> place<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:09.410> then

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
hall and lava all over the place so then

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.530 
hall and lava all over the place so then
once<00:02:09.710> you<00:02:09.830> have<00:02:10.040> this<00:02:10.220> thing<00:02:10.429> built<00:02:10.640> let<00:02:11.480> me

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
once you have this thing built let me

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.420 
once you have this thing built let me
get<00:02:11.720> rid<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:11.990> real<00:02:12.200> quick

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.199 

pretty<00:02:16.430> simple<00:02:17.300> process<00:02:17.990> of<00:02:21.820> going<00:02:22.820> up<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
pretty simple process of going up to the

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:31.449 
pretty simple process of going up to the
top<00:02:25.060> drop<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.270> bucket<00:02:26.300> lava

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.949 

oops<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.359> lost<00:02:33.260> both<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:34.010> these<00:02:34.189> and<00:02:35.090> then

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
oops I lost both of these and then

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.899 
oops I lost both of these and then
jumping<00:02:36.469> down<00:02:36.590> before<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.129> burnt<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:37.790> to

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
jumping down before it burnt you to

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.349 
jumping down before it burnt you to
death<00:02:39.310> then<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.340> get<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.670> watch<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:41.150> lava

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
death then you get to watch the lava

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.319 
death then you get to watch the lava
flow<00:02:41.689> I<00:02:42.159> love<00:02:43.159> love<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.519> play<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.819> love<00:02:44.030> all<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
flow I love love I play of love all the

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.300 
flow I love love I play of love all the
time<00:02:44.540> which<00:02:45.439> is<00:02:45.560> why<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.709> always<00:02:45.890> have<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.069> bucket

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
time which is why I always have a bucket

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.140 
time which is why I always have a bucket
of<00:02:46.400> water<00:02:46.549> handy<00:02:48.909> and<00:02:49.909> as<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.150> can<00:02:50.269> see<00:02:52.150> it's

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
of water handy and as you can see it's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.970 
of water handy and as you can see it's
not<00:02:53.299> going<00:02:53.599> down<00:02:53.719> the<00:02:53.870> middle<00:02:53.959> yet<00:02:54.319> because<00:02:54.889> it

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
not going down the middle yet because it

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.280 
not going down the middle yet because it
has<00:02:55.099> to<00:02:55.219> actually<00:02:55.280> burn<00:02:55.639> through<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:56.030> wood

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
has to actually burn through the wood

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.520 
has to actually burn through the wood
but<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.439> will

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.400 

and<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.580> is<00:03:04.730> what<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.060> farm<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:06.020> structured

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
and this is what the farm is structured

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.230 
and this is what the farm is structured
like<00:03:06.440> underneath<00:03:08.590> see<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:10.820> can<00:03:10.940> see<00:03:11.120> it

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
like underneath see you can see it

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.480 
like underneath see you can see it
starting<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.110> come<00:03:12.170> through<00:03:12.560> now<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:15.490> each

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
starting to come through now and each

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:25.470 
starting to come through now and each
one<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.730> these<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.380> put<00:03:18.530> water<00:03:18.710> in<00:03:19.360> like<00:03:20.360> so

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.440 

and<00:03:25.569> what<00:03:26.230> how<00:03:26.800> it<00:03:26.950> works<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.640> because<00:03:28.060> this

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
and what how it works is because this

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.080 
and what how it works is because this
water<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:29.379> this<00:03:29.860> swear<00:03:30.370> lava<00:03:30.580> right<00:03:30.879> or

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
water this this swear lava right or

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.400 
water this this swear lava right or
washer<00:03:31.450> right<00:03:31.629> here<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.610> at<00:03:33.610> level<00:03:34.060> with<00:03:34.269> or

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
washer right here is at level with or

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.250 
washer right here is at level with or
this<00:03:35.980> square<00:03:36.819> for<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.150> matter<00:03:37.330> is<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.080> level

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
this square for that matter is it level

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.500 
this square for that matter is it level
with<00:03:38.500> these<00:03:38.769> so<00:03:39.580> these<00:03:39.760> are<00:03:39.819> considered

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
with these so these are considered

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.350 
with these so these are considered
watered<00:03:40.930> now<00:03:41.920> this<00:03:42.190> will<00:03:42.519> extend<00:03:42.880> for

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
watered now this will extend for

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.740 
watered now this will extend for
diagonal<00:03:43.900> squares<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.860> this<00:03:45.010> point<00:03:45.250> here<00:03:45.750> so

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
diagonal squares to this point here so

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.900 
diagonal squares to this point here so
you<00:03:46.810> start<00:03:47.260> from<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.560> edge<00:03:47.849> wherever<00:03:48.849> you

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
you start from the edge wherever you

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.009 
you start from the edge wherever you
want<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.120> edge<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.420> be<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.630> can<00:03:49.780> have<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:49.989> here

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
want the edge to be you can have it here

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.479 
want the edge to be you can have it here
I<00:03:50.319> like<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.590> have<00:03:50.800> it<00:03:50.920> here<00:03:51.160> there's<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.370> little

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
I like to have it here there's a little

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.190 
I like to have it here there's a little
bit<00:03:51.580> more<00:03:51.790> light<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.180> way<00:03:52.330> I<00:03:52.360> think<00:03:53.430> it's<00:03:54.430> a

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
bit more light that way I think it's a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.000 
bit more light that way I think it's a
not<00:03:56.200> out<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.500> row<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.799> nine<00:03:57.069> cubes<00:03:58.030> long<00:03:59.010> when

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
not out the row is nine cubes long when

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.949 
not out the row is nine cubes long when
you<00:04:00.099> wanna<00:04:00.250> have<00:04:00.370> two<00:04:00.519> rows<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.120> then<00:04:01.840> the

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
you wanna have two rows and then the

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.330 
you wanna have two rows and then the
third<00:04:02.230> row<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.680> where<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:02.950> have<00:04:03.130> the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
third row is where you have the

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.970 
third row is where you have the
waterfall<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.780> then<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.049> have<00:04:05.140> two<00:04:05.290> rows<00:04:05.530> and

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
waterfall and then you have two rows and

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.920 
waterfall and then you have two rows and
then<00:04:06.730> two<00:04:06.940> more<00:04:07.150> rows<00:04:07.420> because<00:04:07.630> this

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
then two more rows because this

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.729 
then two more rows because this
waterfall<00:04:08.380> will<00:04:08.560> power<00:04:08.739> these<00:04:09.400> two<00:04:09.670> rows<00:04:10.739> it's

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
waterfall will power these two rows it's

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.379 
waterfall will power these two rows it's
pretty<00:04:11.950> simple<00:04:12.340> design<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:14.739> see<00:04:15.389> the

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
pretty simple design and you see the

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.039 
pretty simple design and you see the
lava<00:04:16.570> has<00:04:16.780> now<00:04:16.900> covered<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.290> entire<00:04:17.440> surface

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
lava has now covered the entire surface

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.440 
lava has now covered the entire surface
even<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.169> tops<00:04:20.410> of<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:21.639> glass<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:21.940> sticks

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
even the tops of the glass that sticks

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.980 
even the tops of the glass that sticks
up<00:04:26.070> so<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.280> design<00:04:27.550> is<00:04:27.580> pretty<00:04:27.790> simple<00:04:28.030> and

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
up so the design is pretty simple and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.770 
up so the design is pretty simple and
then<00:04:29.979> just<00:04:30.280> make<00:04:30.430> another<00:04:30.729> row<00:04:33.750> like<00:04:34.750> that

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
then just make another row like that

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.740 
then just make another row like that
four<00:04:35.229> on<00:04:35.350> each<00:04:35.440> into<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.889> water<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:37.570> like

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
four on each into the water and I like

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.820 
four on each into the water and I like
to<00:04:37.870> have<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.050> space<00:04:38.320> between<00:04:38.530> each<00:04:38.740> of<00:04:38.800> these

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
to have a space between each of these

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.590 
to have a space between each of these
waterfall<00:04:41.830> sections<00:04:42.250> so<00:04:43.060> that<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.270> can<00:04:43.450> go

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
waterfall sections so that you can go

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.840 
waterfall sections so that you can go
through<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.930> rows<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.289> way<00:04:44.610> instead<00:04:45.610> of

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
through the rows this way instead of

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.490 
through the rows this way instead of
having<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.150> walk<00:04:46.270> all<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.900> way<00:04:46.930> down<00:04:47.260> to<00:04:47.410> the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
having to walk all the way down to the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.909 
having to walk all the way down to the
end<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.800> your<00:04:47.919> farm<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:49.570> get<00:04:49.690> out<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:50.620> can<00:04:50.770> just

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
end of your farm to get out you can just

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.000 
end of your farm to get out you can just
go<00:04:51.070> through<00:04:51.810> any<00:04:52.810> of<00:04:52.930> these<00:04:54.510> passages<00:04:55.950> just<00:04:56.950> a

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
go through any of these passages just a

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.940 
go through any of these passages just a
little<00:04:57.190> bit<00:04:57.280> more<00:04:57.370> convenient<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.740> that's

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
little bit more convenient and that's

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.360 
little bit more convenient and that's
about<00:05:00.070> it

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
about it

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.450 
about it
it's<00:05:00.669> a<00:05:00.850> not<00:05:01.539> too<00:05:01.690> complicated<00:05:02.020> just<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:03.310> little

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
it's a not too complicated just a little

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.600 
it's a not too complicated just a little
bit<00:05:03.550> of<00:05:03.639> work<00:05:03.789> you<00:05:04.060> have<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.300> clear<00:05:04.510> your<00:05:04.539> space

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
bit of work you have to clear your space

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.730 
bit of work you have to clear your space
putting<00:05:06.610> all<00:05:06.789> the<00:05:06.910> glass<00:05:07.120> up<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.630> tend<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.560> just

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
putting all the glass up I tend to just

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.890 
putting all the glass up I tend to just
put<00:05:08.919> all<00:05:08.950> the<00:05:09.130> glass<00:05:09.310> up<00:05:09.550> balls<00:05:09.760> in<00:05:10.360> a<00:05:10.479> row<00:05:10.510> and

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
put all the glass up balls in a row and

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.270 
put all the glass up balls in a row and
then<00:05:11.889> after<00:05:12.280> I've<00:05:12.840> laid<00:05:13.840> out<00:05:13.870> my<00:05:14.229> area<00:05:14.560> then

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
then after I've laid out my area then

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.740 
then after I've laid out my area then
I'll<00:05:15.430> go<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.729> measure<00:05:15.910> out<00:05:16.210> where<00:05:16.419> to<00:05:16.539> put

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
I'll go and measure out where to put

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.860 
I'll go and measure out where to put
these<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:18.430> you<00:05:18.520> just<00:05:18.760> knock<00:05:19.300> out<00:05:19.479> the<00:05:19.630> glass

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
these and you just knock out the glass

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.400 
these and you just knock out the glass
and<00:05:20.139> then<00:05:20.229> put<00:05:20.410> a<00:05:20.440> glass<00:05:20.650> on<00:05:20.860> top<00:05:21.070> and<00:05:22.260> you<00:05:23.260> want

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
and then put a glass on top and you want

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.620 
and then put a glass on top and you want
to<00:05:23.470> have<00:05:23.530> a<00:05:23.590> hole<00:05:23.860> underneath<00:05:24.400> for<00:05:25.090> that<00:05:25.210> water

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
to have a hole underneath for that water

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.200 
to have a hole underneath for that water
to<00:05:25.750> pour<00:05:25.990> into<00:05:26.169> like<00:05:26.950> this<00:05:27.130> here<00:05:27.400> otherwise

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
to pour into like this here otherwise

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.270 
to pour into like this here otherwise
the<00:05:28.900> water<00:05:29.080> is<00:05:29.200> just<00:05:29.349> poor<00:05:29.560> everywhere<00:05:30.010> you

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
the water is just poor everywhere you

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.450 
the water is just poor everywhere you
don't<00:05:30.460> want<00:05:30.610> that<00:05:31.020> and<00:05:32.020> it's<00:05:32.710> much<00:05:32.889> easier<00:05:32.919> to

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
don't want that and it's much easier to

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.899 
don't want that and it's much easier to
harvest<00:05:34.150> your<00:05:34.419> crops<00:05:34.479> this<00:05:34.900> way<00:05:35.729> so<00:05:36.729> that's

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
harvest your crops this way so that's

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:42.450 
harvest your crops this way so that's
about<00:05:37.060> it<00:05:40.590> one<00:05:41.590> more<00:05:41.770> look<00:05:41.919> at<00:05:42.099> it<00:05:42.130> from<00:05:42.340> the

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
about it one more look at it from the

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.290 
about it one more look at it from the
outside<00:05:42.520> here

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.320 

there<00:05:45.930> you<00:05:45.990> go<00:05:47.389> that<00:05:48.389> is<00:05:48.419> how<00:05:48.780> you<00:05:48.840> make<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.500> farm

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
there you go that is how you make a farm

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.440 
there you go that is how you make a farm
using<00:05:51.330> lava<00:05:51.659> to<00:05:52.139> let<00:05:52.319> it
