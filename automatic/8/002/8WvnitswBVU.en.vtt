group<00:02:40.959> into<00:02:41.260> two<00:02:41.290> smaller<00:02:41.800> groups<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.459> each

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
group into two smaller groups and each

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.119 
group into two smaller groups and each
one<00:02:43.209> can<00:02:43.390> go<00:02:43.569> in<00:02:43.750> turn<00:02:43.989> this<00:02:44.739> time<00:02:44.920> we're<00:02:45.040> going

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
one can go in turn this time we're going

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.970 
one can go in turn this time we're going
to<00:02:45.190> go<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.209> other<00:02:46.420> direction<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:47.830> let's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
to go in the other direction so let's

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.140 
to go in the other direction so let's
turn<00:02:48.190> our<00:02:48.340> ponies<00:02:48.640> around<00:02:48.810> here<00:02:49.810> we<00:02:49.900> go

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
turn our ponies around here we go

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.270 
turn our ponies around here we go
turn<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.269> pony<00:02:52.450> around<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:52.840> way<00:02:55.500> here<00:02:56.500> we<00:02:56.620> go

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
turn the pony around this way here we go

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.630 
turn the pony around this way here we go
you<00:02:57.730> can<00:02:57.879> increase<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.840> challenge<00:02:59.319> level<00:02:59.640> by

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
you can increase the challenge level by

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.309 
you can increase the challenge level by
changing<00:03:01.120> directions<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.840> galloping<00:03:02.170> the

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
changing directions and galloping the

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.069 
changing directions and galloping the
other<00:03:02.440> way<00:03:02.680> or<00:03:03.340> by<00:03:03.819> varying<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.480> pathway<00:03:05.019> from

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
other way or by varying the pathway from

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.789 
other way or by varying the pathway from
the<00:03:05.410> space<00:03:08.819> see<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:10.150> booty<00:03:10.660> go<00:03:10.840> allow<00:03:11.530> for

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
the space see the booty go allow for

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.280 
the space see the booty go allow for
passing<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:12.970> children<00:03:13.480> who<00:03:13.510> really<00:03:14.019> want<00:03:14.200> to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
passing so children who really want to

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.900 
passing so children who really want to
step<00:03:14.470> out<00:03:14.709> are<00:03:15.519> not<00:03:15.700> hampered<00:03:16.209> by<00:03:16.360> single-file
