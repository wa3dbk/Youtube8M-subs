00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.039
 so come on today I'm here in xv and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.130
 I'll write each function for you. 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.949
 starting here by frings there yes and what 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.660
 if that's what this function does, no one 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.789
 Can you see the time you went? 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.610
 last seen there then goes 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.640
 always try to find but will never say 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 that the person is very interesting but 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.820
 you will not be able to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.649
 see the last time the person is 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 online then I do not know right? 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.110
 It's good and bad at the same time. 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.670
 Ribéry cip your contacts will not go 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.629
 able to see that you received the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.510
 message 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.820
 that is, only that little blue whale remains. 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.489
 receiving this is a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.309
 interesting function to protect you 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.109
 has several options but I will focus only on 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.039

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.379
 at sat 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.909
 It's very interesting too because you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.100
 you can enter a password to open a 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.500
 determined chat or you are talking 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.630
 with such a person and even in that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.060
 talk you have to enter a password 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.100

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.900

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.750
