of the voicing kit I have the voicing

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.279 
of the voicing kit I have the voicing
block<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.939> course<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.420> would<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.720> set<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
tool this flat part of the brass cap can

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.660 
tool this flat part of the brass cap can
be<00:00:43.020> used<00:00:43.579> to<00:00:44.579> stomp<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.270> hammers<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.670> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
be used to stomp on hammers with the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.400 
be used to stomp on hammers with the
shape<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.149> nice<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.840> fits<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.200> your<00:00:49.260> hand

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
shape is nice so it fits in your hand

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.970 
shape is nice so it fits in your hand
perfectly<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.170> fairly<00:00:52.410> large<00:00:52.680> hands

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
perfectly and I have fairly large hands

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.459 
perfectly and I have fairly large hands
but<00:00:53.430> also<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:57.210> tip<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> little<00:00:58.079> shorter

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
but also the tip is a little shorter

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.560 
but also the tip is a little shorter
than<00:00:58.680> most<00:00:58.890> voicing<00:00:59.550> tools<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.149> stainless

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
than most voicing tools it's stainless

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.299 
than most voicing tools it's stainless
like<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.170> said<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:01.800> more<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:03.059> sturdier

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
like I said so it's more it's sturdier

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.590 
like I said so it's more it's sturdier
it's<00:01:05.309> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> accommodate<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> needle

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
it's going to accommodate the needle

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's going to accommodate the needle
better<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.409> stainless<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.130> as

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
better because it's stainless and as

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.270 
better because it's stainless and as
opposed<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.970> being<00:01:09.180> brass<00:01:09.770> something<00:01:10.770> softer

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
opposed to being brass something softer

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.030 
opposed to being brass something softer
that<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> needle<00:01:11.939> will<00:01:11.970> will<00:01:12.869> wear<00:01:13.200> or<00:01:13.470> wobble

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
that the needle will will wear or wobble

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.039 
that the needle will will wear or wobble
in<00:01:14.189> eventually<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.840> an<00:01:16.380> extremely

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
in eventually and that is an extremely

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.920 
in eventually and that is an extremely
important<00:01:19.049> point<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.040> tool<00:01:20.479> in<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.540> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
important point of this tool in that it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870 
important point of this tool in that it
holds<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> needle<00:01:22.590> more<00:01:22.979> secure<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.670> won't

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
holds the needle more secure it won't

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.630 
holds the needle more secure it won't
allow<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> bend<00:01:24.689> which<00:01:25.650> eventually<00:01:26.250> will

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
allow it to bend which eventually will

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.929 
allow it to bend which eventually will
lead<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.909> breaking<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:29.869> have<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.579> hex<00:01:32.579> wrench

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
lead to breaking I have a hex wrench

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.420 
lead to breaking I have a hex wrench
here<00:01:33.270> which<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.600> use<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.140> tighten<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.159> set

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
here which I use to tighten the set

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.690 
here which I use to tighten the set
screws<00:01:36.409> that<00:01:37.409> hold<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> needles<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.400> place

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
screws that hold the needles in place

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.080 
screws that hold the needles in place
and<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.720> you'll<00:01:39.900> notice<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> set

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and if you'll notice there is a set

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.550 
and if you'll notice there is a set
screw<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.780> both<00:01:43.350> sides<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.329> needle<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.530> you

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
screw on both sides of the needle so you

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.550 
screw on both sides of the needle so you
snug<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.970> too<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.810> bump<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.380> up<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
snug one up too you just bump it up to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770 
snug one up too you just bump it up to
the<00:01:49.890> needle<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:51.030> side<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the needle on one side and then you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.719 
the needle on one side and then you
tighten<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> other<00:01:52.649> side<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.549> you're

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
tighten the other side so that you're

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.679 
tighten the other side so that you're
not<00:01:54.020> bending<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> needle<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.119> inside<00:01:57.659> of

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
not bending the needle on the inside of

inside<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.840> tool<00:02:01.049> as<00:02:01.229> well<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.460> here's<00:02:02.759> some

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
inside the tool as well so here's some

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.109 
inside the tool as well so here's some
techniques<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.840> would<00:02:04.110> use<00:02:04.640> in<00:02:05.640> someone's

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
techniques that I would use in someone's

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.680 
techniques that I would use in someone's
home<00:02:06.329> working<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.930> their<00:02:07.079> piano

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
home working on their piano

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.040 
home working on their piano
the<00:02:09.050> first<00:02:09.349> most<00:02:09.709> basic<00:02:10.280> technique<00:02:10.789> is<00:02:11.209> deep

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
the first most basic technique is deep

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.979 
the first most basic technique is deep
shoulder<00:02:12.590> needling<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.390> piano<00:02:14.660> hammer

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.600 
shoulder needling and on a piano hammer
of<00:02:15.170> course<00:02:15.530> these<00:02:15.830> are<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.069> shoulders<00:02:16.370> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
of course these are the shoulders the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.229 
of course these are the shoulders the
sides<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.660> hammer<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:19.030> four<00:02:20.030> needles

sides of the hammer and four needles

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.559 
sides of the hammer and four needles
work<00:02:20.720> well<00:02:21.110> with<00:02:21.470> high<00:02:21.980> quality<00:02:22.040> hammer<00:02:22.819> you

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
work well with high quality hammer you

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.680 
work well with high quality hammer you
may<00:02:23.780> have<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.319> use<00:02:24.620> less<00:02:25.010> needles<00:02:25.580> if<00:02:26.090> you're

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
may have to use less needles if you're

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.050 
may have to use less needles if you're
working<00:02:26.930> with<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.319> harder<00:02:27.709> hammer<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.340> these

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
working with the harder hammer and these

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.610 
working with the harder hammer and these
are<00:02:29.209> nice<00:02:29.330> hammers<00:02:29.720> these<00:02:29.900> are<00:02:30.049> yamaha

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
are nice hammers these are yamaha

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.770 
are nice hammers these are yamaha
hammers<00:02:31.129> but<00:02:31.400> i've<00:02:31.790> needled<00:02:32.269> them<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> little

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
hammers but i've needled them a little

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.170 
hammers but i've needled them a little
bit<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.140> they're<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.319> little<00:02:33.470> soft<00:02:33.819> but<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:34.849> would

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
bit so they're a little soft but I would

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.430 
bit so they're a little soft but I would
go<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:36.590> at<00:02:37.010> three<00:02:37.340> o'clock<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.049> again<00:02:39.049> at<00:02:39.200> nine

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
go in at three o'clock and again at nine

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.860 
go in at three o'clock and again at nine
o'clock<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:40.190> do<00:02:40.370> some<00:02:40.700> shoulder<00:02:41.150> needling<00:02:41.780> and

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
o'clock to do some shoulder needling and

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.350 
o'clock to do some shoulder needling and
then<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.260> purpose<00:02:42.650> for<00:02:42.950> shoulder<00:02:43.910> needling

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
then the purpose for shoulder needling

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.979 
then the purpose for shoulder needling
or<00:02:44.480> deep<00:02:44.720> shoulder<00:02:44.989> needling<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:47.000> give

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
or deep shoulder needling is to give

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.809 
or deep shoulder needling is to give
some<00:02:48.319> cushion<00:02:48.799> here<00:02:49.040> on<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.280> shoulders<00:02:49.670> of

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
some cushion here on the shoulders of

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.020 
some cushion here on the shoulders of
the<00:02:49.910> hammer<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:50.540> there's<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.810> little<00:02:50.989> bit<00:02:51.140> more

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the hammer so there's a little bit more

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.330 
the hammer so there's a little bit more
flexibility<00:02:53.049> when<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.170> hammer<00:02:54.440> hits<00:02:55.099> the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
flexibility when the hammer hits the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.809 
flexibility when the hammer hits the
string<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.930> will<00:02:57.440> flex<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:58.129> little<00:02:58.160> bit<00:02:58.459> more<00:02:58.700> in

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
string it will flex a little bit more in

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.479 
string it will flex a little bit more in
the<00:02:58.910> shoulders<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.890> give<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.069> little<00:03:01.340> bit

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
the shoulders and give it a little bit

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.390 
the shoulders and give it a little bit
of<00:03:01.730> an<00:03:02.360> easier<00:03:02.870> escape<00:03:03.379> off<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.829> strings<00:03:04.160> and

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
of an easier escape off the strings and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.550 
of an easier escape off the strings and
open<00:03:04.730> up<00:03:04.849> the<00:03:05.030> tone<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:05.930> it's<00:03:06.079> going<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.260> help

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
open up the tone so it's going to help

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.789 
open up the tone so it's going to help
increase<00:03:07.329> sustain<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:09.010> also<00:03:10.010> increase<00:03:11.799> it

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
increase sustain and also increase it

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.620 
increase sustain and also increase it
will<00:03:12.920> round<00:03:13.310> out<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.910> tone<00:03:14.120> or<00:03:14.150> give<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.569> a

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
will round out the tone or give it a

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.030 
will round out the tone or give it a
little<00:03:14.810> bit<00:03:14.930> more<00:03:15.760> volume<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.680> here's<00:03:18.680> a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
little bit more volume so here's a

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.430 
little bit more volume so here's a
technique<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.329> deep<00:03:20.510> shoulder<00:03:20.720> needling<00:03:21.290> I'm

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
technique the deep shoulder needling I'm

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.410 
technique the deep shoulder needling I'm
going<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.709> push<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.220> needles<00:03:22.579> in<00:03:22.760> all<00:03:23.030> four<00:03:23.389> of

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
going to push the needles in all four of

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.520 
going to push the needles in all four of
them<00:03:23.739> into<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.859> hammer<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.870> what<00:03:26.870> I'll<00:03:26.989> do<00:03:27.230> is

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
them into the hammer and what I'll do is

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.080 
them into the hammer and what I'll do is
I<00:03:27.980> will<00:03:28.280> walk<00:03:28.579> across<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:29.389> hammer<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:30.970> do<00:03:31.970> it

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
I will walk across the hammer and do it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.379 
I will walk across the hammer and do it
about<00:03:32.269> five<00:03:33.109> six<00:03:33.829> seven<00:03:34.430> probably<00:03:35.060> about

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
about five six seven probably about

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.629 
about five six seven probably about
seven<00:03:35.930> times<00:03:36.260> across<00:03:36.889> the<00:03:37.130> width<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.489> the

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
seven times across the width of the

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.490 
seven times across the width of the
hammer<00:03:37.880> this<00:03:38.180> may<00:03:38.419> depend<00:03:38.810> on<00:03:38.900> how<00:03:39.109> wide<00:03:39.290> the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
hammer this may depend on how wide the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.949 
hammer this may depend on how wide the
hammer<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:39.950> in<00:03:40.340> this<00:03:41.030> case<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.630> Hammers

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
hammer is in this case the Hammers

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.589 
hammer is in this case the Hammers
aren't<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.380> wide<00:03:42.620> they<00:03:43.579> could<00:03:43.819> be<00:03:43.970> wider<00:03:44.239> but

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
aren't that wide they could be wider but

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.909 
aren't that wide they could be wider but
they're<00:03:44.750> but<00:03:44.959> they're<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.560> know<00:03:45.590> probably

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
they're but they're you know probably

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:50.550 
they're but they're you know probably
average<00:03:46.310> average<00:03:46.819> width<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.389> here's<00:03:48.400> two

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
average average width so here's two

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:02.409 
average average width so here's two
three<00:03:53.349> four<00:03:55.359> five<00:03:57.400> six<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:59.260> then<00:04:00.260> seven<00:04:01.419> now

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
three four five six and then seven now

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.240 
three four five six and then seven now
this<00:04:02.720> can<00:04:03.019> be<00:04:03.169> a<00:04:03.200> little<00:04:03.319> hard<00:04:03.620> especially<00:04:04.160> if

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
this can be a little hard especially if

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.580 
this can be a little hard especially if
the<00:04:04.370> hammer<00:04:04.609> is<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.849> hard<00:04:05.090> hammer<00:04:05.359> one<00:04:06.319> thing

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
the hammer is a hard hammer one thing

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.349 
the hammer is a hard hammer one thing
for<00:04:06.829> needling<00:04:07.250> on<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.489> front<00:04:07.819> side<00:04:08.090> of<00:04:08.120> the

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
for needling on the front side of the

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.339 
for needling on the front side of the
hammer<00:04:08.569> is<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:09.739> you<00:04:09.919> can<00:04:10.130> push<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:11.599> action

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
hammer is that you can push the action

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.470 
hammer is that you can push the action
while<00:04:12.680> it's<00:04:12.859> in<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:13.220> piano<00:04:13.549> up<00:04:13.849> against<00:04:14.329> the

while it's in the piano up against the
stretcher<00:04:15.070> you<00:04:16.070> know<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.370> piece<00:04:17.150> of<00:04:17.329> wood<00:04:17.539> in

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.770 
front of the plate so with the Hammers
blocked<00:04:20.959> up

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
blocked up

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.840 
blocked up
they<00:04:22.139> won't<00:04:22.410> go<00:04:22.680> back<00:04:22.710> in<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.250> piano<00:04:23.550> but

they won't go back in the piano but

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.490 
they won't go back in the piano but
they'll<00:04:24.060> push<00:04:24.300> up<00:04:24.480> against<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.930> stretcher

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
they'll push up against that stretcher

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.580 
they'll push up against that stretcher
and<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:25.740> can<00:04:25.920> use<00:04:26.220> that<00:04:26.400> as<00:04:26.610> leverage<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:28.350> push

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
and you can use that as leverage to push

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.960 
and you can use that as leverage to push
on<00:04:28.830> those<00:04:28.980> hammers<00:04:29.370> as<00:04:29.520> hard<00:04:29.700> as<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.940> want
