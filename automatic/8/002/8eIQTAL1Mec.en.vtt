00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.470
 there was growth 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.010
 hello good afternoon to the azores is that the novelty arrives at this theme 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.420
 so here today you want to show you how to make a garnish for 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.300
 deforest 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.589
 so here we are going to use 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.470
 a local Celtic 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.470
 back here criticizes it will be 100 years 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.600
 fiftyone 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.160
 we'll press on the support ball 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.770
 let's do it using light to believe see give it to him 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.560
 and the blessing of dain tried to change a little 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.930
 well after we finished the ball 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.339
 10 57 millimeters 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.339
 but let's put the line over 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.739
 inside it already to moderate and we will cut all the excess doing this 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.739
 with the part of him and how the match 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.250
 in season 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.050
 will be in this way model the technical part record had model access to 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.050
 white picking on the eaves 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.250
 The fish's hulk will get exactly that dull finishing way how's the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.180
 of the creative 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.040
 it's a very variable idea 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.110
 what we're going to have an activist cut off after a centimeter to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.090
 centimeter and a half approximately 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.340
 the length of the cusp 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.050
 on top of the amendment 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.050
 the finish stays perfect 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480
 we paste the beginning 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 and now the tip that at the end 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.210
 ae 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.520
 ef 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.590
 tactic in this way the position 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.680
 Let's get a mold. 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 in the little school that is the people of Santa Claus 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.380
 the dwarves and the metalized creative 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.039
 let's close it 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.469
 using the instant color 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.719
 put on 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.469
 in the head 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.559
 the character's dummy 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.559
 let's paste too 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.180
 now that we're going to have to cut a mold from the bar 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:36.229
 pass a hive not only at ipdu tips the mold 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.469
 and paste 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.469
 to shave 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.439
 of the character 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.509
 then again 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.509
 the carat 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.849
 so stay this way 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.849
 using on a strip owes the creative grafiato 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.079
 we're going to done with the Gulf started in the back of the little eye 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.789

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.669
 the landu 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.949
 It hurts to put a glue pen in the beginning and the end. 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.019
 it will stay like this 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.869

 that is nothing more than 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.189
 moves up and down 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.989
 using the pen on the side 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.190
 but by a probe and that we are going to pull the civilians 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.299

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.069
 just punch with 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.029
 a little bit 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.900
