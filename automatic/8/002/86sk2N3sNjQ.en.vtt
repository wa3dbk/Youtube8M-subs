Nick<00:04:52.820> I'm<00:04:52.970> gonna<00:04:53.090> slightly<00:04:53.720> paraphrase<00:04:54.230> this

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
Nick I'm gonna slightly paraphrase this

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.510 
Nick I'm gonna slightly paraphrase this
for<00:04:54.560> you<00:04:54.620> but<00:04:54.740> I<00:04:54.800> think<00:04:54.950> what<00:04:55.250> you're<00:04:55.370> saying

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
for you but I think what you're saying

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.250 
for you but I think what you're saying
is<00:04:55.730> number<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.240> English<00:04:56.390> players<00:04:56.720> selected

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
is number of English players selected

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.990 
is number of English players selected
who<00:04:57.590> didn't<00:04:57.950> arrive<00:04:58.220> in<00:04:58.340> England<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.790> fill

who didn't arrive in England and fill

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.850 
who didn't arrive in England and fill
their<00:04:59.210> team<00:04:59.420> should<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.810> ECB<00:05:00.170> be<00:05:00.410> looking<00:05:00.770> at

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
their team should the ECB be looking at

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.500 
their team should the ECB be looking at
early<00:05:01.130> years<00:05:01.310> player<00:05:01.580> detection<00:05:02.150> but<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:02.300> think

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
early years player detection but I think

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.770 
early years player detection but I think
they<00:05:02.630> are<00:05:03.100> he<00:05:04.100> has<00:05:04.190> a<00:05:04.220> massive<00:05:04.460> issue<00:05:04.780> nothing

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
they are he has a massive issue nothing

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.840 
they are he has a massive issue nothing
wrong<00:05:05.990> with<00:05:06.170> taking<00:05:06.290> players<00:05:07.160> who<00:05:07.430> come<00:05:07.700> from

wrong with taking players who come from
other<00:05:08.030> countries<00:05:08.120> I<00:05:08.480> think<00:05:08.630> it's<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:08.990> really

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
other countries I think it's a really

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.050 
other countries I think it's a really
good<00:05:09.290> thing<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:09.590> it<00:05:09.770> reflects<00:05:10.130> mobile

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
good thing and it reflects mobile

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.990 
good thing and it reflects mobile
multicultural<00:05:11.810> Britain<00:05:11.900> but<00:05:12.830> why<00:05:13.580> is<00:05:13.640> it<00:05:13.850> that

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
multicultural Britain but why is it that

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.810 
multicultural Britain but why is it that
there's<00:05:14.270> so<00:05:14.420> few<00:05:14.450> players<00:05:14.840> coming<00:05:15.230> from

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820
