00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
and now i'm just waiting for parts to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.120 
and now i'm just waiting for parts to
come<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.750> but<00:01:24.750> basically<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
come in but basically this is just a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.660 
come in but basically this is just a
small<00:01:27.259> one-tenth<00:01:28.259> scale<00:01:28.350> skiddy<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
small one-tenth scale skiddy you that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.749 
small one-tenth scale skiddy you that
had<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.360> crappy<00:01:30.750> Ramona's<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.530> nan<00:01:31.950> that's

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
had this crappy Ramona's just nan that's

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.520 
had this crappy Ramona's just nan that's
what<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.329> think<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.170> kind<00:01:34.409> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
what I really think this is kind of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.499 
what I really think this is kind of
stupid<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:37.579> we<00:01:38.579> used<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> some<00:01:39.240> really

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
stupid so and we used to be some really

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.069 
stupid so and we used to be some really
like<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:41.280> normal<00:01:41.640> big<00:01:41.759> bore<00:01:41.939> shocks<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.570> here

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
like just normal big bore shocks in here

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.460 
like just normal big bore shocks in here
they<00:01:43.799> weren't<00:01:44.009> very<00:01:44.070> good<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
they weren't very good so in here and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.889 
they weren't very good so in here and
the<00:01:46.649> swing<00:01:47.369> arm<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:50.390> there<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.750> this

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the swing arm was there was just this

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.330 
the swing arm was there was just this
really<00:01:52.399> loose<00:01:53.399> metal<00:01:54.240> spring<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.310> I

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
really loose metal spring in there so I

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.760 
really loose metal spring in there so I
took<00:01:56.490> these<00:01:56.850> two<00:01:57.090> shots<00:01:57.390> right<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.229> I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
took these two shots right here and I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.639 
took these two shots right here and I
took<00:01:59.270> little<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.780> three<00:02:00.990> quarter<00:02:01.320> inch<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
took little like three quarter inch a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.230 
took little like three quarter inch a
piping<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.680> went<00:02:05.070> through<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.880> up

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
piping that went through here and up

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.570 
piping that went through here and up
here<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:07.229> i<00:02:07.350> mounted<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.770> shocks<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.429> this

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
here and i mounted the shocks to this

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.729 
here and i mounted the shocks to this
middle<00:02:08.910> pulse<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.300> here<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.750> made<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.590> lot

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
middle pulse right here I made it a lot

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.510 
middle pulse right here I made it a lot
stiffer

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
stiffer

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.920 
stiffer
instead<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.790> building<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.330> whole<00:02:12.540> new<00:02:12.690> thing

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
instead of building a whole new thing

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.400 
instead of building a whole new thing
and<00:02:14.390> what<00:02:15.390> really<00:02:15.630> when<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.110> thing<00:02:16.380> was

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
and what really when this thing was

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.240 
and what really when this thing was
going<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.640> trap<00:02:17.940> would<00:02:18.180> always<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:19.250> grind

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
going the trap would always like grind

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.040 
going the trap would always like grind
and<00:02:20.520> slip<00:02:20.780> because<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:23.270> there<00:02:24.270> under<00:02:24.720> here

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
and slip because in the there under here

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.800 
and slip because in the there under here
is<00:02:25.230> pretty<00:02:26.070> much<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.280> driveshaft<00:02:26.670> kind<00:02:27.660> of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
is pretty much a driveshaft kind of

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.080 
is pretty much a driveshaft kind of
sprockets<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.410> stuff<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:29.310> used<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.700> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
sprockets and stuff there used to be a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.610 
sprockets and stuff there used to be a
whole<00:02:30.480> bunch<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.780> little<00:02:30.900> times<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.530> then

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
whole bunch of little times and then

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.070 
whole bunch of little times and then
there<00:02:31.770> was<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:32.210> circle<00:02:33.210> around<00:02:33.300> them<00:02:33.720> which

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
there was a circle around them which

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.710 
there was a circle around them which
also<00:02:34.380> made<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.800> not<00:02:35.160> grip<00:02:35.460> is<00:02:35.610> good<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.330> then

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
also made it not grip is good and then

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.440 
also made it not grip is good and then
there's<00:02:36.960> these<00:02:37.140> great<00:02:37.440> big<00:02:37.910> big<00:02:38.910> things<00:02:39.180> right

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
there's these great big big things right

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.190 
there's these great big big things right
here<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.320> thought<00:02:40.680> well<00:02:41.600> why<00:02:42.600> didn't<00:02:43.110> you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
here that I thought well why didn't you

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.410 
here that I thought well why didn't you
just<00:02:43.410> use<00:02:43.650> those<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.160> grips<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.640> know<00:02:45.120> they're

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
just use those for grips I know they're

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.940 
just use those for grips I know they're
guys<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.110> could<00:02:46.320> use<00:02:46.350> them<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.740> grips

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
guys but you could use them for grips

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.550 
guys but you could use them for grips
too<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.370> took<00:02:47.430> two<00:02:47.940> screws<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.600> went<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:49.320> one

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
too so I took two screws I went from one

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.680 
too so I took two screws I went from one
on<00:02:49.740> either<00:02:49.890> side<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.610> gets<00:02:51.150> really<00:02:51.420> good

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
on either side and it gets really good

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.810 
on either side and it gets really good
now<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:53.450> yes<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.200> ordered<00:02:55.860> new<00:02:56.160> shocks<00:02:56.520> for

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
now and yes so I ordered new shocks for

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.820 
now and yes so I ordered new shocks for
the<00:02:56.940> front<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:58.760> so<00:03:00.320> what<00:03:01.320> I've<00:03:01.440> done<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.800> far

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the front and so what I've done so far

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.280 
the front and so what I've done so far
is<00:03:03.470> took<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.650> all<00:03:04.860> out<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.990> there<00:03:06.990> used<00:03:07.200> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
is took this all out and there used to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.160 
is took this all out and there used to
be<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.440> hole<00:03:07.860> right<00:03:08.310> here<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.810> can<00:03:09.960> see<00:03:09.990> it

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
be a hole right here if you can see it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.530 
be a hole right here if you can see it
went<00:03:10.590> all<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.460> way<00:03:11.550> through<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.300> didn't

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
went all the way through and I didn't

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.090 
went all the way through and I didn't
want<00:03:12.690> water<00:03:12.930> getting<00:03:13.230> in<00:03:13.440> there<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.980> my

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
want water getting in there for my

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.300 
want water getting in there for my
electronics<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.330> took<00:03:16.160> brush<00:03:17.160> on

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
electronics so I took brush on

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.220 
electronics so I took brush on
electrical<00:03:17.760> tape<00:03:17.940> i'll<00:03:18.420> be<00:03:18.630> using<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.200> lot

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
electrical tape i'll be using this a lot

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.160 
electrical tape i'll be using this a lot

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
layered that and i took the cement well

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.710 
layered that and i took the cement well
just<00:03:31.230> all-purpose<00:03:31.410> cement<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:33.120> went<00:03:33.390> I

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720

electrical tape and I went in there and

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.890 
electrical tape and I went in there and
I<00:03:44.040> leveled<00:03:44.490> it<00:03:44.610> out<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:45.090> sand<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.750> all

down<00:03:45.930> these<00:03:46.260> posts<00:03:46.740> that<00:03:46.830> held<00:03:47.070> that<00:03:47.220> big<00:03:47.640> ugly

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
down these posts that held that big ugly

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.460 
down these posts that held that big ugly
circuit<00:03:48.390> panel<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.670> yes<00:03:50.670> so<00:03:51.200> I've<00:03:52.200> pretty

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
circuit panel and yes so I've pretty

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.340 
circuit panel and yes so I've pretty
much<00:03:52.560> cleaned<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.040> out<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:54.450> track<00:03:54.900> when

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
much cleaned it out and this track when

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.949 
much cleaned it out and this track when
it<00:03:55.470> got<00:03:55.650> cold<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.340> would<00:03:56.490> crack<00:03:56.820> all<00:03:57.480> along

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
it got cold it would crack all along

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.120 
it got cold it would crack all along
here<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:59.030> i<00:04:00.030> took<00:04:00.090> brush<00:04:01.050> on<00:04:01.200> triple<00:04:01.709> again<00:04:01.890> and

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
here so i took brush on triple again and

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.340 
here so i took brush on triple again and
i<00:04:02.820> just<00:04:03.030> went<00:04:03.270> in<00:04:03.420> between<00:04:03.570> each<00:04:03.780> one<00:04:04.110> of<00:04:04.170> these

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
i just went in between each one of these

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.100 
i just went in between each one of these
things<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.790> really<00:04:06.030> made<00:04:06.300> it<00:04:06.330> stronger

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
things and it really made it stronger

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.380 
things and it really made it stronger
and<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.739> has<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.250> cracked<00:04:08.700> or<00:04:09.030> anything<00:04:10.580> so<00:04:11.580> that

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
and it has a cracked or anything so that

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.540 
and it has a cracked or anything so that
should<00:04:12.959> be<00:04:12.989> doing<00:04:13.350> good<00:04:13.560> so

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
should be doing good so

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.629 
should be doing good so
and<00:04:15.550> this<00:04:15.940> is<00:04:16.480> just<00:04:16.750> a<00:04:16.930> heat<00:04:17.200> sink<00:04:17.889> for<00:04:18.549> the

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
and this is just a heat sink for the

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.460 
and this is just a heat sink for the
motor<00:04:18.910> that<00:04:19.269> I'm<00:04:19.630> going<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:19.989> be<00:04:20.079> putting<00:04:20.230> in

motor that I'm going to be putting in
here<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:20.859> will<00:04:21.070> see<00:04:21.360> it's<00:04:22.360> pretty<00:04:22.750> much

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
here you will see it's pretty much

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.800 
here you will see it's pretty much
