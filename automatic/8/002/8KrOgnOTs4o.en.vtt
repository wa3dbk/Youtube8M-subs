00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
pressure to a hundred matey I've 185 but

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.690 
pressure to a hundred matey I've 185 but
180<00:02:38.250> works<00:02:38.549> better<00:02:40.340> sergeant<00:02:41.340> actually<00:02:43.700> it's

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
180 works better sergeant actually it's

180 works better sergeant actually it's
not<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:47.810> turn<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.049> acceleration<00:02:49.769> and

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
not you and turn the acceleration and

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.970 
not you and turn the acceleration and
the<00:02:49.980> acceleration<00:02:50.329> on<00:02:51.329> both<00:02:52.019> too<00:02:52.829> full<00:02:53.250> and

the acceleration on both too full and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.550 
the acceleration on both too full and
then<00:02:56.329> you're<00:02:57.329> done<00:02:57.359> I<00:02:58.760> I've<00:02:59.760> done<00:03:00.209> save<00:03:01.200> the

king cobra because the straight on
that's<00:03:56.100> really<00:03:56.790> good<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.770> then<00:03:58.770> wait<00:03:59.640> for<00:03:59.670> it

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
that's really good and then wait for it

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.990 
that's really good and then wait for it
to<00:04:00.000> look<00:04:01.160> but<00:04:02.160> what<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.400> need<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.640> do<00:04:02.730> as<00:04:02.820> well

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
to look but what you need to do as well

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.170 
to look but what you need to do as well
is<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.480> need<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.660> have<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.050> in<00:04:04.430> manual<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.150> that

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
is you need to have it in manual so that

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.090 
is you need to have it in manual so that
you<00:04:06.420> don't<00:04:06.660> over<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:07.500> don't<00:04:07.680> change<00:04:07.890> gear

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
you don't over it so don't change gear

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:18.199 
you don't over it so don't change gear
when<00:04:08.280> doing<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.520> wheelie<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:15.709> okay<00:04:16.760> now<00:04:17.760> i<00:04:17.790> find

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
when doing a wheelie so okay now i find

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.240 
when doing a wheelie so okay now i find
it<00:04:18.359> i<00:04:18.510> find<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.440> easy<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.739> look<00:04:19.830> at<00:04:19.920> the<00:04:20.040> size

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
it i find it easy to look at the size

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.730 
it i find it easy to look at the size
because<00:04:20.549> then<00:04:20.640> you<00:04:20.730> can<00:04:20.910> see<00:04:21.260> when<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.350> bounces

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
because then you can see when it bounces

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.460 
because then you can see when it bounces
money<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.160> do<00:04:23.280> i<00:04:23.660> do<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.960> when<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.140> gets<00:04:25.170> over

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
money to do i do it when it gets over

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.590 
money to do i do it when it gets over
just<00:04:25.650> over<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.980> power<00:04:26.250> two<00:04:26.669> thousand<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.360> red

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
just over to power two thousand and red

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.380 
just over to power two thousand and red
and<00:04:27.900> then<00:04:28.440> just<00:04:28.770> break<00:04:29.400> mix<00:04:29.760> oh<00:04:29.940> right<00:04:30.150> it's

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
and then just break mix oh right it's

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.470 
and then just break mix oh right it's
not<00:04:30.510> fat<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:30.990> think<00:04:31.110> there's<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.410> high<00:04:31.590> enough

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
not fat so I think there's a high enough

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.390 
not fat so I think there's a high enough
just<00:04:33.480> throttle<00:04:33.780> throttle<00:04:34.050> throttle<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:35.190> when

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
just throttle throttle throttle it when

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.430 
just throttle throttle throttle it when
it<00:04:35.490> bounced<00:04:35.790> up<00:04:35.940> high<00:04:36.120> enough<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.540> you<00:04:37.260> should

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
it bounced up high enough and you should

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.640 
it bounced up high enough and you should
put<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.710> weenie<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:39.750> takes<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.169> couple<00:04:40.260> of<00:04:40.440> times

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
put a weenie it takes a couple of times

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.970 
put a weenie it takes a couple of times
to<00:04:40.950> get<00:04:41.100> get<00:04:41.910> right<00:04:42.320> when<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:43.350> start<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:43.890> off

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
to get get right when I start it off

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.710 
to get get right when I start it off
doing<00:04:44.220> I<00:04:44.310> couldn't<00:04:44.790> I<00:04:44.940> couldn't<00:04:45.090> even<00:04:45.480> get<00:04:45.660> the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
doing I couldn't I couldn't even get the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.940 
doing I couldn't I couldn't even get the
wheel<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.990> bounce<00:04:46.200> but<00:04:46.500> it's<00:04:46.590> if<00:04:46.680> your<00:04:46.800> while
