00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.040
 This pattern is called circular knitting 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.630
 columns without nakida number of loops 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:17.240
 who need to dial any i on the first 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.240
 30 loops now I make the first loop 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.039
 but 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:34.650
 and gaining 30 air loops 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 and so on, that is all I need 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:43.530
 dial 30 and so here I dialed the chain 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.260
 of 30 air loops now folding 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.600
 her in such a way that the loops are not 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.530
 turned over that is how they are 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:01:01.730
 on one line neatly wrap 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:07.970
 I find the first loop and knit me and 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.970
 single crochet 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.249
 that is, in this way I get 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:19.280
 here is a ring 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:23.149
 Further I begin to knit the posts without nakida 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.890
 in all air loops that is 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.950
 how much is my loop on my mom 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.500
 only thirty 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.500
 accordingly there should be 30 columns 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.399
 So 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:58.940
 that is, I knit now the columns 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:01.730
 chain knit i need up to that place 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:06.080
 where is my connection i am now 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:10.150
 I knit all the air St. Petersburg ki and so 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.410
 so I connected to the junction 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.410
 I have only three loops left here 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.620
 see the last loop and now i'm 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.900
 just keep knitting that is 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.850
 I have loops already formed here 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.660
 posts 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.230
 accordingly, I'm just knitting 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.209
 further all posts 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:43.070
 columns, without sc on how much she 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.580
 mating collar 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.700
 since I have a single thread 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.730
 I do not recommend lifting loops 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.709
 and close the ranks go to the next 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.080
 there is also such a way but I will show it 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.769
 pipe pattern that is if you have a thread 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.690
 monochromatic then lock the ring and knit 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.820
 round 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.970
 because in this case you are not at all 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.800
 there will be no seam 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.380
 knitting be kaluga you will be 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.780
 just the starting point and ending point 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.290
 preferably at the same level to do 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.030
 if you knit something round 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.310
 that is, in this way I see all the columns 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.220
 I knit with crochets 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.140
 impose as many rows as I 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.140
 need by model 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.900
 so I connected several rows more precisely 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.320
 say time two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 of 12 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.960
 rows that is, i have knitting exactly 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.430
 round without moving to the next row 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.730
 then make the connection and knit as 1 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.190
 row 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.030
 no joints anywhere 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:01.300
 here it turns out such a tube 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.430
 seamless and the only minus only 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.080
 such a knitting that there is a beginning 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.360
 knitting and be sure to be like a place 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.790
 ending knitting but i believe that nothing 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.090
 there is nothing terrible about it then you can work 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.900
 somehow tie up and here these places hide in 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.540
 strapping 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.620
 that is, this is the most optimal 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.620
 circular knitting option
