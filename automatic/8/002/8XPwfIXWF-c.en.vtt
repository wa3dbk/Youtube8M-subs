00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.820
 it is with great pride that I can finally presented to the public 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.440
 the culmination of more than 40 years of research on wagons 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.600
 we are around the murder of its members who are rather peaceful 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 contrary to what some snapshots suggest 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.440
 the collection is organized around three tables 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.670
 the natural history room and ramon 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.730
 where two others are unveiled 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.460
 no it's degrading Westerners I really want to eat 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.460
 and finally place to Eastern dragons 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.970
 over the centuries the dragon the eu has entered the natural history 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.620
 and little by little we found chapters 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.470
 more and more provided and more and more 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.970
 interesting about this period the monstrous males 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.880
 and finally but the murder 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.440
 is at the end of a long line of his sale 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.670
 who have looked at his extraordinary debt 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.460
 Member States will be able to create and manage 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.930
 I would like to spend a few moments on the etymology of the word bravo 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.640
 serpent's clay that gave the order to the dragons 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.480
 because the world will accept school 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.490
 the present participle the greens lose maalouf 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.050
 your first sense and I'm staring 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.250
 observe cppi told them 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 they are characteristic of dragons and snakes 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.740
 many snakes live in wet areas these were known 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.090
 clappers that conceived poaching as a kind of protector 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.930
 living societies 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.119
 the confusion between the dragon and for the little classics such as the snake 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.119
 for distress in the world so not antiquity 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.069
 no one year ago this record 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.230
 the business advisor mantra that ship which means fixed and that's it 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.089
 a point that the dragon in common with reptiles 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:40.089
 the first Christian encyclopedists and visitors of cÃ©line devote a whole 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:43.839
 chapter for dragon enter in his city definition 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.839
 it's the biggest of all times 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:51.129
 so at the beginning he has no m 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.229
 then there is the measure that the mythical image of the dragon does develop 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.089
 85 ' 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.379
 second time due to confusion with the fed domain 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.709
 meteorological that is found in the work of aristotle but which is called 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.709
 the dragon but it's the atmospheric dragon 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.919
 awarded for dragon from the faculty of spitting fire 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.159
 and in the third stage of its development and will receive 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.999
