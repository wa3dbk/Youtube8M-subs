00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.020
 good night wonderful and ximo 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.269
 public I came here to sing like that 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.660
 that without further delay I will ask is not 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.660
 true 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:26.480
 I'm going to ask for the collaboration of the great 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:30.849
 Lola flowers wherever they are 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.849
 they do not own it 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.050
 von ahn and barcelona 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.330
 as you all know I am a great 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.330
 passionate about astrophysics 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:58.560
 of astrophysics I love them 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.740
 stars that's why I've composed this 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.730
 couplet in which he told how he was born 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.600
 they live 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.600
 Y 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.859
 then we talk mom 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.350
 and die 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.290
 teacher 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.920
 very close in our galaxies had 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.710
 a cloud of dust and gas as I was creating 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.450
 materials thus increased its density 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.390
 when the density was very high it was born in 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.670
 the center a proto star but the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.350
 dust hid everything and could not be seen 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.350
 from outside 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.939
 already a very salty hook came to him 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.219
 happen and what if we try to look 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.689
 with this invention that I have here 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.569
 protoestrella protoestrella not you 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.020
 hide that I take you 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:08.020
 I see you because I look at you with a 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.020
 radio telescope 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.310
 squeezing matter at this rate 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.800
 extraordinary since you will soon have 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.800
 around a planetary system 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.000
 and in a short time it will be very big 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.060
 and very beautiful is no longer hiding the dust 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.420
 you will have cracked everything will be a great 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.420
 star 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.560
 if you want to keep quiet for a bit 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.780
 disqualify 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.060
 the stars shine because they are 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.030
 transforming hydrogen into helium 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.340
 by nuclear fusion reactions to 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.730
 this phase is called a sequence 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.580
 principal, and 90% of its 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.269
 master life 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:18.069
 why shines the star becomes 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:21.999
 helium all hydrogen possible 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:26.340
 and that's how life goes until one day 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:26.340
 suddenly he runs out of fuel 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:36.129
 I feel that the star and not because she 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:41.670
 do not choose leave the main sequence and 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.670
 becomes a red giant 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.590
 bolt of grace in barcelona 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.200
 the red giant phase is the phase that 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.629
 precedes the death of the star to 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.450
 the smallest stars the size of 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.370
 our sun can not continue with the 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.250
 fusion of hydrogen so they will be 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.810
 its outer layer placidly 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.859
 forming a structure that is called 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.859
 planetary nebula 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.560
 instead for the biggest stars 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.269
 can continue with the merger and create 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.970
 increasingly heavy materials 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.470
 carbon nitrogen oxygen so up 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.970
 get to the iron 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.970
 once arrived at this point 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.890
 a death awaits the star 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.890
 tragic 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.919
 teacher 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.180
 that has supernovas that when 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.789
 it explodes it 's gases in spurts 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.520
 with processed material enriches the 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:52.699
 medium where they are until cations 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.030
 and the process again goes back to 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:59.060
 start again when condensing the 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.240
 interstellar gas and so again and again 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.380
 but in the end it always explodes there 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.020
 so cruel death 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.220
 a giant and tremendous explosion in the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.220
 supernova explosion
