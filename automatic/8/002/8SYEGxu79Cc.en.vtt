00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.800 

on<00:00:20.080> this<00:00:20.920> side<00:00:21.220> we're<00:00:21.850> doing<00:00:22.119> a<00:00:22.150> pretty<00:00:22.510> steep

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
on this side we're doing a pretty steep

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.630 
on this side we're doing a pretty steep
hillside<00:00:23.350> installation<00:00:24.070> you<00:00:24.189> can<00:00:24.310> see<00:00:24.490> this

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
hillside installation you can see this

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.150 
hillside installation you can see this
is<00:00:24.789> about<00:00:25.000> a<00:00:25.029> 45<00:00:25.599> degree<00:00:25.630> angle<00:00:26.080> upslope<00:00:26.860> here

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
is about a 45 degree angle upslope here

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.159 
is about a 45 degree angle upslope here
so<00:00:27.460> this<00:00:27.910> tree<00:00:28.150> is<00:00:28.270> being<00:00:28.450> planted<00:00:28.990> to

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
so this tree is being planted to

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.010 
so this tree is being planted to
establish<00:00:30.160> forest<00:00:30.700> stand<00:00:31.029> on<00:00:31.419> this<00:00:31.779> wild

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
establish forest stand on this wild

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.220 
establish forest stand on this wild
hillside<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:33.250> anchor<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:33.970> soil<00:00:34.300> prevent

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
hillside to anchor the soil prevent

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.070 
hillside to anchor the soil prevent
erosion<00:00:35.350> and<00:00:36.010> to<00:00:36.820> increase<00:00:37.210> species

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
erosion and to increase species

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.500 
erosion and to increase species
diversity<00:00:38.320> on<00:00:38.739> this<00:00:38.920> hillside<00:00:39.269> really<00:00:40.269> hard

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
diversity on this hillside really hard

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.570 
diversity on this hillside really hard
to<00:00:40.660> make<00:00:40.840> a<00:00:40.870> planting<00:00:41.470> basin<00:00:41.949> and<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.160> terrace

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
to make a planting basin and a terrace

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.060 
to make a planting basin and a terrace
to<00:00:42.760> hold<00:00:43.059> water<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.750> stabilize<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.890> root

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
to hold water and stabilize the root

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.250 
to hold water and stabilize the root
crown<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:45.670> we've<00:00:45.970> laid<00:00:46.210> in<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.510> sycamore<00:00:46.930> log

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
crown so we've laid in a sycamore log

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.810 
crown so we've laid in a sycamore log
here<00:00:47.589> that<00:00:47.769> we've<00:00:47.890> spiked<00:00:48.220> in<00:00:48.430> with<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.640> few

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
here that we've spiked in with a few

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.030 
here that we've spiked in with a few
sticks<00:00:49.089> of<00:00:49.239> rebar<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:50.260> keep<00:00:50.470> it<00:00:50.650> in<00:00:50.769> place<00:00:51.010> so

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
sticks of rebar to keep it in place so

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.830 
sticks of rebar to keep it in place so
that<00:00:51.430> this<00:00:51.579> can<00:00:51.850> firm<00:00:52.120> up<00:00:52.149> into<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:52.660> nice

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
that this can firm up into a nice

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.010 
that this can firm up into a nice
planting<00:00:53.350> site<00:00:53.620> our<00:00:54.370> site<00:00:55.360> is<00:00:55.539> a<00:00:55.570> little<00:00:55.899> bit

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
planting site our site is a little bit

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.560 
planting site our site is a little bit
limited<00:00:56.440> normally<00:00:57.340> we<00:00:57.460> go<00:00:57.610> three<00:00:57.969> times<00:00:58.210> the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
limited normally we go three times the

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.660 
limited normally we go three times the
width<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.050> container<00:00:59.440> in<00:00:59.710> this<00:01:00.430> case

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
width of the container in this case

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.580 
width of the container in this case
we're<00:01:00.879> about<00:01:01.059> two<00:01:01.570> or<00:01:01.690> three<00:01:01.719> times<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.410> width

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
we're about two or three times the width

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.859 
we're about two or three times the width
in<00:01:02.860> this<00:01:03.489> direction<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.059> maybe<00:01:04.180> twice<00:01:04.600> the

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
in this direction and maybe twice the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.620 
in this direction and maybe twice the
width<00:01:05.050> in<00:01:05.229> this<00:01:05.379> direction<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.820> it's<00:01:07.390> the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
width in this direction so it's the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.440 
width in this direction so it's the
compromise<00:01:07.930> for<00:01:08.500> site<00:01:08.740> conditions<00:01:09.280> our<00:01:10.060> soil

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
compromise for site conditions our soil

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.109 
compromise for site conditions our soil
though<00:01:10.780> is<00:01:11.289> pretty<00:01:11.770> good<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.430> fertility<00:01:13.000> is

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
though is pretty good the fertility is

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.450 
though is pretty good the fertility is
pretty<00:01:13.390> high<00:01:13.630> so<00:01:14.080> we're<00:01:14.800> gonna<00:01:14.920> amend<00:01:15.310> a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
pretty high so we're gonna amend a

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.639 
pretty high so we're gonna amend a
little<00:01:15.729> bit<00:01:15.910> but<00:01:16.570> we<00:01:16.899> don't<00:01:17.080> need<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.350> do<00:01:17.470> too

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
little bit but we don't need to do too

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.109 
little bit but we don't need to do too
much<00:01:17.800> because<00:01:18.039> the<00:01:18.340> site<00:01:18.550> has<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:18.759> lot<00:01:19.000> of

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
much because the site has a lot of

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:19.650 
much because the site has a lot of
fertility

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
fertility

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.139 
fertility
we<00:01:20.320> don't<00:01:20.530> dig<00:01:20.860> below<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.670> depth<00:01:21.880> of<00:01:22.060> the

we don't dig below the depth of the

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.090 
we don't dig below the depth of the
container<00:01:22.600> because<00:01:23.259> we<00:01:23.440> don't<00:01:23.619> want<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.860> tree

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
container because we don't want the tree

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.330 
container because we don't want the tree
to<00:01:24.130> settle<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.509> installation<00:01:26.140> hole<00:01:26.380> but

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
to settle in the installation hole but

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.770 
to settle in the installation hole but
in<00:01:27.580> this<00:01:27.850> case<00:01:28.090> what<00:01:28.360> we're<00:01:28.479> going<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.659> do

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
in this case what we're going to do

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.539 
in this case what we're going to do
we're<00:01:28.990> going<00:01:29.020> down<00:01:29.439> a<00:01:29.680> little<00:01:30.070> bit<00:01:30.189> of<00:01:30.310> extra

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
we're going down a little bit of extra

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.539 
we're going down a little bit of extra
depth<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.150> we're<00:01:32.140> mixing<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:32.710> some<00:01:33.009> soil

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549

amendment<00:01:34.119> into<00:01:34.390> this<00:01:34.509> mix<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.079> we're<00:01:35.799> gonna

amendment into this mix and we're gonna

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.890 
amendment into this mix and we're gonna
compact<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:36.790> drive<00:01:37.030> out<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.420> air<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:37.869> the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
compact and drive out the air so the

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.410 
compact and drive out the air so the
tree<00:01:38.200> doesn't<00:01:38.409> settle<00:01:38.829> or<00:01:39.159> change<00:01:39.880> grade<00:01:40.210> in

the landscape

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.760 
the landscape
we're<00:01:42.729> compacting<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.540> driving<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.110> air<00:01:44.229> out

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
we're compacting and driving the air out

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.380 
we're compacting and driving the air out
we<00:01:45.100> don't<00:01:45.250> want<00:01:45.369> an<00:01:45.460> air<00:01:45.610> pocket<00:01:45.909> under<00:01:46.299> the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
we don't want an air pocket under the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.080 
we don't want an air pocket under the
tree<00:01:46.630> we<00:01:47.110> don't<00:01:47.320> want<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:47.500> tree<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.860> settle<00:01:48.340> in

tree we don't want the tree to settle in

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.660 
tree we don't want the tree to settle in
its<00:01:49.329> planting<00:01:49.810> hole<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.500> we're<00:01:51.220> driving<00:01:51.399> the

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
its planting hole so we're driving the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.660 
its planting hole so we're driving the
air<00:01:51.790> out<00:01:51.970> with<00:01:52.149> a<00:01:52.180> little<00:01:52.420> compaction<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:54.460> want

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
air out with a little compaction we want

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.359 
air out with a little compaction we want
the<00:01:54.759> bottom<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.180> hole<00:01:55.329> nice<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.780> level<00:01:56.369> if

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
the bottom of the hole nice and level if

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.399 
the bottom of the hole nice and level if
we<00:01:57.610> use<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.000> compacting<00:01:58.689> jackhammer<00:01:59.259> or

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
we use the compacting jackhammer or

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.170 
we use the compacting jackhammer or
something<00:01:59.770> like<00:01:59.890> that<00:01:59.950> we<00:02:00.250> could<00:02:00.430> easily<00:02:00.640> over

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
something like that we could easily over

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.660 
something like that we could easily over
compact<00:02:01.750> so<00:02:02.500> just<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.070> weight<00:02:03.219> of<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.399> human

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
compact so just the weight of the human

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.520 
compact so just the weight of the human
body<00:02:03.790> isn't<00:02:04.149> going<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.420> be<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:04.780> heavy<00:02:05.049> that<00:02:05.200> we

water penetration down to the bottom of
the<00:03:13.510> root<00:03:13.660> ball<00:03:13.870> we'll<00:03:14.650> do<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> little<00:03:15.130> bit<00:03:15.280> of

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
the root ball we'll do a little bit of

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.880 
the root ball we'll do a little bit of
an<00:03:15.580> irrigation<00:03:16.170> before<00:03:17.170> we<00:03:17.350> have<00:03:17.440> completely

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
an irrigation before we have completely

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.270 
an irrigation before we have completely
backfilled<00:03:18.730> our<00:03:19.510> fill<00:03:19.870> soils<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:20.980> I'm<00:03:21.100> just

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
backfilled our fill soils so I'm just

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.210 
backfilled our fill soils so I'm just
gonna<00:03:21.370> add<00:03:21.959> maybe<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.110> gallon<00:03:23.440> or<00:03:23.680> two<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:24.010> water

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
gonna add maybe a gallon or two of water

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.850 
gonna add maybe a gallon or two of water
here<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:25.750> make<00:03:25.930> sure<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.440> we're<00:03:26.650> getting

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
here to make sure that we're getting

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.699 
here to make sure that we're getting
water<00:03:27.280> penetration<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.390> bottom<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.959> our

so that's about enough we don't want to

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.560 
so that's about enough we don't want to
make<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.170> muddy<00:03:36.000> we<00:03:37.000> just<00:03:37.180> want<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.420> make<00:03:37.540> sure

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
make it muddy we just want to make sure

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.229 
make it muddy we just want to make sure
that<00:03:37.870> we<00:03:37.989> get<00:03:38.110> very<00:03:38.440> good<00:03:39.239> irrigation

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
that we get very good irrigation

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.569 
that we get very good irrigation

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
enough it's not going to receive Stakes

and<00:04:29.830> up<00:04:29.979> on<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.190> hillside<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:31.390> this<00:04:31.720> site<00:04:31.930> is

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
and up on the hillside so this site is

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.360 
and up on the hillside so this site is
not<00:04:32.260> going<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.500> receive<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> lot<00:04:33.010> of<00:04:33.039> irrigation

not going to receive a lot of irrigation

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.060 
not going to receive a lot of irrigation
so<00:04:33.880> we<00:04:34.030> want<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.330> create<00:04:34.479> ideal<00:04:35.070> circumstances

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
so we want to create ideal circumstances

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.880 
so we want to create ideal circumstances
so<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.520> tree<00:04:36.729> will<00:04:36.910> take<00:04:37.350> it's<00:04:38.350> just

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
so that the tree will take it's just

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.370 
so that the tree will take it's just
going<00:04:39.039> to<00:04:39.130> have<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.340> diagonal<00:04:39.990> approach<00:04:40.990> to

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
going to have a diagonal approach to

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.810 
going to have a diagonal approach to
this

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
this

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.960 
this
so<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.930> when<00:04:43.110> rainfall<00:04:43.350> does<00:04:43.830> occur<00:04:44.220> and<00:04:44.520> we

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
so that when rainfall does occur and we

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.610 
so that when rainfall does occur and we
get<00:04:45.120> sufficient<00:04:45.660> rainfall<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:46.320> it<00:04:46.410> causes

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
get sufficient rainfall that it causes

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.130 
get sufficient rainfall that it causes
runoff<00:04:47.280> that<00:04:48.180> runoff<00:04:48.510> is<00:04:48.840> going<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.050> be

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
runoff that runoff is going to be

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.710 
runoff that runoff is going to be
directed<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.740> this<00:04:49.890> Basin<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.480> a<00:04:51.510> way

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
directed to this Basin so this is a way

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.080 
directed to this Basin so this is a way
to<00:04:51.750> magnify<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.560> amount<00:04:53.070> of<00:04:53.160> rainfall<00:04:53.700> or

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
to magnify the amount of rainfall or

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.960 
to magnify the amount of rainfall or
irrigation<00:04:54.750> that<00:04:54.990> a<00:04:55.140> tree<00:04:55.440> receives<00:04:55.980> this<00:04:56.790> is

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
irrigation that a tree receives this is

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.910 
irrigation that a tree receives this is

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
one of those bill Mollison permaculture

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.290 
one of those bill Mollison permaculture
ideas<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.730> using<00:05:00.480> swales<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.470> berms<00:05:01.560> and

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
ideas that using swales and berms and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.570 
ideas that using swales and berms and
catchments<00:05:03.300> we<00:05:04.020> can<00:05:04.260> greatly<00:05:04.860> magnify<00:05:05.520> the

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
catchments we can greatly magnify the

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.240 
catchments we can greatly magnify the
ability<00:05:06.180> of<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.390> tree<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.960> capture<00:05:07.830> and<00:05:08.070> utilize

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
ability of a tree to capture and utilize

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.090 
ability of a tree to capture and utilize
water<00:05:08.760> so<00:05:09.630> we'll<00:05:10.020> probably<00:05:10.200> go<00:05:10.470> back<00:05:10.620> in<00:05:10.890> about

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
water so we'll probably go back in about

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.220 
water so we'll probably go back in about
five<00:05:11.340> or<00:05:11.550> six<00:05:11.790> feet<00:05:12.000> in<00:05:12.270> both<00:05:12.420> directions<00:05:12.810> and

five or six feet in both directions and

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.700 
five or six feet in both directions and
we'll<00:05:13.890> give<00:05:14.040> ourselves<00:05:14.220> a<00:05:15.140> good<00:05:16.140> directive

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
we'll give ourselves a good directive

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.830 
we'll give ourselves a good directive
