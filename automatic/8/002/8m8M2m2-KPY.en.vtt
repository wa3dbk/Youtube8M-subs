00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
showed you this is the new model from

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.770 
showed you this is the new model from
shamim<00:03:41.549> as<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:42.329> talked<00:03:42.600> before<00:03:42.750> it's<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.829> thick

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
shamim as we talked before it's a thick

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.160 
shamim as we talked before it's a thick
vessels<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:46.320> not<00:03:46.620> very<00:03:47.010> narrow<00:03:47.600> but<00:03:48.600> it's

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
vessels is not very narrow but it's

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.880 
vessels is not very narrow but it's
comfortable<00:03:49.739> is<00:03:50.420> 5.5<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:52.109> is<00:03:52.320> comfortable

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.370 
comfortable is 5.5 but is comfortable
maybe<00:03:53.100> because<00:03:53.430> it's<00:03:53.609> rounded<00:03:54.090> sides<00:03:54.600> so<00:03:55.170> it's

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
maybe because it's rounded sides so it's

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.420 
maybe because it's rounded sides so it's
very<00:03:55.620> very<00:03:56.090> handy<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.720> can<00:03:57.750> carry<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.709> compared

let me show you android is for
point-to-point<00:04:30.150> choose<00:04:30.780> my<00:04:31.440> my<00:04:31.980> way<00:04:32.510> as<00:04:33.510> you

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
point-to-point choose my my way as you

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.470 
point-to-point choose my my way as you
can<00:04:33.930> see<00:04:34.110> here<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:35.040> processor<00:04:35.520> is<00:04:35.550> 1.4

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
can see here the processor is 1.4

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.710 
can see here the processor is 1.4
diggers<00:04:37.190> 108<00:04:38.190> around<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:39.000> internal<00:04:39.450> memory

diggers 108 around the internal memory
is<00:04:39.990> 8<00:04:40.530> gigabytes<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:42.560> more<00:04:43.560> or<00:04:43.710> less<00:04:43.860> that's

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
is 8 gigabytes and more or less that's

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.010 
is 8 gigabytes and more or less that's
all<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:45.090> rest<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:45.540> phone<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:47.780> similar<00:04:48.780> oh

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
all the rest of the phone is similar oh

all the rest of the phone is similar oh
let<00:04:49.770> me<00:04:49.800> focus<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:51.780> similar<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.770> another<00:04:52.920> to

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
let me focus is similar to another to

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.390 
let me focus is similar to another to
any<00:04:54.060> other<00:04:54.450> shall<00:04:55.260> mean<00:04:55.470> because<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:56.010> has<00:04:56.220> the

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
any other shall mean because it has the

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.210 
any other shall mean because it has the
same<00:04:56.580> system<00:04:57.000> but<00:04:57.960> you<00:04:58.230> can<00:04:58.620> see<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.040> even

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
same system but you can see that even

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.110 
same system but you can see that even
with<00:04:59.780> 1.4<00:05:00.780> processor<00:05:01.410> run<00:05:01.920> smooth<00:05:02.340> but<00:05:02.880> we<00:05:03.030> are

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
with 1.4 processor run smooth but we are

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.280 
with 1.4 processor run smooth but we are
going<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.420> check<00:05:04.130> with<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.310> benchmarks<00:05:06.290> the

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
going to check with the benchmarks the

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.670 
going to check with the benchmarks the
the<00:05:07.620> results<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:08.340> see<00:05:08.690> how<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:09.870> works<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.380> also

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
the results to see how it works and also

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.610 
the results to see how it works and also
we<00:05:10.950> are<00:05:11.040> going<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.310> test<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.700> camera<00:05:11.940> and

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
we are going to test the camera and

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.490 
we are going to test the camera and
almost<00:05:13.620> everything<00:05:14.130> that<00:05:14.280> we<00:05:14.400> can<00:05:14.670> check<00:05:15.500> you

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
almost everything that we can check you

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.010 
almost everything that we can check you
can<00:05:16.530> see<00:05:16.860> here<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.430> design<00:05:17.790> I'm<00:05:18.510> going<00:05:18.840> to

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
can see here the design I'm going to

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.400 
can see here the design I'm going to
check<00:05:19.380> with<00:05:20.100> you<00:05:20.310> because<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:21.450> this<00:05:22.080> design

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
check with you because this this design

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.950 
check with you because this this design
is<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.920> same<00:05:23.160> as<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.460> original<00:05:23.970> red<00:05:24.570> me<00:05:24.720> but

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
is the same as the original red me but
