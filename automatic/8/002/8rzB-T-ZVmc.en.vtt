00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.689 
and that's butterfly knives are illegal
in<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> UK<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.769> wouldn't<00:00:29.039> surprise<00:00:29.160> me<00:00:29.369> if

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
in the UK it wouldn't surprise me if

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.420 
in the UK it wouldn't surprise me if
customs<00:00:30.240> saw<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.779> ordering<00:00:31.260> butterfly<00:00:32.219> knife

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
customs saw you ordering butterfly knife

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.490 
customs saw you ordering butterfly knife
trainer<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.420> impounded<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.260> or<00:00:34.380> whatever

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
trainer then impounded it or whatever

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.709 
trainer then impounded it or whatever
and<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.100> wouldn't<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.300> charge

and you wouldn't get it or they charge

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810 
and you wouldn't get it or they charge
you<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.579> it'd<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you to get it you know and it'd be a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.170 
you to get it you know and it'd be a
whole<00:00:39.059> lot<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.540> hassle<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.440> cheap

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
whole lot of hassle for a little cheap

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.270 
whole lot of hassle for a little cheap
trainer<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:43.079> um<00:00:45.140> that's<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.379> actual<00:00:46.710> trainer

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
trainer so um that's the actual trainer

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.619 
trainer so um that's the actual trainer
itself<00:00:48.950> it's<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> little<00:00:50.520> lock<00:00:50.730> pin<00:00:51.090> here

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
itself it's got a little lock pin here

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.970 
itself it's got a little lock pin here
you<00:00:51.899> flick<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.289> open<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:54.120> opens<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.980> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you flick that open and it opens up and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.459 
you flick that open and it opens up and
you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.730> secure<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.289> that's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you can secure that like that and that's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950 
you can secure that like that and that's
how<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> knife<00:00:59.039> would<00:00:59.280> actually<00:00:59.870> function<00:01:00.870> if

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
how the knife would actually function if

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.439 
how the knife would actually function if
it<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> butterfly<00:01:01.620> knife<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.550> that's

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
it was a butterfly knife and that's

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
it was a butterfly knife and that's
essentially<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> blade<00:01:04.320> they're<00:01:04.619> all<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
essentially the blade they're all the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.679 
essentially the blade they're all the
fake<00:01:05.070> blade<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.150> big<00:01:06.299> chunk<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
fake blade it's just a big chunk of

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.359 
fake blade it's just a big chunk of
stainless<00:01:06.930> steel<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.560> holes<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.220> keep

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
stainless steel with holes in it to keep

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.690 
stainless steel with holes in it to keep
it<00:01:08.580> lighter<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> I've<00:01:10.560> been<00:01:11.100> practicing<00:01:11.670> with

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it lighter so I've been practicing with

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000 
it lighter so I've been practicing with
it<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.090> little<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.750> hopefully<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.860> won't

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it a little bit and hopefully I won't

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.740 
it a little bit and hopefully I won't
embarrass<00:01:14.100> myself<00:01:14.549> too<00:01:14.909> much<00:01:14.939> I'll<00:01:15.390> try<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
embarrass myself too much I'll try and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.539 
embarrass myself too much I'll try and
flick<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> few<00:01:16.380> times<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.369> see

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
flick it a few times just so you can see

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.149 
flick it a few times just so you can see
how<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.759> works<00:01:18.290> hopefully<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.979> me

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
how it works hopefully you can see me

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.149 
how it works hopefully you can see me
all<00:01:20.250> right<00:01:20.280> stand<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.590> snowy<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.009> as

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
all right stand in here snowy up so as

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.990 
all right stand in here snowy up so as
you<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.490> hopefully<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:24.290> right<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.759> flick

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you can hopefully see right so we flick

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.460 
you can hopefully see right so we flick
it<00:01:27.119> open<00:01:27.290> then<00:01:29.000> miss<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.409> there<00:01:31.409> we

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
it open then miss that one up there we

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.510 
it open then miss that one up there we
go

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
go

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.789 
go
the<00:01:33.520> idea<00:01:33.850> is<00:01:34.060> basically<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:35.020> move<00:01:35.259> your<00:01:35.530> hand

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
the idea is basically you move your hand

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.340 
the idea is basically you move your hand
out<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.460> way<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:36.969> the<00:01:37.390> other<00:01:37.420> handle<00:01:38.020> when

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
out of the way of the other handle when

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.819 
out of the way of the other handle when
you<00:01:38.469> bring<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.829> up<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.439> grab<00:01:41.710> it

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
you bring it up and then you grab it

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.029 
you bring it up and then you grab it
like<00:01:42.009> that<00:01:42.929> that's<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.140> actual<00:01:44.380> flicking

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
like that that's the actual flicking

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.940 
like that that's the actual flicking
thing<00:01:46.170> generally<00:01:47.170> I'd<00:01:47.289> do<00:01:47.439> it<00:01:47.560> better<00:01:47.740> I'll

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
thing generally I'd do it better I'll

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.980 
thing generally I'd do it better I'll
see<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.189> when<00:01:48.280> it's<00:01:48.429> not<00:01:48.579> filming<00:01:49.119> what<00:01:49.840> you

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
see you when it's not filming what you

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.270 
see you when it's not filming what you
kept<00:01:50.200> one<00:01:50.259> of<00:01:50.319> the<00:01:50.469> boils<00:01:50.859> whatever<00:01:51.189> the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
kept one of the boils whatever the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.550 
kept one of the boils whatever the
expression<00:01:51.609> is<00:01:52.030> but<00:01:52.869> that's<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.229> sort<00:01:53.500> of

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
expression is but that's the sort of

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.099 
expression is but that's the sort of
idea<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.189> you<00:01:54.849> flick<00:01:55.179> it<00:01:55.299> up<00:01:55.390> grab<00:01:55.899> it<00:01:55.990> like

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
idea that you flick it up grab it like

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.990 
idea that you flick it up grab it like
that<00:01:57.240> yeah<00:01:59.009> I'll<00:02:00.009> see<00:02:00.310> what<00:02:00.459> time<00:02:00.700> we'll<00:02:00.880> get

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
that yeah I'll see what time we'll get

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.119 
that yeah I'll see what time we'll get
better<00:02:01.149> at<00:02:01.420> now<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.569> idea<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.950> quite

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.129 
better at now that's the idea it's quite

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:09.650 
better at now that's the idea it's quite
easy<00:02:06.429> you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:08.259> do<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.560> really<00:02:08.739> looking<00:02:09.399> at<00:02:09.489> it

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
easy you can do it really looking at it

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.330 
easy you can do it really looking at it
wouldn't<00:02:10.660> you<00:02:10.780> do<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:11.019> enough<00:02:11.230> think<00:02:12.220> there's

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
wouldn't you do it enough think there's

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.750 
wouldn't you do it enough think there's
other<00:02:12.459> sort<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.849> tricks<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.989> do<00:02:14.140> at<00:02:14.260> ease

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
other sort of tricks you can do at ease

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.420 
other sort of tricks you can do at ease
the<00:02:15.760> idea<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.629> one<00:02:16.780> side<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> blade<00:02:17.709> on

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the idea is the one side of the blade on

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.190 
the idea is the one side of the blade on
the<00:02:18.549> real<00:02:18.730> butterfly<00:02:19.269> knife<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.810> false

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
the real butterfly knife it is a false

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.619 
the real butterfly knife it is a false
edge<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.430> others<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.819> actual<00:02:22.180> edge<00:02:22.329> and

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
edge and the others the actual edge and

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.830 
edge and the others the actual edge and
then<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.120> don't<00:02:25.269> have<00:02:25.359> to<00:02:25.480> worry<00:02:25.690> about

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
then so you don't have to worry about

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.509 
then so you don't have to worry about
your<00:02:26.079> hand<00:02:26.379> getting<00:02:26.650> caught<00:02:26.920> by<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.190> blade

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
your hand getting caught by the blade

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.250 
your hand getting caught by the blade
like<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.450> real<00:02:28.599> butterfly<00:02:29.049> knife

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
like this on the real butterfly knife

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.220 
like this on the real butterfly knife
because<00:02:29.769> um<00:02:30.120> only<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.569> side<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.019> blade

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
because um only this side of the blade

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.930 
because um only this side of the blade
would<00:02:32.440> be<00:02:32.560> sharp<00:02:32.859> so<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:33.519> wouldn't<00:02:33.790> actually

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
would be sharp so this wouldn't actually

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.270 
would be sharp so this wouldn't actually
cut<00:02:34.299> you<00:02:34.450> there<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.959> smack<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.190> you

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
cut you there just smack you so you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.890 
cut you there just smack you so you
don't<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.579> worry<00:02:36.790> if<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.060> closes<00:02:37.359> on<00:02:37.630> your

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
don't have to worry if it closes on your

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.569 
don't have to worry if it closes on your
hand<00:02:38.109> like<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.470> because<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.190> would<00:02:39.459> you

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
hand like this because that would you

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.940 
hand like this because that would you
really<00:02:39.730> feel<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.209> know<00:02:40.500> getting<00:02:41.500> smacked<00:02:41.769> my

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
really feel you know getting smacked my

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.410 
really feel you know getting smacked my
metal<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.400> wouldn't<00:02:42.639> actually<00:02:42.760> get<00:02:43.120> Coe

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
metal you wouldn't actually get Coe

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.580 
metal you wouldn't actually get Coe
opened<00:02:43.750> by

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.330 

anyway<00:02:49.590> that's<00:02:49.710> how<00:02:49.860> flight<00:02:50.820> training<00:02:51.120> works

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
anyway that's how flight training works

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.180 
anyway that's how flight training works
not<00:02:53.340> bad<00:02:53.550> fitting<00:02:53.940> good
