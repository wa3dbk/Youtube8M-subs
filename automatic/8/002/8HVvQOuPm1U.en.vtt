00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
I would most lip plumpers act by

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.139 
I would most lip plumpers act by
irritating<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:44.399> lips<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.850> you've<00:00:45.000> ever

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
irritating your lips if you've ever

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.880 
irritating your lips if you've ever
applied<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> lip<00:00:45.989> plumper<00:00:46.320> from<00:00:46.530> Sephora

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
applied like a lip plumper from Sephora

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.440 
applied like a lip plumper from Sephora
or<00:00:47.190> from<00:00:47.370> something<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.700> notice<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.180> kind<00:00:48.390> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
or from something you notice it kind of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.750 
or from something you notice it kind of
like<00:00:48.600> stings<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.920> course<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.399> stinging

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
like stings and of course that stinging

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.340 
like stings and of course that stinging
is<00:00:51.059> causing<00:00:51.449> blood<00:00:51.600> flow<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> area<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
is causing blood flow to the area and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290 
is causing blood flow to the area and
causing<00:00:52.649> your<00:00:52.739> lips<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.039> look<00:00:53.160> plump<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.059> only

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
causing your lips to look plump the only

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
causing your lips to look plump the only
problem<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.170> lips<00:00:55.350> don't<00:00:55.590> absorb

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
problem is if your lips don't absorb

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.290 
problem is if your lips don't absorb
product<00:00:56.430> evenly<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.180> know

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
product evenly because you know

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
product evenly because you know
sometimes<00:00:57.690> part<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.050> our<00:00:58.170> lip<00:00:58.350> has<00:00:58.649> less<00:00:59.070> skin

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
sometimes part of our lip has less skin

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.889 
sometimes part of our lip has less skin
or<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.789> Skinner's<00:01:00.210> thicker<00:01:00.510> than<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> other

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
or more Skinner's thicker than the other

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
I've noticed that with a lot of other

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.190 
I've noticed that with a lot of other
lip<00:04:25.650> plumpers<00:04:26.100> on<00:04:26.340> do<00:04:27.060> sting<00:04:27.420> yes<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.840> produces

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
lip plumpers on do sting yes it produces

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.900 
lip plumpers on do sting yes it produces
a<00:04:28.230> result<00:04:28.590> but<00:04:28.980> I<00:04:29.040> have<00:04:29.250> noticed<00:04:29.490> my<00:04:29.670> lips

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
a result but I have noticed my lips

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.390 
a result but I have noticed my lips
become<00:04:30.240> drier<00:04:30.570> overall<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.980> that's<00:04:32.190> why<00:04:32.370> I

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
become drier overall and that's why I

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.830 
become drier overall and that's why I
think<00:04:32.670> it<00:04:32.760> is<00:04:32.790> important<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.360> find<00:04:33.570> something

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
think it is important to find something

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.390 
think it is important to find something
you<00:04:34.440> know<00:04:34.560> like<00:04:34.590> this<00:04:34.950> or<00:04:35.100> something<00:04:35.250> similar

you know like this or something similar

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.160 
you know like this or something similar
that<00:04:36.180> won't<00:04:36.450> actually<00:04:36.630> cause<00:04:36.990> that

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
that won't actually cause that

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.540 
that won't actually cause that
irritation<00:04:37.560> especially<00:04:38.280> if<00:04:38.430> you're

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
irritation especially if you're

irritation especially if you're
sensitive<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.570> being<00:04:39.750> said<00:04:39.960> if<00:04:40.080> you<00:04:40.200> do

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380

you can even use this as a primer to
lipstick<00:04:48.680> what<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.710> do<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:49.920> just<00:04:50.190> put<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.430> on

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
lipstick what I do is just put it on

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.980 
lipstick what I do is just put it on
wait<00:04:50.820> two<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.150> three<00:04:51.300> minutes<00:04:51.600> for<00:04:51.720> it<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.840> kind

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
wait two to three minutes for it to kind

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
of set and soak in and then it actually

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.400 
of set and soak in and then it actually
acts<00:04:54.360> as<00:04:54.540> a<00:04:54.630> primer<00:04:54.960> because<00:04:55.050> it's<00:04:55.230> very

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
acts as a primer because it's very
