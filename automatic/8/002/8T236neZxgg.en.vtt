00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.680
 we are in moorea the sister island of 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.600
 tahiti every year 150 thousand people 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.680
 enjoy its turquoise waters for 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.900
 to meet the great 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.820
 predators 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.260
 and françois like every day near 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:24.610
 by the morning dive 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:26.320
 in the program the canyon of puno we know 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.840
 maureillas and these are the lemon sharks 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.790
 and tourists come mainly 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.160
 in montreal to see that because if you 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.160
 can 50 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.760
 it's a shark that has a repetition of 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.760
 sharks if you want them to have a small 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.750
 not impressive impressive report 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.900
 with black tips that they usually 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:52.030
 to see sharks everywhere 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.280
 sites and eric have never seen their 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.589
 then life the last briefing with 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.150
 François is very important he arrives 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.870
 barely from Quebec and came to pass 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.870
 their diving diploma 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.780
 after ten minutes of navigation 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.170
 we arrive at the famous puno site 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.570
 sharks are already there on the small 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.400
 boat the faces were clenching the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.400
 first divers jump into the water 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.900
 in fact our dod certification here the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.600
 course we made them in a protected environment 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.450
 of ambition in Quebec 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.380
 apprehensive but I am surprised that these 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:47.479
 white areas that make several facts 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:48.229
 who come back with thor march to the green and 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.210
 of trust 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.310
 it takes to jump in the water 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.440
 so here is where we see a lot of 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.940
 sharks in montreal we can already see the 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.920
 black tip sharks who turns who 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.030
 revolves around metals and 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.289
 recruitments are the sharks she has 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.450
 on the bottom and why not find or 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.250
 we will not in the middle is not the will 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.019
 put in surface sharks that get 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.630
 move mainly on the narrative 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.060
 on the Loire go see here to learn 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.180
 fights happened second life we 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.410
 waiting downhill 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.970
 eric and sylvie Quebecers discover 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.540
 even more impressive sharks 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.250
 that those seen on the surface are 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.250
 sharks lemons the regulars of the pass 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.140
 these sharks have their little habits 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.400
 for more than 25 years they are fed 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.730
 almost daily by 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.730
 divers 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.390
 this is called shark feeding in 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.500
 French feeding sharks the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.940
 process is rather efficient 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.890
 sharks attracted to food 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.890
 passes within a meter of the divers
