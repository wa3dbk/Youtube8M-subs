00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.840
 This time, I would like to explain the setting of motion blur 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.559
 Water motion blur It's rough It seems that the outline can be seen by another channel. 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.860
 But 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:23.390
 Yes there are two numbers here, main switch 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.100
 And each is a layer towards the thumb switch I work switch This is is that here 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:32.400
 It is about to divide that I want to hang and I do not want to hang 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.910
 The motion is moved to the left so I can confirm it now 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.220
 I will 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.190
 Come on here, but it 's also the setting of this motion blur 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:46.090
 I'd like to see composition setting for a while, but 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.680
 Open the tab for the code here Here 's a good book for the tab for this code 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.890
 I would like to see, but there are various settings written as motion blur 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.989
 Shutter angle is first along the shutter of here a You're a little commentary students 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.860
 Corresponding to apply the shutter phase and dissemination of negative 0 positive or sample result is 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.850
 There is 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:09.130
 First of all, here is the sample number of this Flamer-tan 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.420
 Want But I'd have become good now it Is this how to meet Let's to this 4 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.840
 Is it 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.799
 Then it's a bit hard to see here, but the afterimage of this part has become four 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.710
 It is 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:24.390
 I 'm going back to it, and the afterimage is 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.350
 Yes It became two It became two 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.590
 I say that here also afterimage is also called resolution 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:37.200
 Set the fineness, for example 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:41.530
 And I went Tsu's Bar 64 comes to clean blurriness form, such as overlapping 60 sheets clogging 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.549
 And the beauty of Bokeh 3 changes 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.690
 It is is because appoint the number of samples It is also in that this play also it's 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.490
 I want you to see here a little good, but the say the number of samples per frame 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.210
 3d 0 and shape layers 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.440
 It seems to be on the top, so for example if it is only here 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.550
 Bet that what happens 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.470
 Yes shape 0 here 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:11.420
 Atoka using in part Well then chamber to form a Fu that think you are 64 other places I'm two 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.560
 It is necessary to use it properly because it will 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.450
 Shutter angle 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:21.540
 This is fine as I was thinking of the strength of the blur, now it's 185 now 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:26.969
 It will be 500, and the strength will increase . 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.430
 It's strong Now that's the number of samples that had this frame and this is how it's too 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:32.540
 In the same way 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.859
 As you go up the resolution, you can overlap 60 sheets in this way 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.540
 The shutter angle in the strength had Naa do not want to adjust gamma blue 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:42.799
 In the case it is 9 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:49.719
 Self-made by putting a very small amount of shutter angle 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.719
 That is why it can be confirmed Rutteyuu such does not appear or little mountain continued sweets 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.970
 The shutter face in it is by default I have become -90 While this something 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.740
 Well, I'm heading towards the center point here 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.810
 Determines when the shutter opens against the shutter phrase frame 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.870
 It is a device to do 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.770
 For example, the object that has been adapted about the motion Well 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.610
 Object 1 that has not been applied 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.520
 I have put out a place to be displayed late 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.900
 This is a bit confusing, so let's see it once more 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:25.730
 At's made on the basis of those without motion blur 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:31.159
 The state I mean overlap on the now and Kedomo is this overlap An 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.879
 In other words it's You're the shutter phase of the code Yes So little the 362's here 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.740
 Let's go 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:43.060
 I wonder what the operation will be . The motion blur on the left side 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:45.050
 One is decided, and conversely, when it comes to negative 300 snow, it is on this right side 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.580
 Motion blur moves 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:55.900
 Well I think if you think in the form of moving the whole axis 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.900
 I will Toka or use something looks good this well when used in well to well each other superimposed
