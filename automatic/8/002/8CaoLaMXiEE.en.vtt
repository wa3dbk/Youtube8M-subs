00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.760
 Hello 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.390
 toni this to be a television today 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.040
 I have a video to see with me 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.030
 you surprise today to see I tell you last 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.760
 grand prize was the grand prize of canada 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.500
 that something happened on the track 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.990
 networks you know that caught fire with a lot 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.760
 ease have begun to use taught 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.220
 with your finger to the red bull team because 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.600
 presumably because of what has been seen in 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.540
 some images that are in this video 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.500
 could have a traction control already 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.450
 we know that electronics is 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.250
 thus prohibited that type of controls of 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.309
 traction formula 1 already enough 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.309
 years 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.730
 I am convinced that there is no 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.720
 traction control because we passed the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.720
 general reader 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.670
 this is the image 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.220
 mark webber is going to double here you go der 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.720
 Garde and touch each other there is a little touch 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.400
 nothing happens to the red bull I'll put it in 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.489
 play but I want you to notice the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.790
 marks left by the redbull which is what 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.710
 has raised suspicions among some 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.390
 fans there are touching 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.040
 there is traction there is a black mark 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.600
 continuous and suddenly the brand continues 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.310
 ceases to be continuous and becomes the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.850
 conditional bis contains bad people 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.280
 it says to traction control I do not think 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.630
 that we can not say whether or not it has 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.700
 traction control what yes that 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.290
 we can say is that those brands are not 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.060
 by traction control that's something 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.800
 normal in cars is depending on 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.180
 the rigidity of the suspension is in 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.810
 function of the grip you have in that 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.090
 moment of the car and the weight and it's something 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.149
 quite frequent happens in many 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.500
 categories and I would even tell you this as 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.619
 has in function of the depending on the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.509
 we can see it easily in a 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.390
 car simply in a very 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.130
 simple that is what is happening now 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.110
 same a suspension is very rigid but 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.700
 we can what we are doing is the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.070
 tire is jumping right now 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.170
 is moving this happens continuously 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.899
 in a formula 1 this happens on the axis 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.759
 front in the back and what we see 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.830
 when a car accelerates is that it loads the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.050
 rear axle and makes this move 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.880
 go back to back again that's what 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.500
 that makes there more grit less grip more 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.200
 grip less grip produces that vibration 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.180
 that you say on the rear axle too 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.610
 he has it but in a pose or in the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.110
 phase position has the same and what 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.180
 what it does is that the wheels skate and 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.230
 they catch because the car goes like charging 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.690
 downloading 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.849
 that happens in a formula happens easier in 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.470
 the back pullout this is what it is 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.150
 Very easy to do all-in rear - wheel drive 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.450
 but even in a street car can 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.150
 to pass in any category is something very 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.130
 frequent and in fact in the past when 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.769
 we had traction control there was no 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.660
 brand up the brand was imperceptible 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.730
 on the floor was what you would have to 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.049
 explain to people that if it 's a car 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.420
 of formula one any car had 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.190
 Traction control directly when 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.170
 you accelerate is the traction control not you 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.040
 would allow to leave marks neither small nor 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.890
 big ones I would cut it long before 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.400
 happens in a low-powered car that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.379
 goes from 0 to 50 per hour in formula 1 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.019
 it goes up to almost 200 per hour you can 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.510
 leave these marks that is that already the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.209
 power is in canada they wore a 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.459
 second long there was in second already 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.379
 the engine starts to run out of lack of 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.239
 power to start and no longer skate 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.379
 the wheels well tony I think what 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.299
 better how we are in the circuit 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.900
 ricardo tormo de cheste that is to say in a 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.689
 circuit I think we can look 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.680
 easily that kind of brands at least 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.879
 someone 'pit lane' 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.379
 yes yes indeed in the pit lane is when 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.739
 more we will see them because what we saw 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.989
 yesterday is a wever torn from 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.159
 almost 40 50 per hour very slowly that is 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.260
 what we see in a pin from when the 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.790
 cars stop changing wheels and by the way 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.379
 that is important also remember it 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.450
 when there was traction control 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.129
 We the engineers tell you 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.169
 pilot when you want him to leave marks 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.819
 in free treatments disconnects the 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.200
 confess but not to leave marks 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.370
 when we get to the grill by 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.810
 example and we wanted to warm the 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.669
 tire you had to press a 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.590
 button so the wheels could leave 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.100
 mark on the floor if they did not leave it 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.080
 it warmed up leaving marks 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.700
 these are continuous that is known the 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.560
 output that is what we try and see 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.090
 that here are brands of many types of 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.400
 cars of all competitions that 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.100
 they do here in valencia and suddenly 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.810
 there we are seeing some of 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.400
 an area according to exact and from this 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.040
 distance are also seen that some are 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.960
 some that have maybe start 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.150
 continuous then discontinuous or already 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.240
 start discontinuous depends on what 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.190
 kind of car what kind of springs 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.050
 take that weight have that axis for 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.820
 that has a different resonance to 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.130
 Sometimes the marks are short, very short 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.690
 means that it is a rigid car for the 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.770
 weight you have when brands are more 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.410
 long means that you have a 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.780
 oscillation more slower is simply 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.300
 a different frequency but they do 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.400
 all cars and very much easier 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.900
 with rear- wheel drive always but it's very 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.900
 easy to do moral 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.790
 I did not want to end the controversy but 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.920
 the reality is very difficult to make a 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.320
 traction control and I think red bull 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.910
 is when the fastest is for other 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.670
 things not for this 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.180
 and you can read up brands in brands 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.180
 with signatures
