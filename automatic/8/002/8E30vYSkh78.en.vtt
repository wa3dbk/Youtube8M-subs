 sarah ports and so today I will tell 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.290
 as 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.840
 from prague airport to get to the center 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.780
 cities and so there are two options first 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.890
 option is a taxi but about him and advise 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.189
 Immediately forget as a taxi in Prague costs 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.510
 overly expensive the second option is 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.449
 public transport 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.189
 frags temper works so well that 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.439
 most likely to the city center you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.559
 you get much faster and most 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.620
 the main thing is much cheaper and so on 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.600
