00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:41.700 

and<00:01:33.330> then<00:01:33.480> your<00:01:33.630> Lochner

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.260 

and<00:01:42.220> now<00:01:42.400> bleed<00:01:43.710> alright<00:01:45.120> remove<00:01:46.120> the

place an 8 8 mil rinse on that and then

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.499 
place an 8 8 mil rinse on that and then
for<00:02:04.500> bleeding<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:05.579> easiest<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.360> use<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
for bleeding it's easiest to use a

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.919 
for bleeding it's easiest to use a
vacuum<00:02:07.190> pump<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:09.000> know<00:02:09.270> most<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.840> guys

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
vacuum pump but I know most you guys

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.210 
vacuum pump but I know most you guys
don't<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.649> we're<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.069> use<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
don't have that so we're going to use a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.059 
don't have that so we're going to use a
bottle<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> tube<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.440> has<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> loop<00:02:13.800> in<00:02:13.980> it

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
bottle with a tube that has a loop in it

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.400 
bottle with a tube that has a loop in it
to<00:02:14.250> catch<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.610> bubbles<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.840> simple<00:02:16.170> it's

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
to catch the bubbles it's simple it's

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.259 
to catch the bubbles it's simple it's
just<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> radiator<00:02:17.040> hose<00:02:17.250> then<00:02:18.060> you're<00:02:18.180> going

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
just a radiator hose then you're going

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:26.730 
just a radiator hose then you're going
to<00:02:18.330> fill<00:02:19.290> your<00:02:19.380> reservoir

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.540 

fresh<00:02:27.460> fluid<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.620> like<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.890> use<00:02:29.950> racks

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
fresh fluid and I like to use racks

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.280 
fresh fluid and I like to use racks
wasn't<00:02:30.910> her<00:02:31.000> pan<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.420> bad<00:02:31.570> but<00:02:31.780> just<00:02:31.990> give<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.260> a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
wasn't her pan is bad but just give it a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.350 
wasn't her pan is bad but just give it a
pump<00:02:32.500> hold<00:02:33.190> down<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:35.230> bleed<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.530> brake

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
pump hold down and bleed the brake

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.770 
pump hold down and bleed the brake
usually<00:02:38.050> when<00:02:38.760> with<00:02:39.760> used<00:02:40.000> brakes<00:02:40.360> this<00:02:40.570> will

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
usually when with used brakes this will

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.820 
usually when with used brakes this will
be<00:02:41.550> darker<00:02:42.550> color<00:02:42.760> black<00:02:43.240> even<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:44.500> you

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
be darker color black even and that you

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.010 
be darker color black even and that you
really<00:02:45.070> just<00:02:45.190> want<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.460> go<00:02:45.780> until<00:02:46.780> all<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
really just want to go until all the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.230 
really just want to go until all the
fluid<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.650> good<00:02:48.520> color<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.000> there's<00:02:49.120> no

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
fluid is a good color and there's no

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.960 
fluid is a good color and there's no
bubbles<00:02:50.460> remembering<00:02:51.460> not<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.730> let<00:02:51.850> your

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
bubbles remembering not to let your

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:14.750 
bubbles remembering not to let your
reservoir<00:02:52.330> run<00:02:52.600> out<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.750> oil

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.240 

so<00:03:15.360> once<00:03:15.810> all<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.200> fluid<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> clear<00:03:17.010> color

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
so once all the fluid is a clear color

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.890 
so once all the fluid is a clear color
and<00:03:17.489> there's<00:03:17.640> no<00:03:17.760> more<00:03:17.940> bubbles<00:03:18.120> you're<00:03:18.629> good

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
and there's no more bubbles you're good

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.270 
and there's no more bubbles you're good
and<00:03:19.549> just<00:03:20.780> make<00:03:21.780> sure<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:21.959> tighten<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:23.069> bleed

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
and just make sure to tighten the bleed

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.940 
and just make sure to tighten the bleed
bolt<00:03:23.459> good<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.269> fill<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.810> reservoir<00:03:24.959> up<00:03:25.349> and

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
bolt good and fill the reservoir up and
