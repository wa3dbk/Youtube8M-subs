not<00:01:38.460> by<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:39.030> keeping<00:01:39.780> things<00:01:40.259> together<00:01:42.350> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
not by just keeping things together you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.670 
not by just keeping things together you
can<00:01:43.619> do<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.090> center<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.530> do

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
can do just the center or you can do

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.760 
can do just the center or you can do
like<00:01:46.860> I've<00:01:47.130> done<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> through<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
like I've done here in so through the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.370 
like I've done here in so through the
rough<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.700> center<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.630> gives<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
rough and the center it gives it a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.710 
rough and the center it gives it a
little<00:01:52.560> more<00:01:52.920> stability<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.479> what

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
little more stability and so that's what

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.380 
little more stability and so that's what
I'm<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:56.100> I'll<00:01:56.390> start

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I'm going to do with this one I'll start

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.830 
I'm going to do with this one I'll start
with<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:59.509> the<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.930> center<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.770> flower

with the in the the center of the flower
just<00:02:03.840> pull<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.259> through<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:07.110> doesn't<00:02:07.530> come

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
just pull it through and it doesn't come

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.690 
just pull it through and it doesn't come
through<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.310> top<00:02:08.580> yet<00:02:08.879> I'm<00:02:09.060> I've<00:02:09.360> just

secured the knot in the base I bring it
up<00:02:15.489> through<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.700> center<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.180> can<00:02:17.420> actually

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
up through the center you can actually

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.680 
up through the center you can actually
measure<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.769> or<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:19.340> eyeball<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.300> tend<00:02:20.569> to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.460 
measure it or just eyeball it I tend to
just<00:02:20.810> do<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.760> eyeball<00:02:22.760> bring<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:23.720> through<00:02:24.140> and

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
just do the eyeball bring it through and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.339 
just do the eyeball bring it through and
to<00:02:25.340> make<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> French<00:02:26.030> not<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:27.530> will<00:02:27.709> want<00:02:28.010> to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
wind the thread around the needle three

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.800 
wind the thread around the needle three

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
times go close to where the thread came

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.240 
times go close to where the thread came
up<00:02:39.049> go<00:02:39.890> back<00:02:40.129> down<00:02:40.459> hold<00:02:40.849> your<00:02:41.090> thumb<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:42.250> the

pull<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.870> through<00:02:51.110> it's<00:02:51.709> usually<00:02:52.280> best<00:02:52.549> if<00:02:52.880> you

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
pull it through it's usually best if you

pull it through it's usually best if you
pull<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.930> thread<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:54.620> not<00:02:54.829> just<00:02:55.190> pull<00:02:55.489> from

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
pull the thread and not just pull from

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
the needle you're going to get a nicer

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
came up you kind of wiggle it a little

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.370 
came up you kind of wiggle it a little

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
bit to get it to come through if it

into a nice loop and then it's easy to

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.220 
into a nice loop and then it's easy to
pull<00:03:40.370> through<00:03:40.760> without<00:03:41.180> making<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.750> big<00:03:41.989> mess

and<00:04:06.460> I'm<00:04:07.330> wiggling<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.470> needle<00:04:08.920> because<00:04:09.100> I

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
and I'm wiggling that needle because I

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.180 
and I'm wiggling that needle because I
have<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.790> not<00:04:10.000> fairly<00:04:10.390> tight<00:04:10.900> if<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.920> make

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
have the not fairly tight if I make

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.830 
have the not fairly tight if I make
those<00:04:12.490> wraps<00:04:13.000> real<00:04:13.750> loose<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:16.239> tend<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.660> get

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
those wraps real loose you tend to get

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.010 
those wraps real loose you tend to get
it<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.170> real<00:04:17.590> loopy<00:04:18.100> not<00:04:18.640> so<00:04:19.150> I<00:04:19.390> make<00:04:20.140> it<00:04:20.700> tight

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
it a real loopy not so I make it tight

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:32.310 
it a real loopy not so I make it tight
and<00:04:23.790> then<00:04:28.170> wiggle<00:04:29.170> it<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.680> little<00:04:30.930> too<00:04:31.930> kind<00:04:32.200> of

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
and then wiggle it a little too kind of

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.050 
and then wiggle it a little too kind of
shimmy<00:04:32.590> it<00:04:32.860> through<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:35.490> you'll<00:04:36.490> work<00:04:36.820> on

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
shimmy it through and you'll work on

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.810 
shimmy it through and you'll work on
that<00:04:39.210> until<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.300> have<00:04:40.660> as<00:04:40.900> many<00:04:41.110> knots<00:04:41.530> as<00:04:41.920> you

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
that until you have as many knots as you

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.800 
that until you have as many knots as you
