00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:14.869
 Hello everyone and all the new video 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:17.199
 just to talk like that and I wanted to 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:21.830
 to share with you a new one 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:27.380
 passion that in nail reconstruction 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.359
 and so I put a corner of the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.999
 room dedicated to all the things I have 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.250
 taken to all the products I bought 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:39.110
 and how I organized it to the tests I have 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.620
 done and nothing, maybe to many people 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.940
 but it may not be of interest to me either well or 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.400
 bad I always show you everything 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.100
 what I therefore combine for the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.780
 moment can access my workstation 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.710
 the tests I did 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:59.540
 the colors I used brands and nothing 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.140
 and I'll see you at the next video where I'll do it 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.439
 a tutorial a big kiss 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.140
 then this is my post 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:14.420
 only a fera as I call it 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:18.170
 and nothing here I did put let's say 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.149
 all the gels the colors or almost all of the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.140
 greece in the because it is an emotion it is me 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:26.749
 near my house so I took some things 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.039
 to start ii and these are the colors 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:35.289
 of nail passions then to start 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:44.240
 I took the minikit where there was the former trim 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:47.179
 the pink cover yes and then there was it 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.770
 degreaser I put it in here is the 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.509
 top shine and put instead I'm almost done 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.999
 seen here to rehearse then 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.639
 now I want to try my hand at it 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.200
 always alone on myself and I took it 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:03.260
 the 15 mm one 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.930
 and then I also have the former trim 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.440
 [Music] 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.480
 white to make the french then while 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.840
 instead these are the products of people 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.620
 yes these summits the cassino jellicles 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.840
 long these are the gels of products 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.500
 of and of the American nice I made the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.780
 course 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.320
 I spend two very small words for the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:32.209
 course is not at the top of the top as it can 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:35.060
 be the crystal or other homes 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.060
 however people who do the courses that 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.050
 they are truly exceptional masters 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.500
 unfortunately I could afford them 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.100
 because anyway I say to mine 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.290
 flow 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.209
 but I have to say that it wasn't bad 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.019
 because however many things they have 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.350
 said you also find no video that 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.780
 I hear of people that I know are a lot 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.840
 good then we say that at least i 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.760
 passages the various things I know now I have to 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.870
 put in practice then a future 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.820
 if I can get a course a little more 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.090
 let's say in high level 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.630
 I would like to do it anyway and return to 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.790
 products 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.680
 I meant that with the products 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.709
 of the American from if I don't find myself so much 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.680
 because the m is the triphasic method and therefore 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.980
 these are a little more liquid and not me 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.209
 I find myself saying what the product is 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.670
 best in my opinion is the flash 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.769
 white that stretches from fear at least for 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.959
 what concerns me the tests I have done 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.540
 while instead with that of the list not 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.209
 I feel good while instead these for 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.519
 regarding the builders 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.070
 we say found well enough for 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.100
 regarding the drafting 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:56.360
 then I took the spray in the prep 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:00.470
 that what we say in the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.049
 little bottle and primer in pen then 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:08.650
 these this red color 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.650
 American company is present here this 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.560
 this year the various tests and while 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.870
 instead the colors of passion 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.620
 are then this is the maracaibo 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:24.530

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.020
 tokyo from the light I don't know if you can 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.650

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.080
 beautiful I must say that this and this yes 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.530
 stretch with two passes and go to the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.820
 great they almost want three then 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:47.030
 experimented with the team e 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.250

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.680
 he opposed stink on gods and gods 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.770
 glitter is precisely this effect 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.150
 here instead with always semi permanent po 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.270
 made this perfect 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.350

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.310
 inferior every father the lamp that me 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.340
 they gave the course that I know it is not 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.750
 very good though for the moment or this one 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:39.830
 it is also that there rose lake time taken 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:42.500

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.100

 Chinese in my opinion those yes there 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.280

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:03.599

 a decoration can ticket anyway 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:22.020
 I did it with pieces of wood from 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:25.050
 recovering the assembled and painted and 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:32.569
 then I left it a little rough and so I have 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:35.810
 made these little flowers in corn paste 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:39.659

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.180

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.800
 success 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:07:02.669
 let's say we say that I like it too 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:06.620
 this consistency of ceramics when 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.620
 it hardens because it really is 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.340
 pretty solid and I didn't want to waste 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.440
 evils of the film not because there is a 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.210
 Tom Thumb would have taken enough for 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:20.020

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:23.530

 what is here and nothing this is mine 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:32.740
 location that in short if it is from a 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:36.670
 little interesting and nothing to 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:41.550
 next hoping to have succeeded in 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.550
 get my nails done bye bye
