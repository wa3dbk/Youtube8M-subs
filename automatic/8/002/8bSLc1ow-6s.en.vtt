 make a video with packs to each one in 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.380
 this video we are going to put the express to 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.640
 next we're going to concentrate on the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.640
 knot number 5 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.410
 and now that we have the samsung galaxy 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.240
 note number 5 is the fifth version of the 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.250
 samsung note model which is the 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.700
 phone a little bigger in size 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.040
 compared that is the galaxy s 6 5 4 brand 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.379
 3 2 and 1 that have come out here you have 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.080
 we will see the mobile or they can see very 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.150
 similar to what the sc is but more 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.780
 big in the box let's find the 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.370
 start day let's also find 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.650
 information about the product what is 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.059
 the guarantee for information to 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.699
 Security is always guaranteed 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.190
 important to read that we will find 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.600
 some samsung headphones I love that 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.460
 they include hearing aids with 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.750
 controls to control the volume and 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.060
 answer the calls and they come with 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.830
 gums apart to fit you won 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.600
 so that they see a little more as 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.370
 can see they can be fixed well but they are 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.350
 bye-bye type they end up inside the ear 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.479
 that are always more comfortable to me than 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.610
 what goes outside the ear only 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.470
 We have a tool for your section 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.110
 remove a tanger so I also 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.780
 like they include in the box we have the 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.320
 usb power adapter and also 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.460
 We have the usb to micro adapter cable 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.670
 usb 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.170
 and charge the mobile's battery and how 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.570
 we always want to take this moment 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.920
 and remind you not to send 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.020
 text messages and do not enter from gea 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.670
 on the phone while driving a 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.790
 vehicle is super dangerous and can 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.040
 wait here we have version number 5 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.690
 of casino as I already explained this in 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.759
 its white color as you can see here 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.070
 we are going to remove the plastic so that 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.130
 have a better view what is the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.020
 mobile and before stands to have a 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.540
 benchmark of how to see how that 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.670
 look here we have iphone iphone 6 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.320
 plus I did not take to compare a bit what 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.019
 which is size can see that the iphone 6 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.330
 little bit bigger, higher, what 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.000
 which is not 5 will be iphone is also a 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.640
 little bit more more politically more 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.950
 fine with 9 of the profile and 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.959
 as you can see a little bit wider 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.880
 it is also the iphone is exploited 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.140
 compared to being central but five 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.870
 people here so that they have a point of 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.600
 reference and may not give a little better 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.530
 what is the size between a mobile and the 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.180
 other 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.459
 a moment wanted to take this moment 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.340
 also to explain that 25 is very 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.050
 similar what is the galaxy s if those that 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.260

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.740
 screen of the change number progress 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.910
 let's talk a little bit later when 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.220
 let's be a comparison between the two 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.020
 mobile but concentrating on the nou 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.730

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.880

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.950
 of 5 18 that is a spectacular amount 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.959
 for a phone to have phones have 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.650
 an incredible resolution processor to 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.230

 internal memory to save your 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.800

 take these office that are very 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.690
 important are very similar what is 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.160
 we are at home s 6 more designs with 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.930
 good as the camera the sensors has 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.190
 upstairs has a physical button on what 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.290

 this side to find the buttons 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.530
 volume to the back side the camera what the 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.990
 friar from the back is not 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.970
 removable as the s6 will be in the 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.070
 Start button to turn on and off 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.960
 the screen above will find for 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.480
 placing the SIM card and the card 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.680
 memory so he says no people do not see 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.030
 what memory can not share 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.560
 for those for the 100 card can they 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.900
 place up here in the crack is 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.730
 here the bottom part cookers horns 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.440
 that says put a micro usb for 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.980
 transferring the battery here is 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.830
 position 3 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.380
 5000 meters for hearing aid light and also 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.960
 will find the spain that as they can 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.420
 see you need they realized but of a 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.120
 new way for europe to take out the 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.560
 but here comes later what can 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.170
 save in this corner the most part 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.820
 that I liked the design of mobile has 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.410
 more sense with the stent placed there 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.090
 where in that chance that falls apart 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.890
 they have to push it and to be able to 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.840
 remove this here have what 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.610
 is the one is very similar to what it is 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.320
 other versions that we have seen before 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.950
 it comes as a button to be able to do 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.570
 tasks with the button but as always 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:26.050
 all the life of the central suns but 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.720
 that comes with the spain the function of 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.860
 this one always improves in age more 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.910
 function as you can see here not what 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.680
 drawing you to the screen with the 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.270
 sprint but always the function of this 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.070
 pen of this ballpoint pen of this style is 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.840
 like the one they give is always saying the 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.570
 they update a little more they can do a 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.790
 little more with operating system with this 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.620
 ballpoint pen and good table that has been the 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.050
