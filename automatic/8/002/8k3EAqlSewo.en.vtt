00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
they basically look identical it's just

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.850 
they basically look identical it's just

need<00:01:04.050> to<00:01:04.229> install<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> fan<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.430> one

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
need to install the fan if you have one

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.750 
need to install the fan if you have one
of<00:01:05.760> those<00:01:06.110> processors<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:08.190> very<00:01:08.550> low

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
of those processors that are very low

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.610 
of those processors that are very low
wattage<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.479> example<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
wattage for example you can have a

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.310 
wattage for example you can have a
noiseless<00:01:11.070> system<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.960> ones<00:01:13.170> come

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
noiseless system but these ones come

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.990 
noiseless system but these ones come
with<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.530> nice<00:01:13.680> little<00:01:13.800> fan<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.460> an<00:01:14.640> adapter

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
with a nice little fan and an adapter

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.530 
with a nice little fan and an adapter
that<00:01:15.899> allow<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.560> lower<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> RPM<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that allow you to lower the RPM of the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.270 
that allow you to lower the RPM of the
fan<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.079> way<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.500> little<00:01:19.590> bit<00:01:19.799> cooler

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
fan so that way it's a little bit cooler

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.749 
fan so that way it's a little bit cooler
and<00:01:20.460> quieter<00:01:21.439> ok<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:23.369> definitely

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and quieter ok so it's definitely

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.109 
and quieter ok so it's definitely
definitely<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:25.140> nice<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.950> kit<00:01:26.369> okay<00:01:27.060> so

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
definitely a a nice little kit okay so

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.590 
definitely a a nice little kit okay so
there's<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.170> low<00:01:28.619> noise<00:01:28.909> adapter<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
there's the low noise adapter that you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.660 
there's the low noise adapter that you
would<00:01:30.719> attach<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.170> your<00:01:31.289> fan<00:01:31.619> optional<00:01:32.549> and

can see it's very low-profile slim you
know<00:02:09.720> doesn't<00:02:10.259> occupy<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> lot<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> space<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.400> if

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
know doesn't occupy a lot of space so if

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.120 
know doesn't occupy a lot of space so if
you<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.850> one<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.090> those<00:02:12.150> slim<00:02:12.480> cases<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.590> home

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
you have one of those slim cases a home

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.920 
you have one of those slim cases a home
theater<00:02:14.490> PC<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:15.420> know<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.630> gonna<00:02:15.720> fit

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
theater PC you know it's gonna fit

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.630 
theater PC you know it's gonna fit
nicely<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.380> can<00:02:16.440> see<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.770> bracket<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.460> this

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
nicely you can see the bracket on this

nicely you can see the bracket on this
AMD<00:02:18.240> version<00:02:18.750> already<00:02:19.620> comes<00:02:20.099> installed<00:02:20.580> so

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
AMD version already comes installed so

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.000 
AMD version already comes installed so
that's<00:02:21.269> going<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.540> make<00:02:21.780> things<00:02:22.019> easier<00:02:22.379> when

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
that's going to make things easier when

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.979 
that's going to make things easier when
it<00:02:23.129> comes<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.640> putting<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.239> on<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.540> board

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
it comes to putting it on the board

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:25.580 
it comes to putting it on the board
all<00:02:25.290> you

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590

all you
to<00:02:25.709> do<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:25.950> apply<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> thermal<00:02:26.700> grease<00:02:26.879> attach

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
to do is apply the thermal grease attach

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.630 
to do is apply the thermal grease attach

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the screws that it came with basically

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.180 
the screws that it came with basically
and<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.330> back<00:02:30.750> plate<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.319> you're<00:02:31.890> good<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.160> go

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
and the back plate and you're good to go

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.900 
and the back plate and you're good to go
that's<00:02:32.730> pretty<00:02:33.360> much<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.959> for<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.910> intel

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
that's pretty much it for the intel

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.699 
that's pretty much it for the intel
version<00:02:36.330> basically<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.930> same<00:02:37.140> thing<00:02:37.379> as<00:02:37.560> you

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
version basically the same thing as you

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.210 
version basically the same thing as you
can<00:02:37.860> see<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> kit<00:02:38.640> almost<00:02:40.129> identical<00:02:41.129> if

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
can see here the kit almost identical if

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.710 
can see here the kit almost identical if
you<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.489> looked<00:02:41.849> at<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.420> right<00:02:42.569> away

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
you just looked at it just right away

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.509 
you just looked at it just right away
but<00:02:43.049> then<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.319> course<00:02:43.349> when<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.190> flip<00:02:44.489> it

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
but then of course when you flip it

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.030 
but then of course when you flip it
underneath<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.690> brackets<00:02:46.500> are<00:02:46.650> different

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
the AMD has a rectangular bracket as

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.009 
the AMD has a rectangular bracket as
opposed<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.549> Intel<00:02:50.940> which<00:02:51.150> doesn't<00:02:51.599> so

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
opposed to the Intel which doesn't so

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.619 
opposed to the Intel which doesn't so
when<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.709> install<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.239> take<00:02:54.420> off

and I did benchmarks I'll post the link
to<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.160> video<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.700> ran<00:03:05.940> benchmarks<00:03:06.569> for

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
to the video that I ran benchmarks for

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.970 
to the video that I ran benchmarks for
the<00:03:06.810> system<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.410> can<00:03:07.530> see<00:03:07.829> the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the system so you can see the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.830 
the system so you can see the
temperatures<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.730> what<00:03:08.849> was<00:03:09.030> accomplished<00:03:09.630> I

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
temperatures and what was accomplished I

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.630 
temperatures and what was accomplished I
