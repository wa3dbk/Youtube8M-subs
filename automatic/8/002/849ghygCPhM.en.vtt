thing<00:01:16.920> you'll<00:01:17.040> probably<00:01:17.189> notice<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.790> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
thing you'll probably notice here is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
thing you'll probably notice here is
that<00:01:18.030> both<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> fuel<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> reactant

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that both the fuel and the reactant

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
tables have a redstone flux value so

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.300 
tables have a redstone flux value so
some<00:01:22.049> people's<00:01:22.350> first<00:01:22.619> thought<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.100> they

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
some people's first thought is that they

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
some people's first thought is that they
both<00:01:23.490> add<00:01:23.759> together<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.229> combine<00:01:25.409> one

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
both add together so if you combine one

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.499 
both add together so if you combine one
sugar<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.549> bucket<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> sludge<00:01:27.299> inside

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
sugar and one bucket of sludge inside

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
sugar and one bucket of sludge inside
the<00:01:27.780> Dynamo<00:01:28.200> you'll<00:01:28.470> get<00:01:28.619> 16,000<00:01:29.430> redstone

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the Dynamo you'll get 16,000 redstone

the Dynamo you'll get 16,000 redstone
flux<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.270> each<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.200> does<00:01:31.409> make<00:01:31.590> sense

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
flux from each now that does make sense

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.920 
flux from each now that does make sense
but<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.579> how<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> works<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.750> these

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
but that's not how it works what these

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
but that's not how it works what these
tables<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.350> saying<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.860> when<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.369> of

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
tables are saying is that when one of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.160 
tables are saying is that when one of
these<00:01:35.640> reactants<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.270> combined<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
these reactants is combined with one of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.170 
these reactants is combined with one of
these<00:01:37.259> fuels<00:01:37.650> they'll<00:01:38.130> generate<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.790> amount

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
these fuels they'll generate that amount

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
these fuels they'll generate that amount
of<00:01:39.299> redstone<00:01:39.600> flux<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> might<00:01:41.009> initially

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
of redstone flux so that might initially

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.740 
of redstone flux so that might initially
be<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> little<00:01:41.759> confusing<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.390> here's<00:01:42.630> an

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
be a little confusing so here's an

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.960 
be a little confusing so here's an
example<00:01:42.840> I'll<00:01:43.380> combine<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.250> gunpowder<00:01:44.700> which

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
example I'll combine one gunpowder which

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.020 
example I'll combine one gunpowder which

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
this lead stone energy cell which is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.530 
this lead stone energy cell which is

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
collected as we can see this combination

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.539 
collected as we can see this combination
created<00:02:00.360> 16,000<00:02:01.229> redstone<00:02:01.560> flux<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.430> is

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
created 16,000 redstone flux which is

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.490 
created 16,000 redstone flux which is
equal<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.060> total<00:02:03.420> yield<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:04.140> bucket

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
equal to the total yield of one bucket

equal to the total yield of one bucket
of<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> sludge<00:02:05.180> going<00:02:06.180> back<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> Dynamo

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
of the sludge going back to the Dynamo

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.719 
of the sludge going back to the Dynamo
we<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:08.039> outputting<00:02:08.580> any

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
we can see that it's not outputting any

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.820 
we can see that it's not outputting any
power<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.360> there<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.599> no<00:02:09.720> more<00:02:09.750> sludge<00:02:10.200> there's

still some gunpowder left however this

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.850 
still some gunpowder left however this
gunpowder<00:02:13.200> will<00:02:13.349> stay<00:02:13.560> here

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
gunpowder will stay here

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.410 
gunpowder will stay here
available<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.580> use<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.180> will<00:02:15.270> not

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420

deplete by itself it initially had a

deplete by itself it initially had a
total<00:02:18.240> yield<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.860> 160,000<00:02:19.860> redstone<00:02:20.220> flux

total yield of 160,000 redstone flux

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.610 
total yield of 160,000 redstone flux
then<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.210> combined<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.630> with<00:02:21.780> one<00:02:22.080> bucket<00:02:22.530> of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
then we combined it with one bucket of

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.710 
then we combined it with one bucket of
sludge<00:02:22.890> after<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> sludge<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.300> completely

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
sludge after the sludge was completely

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.330 
sludge after the sludge was completely
used<00:02:24.900> up<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.320> gunpowder's<00:02:25.830> yield<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.190> now

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
used up the gunpowder's yield is now

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.410 
used up the gunpowder's yield is now
reduced<00:02:26.730> by<00:02:26.940> 16,000<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.730> 144,000<00:02:29.730> if<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.270> add

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
reduced by 16,000 to 144,000 if I add

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.820 
reduced by 16,000 to 144,000 if I add
another<00:02:30.660> bucket<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.110> sludge<00:02:31.380> which<00:02:31.680> will

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
another bucket of sludge which will

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.040 
another bucket of sludge which will
quickly<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.250> used<00:02:32.430> up<00:02:32.700> another<00:02:33.210> 16,000

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050

redstone<00:02:34.410> flux<00:02:34.620> will<00:02:34.890> be<00:02:34.980> generated<00:02:35.490> this

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
redstone flux will be generated this

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.820 
redstone flux will be generated this
will<00:02:36.360> decrease<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.870> gunpowder's<00:02:37.410> yield<00:02:37.620> by

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
will decrease the gunpowder's yield by

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.120 
will decrease the gunpowder's yield by
16,000<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.970> 128<00:02:39.810> thousand<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.740> can<00:02:40.980> then<00:02:41.070> be

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
16,000 to 128 thousand this can then be

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.830 
16,000 to 128 thousand this can then be
repeated<00:02:41.520> until<00:02:41.820> its<00:02:42.060> yield<00:02:42.270> reaches<00:02:42.600> zero

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
repeated until its yield reaches zero

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.590 
repeated until its yield reaches zero
and<00:02:43.110> then<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.320> Gunpowder<00:02:43.740> will<00:02:43.920> run<00:02:44.100> out

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
and then the Gunpowder will run out

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.730 
and then the Gunpowder will run out
