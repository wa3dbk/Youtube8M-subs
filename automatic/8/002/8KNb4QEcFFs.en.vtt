parachutes follow immediately and you
will<00:01:01.550> be<00:01:01.670> able<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:01.970> see<00:01:02.240> how<00:01:02.540> one<00:01:02.900> deflates<00:01:03.410> and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
will be able to see how one deflates and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.859 
will be able to see how one deflates and
the<00:01:04.250> second<00:01:04.640> remains<00:01:04.939> only<00:01:05.329> partially

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
inflated right before water impact if

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.719 
inflated right before water impact if

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
you look closely at the nozzle you'll

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.819 
you look closely at the nozzle you'll
see<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.119> jettison<00:01:11.600> or<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.810> nozzle<00:01:12.049> extension

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829
