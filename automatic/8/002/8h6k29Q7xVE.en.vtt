classification looking at the failure of
Aristotle's<00:00:28.890> classification<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:30.210> what<00:00:30.420> did

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
Aristotle's classification so what did

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.990 
Aristotle's classification so what did
he<00:00:30.660> try<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.230> he<00:00:31.380> kept<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.769> very<00:00:31.920> simple<00:00:32.070> he

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
he try to do he kept it very simple he

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.170 
he try to do he kept it very simple he
just<00:00:33.590> introduced<00:00:34.590> two<00:00:35.160> kingdoms<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
just introduced two kingdoms one is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.780 
just introduced two kingdoms one is
planting<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.559> other<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.070> Animalia

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
planting and the other one is Animalia

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.720 
planting and the other one is Animalia
so<00:00:39.750> he<00:00:39.960> said<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.530> whatever<00:00:41.040> living

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so he said that whatever living

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.049 
so he said that whatever living
organisms<00:00:42.420> exist<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.379> earth<00:00:43.559> they<00:00:44.399> have

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
organisms exist on this earth they have

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.209 
organisms exist on this earth they have
to<00:00:45.420> fall<00:00:45.750> under<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.770> these<00:00:47.160> categories

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
to fall under one of these categories

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.439 
to fall under one of these categories
when<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.149> plant<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.050> other<00:00:49.289> one<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.590> animals

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
when is plant the other one is animals

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.750 
when is plant the other one is animals
now<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> kingdom<00:00:52.050> plantae<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:52.980> sorts<00:00:53.670> of

now in the kingdom plantae all sorts of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.049 
now in the kingdom plantae all sorts of
plants<00:00:54.210> were<00:00:54.390> included<00:00:55.230> being<00:00:55.770> factors<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.879> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
plants were included being factors be it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.170 
plants were included being factors be it
grasses<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:58.199> tall<00:00:58.649> big<00:00:58.980> trees<00:00:59.309> or<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.969> it

grasses which tall big trees or be it
the<00:01:00.300> aquatic<00:01:00.840> plants<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.829> sorts<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the aquatic plants so all sorts of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.149 
the aquatic plants so all sorts of
plants<00:01:02.820> where<00:01:03.510> made<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.350> fall<00:01:04.589> under<00:01:04.860> this

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
plants where made to fall under this

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.730 
plants where made to fall under this
category<00:01:05.400> Plantae<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.330> Animalia<00:01:07.320> would

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
category Plantae and Animalia would

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.649 
category Plantae and Animalia would
include<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> animals<00:01:09.000> starting<00:01:09.450> from<00:01:09.600> a

like bacteria viruses fungi or the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
like bacteria viruses fungi or the
aquatic<00:01:17.939> animals<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.630> human<00:01:18.990> needs<00:01:19.170> so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
aquatic animals or human needs so

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.469 
aquatic animals or human needs so
everything<00:01:20.130> will<00:01:20.280> fall<00:01:20.549> under<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.210> category

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
everything will fall under this category

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.490 
everything will fall under this category
a<00:01:21.869> minute

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
a minute

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.910 
a minute
so<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.549> was<00:01:23.850> given<00:01:24.720> by<00:01:24.860> Linnaeus<00:01:25.860> lineage<00:01:27.920> so

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
so that was given by Linnaeus lineage so

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
so that was given by Linnaeus lineage so
now<00:01:29.900> was<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.200> successful<00:01:32.540> even<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.780> mode

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
now was this successful even this mode

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.069 
now was this successful even this mode
of<00:01:34.409> classification<00:01:35.280> was<00:01:35.520> also<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> failure<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
of classification was also a failure and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.740 
of classification was also a failure and
the<00:01:37.560> primary<00:01:38.100> reason<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.579> failure<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the primary reason for failure was that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.530 
the primary reason for failure was that
the<00:01:40.320> organisms<00:01:41.159> which<00:01:41.430> exist<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.360> earth

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the organisms which exist on this earth

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.410 
the organisms which exist on this earth
are<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.200> only<00:01:43.619> huge<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.189> number<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.210> also

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
are not only huge in number but also

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.660 
are not only huge in number but also
they<00:01:45.930> are<00:01:46.079> very<00:01:46.320> very<00:01:46.590> diverse<00:01:46.860> they<00:01:47.399> are<00:01:47.490> very

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
they are very very diverse they are very

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.530 
they are very very diverse they are very
different<00:01:48.149> from<00:01:48.299> each<00:01:48.479> other<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:51.360> was

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
different from each other so what was

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.630 
different from each other so what was
the<00:01:51.720> basis<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.590> two<00:01:53.159> kingdom

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the basis of this two kingdom

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.350 
the basis of this two kingdom
classification<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.540> mean<00:01:54.810> why<00:01:55.259> did<00:01:56.329> Linnaeus

Linnaeus<00:02:50.530> thought<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.189> dividing<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.939> living

two<00:02:56.500> groups<00:02:56.829> were<00:02:57.099> huge<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:58.120> he<00:02:58.239> thought<00:02:58.419> let's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
two groups were huge so he thought let's

two groups were huge so he thought let's

about<00:04:26.430> whether<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.270> is<00:04:27.420> a<00:04:27.450> eukaryote<00:04:28.080> a

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
about whether it is a eukaryote a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.710 
about whether it is a eukaryote a
prokaryote<00:04:28.740> similarly<00:04:29.700> we<00:04:29.910> are<00:04:29.940> not<00:04:30.270> bothered

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
prokaryote similarly we are not bothered

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.960 
prokaryote similarly we are not bothered
about<00:04:30.840> whether<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.530> is<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.800> unicellular<00:04:32.550> or

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
about whether it is a unicellular or

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.150 
about whether it is a unicellular or
multicellular<00:04:33.050> whether<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.320> organism<00:04:35.010> is

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
multicellular whether that organism is

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.270 
multicellular whether that organism is
made<00:04:35.400> up<00:04:35.760> of<00:04:35.850> one<00:04:36.180> cell<00:04:36.570> or<00:04:36.780> multiple<00:04:37.560> cells<00:04:37.830> so

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
made up of one cell or multiple cells so

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.430 
made up of one cell or multiple cells so
it<00:04:38.550> will<00:04:38.730> happen<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.360> we<00:04:39.720> will<00:04:39.900> end<00:04:40.110> up

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
it will happen that we will end up

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.890 
it will happen that we will end up
putting<00:04:40.970> eukaryotes<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.150> prokaryotes<00:04:42.240> in

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
putting eukaryotes and prokaryotes in

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.200 
putting eukaryotes and prokaryotes in
the<00:04:42.990> same<00:04:43.200> group<00:04:43.500> or<00:04:43.650> we<00:04:44.310> might<00:04:44.490> also<00:04:44.790> end<00:04:44.970> up

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
the same group or we might also end up

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.520 
the same group or we might also end up
putting<00:04:45.420> you<00:04:45.660> unicellular<00:04:46.260> and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
putting you unicellular and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.920 
putting you unicellular and
multicellular<00:04:46.620> in<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.520> same<00:04:47.730> group<00:04:48.000> now<00:04:48.720> when

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
multicellular in the same group now when

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.020 
multicellular in the same group now when
I<00:04:48.960> am<00:04:49.080> saying<00:04:49.380> in<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.530> same<00:04:49.710> group<00:04:50.070> we<00:04:50.520> expect

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
I am saying in the same group we expect

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.910 
I am saying in the same group we expect
that<00:04:51.210> organisms<00:04:51.870> in<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.110> same<00:04:52.320> group<00:04:52.650> will

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
that organisms in the same group will

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.640 
that organisms in the same group will
have<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.370> lot<00:04:53.640> of<00:04:53.670> similarities<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:55.110> just

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
have a lot of similarities so just

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.440 
have a lot of similarities so just
imagine<00:04:55.890> if<00:04:56.220> two<00:04:56.400> organisms<00:04:56.790> one<00:04:57.270> is

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
imagine if two organisms one is

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.120 
imagine if two organisms one is
unicellular<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.470> other<00:04:58.590> one<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:58.980> like

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
unicellular and the other one is like

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.430 
unicellular and the other one is like
this<00:04:59.340> editor<00:04:59.760> and<00:05:00.060> if<00:05:00.480> both<00:05:00.750> of<00:05:00.960> them<00:05:01.169> are<00:05:01.320> in

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
this editor and if both of them are in

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.620 
this editor and if both of them are in
the<00:05:01.590> same<00:05:01.800> group<00:05:01.980> do<00:05:02.669> you<00:05:02.730> think<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.480> they

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
the same group do you think that they

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.260 
the same group do you think that they
are<00:05:03.720> going<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.050> share<00:05:04.290> any<00:05:04.560> similarities<00:05:05.370> no

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
are going to share any similarities no

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.570 
are going to share any similarities no
right<00:05:06.690> because<00:05:07.260> when<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.770> organism<00:05:08.070> is<00:05:08.370> made

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
right because when the organism is made

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.700 
right because when the organism is made
up<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:08.940> one<00:05:09.210> cell<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:11.280> entire<00:05:11.820> process<00:05:12.710> and

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
up of one cell so the entire process and

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.950 
up of one cell so the entire process and
I<00:05:13.980> tired<00:05:14.430> lifecycle<00:05:15.390> of<00:05:15.480> that<00:05:15.660> organism

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
I tired lifecycle of that organism

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.010 
I tired lifecycle of that organism
changes<00:05:16.590> completely<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.940> a<00:05:17.970> unicellular<00:05:18.450> and

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
changes completely so a unicellular and

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.230 
changes completely so a unicellular and
multicellular<00:05:19.820> distinction<00:05:20.820> should<00:05:21.030> be<00:05:21.090> made

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
multicellular distinction should be made

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.890 
multicellular distinction should be made
similarly<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.020> eukaryotic<00:05:22.890> and<00:05:23.070> prokaryotic

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
similarly a eukaryotic and prokaryotic

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.020 
similarly a eukaryotic and prokaryotic
distinction<00:05:24.900> has<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.169> be<00:05:25.380> there<00:05:25.729> there<00:05:26.729> was<00:05:26.850> no

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
distinction has to be there there was no

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.330 
distinction has to be there there was no
distinction<00:05:27.479> between<00:05:28.160> photosynthetic<00:05:29.160> and

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
distinction between photosynthetic and

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.780 
distinction between photosynthetic and
non-photosynthetic<00:05:30.380> so<00:05:31.380> in<00:05:31.590> this<00:05:31.890> case<00:05:32.190> there

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
non-photosynthetic so in this case there

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.180 
non-photosynthetic so in this case there
was<00:05:32.970> no<00:05:33.200> consideration<00:05:34.200> given<00:05:34.410> to<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.979> cell

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
was no consideration given to the cell

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.270 
was no consideration given to the cell
structure<00:05:35.550> or<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.660> number<00:05:37.620> of<00:05:37.740> cells<00:05:38.040> present

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
structure or the number of cells present

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.710 
structure or the number of cells present
in<00:05:38.610> our<00:05:38.729> organism<00:05:39.120> or<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:40.710> food<00:05:40.979> habit

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
in our organism or the food habit

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.690 
in our organism or the food habit
secondly<00:05:42.720> many<00:05:43.050> organisms<00:05:43.560> do<00:05:44.220> not<00:05:44.340> belong<00:05:44.640> to

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
secondly many organisms do not belong to

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.510 
secondly many organisms do not belong to
any<00:05:45.090> of<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.570> two<00:05:45.750> kingdoms<00:05:46.050> like<00:05:46.520> bacteria

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
any of the two kingdoms like bacteria

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.600 
any of the two kingdoms like bacteria
fungi<00:05:48.030> viruses<00:05:48.200> so<00:05:49.200> it<00:05:49.500> was<00:05:49.680> also<00:05:49.890> seen<00:05:50.280> that

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
fungi viruses so it was also seen that

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.420 
fungi viruses so it was also seen that
there<00:05:51.090> are<00:05:51.270> some<00:05:51.479> organisms<00:05:52.260> which<00:05:52.740> did<00:05:53.220> not

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
there are some organisms which did not

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.300 
there are some organisms which did not
resemble<00:05:54.200> which<00:05:55.200> was<00:05:55.380> thereby<00:05:55.590> neither<00:05:56.040> the

plants<00:05:56.729> nor<00:05:57.180> the<00:05:57.390> animals<00:05:57.900> so<00:05:58.260> they<00:05:58.410> were

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
plants nor the animals so they were

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.580 
plants nor the animals so they were
