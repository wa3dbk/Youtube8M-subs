secret is instead of having to you know
get<00:01:16.420> down<00:01:16.690> there<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.050> so<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:18.130> try<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.610> figure

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
get down there and so and try to figure

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.469 
get down there and so and try to figure
out<00:01:19.030> okay<00:01:19.420> what's<00:01:19.630> goin<00:01:19.930> on<00:01:20.939> take<00:01:21.939> the<00:01:22.090> fabric

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
out okay what's goin on take the fabric

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.330 
out okay what's goin on take the fabric
up<00:01:22.630> fold<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.079> in<00:01:23.200> half<00:01:23.229> and<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:26.219> loop<00:01:27.219> it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
up fold it in half and then loop it

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.749 
up fold it in half and then loop it
through<00:01:27.399> your<00:01:28.079> loop<00:01:29.079> it<00:01:29.229> through<00:01:29.259> your<00:01:29.500> bottom

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
through your loop it through your bottom

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.149 
through your loop it through your bottom
and<00:01:30.759> then<00:01:31.060> I<00:01:31.090> loop<00:01:31.299> it<00:01:31.450> through<00:01:31.479> your<00:01:31.750> button

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and then I loop it through your button

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.980 
and then I loop it through your button
let<00:01:33.159> it<00:01:33.280> dangle<00:01:33.460> there<00:01:33.820> it'll<00:01:34.360> find<00:01:34.630> its<00:01:34.750> way

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
let it dangle there it'll find its way

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.490 
let it dangle there it'll find its way
home<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.990> loop<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:39.070> through<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.369> way

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
home and then loop it through this way

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.260 
home and then loop it through this way
so<00:01:41.579> push<00:01:42.579> it<00:01:42.729> through

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
so push it through

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.950 
so push it through
and<00:01:44.450> then<00:01:44.899> through<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:45.829> fold<00:01:46.840> through<00:01:47.840> the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
and then through the fold through the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.359 
and then through the fold through the
button<00:01:50.920> up<00:01:51.920> through<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.670> fold<00:01:54.070> now<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.130> want

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
button up through the fold now you want

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.429 
button up through the fold now you want
to<00:01:55.460> do<00:01:55.549> this<00:01:55.729> at<00:01:55.880> least<00:01:56.119> five<00:01:56.689> times<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:57.409> that

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
to do this at least five times so that

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.139 
to do this at least five times so that
your<00:01:57.770> button<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.189> nice<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.549> secure<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:02.000> can

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
your button is nice and secure you can

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.080 
your button is nice and secure you can
do<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.329> more<00:02:02.569> I<00:02:03.159> probably<00:02:04.159> suggest<00:02:04.670> not<00:02:04.789> doing

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
do it more I probably suggest not doing

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.980 
do it more I probably suggest not doing
it<00:02:05.209> less<00:02:05.390> because<00:02:05.539> it<00:02:05.659> going<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.840> lose<00:02:05.959> that

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
it less because it going to lose that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.969 
it less because it going to lose that
button<00:02:06.439> again<00:02:07.750> all<00:02:08.750> right<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.560> think<00:02:09.860> this

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
button again all right so I think this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.910 
button again all right so I think this
is<00:02:10.160> number<00:02:10.369> five<00:02:11.080> but<00:02:12.080> through<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.620> button

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
is number five but through the button

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.630 
is number five but through the button
and<00:02:13.190> then<00:02:13.519> through<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:15.200> fabric<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:16.310> want<00:02:16.430> to

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
and then through the fabric you want to

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.319 
and then through the fabric you want to
tie<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:16.880> off<00:02:17.349> meaning<00:02:18.519> anchor<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:19.640> make<00:02:20.180> sure

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
tie it off meaning anchor it make sure

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.270 
tie it off meaning anchor it make sure
it<00:02:20.420> doesn't<00:02:20.660> go<00:02:20.780> anywhere<00:02:20.989> do<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.010> three<00:02:22.250> times

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
it doesn't go anywhere do it three times

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:31.150 
it doesn't go anywhere do it three times
just<00:02:22.910> through<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.599> fabric<00:02:25.870> one

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.090 

two

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.650 

three<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.120> then<00:02:37.630> cut<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.260> off<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:40.090> way<00:02:40.360> when

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
three and then cut it off that way when

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.010 
three and then cut it off that way when
you<00:02:40.840> flatten<00:02:41.740> your<00:02:41.950> fabric<00:02:42.370> again<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:43.780> nice
