question and when we do is we throw
purple<00:01:26.840> dye<00:01:26.990> which<00:01:27.230> is<00:01:27.320> harmless<00:01:27.650> into<00:01:28.130> the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
purple dye which is harmless into the

purple dye which is harmless into the
water<00:01:28.460> da<00:01:28.940> goes<00:01:29.210> wherever<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.720> water<00:01:29.930> goes

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
water da goes wherever the water goes

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
and it's an easy way to spot the rip

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.420 
and it's an easy way to spot the rip
well<00:01:33.050> let<00:01:33.200> me<00:01:33.320> tell<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.560> what<00:01:33.710> rips<00:01:33.950> are<00:01:34.190> not

are strong narrow currents that flow

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.360 
are strong narrow currents that flow

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
like that signals for the lifeguards and

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.289 
like that signals for the lifeguards and
the<00:02:44.409> lifesavers<00:02:44.889> to<00:02:45.129> come<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.430> get<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.790> what

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
the lifesavers to come and get you what

the lifesavers to come and get you what
you<00:02:46.329> could<00:02:46.510> also<00:02:46.689> do<00:02:46.989> if<00:02:47.200> you're<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.349> good

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
you could also do if you're a good

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.740 
you could also do if you're a good
swimmer<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:48.159> you<00:02:48.310> could<00:02:48.430> look<00:02:48.549> around<00:02:48.909> if<00:02:49.209> you

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
swimmer is you could look around if you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.479 
swimmer is you could look around if you
can<00:02:49.900> see<00:02:50.109> the<00:02:50.230> sides<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.889> RIP<00:02:51.099> which<00:02:51.370> is

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
can see the sides of the RIP which is

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.099 
can see the sides of the RIP which is
usually<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.969> shallower<00:02:52.359> water<00:02:52.689> where<00:02:52.959> the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
usually the shallower water where the

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.899 
usually the shallower water where the
waves<00:02:53.349> are<00:02:53.530> breaking<00:02:53.680> lot<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.579> white<00:02:54.730> water

swim<00:02:55.780> towards<00:02:56.169> that<00:02:56.379> area<00:02:56.650> white<00:02:57.370> water<00:02:57.609> is

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
swim towards that area white water is

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.670 
swim towards that area white water is
good<00:02:58.000> because<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.449> means<00:02:58.480> it's<00:02:58.780> shallow<00:02:59.079> you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
good because it means it's shallow you

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.349 
good because it means it's shallow you
can<00:02:59.799> maybe<00:02:59.949> stand<00:03:00.310> up<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.879> also<00:03:01.000> whitewater

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
can maybe stand up and also whitewater

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.390 
can maybe stand up and also whitewater
brings<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.959> back<00:03:02.109> to<00:03:02.169> the<00:03:02.379> beach<00:03:02.650> what<00:03:03.310> you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
brings you back to the beach what you

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.039 
brings you back to the beach what you
should<00:03:03.459> never<00:03:03.760> do<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.180> swim<00:03:04.419> against<00:03:04.689> the<00:03:04.780> rib

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
should never do is swim against the rib

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.170 
should never do is swim against the rib
these<00:03:05.560> things<00:03:05.829> feel<00:03:06.010> pretty<00:03:06.250> fast<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.879> you'll

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
these things feel pretty fast and you'll

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.610 
these things feel pretty fast and you'll
just<00:03:07.329> find<00:03:07.480> yourselves<00:03:07.840> going<00:03:08.109> backwards

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
just find yourselves going backwards

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.709 
just find yourselves going backwards
swimming<00:03:09.159> fast<00:03:09.370> or<00:03:09.609> getting<00:03:09.879> tired<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.419> then

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
swimming fast or getting tired and then

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.720 
swimming fast or getting tired and then
you'll<00:03:10.840> start<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.169> get<00:03:11.319> scared<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.549> go

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
you'll start to get scared so just go

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.429 
you'll start to get scared so just go
with<00:03:12.909> the<00:03:12.939> flow<00:03:13.030> signal<00:03:13.840> for<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:13.989> lifeguard

that<00:03:18.609> rips<00:03:18.909> are<00:03:19.060> dangerous<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.719> that<00:03:19.900> they

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
that rips are dangerous is that they

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.899 
that rips are dangerous is that they
flow<00:03:20.319> faster<00:03:20.859> than<00:03:21.009> people<00:03:21.129> can<00:03:21.400> swim<00:03:21.549> it

flow faster than people can swim it

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.879 
flow faster than people can swim it
sometimes<00:03:22.419> they<00:03:22.659> can<00:03:22.720> flow<00:03:23.019> faster<00:03:23.530> than<00:03:23.680> even

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
sometimes they can flow faster than even

sometimes they can flow faster than even
Olympic<00:03:24.250> swimmers<00:03:24.639> rips<00:03:25.389> are<00:03:25.509> most<00:03:25.750> dangerous

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:26.229 
Olympic swimmers rips are most dangerous

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:27.869 
Olympic swimmers rips are most dangerous
because<00:03:26.560> they<00:03:26.739> actually<00:03:27.189> look<00:03:27.519> like<00:03:27.549> the

because they actually look like the

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.390 
because they actually look like the

of the surf well we've just had an

sudden trip is pulsed out where those

sudden trip is pulsed out where those
surfers<00:04:04.959> are<00:04:05.109> you<00:04:05.259> can<00:04:05.379> see<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:06.099> chopped

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
surfers are you can see the the chopped

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.729 
surfers are you can see the the chopped
up<00:04:06.699> messy<00:04:07.209> whitewater<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:08.049> is<00:04:08.199> gone<00:04:08.379> out<00:04:08.590> and

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
up messy whitewater this is gone out and

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.800 
up messy whitewater this is gone out and
then<00:04:09.129> it's<00:04:09.250> just<00:04:09.340> stopped<00:04:09.729> and<00:04:09.969> that's<00:04:10.599> when

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
then it's just stopped and that's when

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.539 
then it's just stopped and that's when
one<00:04:11.049> common<00:04:11.439> thing<00:04:11.560> about<00:04:11.739> these<00:04:11.889> flash<00:04:12.189> rips

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
one common thing about these flash rips

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.699 
one common thing about these flash rips
is<00:04:12.699> that<00:04:12.879> they<00:04:13.000> can<00:04:13.060> suddenly<00:04:13.449> occur<00:04:13.900> anywhere

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
is that they can suddenly occur anywhere

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:15.929 
is that they can suddenly occur anywhere
where<00:04:15.039> there's<00:04:15.219> suddenly<00:04:15.400> been<00:04:15.639> a<00:04:15.669> large

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
where there's suddenly been a large

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.729 
where there's suddenly been a large
group<00:04:16.180> of<00:04:16.299> waves<00:04:16.509> breaking<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.500> pushes

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
group of waves breaking and it pushes

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.149 
group of waves breaking and it pushes
the<00:04:18.009> rip<00:04:18.130> out<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.519> then<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.539> disappears

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
the rip out and then it disappears

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.990 
the rip out and then it disappears
finally<00:04:21.159> we<00:04:21.310> get<00:04:21.459> something<00:04:21.699> called<00:04:21.940> a

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
finally we get something called a

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.240 
finally we get something called a
permanent<00:04:22.479> rip<00:04:22.659> or<00:04:22.840> headland<00:04:23.440> rip<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.800> these

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
permanent rip or headland rip and these

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.980 
permanent rip or headland rip and these
are<00:04:24.490> rips<00:04:24.699> that<00:04:24.849> are<00:04:24.969> pushed<00:04:25.300> against<00:04:25.900> the

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
are rips that are pushed against the

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.659 
are rips that are pushed against the
headland<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.560> they're<00:04:26.919> they're<00:04:27.130> almost<00:04:27.370> all

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
headland and they're they're almost all

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:27.990 
headland and they're they're almost all
the

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000 
the
on<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.750> it's<00:04:28.870> another<00:04:29.050> good<00:04:29.290> reason<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.740> always

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
on so it's another good reason to always

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.440 
on so it's another good reason to always
be<00:04:30.130> careful<00:04:30.370> when<00:04:30.700> you're<00:04:30.790> swimming<00:04:31.030> close<00:04:31.300> to

be careful when you're swimming close to

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.410 
be careful when you're swimming close to
head<00:04:31.600> lands<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:31.990> rocks<00:04:33.030> if<00:04:34.030> there's<00:04:34.300> no
