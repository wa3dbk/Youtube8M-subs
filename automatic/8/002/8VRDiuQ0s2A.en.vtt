00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.510
 More than 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.110
 To 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.110
 No matter who comes to cleaning 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.610
 Always put on top 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.920
 To want to leave good results 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.510
 Because I think 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.970
 Who is trying to complete but good 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.829
 I always think that I am a rival 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.750
 Always attack 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:48.880
 I think I ran and the route is great 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.600
 Well set time or router's 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.910
 So great 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.150
 It seems tough, so that side 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.340
 To be able to put everything on time 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:07.530
 I 'd like to run for a while at first or pace to break the bridge . With rude 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:11.600
 For example, if say shorten it or is a 1-minute tiny to cause and 60 seconds in a test 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.600
 Because there is a pretty hard part 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.550
 I feel like running for 6 days 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.460
 The route 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.140
 From the beginning 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.110
 I want to run at a faster pace, even after the first lap 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:32.100
 If it is the fourth 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:37.759
 I think that it is good for the first column, but I'll come back from the second column because 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.759
 Well I think that the route will be more important than the test 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.400
 land 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:02.220
 Say Na you are able to run a good feeling because quite bike finish was good 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:06.560
 Of this yourself microphone if there is a high puzzled by many things because it was the first time I thought last year 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.560
 It takes a lot of time to match the style 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.460
 I wonder if it affected 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.380
 And when time and bad Well after all strangeness'd end out waves buy and not finished bike 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.730
 I'm pretty clear 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.180
 Well here is this year's 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.100
 Well Well bike is held together color 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.740
 It is said to wonder if being able to run as I thought 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.630
 the first time I why not say what it is and the other this time towards ac 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.420
 Already 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:41.980
 If you look at the number of turns, one lap is long 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.980
 Anyway Kato I think I'm going to be a race that looks like a normal salt Tiro 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:51.200
 I feel the Well seems this say 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.200
 Well , so maybe it's okay or not 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:07.480
 There was also a recommendation from my husband, but once in a while it 's also good for Enduro before 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:12.490
 fine from that time and we have that war is not in the way of jncc 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:15.730
 I love the towards the Well but that bike itself, I like Enduro 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.100
 The feeling that I want to do well 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.360
 Reco 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.170
 Konno Fantic 's machine from scuderia rana 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.090
 The 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:30.120
 I was able to lend, so I had a good opportunity so this year 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.300
 I felt like I'm going to challenge 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:40.050
 I thought I got on the fantic but it was great 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:46.770
 Well the corner is also easy to turn and the thin corner is really that- 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:48.740
 And after the part that you Do not easy to ride also about can feel yourself also power 250 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.670
 In that 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:58.160
 Well so is straight and so is climbing 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.450
 There are so many parts that can really be helped and it's great that you can ride your feet 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.610
 I think it is a machine 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:07.930
 Well after all ene throughout Rotoyuu the competition itself is south of the motocross and trial 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:13.239
 Because I think that stuck was, such as competition 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.260
 Well, you can use the speed of the motocross in the speedy part of the equipment. 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.260
 I think 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.290
 a 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:24.110
 I think it will be possible to use the trial cure technique for spare and land areas 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.770
 Because there is a part there 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.380
 Hmmm good thing 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.809
 Oh Kedomo I think that's what can be exhibited 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.159
 Yes you 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:40.510
 There is a part that you can do with 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:44.590
 Aon time the first time a real 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:51.130
 That's right I'm terribly uneasy, but not at all 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:52.930
 Rules supposed to Mattel this time because the Well did not grasp the rule until a little out 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.250
 Is positive 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.250
 Good luck and remember 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.780
 Yes this time 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:07.620
 I feel it 's not know and do not try doing is just fear that all right kana is I have a 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.230
 Well attractive of the Well on-time Kedomo 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:17.160
 Listen from various people 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:20.390
 As I received the impression that I was the captain again, I enjoyed the semitone time by enjoying it tomorrow. 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.390
 I think I want
