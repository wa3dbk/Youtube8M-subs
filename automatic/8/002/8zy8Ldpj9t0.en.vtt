that<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.170> seen<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.530> previous<00:01:37.560> screen

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that we have seen in previous screen

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.670 
that we have seen in previous screen
shots<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:39.150> example<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> yellow<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
shots for example the yellow one and the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.370 
shots for example the yellow one and the
kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.400> military<00:01:41.610> Chuck<00:01:42.180> ads<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.750> back<00:01:43.079> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
kind of military Chuck ads be back and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.139 
kind of military Chuck ads be back and
we've<00:01:43.829> never<00:01:43.860> seen<00:01:44.220> before<00:01:44.280> off<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
we've never seen before off the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.789 
we've never seen before off the
Lamborghini<00:01:45.720> looking<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.200> which<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.380> yellow

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
Lamborghini looking one which is yellow

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.920 
Lamborghini looking one which is yellow
on<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> guess<00:01:47.549> that's<00:01:47.790> pretty<00:01:47.970> cool<00:01:48.270> event

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
on so I guess that's pretty cool event

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
on so I guess that's pretty cool event
to<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> left<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.680> car<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.610> one

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
to the left of that car we do have one

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.460 
to the left of that car we do have one
that<00:01:50.970> kind<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.270> looks<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.570> Bentley<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.259> if

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that kind of looks like a Bentley so if

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.630 
that kind of looks like a Bentley so if
they<00:01:52.560> all<00:01:52.710> look<00:01:52.920> Cooper

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
they all look Cooper

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.930 
they all look Cooper
only<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.909> my<00:01:54.060> opinion<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.840> here<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.700> do

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
only in my opinion and here then we do

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.360 
only in my opinion and here then we do
have<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.390> map<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:57.930> medicine<00:01:58.650> now<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.220> to

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
have the map of medicine now just to

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.370 
have the map of medicine now just to
throw<00:01:59.580> it<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.909> there<00:02:00.090> guys<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.780> isn't<00:02:01.080> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
throw it out there guys this isn't the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.130 
throw it out there guys this isn't the
map<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.520> goes<00:02:02.790> free<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.869> guys<00:02:03.990> can

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
map of just goes free as you guys can

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.810 
map of just goes free as you guys can
see<00:02:04.200> or<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.890> play<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.430> cause<00:02:05.490> 2

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
see or if you have play just cause 2

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.890 
see or if you have play just cause 2
should<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.119> say<00:02:06.330> then<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> would

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
should I say then you would

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.320 
should I say then you would
automatically<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.060> map

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
automatically know this is the map

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.960 
automatically know this is the map
exactly<00:02:09.600> for<00:02:10.350> just<00:02:10.679> cause<00:02:10.950> 2<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.640> guess<00:02:11.940> it's

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
exactly for just cause 2 so I guess it's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
exactly for just cause 2 so I guess it's
kind<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.450> like<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.690> little<00:02:12.840> teaser<00:02:13.260> and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
kind of like a little teaser and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.460 
kind of like a little teaser and
basically<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.660> map<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
basically this is just a map of the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.560 
basically this is just a map of the
whole<00:02:16.740> map<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.760> cool<00:02:17.940> spring<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.360> guess

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
whole map of just cool spring I guess

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.510 
whole map of just cool spring I guess
meda<00:02:18.870> see<00:02:19.080> which<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.650> cool<00:02:19.890> kind<00:02:20.489> of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
meda see which is really cool kind of

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.280 
meda see which is really cool kind of
like<00:02:20.670> GTA<00:02:21.090> 5<00:02:21.330> when<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.600> purchase<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.080> game

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
like GTA 5 when you purchase the game

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.990 
like GTA 5 when you purchase the game
and<00:02:22.470> then<00:02:22.560> they<00:02:22.650> give<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.130> whole<00:02:23.340> map<00:02:23.700> as

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and then they give you the whole map as

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.900 
and then they give you the whole map as
a<00:02:24.060> poster<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:25.020> basically<00:02:25.860> bad<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.489> really

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
a poster it's basically bad so I really

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.400 
a poster it's basically bad so I really
like<00:02:27.120> pay<00:02:27.330> some<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> would<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.350> to

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
again one of those little models like

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.820 
again one of those little models like
you<00:02:45.420> would<00:02:45.600> put<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:45.900> your<00:02:46.050> desk<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.500> thought

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
you would put on your desk but I thought

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.830 
you would put on your desk but I thought
it<00:02:46.980> looks<00:02:47.160> really<00:02:47.519> really<00:02:47.790> awesome<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.450> maybe

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
it looks really really awesome and maybe

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.020 
it looks really really awesome and maybe
you<00:02:48.989> can<00:02:49.260> extend<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.980> hook<00:02:50.250> at<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.519> end<00:02:50.730> a

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
you can extend the hook at the end a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.340 
you can extend the hook at the end a
little<00:02:51.269> bit<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.570> don't<00:02:51.780> really<00:02:51.900> know<00:02:52.170> but

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
little bit I don't really know but

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.470 
little bit I don't really know but
regardless<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.400> looks<00:02:53.580> absolutely<00:02:53.760> insane

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
regardless it looks absolutely insane

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.330 
regardless it looks absolutely insane
and<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.690> really<00:02:55.050> did<00:02:55.230> like<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.800> as<00:02:55.920> i<00:02:56.040> said<00:02:56.070> i

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250

when<00:05:06.560> they<00:05:06.740> will<00:05:06.770> close<00:05:07.250> vistas<00:05:07.849> or<00:05:07.880> voting

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
when they will close vistas or voting

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.270 
when they will close vistas or voting
thing<00:05:08.720> up<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.080> taking<00:05:09.470> all<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.800> boats<00:05:10.010> and

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
thing up and taking all the boats and

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.189 
thing up and taking all the boats and
then<00:05:10.400> decide<00:05:10.789> but<00:05:11.330> i<00:05:11.360> guess<00:05:11.720> i<00:05:11.870> will<00:05:11.930> probably

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
then decide but i guess i will probably

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.409 
then decide but i guess i will probably
be<00:05:12.650> in<00:05:12.800> a<00:05:12.860> couple<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.250> weeks<00:05:13.310> and<00:05:13.820> then<00:05:14.180> my

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
be in a couple of weeks and then my

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:15.820 
be in a couple of weeks and then my
guess<00:05:14.659> we'll<00:05:14.870> just<00:05:14.900> find<00:05:15.260> out<00:05:15.470> when<00:05:15.680> the

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
guess we'll just find out when the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.710 
guess we'll just find out when the
collectors<00:05:16.250> edition<00:05:16.340> will<00:05:16.789> be<00:05:16.909> releasing<00:05:17.300> and
