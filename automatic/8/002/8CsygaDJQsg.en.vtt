00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.320
 Pokemon 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.990

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.000
 that is the solution to play more games 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.190
 but the daytime video is going to drink from 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.550

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.879
 interesting things with this box 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.470

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.140
 desk 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.750
 little box that came to the United States does 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.030
 some days I already broke it because the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.700
 curiosity made me able to perceive and in 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.950
 good conditions but as you can see 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.090

 a little note 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.480
 really transparent and smaller than 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.480
 a normal game 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.590

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.569
 for that I have below my 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.580
 nintendo gamecube save from a friend 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.919

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:16.230
 if it was bobo cube that unlocking the 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.230
 nintendo jenkins 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:23.069

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.069
 larger 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.710
 of end also being fine 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:34.030
 is graphically made by you very well 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.030
 and what I was saying 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:42.680
 the battle will cut connected home 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:47.240
 modifying is like putting together a lego 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.070
 this is simply fit 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.600
 screw 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:56.490
 Y 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:59.520
 this rare music of salt gives a little 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:04.000
 can perfectly 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.740
 we will talk about the handling of the camera 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.110
 perfectly you can play the 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.230
 Game Boy Advance games here in your 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.140

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.900
 be a bit higher but the nkvd very 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.390
 little girl look at the length that has a 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.830
 very pretty dough very practical that in your 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.260
 time did not go so well because the 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.000
 disc were very small compared to the play 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.050
 zone that had a lot of capacity 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.960
 memory or information but a great 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.930
 buy so if God wants and if everything 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.980
 it goes well and I can make a kind of 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.290

 in the level it takes approximately 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:09.729

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.610
 tired but was quite happy for the 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:15.039
