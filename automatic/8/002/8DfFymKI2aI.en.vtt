00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
you're interested in building this deck

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.860 
you're interested in building this deck
because<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.730> want<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.060> know<00:03:09.150> build<00:03:09.630> it

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
and pick up three structure decks and

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.980 
and pick up three structure decks and
try<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.220> make<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.580> deck<00:03:11.880> out<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.480> don't

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
try to make a deck out of it I don't

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.960 
try to make a deck out of it I don't
think<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.410> this<00:03:13.590> deck<00:03:13.950> actually<00:03:14.520> can

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
think that this deck actually can

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.580 
think that this deck actually can
compete<00:03:15.330> with<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.540> lot<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.930> higher<00:03:16.110> dyrdek

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
compete with a lot of the higher dyrdek

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.229 
compete with a lot of the higher dyrdek
simply<00:03:16.950> because<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.670> you're<00:03:17.880> playing<00:03:18.000> against

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
simply because if you're playing against

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.430 
simply because if you're playing against
a<00:03:18.330> player<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.540> knows<00:03:18.870> you're<00:03:19.140> playing<00:03:19.320> this

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
a player that knows you're playing this

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440 
a player that knows you're playing this
deck<00:03:19.650> they<00:03:19.800> just<00:03:20.010> won't<00:03:20.580> attack<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:20.940> mate<00:03:21.239> and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
deck they just won't attack the mate and

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.090 
deck they just won't attack the mate and
that's<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:21.959> as<00:03:22.260> simple<00:03:22.380> as<00:03:22.620> just<00:03:22.830> not

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
that's it's as simple as just not

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.220 
that's it's as simple as just not
letting<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.730> know<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.030> your<00:03:24.660> opponent<00:03:25.019> get<00:03:25.110> out

the blue eyes I know that sometimes you

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.850 
the blue eyes I know that sometimes you
can<00:03:27.090> activate<00:03:27.390> cards<00:03:27.780> like<00:03:28.019> I'll<00:03:28.260> wonder<00:03:28.650> one

and then that can you know make it so

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.800 
and then that can you know make it so
you<00:03:31.170> can<00:03:31.320> actually<00:03:31.530> get<00:03:31.769> out<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:33.630> blue

eyes which is a pretty nasty card to
deal<00:04:15.870> with<00:04:15.989> but<00:04:16.109> i<00:04:16.169> don't<00:04:16.290> think<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> cards

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
deal with but i don't think the cards

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.140 
deal with but i don't think the cards
really<00:04:16.859> gonna<00:04:16.950> be<00:04:17.040> worth<00:04:17.190> anything<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.609> if

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
really gonna be worth anything so if

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.849 
really gonna be worth anything so if
you're<00:04:18.299> actually<00:04:18.419> investing<00:04:19.260> into<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.680> deck

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
to play i would say it's not going to be

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.230
