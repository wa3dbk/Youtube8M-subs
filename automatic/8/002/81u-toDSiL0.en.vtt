00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
one or two of the threads within the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.150 
one or two of the threads within the
weave<00:00:50.210> you<00:00:51.210> don't<00:00:51.480> want<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> show<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
couple of threads and then I'm going to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.709 
couple of threads and then I'm going to
go<00:00:59.850> into<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> hem<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:02.420> can<00:01:03.420> pick<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.660> more

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.649 
go into the hem you can pick up more
have<00:01:04.140> more<00:01:04.500> threads<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> hem<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.729> then

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
have more threads on the hem and then

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.420 
have more threads on the hem and then
just<00:01:07.020> pick<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.439> couple<00:01:09.860> one<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.130> threads

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
just pick up a couple one or two threads

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.249 
just pick up a couple one or two threads
on<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> top<00:01:14.360> this<00:01:15.360> ensures<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.110> won't

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
on the top this ensures that it won't

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
on the top this ensures that it won't
show<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:17.670> side<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
show on the on the right side so you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.310 
show on the on the right side so you
won't<00:01:18.770> you'll<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.750> won't<00:01:21.750> look<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:21.960> you

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
won't you'll have a won't look like you

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.000 
won't you'll have a won't look like you
have<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.770> pants<00:01:24.170> they<00:01:25.170> look<00:01:25.439> clean

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.050 

so<00:01:31.010> there<00:01:31.190> we<00:01:31.310> are<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.790> as<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.479> can<00:01:32.630> see<00:01:34.060> you

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
so there we are and as you can see you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.170 
so there we are and as you can see you
cannot<00:01:35.479> see<00:01:35.720> it<00:01:35.810> on<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.049> front<00:01:36.200> side<00:01:37.030> as<00:01:38.030> you

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
cannot see it on the front side as you

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.250 
cannot see it on the front side as you
didn't<00:01:38.450> put<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.659> needle<00:01:38.900> all<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.110> way

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
didn't put the needle all the way

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.140 
didn't put the needle all the way
through<00:01:39.650> you<00:01:39.950> only<00:01:40.190> put<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.820> needle<00:01:41.119> through

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
through you only put the needle through

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.630 
through you only put the needle through
a<00:01:41.330> couple<00:01:41.570> of<00:01:41.750> threads<00:01:42.250> picked<00:01:43.250> up<00:01:43.400> a<00:01:43.490> couple

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
a couple of threads picked up a couple

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.060 
a couple of threads picked up a couple
it'll<00:01:44.600> be<00:01:44.720> strong<00:01:44.990> enough<00:01:45.229> it'll<00:01:45.470> hold<00:01:45.680> once

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
it'll be strong enough it'll hold once

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.810 
it'll be strong enough it'll hold once
you<00:01:46.190> continue<00:01:46.640> on<00:01:46.670> around<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.240> whole<00:01:47.390> service

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
you continue on around the whole service

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.469 
you continue on around the whole service
but<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:50.210> will<00:01:50.360> not<00:01:50.570> show<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.110> front<00:01:52.479> so

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
but it will not show on the front so

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.170 
but it will not show on the front so
with<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:53.869> in<00:01:54.110> mind<00:01:54.729> I'm<00:01:55.729> going<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:55.970> show<00:01:56.119> you

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
with that in mind I'm going to show you

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.340 
with that in mind I'm going to show you
now<00:01:57.820> some<00:01:58.820> other<00:01:58.909> steps<00:01:59.240> now<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.140> we<00:02:00.200> learn

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
now some other steps now that we learn

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.800 
now some other steps now that we learn
this<00:02:00.530> technique
