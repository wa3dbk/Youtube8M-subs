green drip emitters are lined up kind of

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.920 
green drip emitters are lined up kind of
like<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> bed<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> water

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
like this in the bed so that the water

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.859 
like this in the bed so that the water
spreads<00:01:25.350> out<00:01:25.619> as<00:01:25.799> evenly<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.549> possible<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
spreads out as evenly as possible if you

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.140 
spreads out as evenly as possible if you
need<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.829> use<00:01:28.890> these<00:01:29.310> metal<00:01:29.759> view

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
need to you can use these metal view

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.270 
need to you can use these metal view
States<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.079> help<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.500> keep<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.890> tubing

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
now if you ever see a drip emitter

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.280 
now if you ever see a drip emitter
that's<00:01:40.610> plugged<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.270> not<00:01:41.420> dripping<00:01:41.720> like<00:01:42.050> its

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
that's plugged and not dripping like its

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.860 
that's plugged and not dripping like its
neighbors<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.220> can<00:01:43.400> just<00:01:43.610> rotate<00:01:43.880> or<00:01:44.510> turn

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
neighbors you can just rotate or turn

neighbors you can just rotate or turn
the<00:01:45.080> green<00:01:45.320> part<00:01:45.650> on<00:01:45.800> top<00:01:46.010> a<00:01:46.040> few<00:01:46.370> times<00:01:46.640> to

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
the green part on top a few times to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.090 
the green part on top a few times to
help<00:01:47.000> unclog<00:01:47.660> it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
help unclog it

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.230 
help unclog it
pretty<00:01:49.100> soon<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.520> should<00:01:49.730> start<00:01:50.030> dripping

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
pretty soon it should start dripping

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.500 
pretty soon it should start dripping
again<00:01:51.250> now<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.310> nice<00:01:52.580> thing<00:01:52.610> about<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.270> drip

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
again now the nice thing about the drip

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.230 
again now the nice thing about the drip
irrigation<00:01:53.960> system<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:55.010> that<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.550> applies<00:01:55.940> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
irrigation system is that it applies the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.900 
irrigation system is that it applies the
water<00:01:56.480> really<00:01:57.470> really<00:01:57.860> really<00:01:58.130> slowly<00:01:58.430> to<00:01:58.790> the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
water really really really slowly to the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.530 
water really really really slowly to the
soil<00:02:00.340> also<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.490> water<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:01.910> going<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.210> spread

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
soil also the water is going to spread

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.900 
soil also the water is going to spread
out<00:02:02.600> pretty<00:02:03.110> evenly<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.890> these<00:02:04.040> uniform

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
out pretty evenly in these uniform

to do this you just need to use a drill
and<00:02:34.280> put<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.820> few<00:02:35.060> small<00:02:35.390> holes<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:35.990> cap<00:02:36.320> of

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
and put a few small holes in the cap of

the container

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.430 
the container
I<00:02:37.780> used<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.959> 1/16<00:02:39.830> inch<00:02:40.130> or<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.840> 1.5<00:02:41.840> millimeter

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
holes in the cap that's really enough to

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.580 
holes in the cap that's really enough to

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
get water from all over so you don't

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
of now the buckets in our garden hold

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.589 
of now the buckets in our garden hold
five<00:03:43.049> gallons<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.560> water<00:03:43.909> and<00:03:44.909> if<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.269> filled

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
five gallons of water and if you filled

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.229 
five gallons of water and if you filled
up<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.900> bucket<00:03:46.290> all<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.620> way<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.920> top

up the bucket all the way to the top

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.360 
up the bucket all the way to the top
this<00:03:48.239> would<00:03:48.480> be<00:03:48.629> similar<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.140> if<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.829> added<00:03:50.220> a

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
this would be similar to if you added a

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.610 
this would be similar to if you added a
half<00:03:50.760> an<00:03:50.970> inch<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.239> water<00:03:51.540> over<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.230> entire

out how often and how much water to add
