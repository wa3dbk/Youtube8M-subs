how fun and easy it is and how
good-looking<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:42.710> boxwood<00:00:43.219> looks<00:00:43.460> on<00:00:43.640> these

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
good-looking this boxwood looks on these

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.319 
good-looking this boxwood looks on these
Christmas<00:00:44.780> trees<00:00:44.809> let's<00:00:45.679> go<00:00:46.089> we've<00:00:47.089> got<00:00:47.120> a

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
Christmas trees let's go we've got a

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.860 
Christmas trees let's go we've got a
14-inch<00:00:47.929> base<00:00:48.440> right<00:00:48.800> here<00:00:49.269> we've<00:00:50.269> just<00:00:50.600> drawn

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
14-inch base right here we've just drawn

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.959 
14-inch base right here we've just drawn
two<00:00:51.229> two<00:00:51.739> lines<00:00:52.010> from<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.429> widest<00:00:52.819> point

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
two two lines from the widest point

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.869 
two two lines from the widest point
we've<00:00:55.969> also<00:00:56.149> drill<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.719> hole<00:00:56.929> in<00:00:57.339> the<00:00:58.339> center

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.049 

for<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:01.909> pilot<00:01:03.640> now<00:01:04.640> we're<00:01:04.760> going<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:04.909> go

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
for the pilot now we're going to go

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:16.390 
for the pilot now we're going to go
ahead<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.510> drill<00:01:05.720> this<00:01:05.900> base<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:13.780> then<00:01:15.400> we're

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
ahead and drill this base and then we're

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.050 
ahead and drill this base and then we're
gonna<00:01:16.490> put<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.150> base<00:01:17.360> on<00:01:17.600> there<00:01:21.910> now<00:01:22.910> we're

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
gonna put the base on there now we're

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:51.940 
gonna put the base on there now we're
going<00:01:23.150> to<00:01:23.210> anchor<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.750> bottom

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.440 

all<00:01:52.950> right<00:01:53.130> we're<00:01:53.310> gonna<00:01:53.399> cut<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.880> wire<00:01:54.119> mesh

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
all right we're gonna cut this wire mesh

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.319 
all right we're gonna cut this wire mesh
and<00:01:54.780> right<00:01:55.740> around<00:01:56.100> four<00:01:56.520> feet<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:57.119> should

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and right around four feet that should

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.870 
and right around four feet that should
give<00:01:57.479> us<00:01:57.509> plenty<00:02:01.220> we're<00:02:02.220> gonna<00:02:02.340> put<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> wire

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
give us plenty we're gonna put the wire

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
give us plenty we're gonna put the wire
on<00:02:03.149> at<00:02:03.360> an<00:02:03.509> angle<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:05.220> it's<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.430> cone-shaped<00:02:06.740> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
on at an angle so it's a cone-shaped and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.290 
on at an angle so it's a cone-shaped and
start<00:02:08.009> stapling<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:11.810> I'm<00:02:12.810> gonna<00:02:13.019> trim<00:02:14.300> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
start stapling it on I'm gonna trim the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.600 
start stapling it on I'm gonna trim the
wire<00:02:15.540> mesh<00:02:15.840> material<00:02:16.080> off<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.739> bottom<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.489> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
wire mesh material off the bottom of the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.660 
wire mesh material off the bottom of the
project<00:02:18.180> here<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:21.060> now<00:02:21.450> you're<00:02:21.690> gonna<00:02:21.840> see

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
project here and now you're gonna see

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.910 
project here and now you're gonna see
that<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.819> have<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> nice<00:02:24.299> base<00:02:24.739> covered<00:02:25.739> with

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
that we have the nice base covered with

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.340 
that we have the nice base covered with
the<00:02:26.069> frame<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.600> great<00:02:28.019> because<00:02:28.260> you

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the frame and this is great because you

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.920 
the frame and this is great because you
can<00:02:28.530> do<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> lot<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.160> different<00:02:29.519> style<00:02:30.269> projects

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
can do a lot of different style projects

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.800 
can do a lot of different style projects
and<00:02:31.080> shapes<00:02:31.350> with<00:02:31.650> boxwood<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.269> use<00:02:33.510> this

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
and shapes with boxwood if you use this

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.520 
and shapes with boxwood if you use this
pattern<00:02:34.430> use<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.790> process<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.200> now<00:02:37.350> we're

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
pattern use this process so now we're

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.020 
pattern use this process so now we're
going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> go<00:02:37.860> ahead<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.220> put<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.549> skin<00:02:38.850> on

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
going to go ahead and put the skin on

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.930 
going to go ahead and put the skin on
and<00:02:39.269> get<00:02:39.600> this<00:02:39.810> thing<00:02:40.080> done

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
and get this thing done

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.759 
and get this thing done
we're<00:02:41.940> playing<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.480> boxwood<00:02:42.870> material<00:02:43.590> on

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
we're playing the boxwood material on

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.130 
we're playing the boxwood material on
here<00:02:44.130> which<00:02:44.430> we've<00:02:44.670> actually<00:02:44.940> used<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.690> UV

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
here which we've actually used a UV

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.199 
here which we've actually used a UV
product<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.489> can<00:02:47.610> put<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.880> out<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
product so you can put it out in the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.479 
product so you can put it out in the
yard<00:02:48.390> when<00:02:48.780> you're<00:02:48.930> done<00:02:49.049> with<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.470> for<00:02:50.130> next

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
yard when you're done with it for next

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.479 
yard when you're done with it for next
year<00:02:54.110> many<00:02:55.110> ways<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.650> do<00:02:55.799> it<00:02:55.829> but<00:02:55.980> we're<00:02:56.280> trying

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
year many ways to do it but we're trying

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.539 
year many ways to do it but we're trying
to<00:02:56.609> get<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:57.000> shape<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.950> line<00:02:59.190> up<00:02:59.370> here

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
to get this shape to line up here

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.150 
to get this shape to line up here
straight<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.390> that's<00:03:01.140> going<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.410> form<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.920> cone

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
straight and that's going to form a cone

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.470 
straight and that's going to form a cone
and<00:03:03.019> basically<00:03:04.019> we've<00:03:04.350> used<00:03:04.709> two<00:03:04.980> times<00:03:05.480> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and basically we've used two times the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.410 
and basically we've used two times the
diameter<00:03:07.010> 2.5<00:03:08.010> times<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.459> diameter<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:09.209> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
diameter 2.5 times the diameter of the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.789 
diameter 2.5 times the diameter of the
base<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:10.320> get<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.650> same<00:03:11.269> cone<00:03:12.269> shape<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.560> let's

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
base to get the same cone shape so let's

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.330 
base to get the same cone shape so let's
