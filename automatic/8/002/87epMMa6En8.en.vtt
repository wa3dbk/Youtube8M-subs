00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.190
 event on May 9th and 11th 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.540
 on the territory the city of alès the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.790
 Cevennes country the regional committee 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.910
 riding organizes the first trek 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 alès cévennes on Mercoirol site 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.599
 european cup match and first 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.380
 regional scale of this size is very 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.109
 ambitious we had a big project and we 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.789
 was pleased to have the follow up and the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.029
 community policy support 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.769
 local Cevennes country gave everyone 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.990
 stakeholders and all decision makers 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.640
 therefore it is a big issue in 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.860
 plus the site it is virgin 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.870
 so for the event it takes everything 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 install bring water electricity the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.290
 marquees to build the courses 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.660
 techniques etc 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.950
 so it's a huge job I think 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.210
 that it will be very nice success yes 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.539
 because the site really lends itself to it 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.030
 a lot 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.140
 and precisely the choice of mercoirol for 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.610
 welcome such an event 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.640
 sounded like obvious to them 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.649
 organizers this place lends itself because 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.039
 that it offers a lot of possibilities 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.750
 techniques and also to accommodate 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.670
 many jumper couples will do is 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.989
 also a multitude of possibilities 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.790
 public reception 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.290
 it's sometimes a bit difficult 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.170
 of the equestrian world 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.610
 it's not really having an anchor 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.190
 territorial for its development and 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.260
 really that's what was offered by 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.580
 the territory left on time even though 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.770
 the discipline has existed for 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.840
 fifteen years the technical trec of 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.180
 equestrian competition ride is 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.770
 today thriving three 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.540
 events wait for the riders on the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.400
 orientation and regularity course 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.900
 control of pace and course 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.100
 in varied terrain then there you go 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.229
 see equestrian sport in the heart of nature 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.700
 here is the importance of the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.350
 discipline because it's a 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.860
 new discipline that is open towards 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.950
 outdoors 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.660
 it's an added attraction for 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.840
 the shoulder doing the trek it gives back 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.830
 a little taste of technicality 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.110
 without losing the taste of escape 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.800
 there are sequences of jumps of the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.720
 maneuverability of the bosphorus if the number 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.340
