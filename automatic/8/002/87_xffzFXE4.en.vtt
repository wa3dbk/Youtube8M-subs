that happens this case will probably be
one<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> first<00:03:00.760> ever<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:01.690> stood<00:03:02.140> up

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
one of the first ever to have stood up

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.990 
one of the first ever to have stood up
in<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.470> court<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.740> law<00:03:02.770> there's<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.790> much

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
in a court of law there's that much

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.480 
in a court of law there's that much
evidence<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.930> now<00:03:05.530> they<00:03:06.040> would<00:03:06.160> have<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.400> be

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
evidence to it now they would have to be

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.390 
evidence to it now they would have to be
unbiased<00:03:06.700> jury<00:03:07.210> I<00:03:07.480> think<00:03:08.220> because<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.250> the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
unbiased jury I think because of the

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.130 
unbiased jury I think because of the
topic<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:10.030> had<00:03:10.180> that's<00:03:10.420> where<00:03:10.690> we<00:03:10.840> come<00:03:11.080> in

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
topic and I had that's where we come in

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.650 
topic and I had that's where we come in
to<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.860> some<00:03:12.010> issues<00:03:12.340> well<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.880> Karen<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.480> mean

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
to to some issues well and Karen I mean

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.840 
to to some issues well and Karen I mean

explore on this series we look for

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.710 
explore on this series we look for
stories<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.560> high<00:03:47.680> tangible<00:03:48.190> evidence<00:03:48.720> really

personal<00:03:50.380> stories<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.130> then<00:03:51.370> we're<00:03:51.489> pulling

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
personal stories and then we're pulling

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.960 
personal stories and then we're pulling
scientists<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.989> talk<00:03:53.170> about<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.970> possibility

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
scientists to talk about the possibility

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.760 
scientists to talk about the possibility
and<00:03:55.180> plausibility<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:56.080> these<00:03:56.290> types<00:03:56.620> of

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
events happening and it's the kind of

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.710 
events happening and it's the kind of
show<00:03:59.770> that<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.040> think<00:04:00.130> will<00:04:00.459> just<00:04:00.730> open<00:04:00.910> viewers

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
show that I think will just open viewers

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.570 
show that I think will just open viewers
minds<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.530> possibility<00:04:03.130> of<00:04:03.160> what<00:04:03.370> might

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
minds to the possibility of what might

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.360 
minds to the possibility of what might
be<00:04:03.760> out<00:04:03.910> there<00:04:04.110> we<00:04:05.110> don't<00:04:05.260> try<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.739> answer<00:04:05.950> the

the ride and just looking at the clip
there<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.989> technology<00:04:21.680> that's<00:04:21.920> used<00:04:22.070> in<00:04:22.490> this

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
there the technology that's used in this

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.760 
there the technology that's used in this
it's<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:23.150> interesting<00:04:23.480> to<00:04:23.690> bring<00:04:23.900> these

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
it's so interesting to bring these

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.350 
it's so interesting to bring these
stories<00:04:25.010> to<00:04:25.190> life<00:04:25.700> tell<00:04:25.970> me<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.090> little<00:04:26.210> bit

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
stories to life tell me a little bit

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.300 
stories to life tell me a little bit
about<00:04:26.630> what<00:04:26.870> was<00:04:27.020> used<00:04:27.380> well<00:04:27.770> we<00:04:28.040> use<00:04:28.190> the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
about what was used well we use the

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.100 
about what was used well we use the
magic<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:28.670> green<00:04:28.940> screen<00:04:29.270> technology<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:29.960> for

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
magic of green screen technology so for

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.240 
magic of green screen technology so for
example<00:04:30.440> in<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.560> clip<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:30.860> you're<00:04:30.920> looking
