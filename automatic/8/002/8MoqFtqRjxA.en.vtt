because I was a big fan of the dirge
mode<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.850> really<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.600> new<00:00:21.779> paint

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
the new paint scheme for some reason I

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.560 
the new paint scheme for some reason I
know<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.400> lot<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.580> reviewers<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.300> said<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.539> was

bland it was just you know yeah whatever
but<00:00:32.040> I'm<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:33.360> really<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.690> fan<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
but I'm not really a fan of the of the

but I'm not really a fan of the of the
new<00:00:35.309> paint<00:00:35.550> scheme<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.120> good<00:00:36.809> job<00:00:37.050> Hasbro

I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:43.040> especially<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> name

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.119 
I think especially because of the name
the<00:00:44.879> character<00:00:45.170> jet<00:00:46.170> blade<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the character jet blade I think it's a

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
the character jet blade I think it's a
new<00:00:47.370> reason<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.910> don't<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.539> there's<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
new reason I don't know if there's a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.220 
new reason I don't know if there's a
secret<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.260> jet<00:00:49.559> blade<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:51.570> color<00:00:51.899> scheme

gear<00:05:21.300> but<00:05:22.220> really<00:05:23.220> when<00:05:23.909> you<00:05:24.000> fold<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.479> it<00:05:25.260> just

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
gear but really when you fold it it just

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.810 
gear but really when you fold it it just
barely<00:05:26.099> clears<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.820> ground<00:05:27.180> with<00:05:27.750> it<00:05:28.820> doesn't

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
barely clears the ground with it doesn't

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.070 
barely clears the ground with it doesn't
roll<00:05:30.150> unfortunately<00:05:31.400> but<00:05:32.400> it<00:05:32.970> probably<00:05:33.870> you

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
roll unfortunately but it probably you

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.279 
roll unfortunately but it probably you
probably<00:05:34.110> going<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.889> roll<00:05:35.639> him<00:05:35.930> this<00:05:36.930> thing<00:05:37.139> is

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
probably going to roll him this thing is

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:44.920 
probably going to roll him this thing is
not<00:05:37.440> snapping<00:05:37.949> into<00:05:38.070> place<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:38.580> wonder<00:05:38.880> why

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.650 

okay<00:05:45.930> moles<00:05:46.500> degradation<00:05:46.860> I<00:05:47.190> suppose<00:05:47.660> but

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
okay moles degradation I suppose but

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.270 
okay moles degradation I suppose but
when<00:05:48.840> it<00:05:48.960> came<00:05:49.110> out<00:05:49.290> of<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.470> box<00:05:49.680> it<00:05:49.980> was<00:05:50.010> like

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
when it came out of the box it was like

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.560 
when it came out of the box it was like
tight<00:05:52.550> anyway<00:05:53.810> okay<00:05:54.810> so<00:05:55.130> very<00:05:56.130> nice<00:05:56.540> it's<00:05:57.540> a

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
tight anyway okay so very nice it's a

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.480 
tight anyway okay so very nice it's a
great<00:05:57.720> repaint<00:05:58.140> they<00:05:58.680> got<00:05:59.040> the<00:05:59.160> cultures

great repaint they got the cultures
right<00:05:59.760> I<00:06:00.030> think<00:06:00.570> in<00:06:00.690> my<00:06:00.840> opinion<00:06:01.520> if<00:06:02.520> you're

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
right I think in my opinion if you're

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.110 
right I think in my opinion if you're
not<00:06:03.090> I<00:06:03.360> mean<00:06:03.990> if<00:06:04.140> you<00:06:04.440> love<00:06:04.680> seekers<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.700> you

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
not I mean if you love seekers and you

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.090 
not I mean if you love seekers and you
don't<00:06:06.450> mind<00:06:06.660> repaints<00:06:07.290> I<00:06:07.440> guess<00:06:07.650> you<00:06:07.890> can<00:06:07.980> go

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
ahead and get this one but if you're

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.750
