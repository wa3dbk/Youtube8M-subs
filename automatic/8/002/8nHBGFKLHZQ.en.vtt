00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.190
 What will happen to you if a black hole is the size of the coin 

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.831
 Suddenly appeared by your side? 

00:00:04.836 --> 00:00:06.346
 The short answer is that you will die. 

00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:08.081
 Long Answer: It depends on several things. 

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:09.961
 Is the black hole in the mass of the coin, 

00:00:09.963 --> 00:00:11.503
 Or is it a piece of money? 

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:14.963
 Let's assume that this coin belongs to the United States, that is, its mass is 5 grams. 

00:00:14.963 --> 00:00:17.083
 Magically overlapping to form the black hole. 

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:20.643
 This black hole will have a diameter of about 10 to 30-meter power. 

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:25.465
 By comparison, the hydrogen atom is about 10 to 11 meters in diameter. 

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:28.455
 If that black hole compared with the atom would be 

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:30.215
 The size of the corn compared to the sun. 

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:31.885
 Unexpectedly small! 

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:35.675
 The small black hole would also have an unexpectedly short life cycle. 

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:37.285
 To be dissolved by Hawking radiation. 

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:42.455
 Will erase its small mass with a time of 10 to 23 seconds. 

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:47.225
 Its mass of 5 grams will turn to 450 tajoules of energy, 

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.246
 Resulting in an explosion of up to 3 times the size of an explosion 

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:53.616
 The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. 

00:00:53.627 --> 00:00:55.097
 In this case, you will die. 

00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:57.077
 You will also lose the coin. 

00:00:57.092 --> 00:00:59.872
 If the diameter of the black hole is equal to the diameter of a common coin, 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.133
 Then it will be much more intense than before. 

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.265
 In fact, it is a black hole with a diameter of a coin 

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.475
 It will be even the largest density of land. 

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:11.195
 It will have a gravity force on its surface one billion billion times larger 

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.895
 Of gravity on Earth. 

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:15.475
 The power of his attraction applied to you will be very strong 

00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:18.323
 To the extent that they will rip your cells. 

00:01:18.323 --> 00:01:22.393
 The black hole will swallow you even before you notice what is happening! 

00:01:22.393 --> 00:01:24.653
 Although the laws of gravity are the same, 

00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:28.007
 The gravitational phenomenon you will experience will be very different 

00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:29.847
 Around objects of this density. 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.690
 The extent of gravity attraction 

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:33.972
 Extends to all the visible universe, 

00:01:33.972 --> 00:01:37.172
 The weaker your attractiveness, the more you withdraw from it. 

00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:41.662
 On the floor now, your head and toes will almost the same dimension 

00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:43.122
 About the center of the planet. 

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:45.692
 But if you stand on a black hole the size of a coin, 

00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:48.482
 Your feet will be a hundred times closer to the center of the hole, 

00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:52.222
 Gravity will be tens of thousands of times stronger 

00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:55.681
 Of the force applied to your head and will tear you to a billion pieces. 

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.171
 But the black hole will not just stand with you. 

00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:01.461
 The black hole will be a dominant attraction 

00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:04.051
 In the deadly lunar ground hole system 

00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:07.761
 You may think that the black hole will attract toward the center of the planet 

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.101
 And he is cursing him from the inside out. 

00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:14.631
 In fact, the earth will also go up towards the black hole and begin to rise and fall, 

00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:16.331
 As it circled around the black hole, 

00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:19.071
 All this while areas of mass will be lost in every crossing of the hole, 

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.691
 Making it even more frightening. 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.559
 As the earth devours from within it, 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.099
 The earth will turn into a scattering disc of hot rocks, 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.359
 Surrounding the black hole closely. 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.859
 The black hole will double its mass when it is finished. 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.809
 The rotation of the moon will be more ovoid. 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.289
 Its impact on the solar system will be great 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.289
 In the biblical sense of the word "great" which means majestic. 

00:02:41.298 --> 00:02:45.058
 It is possible that the forces of attraction of the black hole will lead to the disturbance of asteroids surrounding the Earth, 

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:47.398
 Perhaps even parts of the asteroid belt, 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.840
 To be sent with rocks in the solar system. 

00:02:49.847 --> 00:02:52.677
 Explosions and collisions will become commonplace 

00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:54.157
 For the next few million years. 

00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:58.157
 The planets will be disturbed, but they will remain almost in their orbit. 

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:00.857
 The black hole we used for the land 

00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:03.357
 The Earth's orbit will take the sun now. 

00:03:03.363 --> 00:03:06.023
 In this case, you will also die. 

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:11.124
