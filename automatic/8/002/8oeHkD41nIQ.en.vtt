 extra virgin olive oil salt and this point 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.940
 just the first step I will take will be 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.649
 to leaf through clean artichokes 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.649
 zago and delete points 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.910
 between the stock and very thin slices 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.349
 in a pan towards the opposite functions 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.230

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.700
 for a few minutes in the meantime cut 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.700

 towards species in the pan and bebo 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.380
 and now towards the malga mobile furniture the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.340
 we need to add a little bit 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.340
 of firm water 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.400
 I ran the cautions he left one 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.220
 little to the right towards the pan e 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.900
 Mars as you call it shore I add 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.330
 possibly a few spoonfuls 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:45.159
 water of the pasta to get the 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:46.989
 of the sterling pappardelle with I do 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:51.790

 a decidedly very tasty dish and 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.629
 rich in taste in games and I expect it 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.030
 combines a little less well 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.329
