00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
little look at all of those and on the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.979 
little look at all of those and on the
side<00:02:06.420> same<00:02:07.229> thing<00:02:07.259> boost<00:02:07.740> case<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.879> flips<00:02:09.810> open

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
side same thing boost case it flips open

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.660 
side same thing boost case it flips open
so<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.470> see<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> inside<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.520> by

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so you can see the inside just by

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.740 
so you can see the inside just by
opening<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.090> lid

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
opening the lid

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.190 
opening the lid
in<00:02:14.680> slide<00:02:15.070> open<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.580> cap<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.900> pop<00:02:17.050> it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
in slide open the cap and just pop it

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.780 
in slide open the cap and just pop it
right<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:18.220> got<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.400> really<00:02:18.580> nice

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
right in it's got a really nice

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.290 
right in it's got a really nice
form-fitting<00:02:19.890> type<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.010> case<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.220> from<00:02:22.180> what

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
form-fitting type of case that from what

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.580 
form-fitting type of case that from what
I<00:02:22.330> saw<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.720> reviews<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.260> Amazon<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:24.300> edges

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
I saw on the reviews on Amazon the edges

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.350 
I saw on the reviews on Amazon the edges
kind<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.680> lock<00:02:26.950> perfectly<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.120> don't<00:02:28.270> have

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
kind of lock perfectly so you don't have

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.420 
kind of lock perfectly so you don't have
that<00:02:28.480> gap<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.140> see<00:02:29.320> with<00:02:30.100> some<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
that gap that you see with some of the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.070 
that gap that you see with some of the
cases<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.270> mophie<00:02:32.230> juice<00:02:32.260> pack<00:02:32.830> plus<00:02:34.080> it

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
cases like the mophie juice pack plus it

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.510 
cases like the mophie juice pack plus it
also<00:02:35.200> has<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.740> little<00:02:35.890> power<00:02:36.190> indicator

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
also has this little power indicator

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.210 
also has this little power indicator
light<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.390> back<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.980> know<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.130> can

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
light on the back so you know you can

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.440 
light on the back so you know you can
turn<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.580> case<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.060> off<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.330> can

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
turn the case on and off but you can

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.140 
turn the case on and off but you can
also<00:02:40.600> hit<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.520> see<00:02:42.520> how<00:02:42.640> much<00:02:42.730> juice<00:02:43.000> you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
also hit it and see how much juice you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.000 
also hit it and see how much juice you
have<00:02:43.240> left<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.720> there's<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.590> little<00:02:44.680> look<00:02:44.920> at

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
have left so there's a little look at

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.310 
have left so there's a little look at
the<00:02:45.130> case<00:02:45.540> let's<00:02:46.540> go<00:02:46.660> ahead<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.840> open<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.170> up

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
the case let's go ahead and open it up

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.740 
the case let's go ahead and open it up
and<00:02:47.470> see<00:02:47.560> what's<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.370> there<00:02:48.520> all<00:02:49.330> right<00:02:49.540> so

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
we're going to just go ahead and flip

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.490 
we're going to just go ahead and flip
this<00:02:51.370> open<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:54.510> flip<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.570> around<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.080> just

this open and flip it around and just
pull<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.220> case<00:02:57.400> right<00:02:57.640> out<00:02:57.850> this<00:02:58.840> comes<00:02:59.110> right

you guys I know if you can see that but
uses<00:03:39.010> micro<00:03:39.340> USB<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.600> get<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.700> you

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
uses micro USB so you get that and you

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.550 
uses micro USB so you get that and you
get<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.910> case<00:03:43.060> we'll<00:03:44.049> go<00:03:44.140> ahead<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.320> take<00:03:44.500> it

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
get the case we'll go ahead and take it

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.729 
get the case we'll go ahead and take it
out<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.720> there<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.959> have<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.170> look<00:03:47.530> at<00:03:47.650> the

which is pretty nice there's the other
side<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:11.049> can<00:04:11.170> get<00:04:11.290> an<00:04:11.380> idea<00:04:11.410> for<00:04:11.769> thickness

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
side you can get an idea for thickness

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.259 
side you can get an idea for thickness
and<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:13.660> can<00:04:13.810> see<00:04:14.019> that<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.350> seams<00:04:14.769> fit<00:04:15.670> very

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
and you can see that the seams fit very

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.729 
and you can see that the seams fit very
very<00:04:16.600> tightly<00:04:16.900> that's<00:04:17.229> what<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.410> liked<00:04:17.650> about

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
very tightly that's what I liked about

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.729 
very tightly that's what I liked about
this<00:04:18.010> case<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.880> more<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.390> mophie<00:04:19.720> juice<00:04:19.750> pack

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
this case the more the mophie juice pack

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.589 
this case the more the mophie juice pack
plus<00:04:20.979> which<00:04:21.940> was<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.180> other<00:04:22.300> one<00:04:22.390> I<00:04:22.479> was

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
plus which was the other one I was

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.820 
plus which was the other one I was
looking<00:04:22.690> at<00:04:23.370> leaves<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.610> gap<00:04:24.849> right<00:04:25.270> here<00:04:25.830> which

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
looking at leaves a gap right here which

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.580 
looking at leaves a gap right here which
kind<00:04:27.070> of

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
kind of

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.950 
kind of
kills<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.100> aesthetic<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:29.060> fit<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:29.510> it

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
kills the aesthetic and the fit so it

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.390 
kills the aesthetic and the fit so it
feels<00:04:30.110> really<00:04:30.380> good<00:04:30.500> in<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.740> hand<00:04:30.919> it<00:04:31.250> looks

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
feels really good in the hand it looks

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.490 
feels really good in the hand it looks
like<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.669> seams<00:04:31.910> lock<00:04:32.180> good<00:04:32.449> got<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.320> big
