00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
and it was weird because it seemed like

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.670 
and it was weird because it seemed like
my<00:00:42.030> spawning<00:00:42.450> point<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> only<00:00:43.379> place

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
my spawning point was the only place

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.709 
my spawning point was the only place
with<00:00:43.829> dungeons<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.340> started<00:00:44.910> walking<00:00:45.090> away<00:00:45.420> in

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719

with dungeons I started walking away in
a<00:00:45.809> way<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.200> way<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.800> got<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:48.410> really

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
a way in a way and I got really really

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.910 
a way in a way and I got really really
far<00:00:49.829> away<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:51.350> abnormally<00:00:52.350> far<00:00:52.620> away<00:00:52.860> from

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
far away like abnormally far away from

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.529 
far away like abnormally far away from
my<00:00:53.160> base<00:00:53.340> right<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> had<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.120> many<00:00:54.210> blocks

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
my base right and I had so many blocks

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.830 
my base right and I had so many blocks
loaded<00:00:55.129> I<00:00:56.329> don't<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
spent my time running around too much

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.920 
spent my time running around too much
because<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.269> seemed<00:04:00.390> like<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.660> was<00:04:00.720> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
because it seemed like that was the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.319 
because it seemed like that was the
problem<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.560> dungeon<00:04:02.100> blah<00:04:02.519> or<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.910> blocks

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
problem the dungeon blah or the blocks

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.000 
problem the dungeon blah or the blocks
updating<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.260> too<00:04:04.410> much<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.620> there's<00:04:04.890> too

updating it too much and there's too
many<00:04:05.130> blocks<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.730> handle<00:04:06.030> I'm<00:04:06.350> guessing

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
many blocks for the handle I'm guessing

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.000 
many blocks for the handle I'm guessing
that<00:04:07.380> was<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.709> problem<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:08.190> really<00:04:08.609> have<00:04:08.730> no
