00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
really go go crazy right now now I could

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.410 
really go go crazy right now now I could
prune<00:00:32.219> these<00:00:32.369> back<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.850> some<00:00:33.030> pruners

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
prune these back with some pruners

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.080 
prune these back with some pruners
they're<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.440> small<00:00:34.710> enough<00:00:34.890> where<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.610> could

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
they're just small enough where I could

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.780 
they're just small enough where I could
probably<00:00:36.420> make<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.690> happen<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.440> math<00:00:38.160> too

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
probably make it happen but math too

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.060 
probably make it happen but math too
much<00:00:38.969> work<00:00:39.239> I'll<00:00:39.930> go<00:00:40.170> with<00:00:40.410> my<00:00:41.899> hedgers<00:00:43.070> there

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
