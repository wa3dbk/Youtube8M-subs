00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Now you are old and we will 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.810
 surpass the chases at yar cook on 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.700
 which car will we do of course 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.389
 I can't do it on the bugatti veyron 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.910
 drive and got it right away because 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.730
 the car is very very fast and simple 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.939
 uncontrollable for me until the least I do not 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.830
 I can therefore wait a lot of accidents while them 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.470
 yar i don't know maybe somehow over 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.149
 called the enemy on grease o my 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.680
 bright to think it is not mate no you 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.399
 saw for yourself how to spell the name of this 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.399
 cars therefore 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.300
 will go 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.320
 drove in general so here we are here so 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.230
 Here we take off and take a look ofiget 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.809
 To get nishtyak nishtyak scold and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.280
 and went there completely from left often 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.309
 before we turn right like this 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.310
 free rivers banks 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.360
 order it even more abruptly than when 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:09.080
 earlier earlier there all these turns only 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.430
 some are not racing they close now 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.440
 can I take you to go round something else 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.440
 do not understand 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.549
 screen format what 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.469
 nefiga cibe is not a chase 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.060
 Forward van hool method held for a long time 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.060
 it is a task 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.369
 until there ran into a thread to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.159
 only damn stop all 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.240
 the only way and we did not raise 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.960
 got hurt hard to get in the ass 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.710
 police fact fun how there howitzer 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.830
 of course my English understood perfectly 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.830
 damn I can not control this machine 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.830
 inability 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.740
 but everything will be compensated I think 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.740
 backward speed 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.330
 with the face and opening early stayed score 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.610
 two bosses go including this one and 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.590
 the next will be last on 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.630
 specifically given bugatti because besides 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:27.260
 pass your engine will not beat earn 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.740
 bastard and he through the sovereign on 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.330
 minimap 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:35.570
 so I also looked up to agree so 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.340
 well, I think I did not take mayonnaise series 1 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.770
 1 1 hotel 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:46.550
 just perfect drove a car on 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:53.080
 no keyboard but we can't not 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:56.140
 bump and he bought for 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.030
 i say this say studio big 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.030
 the speed of time is possible to get on 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.360
 in her right and right as these 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.820
 you do not get there channel or not 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.670
 even try tried interesting not 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.840
 you know I can drive along 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.769
 it's even easier here than the vestibule 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.160
 I decided to change go to the oncoming tom 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.990
 what was there on the map as shown is 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.100
 it turned out and we lost 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.570
 serve 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.690
 lost it corps 2 so the second 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.010
 Attempt this time huyar and not win I 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.690
 I will not make the mistakes that 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.450
 will commit 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.450
 1 of 5 I hope they turned out that 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.520
 stamp 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.520
 much better than 1 hand 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.230
 we are somehow behind 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.940
 exactly 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.830
 but now I don’t know why 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:00.330
 crashed 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:09.990
 you all got together and slow down 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:18.799
 but you are serious like cards in left ahed 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:23.260
 ahed how does it divert to a con nub or 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.030
 criteria was about 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.670
 when was doing a fucking review on this 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.690
 I will say everything to the game 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.160
 shaved to build the last drop of 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.740
 tom like what a wonderful game they have 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.830
 did not and nothing right hike to be 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.600
 the game is not spoken good yes but there were but 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.220
 here are these signs an accident on a few 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.890
 seconds in the damn hot time when 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.020
 it will end there boss you have fingers 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.210
 strained to the limit faq and you like that 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.950
 here I have to wait after each his 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.550
 the file of the brano at that speed should 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.550
 wait bye 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.750
 but then later be the counter do not 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.620
 be lazy about these 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.620
 wow and damn 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.539
 I also don't get tired of him and I 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:17.150
 of him not far behind similarly cuts 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.340
 at every turn I'm not on 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.439
 cornering ghosts cornering then not 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:28.280
 bump but no turn too 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:31.280
 hurt okay it's actually I don't have 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.300
 excuses are good i'm probably bad 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.930
 let's drive after this time if u 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.449
 we can not work you can try but 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.930
 no bugatti on another machine not 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.310
 will turn out 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.310
 but on 400 we go to not 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.030
 all power so wonderful difference 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.620
 speed we will go for 400 kilometers per hour 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:58.400
 and either touch 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.490
 my body 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.230
 to any 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.680
 carries with it 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.630
 cast out a potential death 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.509
 since it plays not everything is just a loss 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.630
 time here I can not get away from these 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:15.060
 collisions and okay though still 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.930
 holding back 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.930
 and then there is the beginning 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.430
 swear at me 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.460
 and probably do 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.130
 now just won’t win and I drank almost 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.570
 at the second attempt we went to the arch in 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.250
 our next final 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.200
