 gum I must say that the questions here 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.850
 generally scientific because chewing 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.020
 gum is a chemical and 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.119
 of course we all know that when she 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.850

 college wave physical non-physical 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:41.069
 that is, the bond gum hardens and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.399

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:29.110
 everybody has vodka glasses too 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:36.100
 no then every house people said for 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:38.470
 medical purposes there press first aid kit what 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:47.410
 to be discovered rewarding it we

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.520
 everything 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:57.640
 the mechanism is probably about the same 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:59.800
 evaporation vodka alcohol well you 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.550

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.550
 every home 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.860
 I give them quietly to us against that vodka was in 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.390

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.390
 quietly come to us again 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.310
 girl i want to offer vinegar and tooth 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.530
 brush 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:40.129
 need to moisten the brush 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:42.980
 and vinegar also let's get your way 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.769
 polygon it was me you brush 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.370
 with a brush like this 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.519
 you need 5 logical that's all 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.969
 only we need to go. 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.980
 but it is the same as that's how much vodka 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.959
 the strongest solvent so he 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.879
 dissolves chewable compound 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.489
 gum but I think you will 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.659
 German 6 is more correct it is not widely 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.629

 just washing powder yes just 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.419
 liquid laundry detergent takes levani 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.550
 levani 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:49.270
 but also to this place so here it is essentially 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.389
 holds, too, for lowering the word 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.999
 solvent 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.999

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:59.240
 came now also . brush all 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:05:02.120
 it will wait looking for what should 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.249
 blot fabric to make solvent 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.629
 acted so nache 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:10.400
 and now is not the brush remove all 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:14.569

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.249
 chewing gum led to the couch chair and now 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.770
 if something is left a little bit you can 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:20.870
 knife scraper will not remain in the game 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:26.139
 be for yes yes no fat spots 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.139

 please, well, that's how we are all ways 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:37.520
 liked them and physics 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:40.539
 and chemistry is the most usual something on 1 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.539
 then you can wash
