00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.200
 hello I am Carol ucs and welcome to 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.490
 new manga tutorial in which 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.500
 we will learn body in the manga 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.959
 but first comes our theme of 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.240
 studio sleeve productivity come 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.790
 all those tools that actually 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.820
 it confuses you a lot but there is a solution 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.680
 it's called lakers scared 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.560
 are active in the window menu 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.470
 pressing the F key diaz all that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.619
 has layers the tools the colors 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.059
 and also the bookstores to be able 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.870
 find everything you need in a 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.040
 simple and organized way 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.010
 personally I have always activated 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.820
 small shelf to find everything 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.700
 Too much faster 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.010
 they are going on with the tutorials 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.890
 let's start to know that the media 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.780
 of a body the 2 channel are usually 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.710
 media with heads the size of the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.920
 head 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.130
 x many times you will stop the style and 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.260
 whatever you want to draw 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.190
 in this case we are going to use the model 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.190
 of six heads 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.980
 we double the height of the head or in 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.600
 six times for people we need 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.510
 and with that we're going to start drawing the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.390
 body that is to say comes to the head of 1 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.580
 2 3 4 5 16 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.040
 and already with that measure we started to locate 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.220
 the body parts but the same 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.979
 remember not only 16 there are 7 and 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.900
 8 heads up more while more heads 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.659
 you have a much more body 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.540
 Slim and stylized is also 53 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.250
 videos of two heads and it's the style 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.100
 chibi that we will see later in another 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.810
 tutorial you simply choose the number 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.570
 of heads and cheers locating the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.909
 elements of the body at every moment is 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.910
 say in the first one obviously obviously the 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.119
 head and second the waist in the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.220
 third you are going to put the crotch and 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.149
 between the fourth and fifth the knee 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.800
 then sex and finally likewise if you go 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.840
 to draw the body on the side simply 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.780
 is to make a projection of lines and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.840
 locate the same points to generate the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.230
 draw to these measures are simply 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.590
 to achieve a scale or a proportion 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.959
 let's say of standard beauty remember 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.230
 that for this they simply need to see 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.349
 anatomy books and observe it 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.780
 for the reality of photographs try 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.000
 be based on real bodies or bodies 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.580
 of manga drawings and so learning 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.370
 on human anatomy 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.360
 it's always a bit difficult to separate from 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.190
 the basic poses of the fabrics always 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.710
 It's a bit difficult to separate the poses 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.080
 basic to more complex ones but 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.780
 initially it is better to practice 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.410
 let's say the standard poses that would be of 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.920
 front facing versus some poses with 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.570
 courses and angles very difficult to play 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.510
 Just remember the drawing of the figure 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.530
 human in manga is not so complex or 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.650
 so easy they are separated in the anatomy 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.870
 real are simply fewer strokes less 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.780
 volume maybe lines a little straighter 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.600
 and without so much volume because the manga well and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.640
 we have plans with shadows stopped and 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.060
 there you can achieve the small volume that 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.300
 we need to remember to study books of 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.130
 anatomy and look at the reality already 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.340
 nothing else remains but practice see 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.100
 references draw even copy is 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.870
 very good and take advantage of the pressure and 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.640
 all the things that have the between two 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.890
 manga to achieve incredible drawings 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.940
 we have many thanks and I hope to see you 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.940
 in the next tutorial
