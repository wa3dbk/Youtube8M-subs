very careful this stuff burns like the

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.500 
very careful this stuff burns like the
dickens<00:04:51.590> if<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:51.920> get<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:52.160> on<00:04:52.220> your<00:04:52.340> skin<00:04:52.550> you

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
dickens if you get it on your skin you

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.960 
dickens if you get it on your skin you
don't<00:04:53.660> district<00:04:54.140> constantly<00:04:54.760> but<00:04:55.760> make<00:04:55.940> sure

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
don't district constantly but make sure

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.690 
don't district constantly but make sure
it<00:04:56.210> doesn't<00:04:56.510> burn<00:04:56.920> your<00:04:57.920> cooking<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.400> flour

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
it doesn't burn your cooking the flour

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.450 
it doesn't burn your cooking the flour
so<00:04:59.120> it<00:04:59.150> Browns<00:04:59.660> down<00:05:00.020> very<00:05:00.290> dark<00:05:00.650> maybe<00:05:01.070> even<00:05:01.310> a

so it Browns down very dark maybe even a
reddish<00:05:01.880> color<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.900> you<00:05:05.960> get<00:05:06.140> it<00:05:06.260> to<00:05:06.410> a<00:05:06.470> nice

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
stir them around with the roux so it all

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.470

gets mixed together the vegetables will

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.480 
gets mixed together the vegetables will
cook<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:17.960> get<00:05:18.350> a<00:05:18.380> nice<00:05:18.650> paste<00:05:19.130> that

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
cook and you get a nice paste that

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.409
