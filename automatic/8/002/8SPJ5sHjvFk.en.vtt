00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.780
 a previous resistance test for the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.059
 do just apply step 2 the absolute

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.289
 resistance in hair 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.620
 If you are normal, you can 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.230
 application if the hair increases 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.750

 one and a half inches of leather 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.370
 hairy 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:34.510
 distributes the product throughout the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:37.090
 hair avoiding the root then I tried 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.500
 gently asks for long seers 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.500
 using medium voltage 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:51.459
 make sure it's always 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:53.709
 insufficient product in the hair work 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.350
 Hair at room temperature and did not 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.030
 cover with towels or use the dryer 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.030
 other heat source 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.950
 take some hair from the part 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.040
 between the top of the head and the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.689

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.019
 is fully worked 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:31.400
 if the guy can open the hair 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.680
 need additional time is possible 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.260
 that in specific cases it should be 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.659
 repeat the process according to the force of the 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.780

 the fingers to dry the hair needs 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:20.449
 with 10 to 20% humidity so that the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.240
 if smoothing is done with iron 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.340
 excepcione tried the hair on parts

 start at the nape take half sessions 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.340
 centimeter never wider than the 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.770
 keep the iron at a distance 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.770
