00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
Lenna was used to have and this is one

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.330 
Lenna was used to have and this is one
of<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.079> easy<00:02:07.079> ones<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.560> mean<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.810> this<00:02:10.190> can<00:02:11.190> be

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
of the easy ones I mean and this can be

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.460 
of the easy ones I mean and this can be
a<00:02:11.640> bit<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.000> then<00:02:12.239> can<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.569> controlled<00:02:12.959> by<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.110> W

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
a bit of then can be controlled by the W

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.730 
a bit of then can be controlled by the W
and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.610 
and
see<00:02:13.830> i<00:02:13.940> wmic<00:02:14.940> command<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:16.020> few<00:02:16.290> needs<00:02:16.470> of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
see i wmic command a few needs of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.980 
see i wmic command a few needs of
information<00:02:17.070> from<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> bias<00:02:17.630> that's<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.870> way

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
information from the bias that's the way

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.780 
information from the bias that's the way
so<00:02:19.970> thank<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.210> watching<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.630> video
