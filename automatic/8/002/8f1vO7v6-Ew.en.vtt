really<00:02:28.440> shouldn't<00:02:28.710> done<00:02:28.830> something<00:02:29.070> about

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
really shouldn't done something about

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.120 
really shouldn't done something about
that<00:02:29.510> did<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.630> see<00:02:30.960> something<00:02:31.470> maybe<00:02:32.010> I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
that did I just see something maybe I

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.940 
that did I just see something maybe I
just<00:02:32.340> saw<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.420> might<00:02:33.600> be<00:02:33.720> mistaken<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:34.830> I

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
just saw and I might be mistaken if I

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.490 
just saw and I might be mistaken if I
saw<00:02:35.190> something<00:02:35.550> morphing<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.030> was<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> third

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
saw something morphing it was a third

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.280 
saw something morphing it was a third
base<00:02:37.740> well<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.510> nine<00:02:39.510> o'clock<00:02:39.540> expansion

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
base well as a nine o'clock expansion

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.700 
base well as a nine o'clock expansion
there<00:02:40.670> anyway<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:41.850> now<00:02:42.120> zero<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.750> gonna<00:02:43.500> have

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
there anyway so now zero is gonna have

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.730 
there anyway so now zero is gonna have
to<00:02:43.830> fight<00:02:44.360> she<00:02:45.360> got<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.690> whole<00:02:45.870> drop<00:02:46.140> off<00:02:46.380> and

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
to fight she got that whole drop off and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.830 
to fight she got that whole drop off and
it<00:02:46.830> didn't<00:02:47.220> do<00:02:47.310> as<00:02:47.400> much<00:02:47.580> as<00:02:47.610> he<00:02:47.760> really<00:02:48.270> needed

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
it didn't do as much as he really needed

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.750 
it didn't do as much as he really needed
it<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.350> now<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:49.950> coming<00:02:50.220> up<00:02:50.280> with<00:02:50.460> some<00:02:50.640> more
