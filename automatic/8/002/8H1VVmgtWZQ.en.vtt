00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
cuz it's gonna take forever I might do

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.600 
cuz it's gonna take forever I might do
it<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.690> long<00:00:34.170> time<00:00:34.380> from<00:00:34.500> now<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:34.680> usually

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
it on a long time from now but usually

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.060 
it on a long time from now but usually
most<00:00:35.790> people<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.300> get<00:00:36.450> through<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.710> here

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
most people can get through up to here

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.139 
most people can get through up to here
this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.640> starts<00:00:38.670> getting<00:00:38.940> really

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
this is when it starts getting really

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.030

the triumph that attack anyways we're

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.850 
the triumph that attack anyways we're
going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:54.930> another<00:00:55.110> tech<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.710> one

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
going to do another tech here this one

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.790 
going to do another tech here this one
is<00:00:55.920> called<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.760> all-seeing<00:00:57.270> eye<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> this

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
is called the all-seeing eye and this

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.319 
is called the all-seeing eye and this
one's<00:00:59.010> pretty<00:00:59.190> simple<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.699> i<00:00:59.760> actually<00:01:00.180> did

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
one's pretty simple all i actually did

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
one's pretty simple all i actually did
was<00:01:00.570> use<00:01:01.050> um<00:01:02.600> hornets<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.780> mean<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.470> ones<00:01:04.739> are

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
was use um hornets I mean these ones are

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.200 
was use um hornets I mean these ones are
probably<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.159> lot<00:01:05.250> easier<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.850> because

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
probably a lot easier just because

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.899 
probably a lot easier just because
they're<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.900> boss<00:01:07.409> boss<00:01:07.920> battles<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
they're not the boss boss battles so I

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.420 
they're not the boss boss battles so I
mean<00:01:09.360> I'm<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.479> showing<00:01:10.350> guys<00:01:10.680> these<00:01:10.950> battles

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
mean I'm just showing guys these battles

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.200 
mean I'm just showing guys these battles
just<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> UM<00:01:13.049> enjoying<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.640> other

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
just for the UM enjoying it for other

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.480 
just for the UM enjoying it for other
people<00:01:15.570> or<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.439> people<00:01:16.740> are<00:01:16.860> actually<00:01:17.159> really

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
people or if people are actually really

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.749 
people or if people are actually really
stuck<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.180> I'm<00:01:18.420> sure<00:01:18.840> there's<00:01:19.080> um<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:20.340> few

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
stuck on these I'm sure there's um a few

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.420 
stuck on these I'm sure there's um a few
people<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.090> might<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.020> little<00:01:22.799> challenged

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
people that might be a little challenged

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.120 
people that might be a little challenged
or<00:01:24.140> finding<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> little<00:01:25.380> challenge<00:01:25.740> i'm<00:01:25.890> doing

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
or finding a little challenge i'm doing

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.670 
or finding a little challenge i'm doing
it<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.340> those<00:01:26.430> people<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:28.049> most<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> time

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
it for those people but most of the time

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.800 
it for those people but most of the time
i<00:01:28.920> mean<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.970> one's<00:01:30.210> probably<00:01:30.329> pretty<00:01:30.630> easy

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
i mean this one's probably pretty easy

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810 
i mean this one's probably pretty easy
for<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> lot<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> people<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> means<00:01:32.310> obvious

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
for a lot of people do it means obvious

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.130 
for a lot of people do it means obvious
that<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.360> use<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.509> bunch<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.869> Hornets

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that you can just use a bunch of Hornets

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.620 
that you can just use a bunch of Hornets
like<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> view<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.390> i'm<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
like a view in this one so i'm going to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.090 
like a view in this one so i'm going to
do<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:36.900> use<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.409> these<00:01:37.560> Hornets<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
do is just use all these Hornets and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.630 
do is just use all these Hornets and
writing<00:01:38.490> put

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
writing put

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.310 
writing put
now<00:01:40.640> put<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:40.909> few<00:01:41.119> more<00:01:41.149> on<00:01:41.390> here<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:42.140> actually

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
now put a few more on here and actually

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.319 
now put a few more on here and actually
did<00:01:42.619> go<00:01:42.770> play<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.070> one<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.310> was<00:01:43.549> on<00:01:43.759> testing<00:01:44.240> it

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
did go play this one I was on testing it

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.789 
did go play this one I was on testing it
out<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:46.899> was<00:01:47.899> testing<00:01:48.259> out<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.470> see<00:01:48.619> if<00:01:48.649> I'd

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
out and I was testing out to see if I'd

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.249 
out and I was testing out to see if I'd
actually<00:01:48.979> win<00:01:49.369> but<00:01:50.090> what<00:01:50.210> I'll<00:01:50.299> do<00:01:50.509> usually<00:01:50.750> is

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
actually win but what I'll do usually is

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.499 
actually win but what I'll do usually is
