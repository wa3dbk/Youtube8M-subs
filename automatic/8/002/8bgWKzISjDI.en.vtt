00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.870
 Hello everyone, you are watching a video project 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.200
 We will see cars today too 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.200
 drug test 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.130
 We test and today VAZ 2109 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.320
 but before we move on, and to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.480
 performance and testing in the car 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.300
 I want to share my feelings and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.339
 management and all because there is sort of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.760
 like in the usual nine all 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:50.729
 europanel gearshift 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.680
 not short-stroke it is an ordinary instrument 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.479
 the board also remained unchanged 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.629
 extra sensors except the sensor 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.070
 pressure turbine stands and everything I sit in 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.010
 sports arshak with good lateral 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.250
 support but drive to drive cars 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.530
 very nice yes the steering wheel was replaced here but 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.690
 and also put the power steering he 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.369
 electro and the whole set cost no 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.890
 expensive only 13 thousand rubles 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.979
 do-it-yourself installation and installation 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.350
 took about an hour as a result 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.270
 really nice and comfortable to manage 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.270
 car that in the city that in the city 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.710
 appearance of the car also did not undergo 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.590
 strong changes unless established 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.090
 plastic hood chip here quite in 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.790
 to a friend she is hidden just under 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.190
 this hood means let's start with 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.820
 suspension here gas oil racks 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.750
 wishbones worth subframe and 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:08.810
 hard beam 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:11.570
 Well , the main secret under the hood motor 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.580
 iherb turbine here 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:20.110
 IMF 37 Frequently encountered Piping 51 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.770
 diameter of course there is an intercooler 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.540
 additionally set 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.890
 oil cooler before 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:32.350
 receiver choke 54 pilaf taken from audi 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:36.500
 rs outlet pipe diameter 63 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.480
 upgraded the ignition as a whole myself 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.160
 engine remained unchanged 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.770
 put the piston from the fields and everything in 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.680
 basically everything is now the motor is set to 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.440
 pressure of the turbine and a half bar and gives 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.050
 horsepower somewhere 300 plus box 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.760
 gears and here are 8 row pair 37 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.310
 naturally worth blocking 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.560
 the differential is already clear that the motor 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.700
 it will be very good to accelerate the car 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.770
 but it's time to think about brakes 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.320
 here put four piston 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.470
 ventilated brakes well and behind 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.270
 set disk 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.130
 it's time to go to the test plant 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.750
 owners behind the wheel and see how she 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.940
 accelerates to a hundred and how it goes 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.940
 a distance of 402 meters went 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.980
 overclocking to hundreds of attempt number 2 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.140
 402 meters attempt number three 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.140
 It is worth noting that there is pita in the car 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.930
 control which is due to the interaction 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.510
 The ignition system helps the car not 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.490
 drown in other boxes at the start this 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.320
 big and plus as a result we have 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.750
 acceleration to a hundred in six seconds and 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.270
 passing 400 meters in 15 half 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.250
 seconds result worthy of respect 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.320
 so leave your comments under 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.790
 this video but we are going to shoot 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.000
 the next car to all new 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.000
 meeting
