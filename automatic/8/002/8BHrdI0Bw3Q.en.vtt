00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.510 

so<00:01:55.370> then<00:01:55.520> we're<00:01:55.640> gonna<00:01:55.730> be<00:01:55.910> playing<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:57.520> little

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
so then we're gonna be playing a little

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:08.109 
so then we're gonna be playing a little
power<00:01:58.760> cord<00:01:59.060> there<00:02:06.370> so<00:02:07.370> just<00:02:07.550> power<00:02:07.760> cord<00:02:08.030> on

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
power cord there so just power cord on

power cord there so just power cord on
the<00:02:08.210> second<00:02:10.000> five<00:02:11.620> four<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:14.530> five<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.780> that's

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
the second five four to five so that's

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.680 
the second five four to five so that's
the<00:02:24.080> main<00:02:24.290> riff<00:02:24.730> there<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.880> variation<00:02:26.540> in

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
the main riff there is a variation in

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.170 
the main riff there is a variation in
the<00:02:26.780> style<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.230> song<00:02:27.410> which<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.680> this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.720 

okay<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.240> very<00:02:34.720> similar<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.320> original<00:02:37.320> but

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
okay so very similar to the original but

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.270 
okay so very similar to the original but
instead<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.880> coming<00:02:40.180> back<00:02:40.330> down<00:02:40.630> I'm<00:02:41.280> gonna

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
instead of coming back down I'm gonna

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.340 
instead of coming back down I'm gonna
play<00:02:42.490> on<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.730> g-string<00:02:43.330> for<00:02:44.140> two<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:46.000> two<00:02:46.350> so

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
play on the g-string for two for two so

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:58.100 
play on the g-string for two for two so
that's<00:02:50.760> then<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:51.880> bit<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.240> same

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.480 

okay<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.170> there<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.560> variation<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.250> here

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.990 

okay<00:03:06.490> so<00:03:06.780> very<00:03:07.780> similar<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.350> original

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.260 

let<00:03:48.500> me<00:03:48.590> have<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.800> bass<00:03:49.010> part<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.640> then<00:03:50.180> the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
okay so there's quite a bit of a break

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.479 
okay so there's quite a bit of a break
for<00:03:55.790> guitar<00:03:56.090> then<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.599> come<00:03:56.750> with<00:03:56.900> five<00:03:57.489> four
