00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.970
 6000 spectators moved to Bruchwegstadion in Mainz 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.710
 Meeting between the table-ninth from Mainz before the second MSV Duisburg 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.709
 to see 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.919
 the FSV Mainz 05 in the light play clothes did not hide 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.800
 against the MSV the first opportunity for Mainz Fabrizio Hayer 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.759
 the MSV Duisburg did not play in Wels cast without his 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.130
 regular storm after no longer trained but Schmidt 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.130
 for today also the set of strikers extinguished 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.309
 but also the hosts had staff problems Note 2 5 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.320
 Schumacher lacked the Mainz equal four regular players also looked for 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.320
 Injury time is expected there 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.970
 In the middle of the first half, no team was able to penetrate 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.149
 Scene put the MSV with more game shares 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.430
 had the overweight in midfield but on the penalty area of ​​the opponent 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.900
 was then final stop 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.650
 For the Mainz with fast counterattack, they tried again and again 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.230
 Midfield to bridge 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.820
 most direct way and go into the free space and Jürgen Klopp with the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 Fußspitze 4 1 0-leadership for Heidenheim 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.670
 a replay once again to see the opening pass and the won 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.710
 Running duels from Prof will be eighth goal of the season 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.200
 not five minutes later, of course, the MSV with the forward gear hot 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 to the across Hofmann and there is no 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.030
 Hofmann actually a Vorstopper but was the striker Misere the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.610
 Würzburger converted five attackers 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.610
 if we once again the gate from another point of view 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.340
 the one-to-one 29 5 4 minutes 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.940
 the guests now with more game shares put pressure on the goal of Mainz 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.850
 and a similar scene as the idea of ​​compensation led Struckmann completely 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.790
 free in front of goal but he seems to be in luck at this stage for the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.640
 Rising wholesale market 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.030
 the hosts tried again and again with direct combinations and long 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.260
 Pass the well staggered midfield of Günzburger bridge 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.830
 the FSV could actually play free with the descent one has 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.200
 nothing left to do the greatest opportunity to guide Gernot Rohr 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.650
 Frith just the latte of the promoted in the phase just before the break 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.230
 Second place on a par with Hof Orosz Euro 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.189
 so our problems pass 7 4 percent easily in googles new 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.159
 Wing them so special 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.969
 We have to see that we are in Tyrol and think about what he himself is part of 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:31.470
 the tourist last month by 0 4% one euro lots 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.029
 The match also got better and better after the change from minute to minute 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.999
 The first chance for the zero-five celebration was much more exciting 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.839
 no problem for some 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.869
 MSV with even more vigor in the second round pushed to the pace wanted 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:49.639
 The lead in the fight for second place is definitely the tone 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.540
 Nice shot of Toni Kroos at 12 but good for help for Norge 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.339
 Parade of Kunert 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.829
 The possibilities for the MSV repeatedly became more and more skillful 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.829
 Combination Naber a goal simply did not want to fall 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.169
 on the brake today one of the best 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:23.549
 then probably the greatest opportunity for sweetening seductions in the 67 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.300
 Minutes after this scene Michael Tarnat 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.480
 After the Mainz probably their need is only grazed the ball 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:34.979
 to see a repeat maybe he would have the ball through for Struckmann 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.979
 should let 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:45.879
 it remained at the end of 1 1-draw in a high-class encounter after 90 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.490
 minutes 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.870
 who certainly did not deserve a winner
