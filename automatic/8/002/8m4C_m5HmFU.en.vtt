00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.519
 I feel spring approaching 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.439
 have a little time since morning and i want 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.810
 invite you to meet with today 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.540

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:40.030
 the make up had time to apply face cream and 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:42.519
 For the age of your favorite from lucy minerals 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.489
 don't like her tight and cream 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.010
 coating it melts on the skin due to 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.920
 theory there magnesium is a magnesium compound 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.079
 and stearic acid it gives a gentle 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.199
 sliding texture based 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.079
 and enhances the covering power therefore 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.850
 if you need these properties look in 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.510
 composition of the mineral base this 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.969
 component 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.399
 more detailed composition of this mineral 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.979
 I told you the basics in this video 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.229
 eye repeat as from the video about how 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.780
 get rid of depression and where to find 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.640
 motivation because almost every 5 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.220
 comment was a request to repeat 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.140
 I will do it with pleasure 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.960
 for you and execute it practically 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.840
 completely using one brush for 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.539
 I started putting a white cream pencil on 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.060
 the whole eyelid is not big strokes and light 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.310
 moving white pencil 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.170
 will become the base under the shadows and extend them 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.360
 stamina and help shade to reveal 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.759
 we put a light golden shade in 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.520
 inner corner of the eye to the middle 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.039
 which will be a bright flare makeup 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.560
 we layer it in several layers for 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.200
 intense color transfer more 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.590
 intense Sakenova golden color 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.090
 put the emphasis on mid-century and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.250
 Shade edges, removing sharp 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.239
 borders go to the first shade 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.119
 creating a smooth transition of tones juicy 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.340
 blue color we type on a brush and its edge 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.319
 from the place of growth is extremely cilia 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.050
 upward towards the temple 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.019
 light strokes draw the form 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.450
 creating a corner we collect by a little bit 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.090
 shadows so you can layered 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.489
 hue intensity so desired shape 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.310
 it will be neater and it will be easier 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.690
 work with bright shadows remaining on 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.080
 brush shadows, we stretch the shade 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.110
 along the line above the crease of the eyelid framing it 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.420
 and at the same time blend we use 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.330
 intermediate shade between golden 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.850
 tones and blue take shade chameleon 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.760
 from golden to turquoise green 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.780
 put the focus in the middle of the border and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.030
 neatly 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.020
 combine colors to make transitions 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.090
 looked smoothly natural matte 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.180
 beige we remove the excess 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.240
 century bone shading colors 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.240
 the border 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.650
 light matte color frame the area 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.719
 under eyebrow tint emphasize 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.959
 expressive colors and will give 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.959
 completeness 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.849
 beige satin shadows give 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.950
 a healthy glow look shade 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:27.950
 in the corner of the eye on the corner 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.920
 brush type the same blue color as his 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.260
 the outer corner of the eye create a haze 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.319
 eyelash growth lines are not large strokes 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.260
 away from the lash line 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:44.180
 up blur the color to give 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.159
 expressiveness of eye tone to 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.280
 visually increase eyelash volume 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.489
 let down gel eyeliner thin clear 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.349
 line in the ciliary contour 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.599
 for the balance in the eye we omit 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.640
 mucous blue tint so as not to 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.769
 overload look arrange only 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.840
 middle and bright turquoise 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.849
 shade with light clapping 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.340
 movements thus creating haze 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.799
 we pull out ink and we paint over only 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.280
 cilia in the outer corner creating 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.459
 Effect 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.650
 swing open the soup extinguish the butterfly wing to 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.479
 It can be further emphasized 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:26.060
 use false cilia and 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:28.010
 stickies use eyebrow shadows to 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.590
 fill gaps and dashed 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:36.349
 movements make eyebrow lip 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.050
 mix two shine tint 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.810
 upper lip and transparent giving 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.760
 glossy shine on the bottom 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.300
 mix and delicate glossy shade 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.300

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.509

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.060
