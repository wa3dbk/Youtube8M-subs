00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.870
 well guys here it was ksos here we are back 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.509
 with a new video 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.359
 we are here today on the transit mode of 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.160
 call of duty black ops 2 zombies 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.810
 today as in the previous videos vi 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.949
 I will show not so much a strategy of 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.820
 transit because in the end there are one 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.340
 bag but the more we tell you the basics for 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.530
 start with the basics to make a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.809
 good game precisely on this mode 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.930
 which unlike the others is much more 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.180
 complicated and much more must be done 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.590
 more things and you have to be much more 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.719
 organized because the map and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.390
 rules are doing a lot of things then 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.489
 so much first thing you need to do is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.960
 build the turbine as you can see 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.730
 in the video once the turbine is built 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.010
 you are going to position it in front of this one 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.820
 door so you can go out without 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.299
 having to spend 750 points and hold on 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 it also whirls because later on 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.659
 will serve precisely this turbine here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.549
 so you pick it up and don't throw it away 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.740
 already from round 2 I would say to use i 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.960
 bus so try to do 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.259
 lots of points at the beginning and then 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.799
 leave a last zombie and go to the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.799
 second station 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:35.560
 with at least a 2,000 point raise here 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.649
 so to be able to open the door and be able to 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.569
 at least it will try once arrived 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.579
 in the second station is not 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.409
 fundamental to go and look for a weapon 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.349
 you can very well even stay alone 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.479
 with the colt I tried to look for a 

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:54.880
 weapon and now you see how it went because 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.709
 I found two really painful weapons e 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.099
 so easily I did not do 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:03.780
 nothing however you can repeat go 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:06.840
 simply with the initial pistol e 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.980
 always leaving a final zombie 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.329
 back on the bus is ok 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.090
 arrived in the second and third 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:18.280
 sorry station or farm not 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.170
 you have to do absolutely nothing for 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.769
 mistake started the round anyway 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.109
 I finish the round I keep 1 and I leave 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.940
 you must not open any gate not 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:32.440
 you have to stay here doing rounder looking 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.930
 to die also because you don't already have 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.150
 grenades so much more we say 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.340
 dangerous to stand round and 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.549
 so I recommend nor leave 1 e 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.910
 go to the fourth station where we are 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.799
 will be the current here you see in the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.989
 flush on the bus and refill beautiful 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.299
 windows also because I could 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.569
 do we make some points here are ten 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.489
 years vary recharged arrived at 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.519
 fourth station went to buy the 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.250
 hood 74 which is a machine gun indeed 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:07.060
 strong that you should keep forever 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.639
 then go and make the switch 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.950
 of the electricity then going 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:17.739
 also to activate if you can 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.540
 take the bus immediately because 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.790
 after a while the bus also from 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.099
 only he leaves and therefore you must do 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.290
 fast build the current obviously 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.910
 to then come back down yesterday to kr 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.930
 get off the bus immediately while it is 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.489
 starting 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.139
 exactly as you did see I am 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.760
 managed to get it right for a pil 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.880
 it was already gone I jumped up 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.340
 managed to take it then arrive in the 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.430
 fifth station 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.010
 or the city if you have arrived here 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.890
 you were good because in the end the 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.200
 difficult you managed to do it because 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.680
 here as well you can know you will find the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.680
 life of tiger not that which pulls 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.010
 more life and therefore with this drink it will be 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.640
 really a lot, much easier 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.739
 resist so don't die because you have 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.709
 really much more life will not decide 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.380
 with two merits then in a nutshell 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.950
 once you get the juggernauts you can 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.799
 save you with any cia 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.269
 even going out of leaps as i'm going 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.340
 I'm fine 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.210
 or buy keep p5 on the side 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.400
 wall ok, the hard part is getting to 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.620
 own city hotel juggernaut and you are 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.930
 quite right here later 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:39.270
 you have to advise you as always 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:41.010
 now leaving a zombie and of and of 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.840
 go say let's improve your own 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.389
 match because as you can see the 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.520
 over wolf hall is not that it is really a 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.960
 armo na and then once 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.110
 once the game was taken it was night in the 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.440
 71 and go and try looking for a 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.690
 weapon a little better let's say how 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.020
 you will see I was lucky enough 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.669
 in fact it never happened from reagan and that's it 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.169
 the weapons you want me that I am 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:12.000
 potentials have been reagan and ak 74 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.479
 I really recommend these as a weapon 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.449
 strong primary which can be or reagan e 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.669
 or a light one though 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:25.830
 something strong and secondary them one 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:27.870
 simple in chapter 74 one who is strong and then 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.340
 you can as well as serve them you can 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.250
 even go buy the ammunition on the 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.650
 wall so I really recommend you 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.500
 I recommend that weapon also because of this 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.090
 you can keep more points not having to not 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.960
 having to stand there looking for a weapon 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:46.370
 decent selling 20,000 points on which 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.780
 you can go and buy daily perco 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.169
 enhance here use points in a 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.169
 other way 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:57.889
 the last thing you need to do is that 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:02.280
 to go to empower and how you can 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:04.380
 as you will know to empower you must 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.599
 okay you have to give it current and then 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.520
 go to town open the safe e 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.349
 go to upgrade but I won't do it for you 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.990
 see if you want some theme guide 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.760
 but it is quite simple as what e 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.860
 so then i recommend the parks 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.909
 are basic jacquard born and to which 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.889
 creval and then I recommend thomson and the 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:26.699
 new the new lost and that of 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:28.770
 tomb that when you die fi game over of 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.599
 call there's a friend of yours ends the round 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.310
 you come back to life with all your weapons 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.889
 the parks you had before you died and then 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.210
 I recommend prestige game I think 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.490
 or that of the race I do n't know 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.229
 you decide it's not that it's useful 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.729
 anyway guys i hope this video 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.600
 you enjoyed it if so left a nice one 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:46.070
 I like to subscribe to the channel 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.200
 see you at the next video that 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.370
 it really will be another strategy on 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.370
 beautiful zombie
