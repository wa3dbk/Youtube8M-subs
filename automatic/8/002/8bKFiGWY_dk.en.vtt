00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
reminds me a little bit of the mp5 but

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.890 
reminds me a little bit of the mp5 but
with<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.799> nice<00:01:23.460> extended<00:01:24.000> mag<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.570> even

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
though ish I was really hoping that it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
though ish I was really hoping that it's
gonna<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.860> maybe<00:01:28.860> 40<00:01:29.759> bullets<00:01:30.119> 41<00:01:31.250> something

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
gonna have maybe 40 bullets 41 something

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.160 
gonna have maybe 40 bullets 41 something
like<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> case<00:01:33.540> he<00:01:33.780> only<00:01:33.900> has

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
like that it's not the case he only has

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.410 
like that it's not the case he only has

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
use em 320s that often and i don'ti I

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.160 
use em 320s that often and i don'ti I
don't<00:03:54.519> even<00:03:54.640> look<00:03:54.940> inside<00:03:55.359> there<00:03:55.600> but<00:03:55.810> looking

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
don't even look inside there but looking

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.810 
don't even look inside there but looking
today<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.470> found<00:03:56.829> something<00:03:57.130> which<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.609> this

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
today I found something which is this

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.870 
today I found something which is this
the<00:03:58.030> m320<00:03:58.540> 3gl<00:03:59.230> now<00:03:59.890> I<00:03:59.920> was<00:04:00.100> thinking<00:04:00.430> I'd<00:04:00.640> just

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
the m320 3gl now I was thinking I'd just

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.030 
the m320 3gl now I was thinking I'd just
another<00:04:01.150> m320<00:04:01.870> just<00:04:02.140> shoot<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.410> one<00:04:02.620> time<00:04:02.799> and

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
another m320 just shoot it one time and

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.710 
another m320 just shoot it one time and
then<00:04:03.130> that's<00:04:03.310> that<00:04:03.430> but<00:04:04.030> for<00:04:04.209> close-quarter

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
then that's that but for close-quarter

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.050 
then that's that but for close-quarter
perhaps<00:04:05.050> this<00:04:05.409> is<00:04:05.560> going<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:05.830> be<00:04:05.980> absolutely<00:04:06.190> a

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
perhaps this is going to be absolutely a

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.690 
perhaps this is going to be absolutely a
terrible<00:04:07.810> idea<00:04:07.930> he<00:04:08.560> shoots<00:04:08.920> three<00:04:09.430> of<00:04:09.580> them

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
terrible idea he shoots three of them

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.230 
terrible idea he shoots three of them
are<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:09.909> same

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
are the same

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.700 
are the same
time<00:04:10.360> no<00:04:10.570> matter<00:04:10.720> how<00:04:10.930> much<00:04:11.110> damage<00:04:11.350> they<00:04:11.650> do

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
time no matter how much damage they do

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.830 
time no matter how much damage they do
shooting<00:04:12.670> three<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:13.030> these<00:04:13.150> at<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.360> same<00:04:13.450> time

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
shooting three of these at the same time

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.350 
shooting three of these at the same time
it's<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.290> bad<00:04:14.590> idea<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:15.640> that's<00:04:16.000> it<00:04:16.150> for<00:04:16.300> the

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
it's a bad idea so that's it for the
