00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.520 
confusing so now I'm going to show you
what<00:03:09.250> your<00:03:09.370> friend<00:03:09.579> should<00:03:09.760> do<00:03:09.879> and<00:03:10.060> see<00:03:10.530> first

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
like I said earlier is he should host a

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.149 
like I said earlier is he should host a
theater<00:03:13.629> lobby<00:03:13.810> right<00:03:14.439> now<00:03:14.620> I'm<00:03:14.859> just<00:03:14.980> going
