arrows to adjust that so as you can see

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.890 
arrows to adjust that so as you can see
it<00:03:26.099> just<00:03:26.280> makes<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.669> background<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.449> little

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.259 
it just makes the background a little
softer<00:03:28.409> blurry<00:03:30.109> once<00:03:31.109> I<00:03:31.260> have<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.849> close<00:03:32.849> and

and<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:46.229> one<00:03:46.439> I'm<00:03:46.620> going<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.859> soften<00:03:47.159> by

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
and this one I'm going to soften by

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.649 
and this one I'm going to soften by
let's<00:03:49.379> say<00:03:50.750> 30%<00:03:52.699> so<00:03:53.699> going<00:03:53.909> back<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.449> forth

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
let's say 30% so going back and forth

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.420 
let's say 30% so going back and forth
between<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.229> two<00:03:55.379> images<00:03:55.799> you<00:03:55.979> can<00:03:56.099> kind<00:03:56.340> of

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
between the two images you can kind of

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.490 
between the two images you can kind of
see<00:03:56.669> it's<00:03:57.090> very<00:03:57.269> subtle<00:03:57.540> change<00:03:57.900> but<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.379> is

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
see it's very subtle change but it is

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.429 
see it's very subtle change but it is
there<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.090> right<00:04:00.090> now<00:04:00.239> if<00:04:00.419> I<00:04:00.540> go<00:04:00.689> to<00:04:00.720> slideshow

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
there and right now if I go to slideshow

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.640 
there and right now if I go to slideshow
view<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.129> go<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.819> first<00:04:03.120> slide<00:04:03.470> this<00:04:04.470> is

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
view and go to the first slide this is

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.199 
view and go to the first slide this is
what<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:04.889> looks<00:04:05.040> like<00:04:05.099> when<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.430> advanced<00:04:05.849> it

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
what it looks like when I advanced it

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.059 
what it looks like when I advanced it
just<00:04:06.419> jumps<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.049> blurry<00:04:07.409> image<00:04:07.799> which<00:04:07.979> I

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
just jumps to that blurry image which I

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.740 
just jumps to that blurry image which I
don't<00:04:08.129> really<00:04:08.430> don't<00:04:08.519> want<00:04:08.849> I<00:04:09.090> want<00:04:09.389> it<00:04:09.479> to<00:04:09.599> be

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
don't really don't want I want it to be

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.729 
don't really don't want I want it to be
kind<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.139> softer<00:04:10.829> fade<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:12.379> selecting<00:04:13.379> slide

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
kind of a softer fade so selecting slide

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.129 
kind of a softer fade so selecting slide
two<00:04:14.040> if<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.489> go<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.669> my<00:04:14.729> transitions<00:04:15.479> tab<00:04:15.840> and

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
two if I go to my transitions tab and

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.089 
two if I go to my transitions tab and
choose<00:04:16.349> fade<00:04:18.169> now<00:04:19.169> when<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:19.859> run<00:04:20.280> slideshow

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
choose fade now when I run slideshow

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.740 
choose fade now when I run slideshow
slowly<00:04:23.099> transitions<00:04:23.969> to<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.240> second<00:04:24.630> slide

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
slowly transitions to that second slide

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.280 
slowly transitions to that second slide
so<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.260> blur<00:04:25.529> looks<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.130> little<00:04:26.310> more<00:04:26.550> subtle

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
so the blur looks a little more subtle

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.710 
so the blur looks a little more subtle
now<00:04:28.290> one<00:04:28.710> final<00:04:28.919> element<00:04:29.250> on<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:30.150> second

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
now one final element on the second

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.439 
now one final element on the second
slide<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.290> that<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.710> my<00:04:32.010> text<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.790> clarifies

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
slide and that is my text that clarifies

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.780 
slide and that is my text that clarifies
what's<00:04:33.840> happening<00:04:34.350> with<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.830> animations<00:04:35.430> or

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
what's happening with the animations or

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.600 
what's happening with the animations or
the<00:04:35.880> transition<00:04:36.620> so<00:04:37.620> I'm<00:04:37.919> going<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.130> add<00:04:38.280> a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
the transition so I'm going to add a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.480 
the transition so I'm going to add a
rectangle<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.770> I'm<00:04:40.949> just<00:04:41.100> going<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.280> color

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
rectangle and I'm just going to color

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.610 
rectangle and I'm just going to color
that<00:04:41.900> black<00:04:42.900> for<00:04:43.320> now<00:04:46.970> and<00:04:48.139> then<00:04:49.139> adjust<00:04:49.560> the

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
that black for now and then adjust the

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.680 
that black for now and then adjust the
size<00:04:49.949> of<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.930> text<00:04:52.410> in<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.860> position<00:04:53.690> maybe

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
size of the text in the position maybe

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.740 
size of the text in the position maybe
on<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:54.900> side<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:56.040> I<00:04:56.610> can<00:04:56.669> also<00:04:56.880> do<00:04:57.210> something

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
on that side and I can also do something

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.629 
on that side and I can also do something
like<00:04:57.930> adjust<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.470> transparency<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.370> that

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
like adjust the transparency of that

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.490 
like adjust the transparency of that
object<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.120> make<00:05:00.300> a<00:05:00.360> little<00:05:00.690> bit<00:05:00.930> more<00:05:01.139> of<00:05:01.410> the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
object to make a little bit more of the

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.719 
object to make a little bit more of the
background<00:05:01.740> stand<00:05:02.460> out<00:05:04.310> there<00:05:05.310> we<00:05:05.400> go<00:05:05.550> and

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
background stand out there we go and

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.730 
background stand out there we go and
maybe<00:05:05.910> maybe<00:05:06.510> I<00:05:06.600> don't<00:05:06.690> want<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:07.110> border

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
maybe maybe I don't want that border

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.870 
maybe maybe I don't want that border
around<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.400> box

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.620 
the slide I'm going to add an animation
to<00:05:17.789> that<00:05:17.970> object

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
to that object

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.310 
to that object
just<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.320> simple<00:05:19.560> fade<00:05:19.979> we'll<00:05:20.370> do<00:05:20.550> an<00:05:20.900> on<00:05:21.900> click

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
just a simple fade we'll do an on click

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.969 
just a simple fade we'll do an on click
and<00:05:23.030> now<00:05:24.030> when<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.270> run<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.660> presentation

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
and now when I run the presentation

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.400 
and now when I run the presentation
there's<00:05:25.979> the<00:05:26.220> first<00:05:26.400> slide<00:05:26.990> advanced<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.289> the

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
there's the first slide advanced to the

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.529 
there's the first slide advanced to the
second<00:05:28.800> slide<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.910> kind<00:05:30.180> of<00:05:30.210> see<00:05:30.360> how<00:05:30.389> the

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
second slide and kind of see how the

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.500 
second slide and kind of see how the
focus<00:05:30.840> changes<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.800> then<00:05:32.550> bring<00:05:33.030> on<00:05:33.210> that

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
focus changes and then bring on that

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.969 
focus changes and then bring on that
text<00:05:33.870> box<00:05:35.150> so<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:36.180> is<00:05:36.690> one<00:05:37.020> way<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:37.530> you<00:05:37.710> can

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
text box so that is one way that you can

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.370 
text box so that is one way that you can
change<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.700> focus<00:05:39.389> or<00:05:39.599> where<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:39.960> audience
