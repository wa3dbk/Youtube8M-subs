00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
going there's not going to be trick

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.710 
going there's not going to be trick
showers<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> black<00:01:30.000> ops<00:01:30.210> right<00:01:30.329> now<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:30.600> it's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720

showers and black ops right now but it's
definitely<00:01:30.900> there<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.670> i<00:01:32.670> think<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.030> is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
definitely there and i think this is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.690 
definitely there and i think this is
because<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.750> made<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.170> pretty<00:01:34.860> effective<00:01:35.579> i

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
because they made it pretty effective i

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.530 
because they made it pretty effective i
mean<00:01:36.229> they<00:01:37.229> didn't<00:01:37.680> destroy<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.670> YY<00:01:39.150> like

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
mean they didn't destroy the YY like

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.590 
mean they didn't destroy the YY like
Martha<00:01:39.990> 3<00:01:40.290> did<00:01:40.470> or<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.909> triangle

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
Thea I don't like how they have they're

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.400 
Thea I don't like how they have they're
not<00:03:14.950> like<00:03:15.700> straight<00:03:16.090> up<00:03:16.120> kills<00:03:16.569> so<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:17.230> don't

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
not like straight up kills so you don't

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.990 
not like straight up kills so you don't
get<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.560> hunter-killer<00:03:17.859> after<00:03:18.310> five<00:03:18.519> cows<00:03:18.850> or

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
get a hunter-killer after five cows or

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.370 
get a hunter-killer after five cows or
even<00:03:19.209> after<00:03:19.420> six<00:03:19.690> kills<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.019> get<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.260> after

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
even after six kills you get it after

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.410 
even after six kills you get it after
five<00:03:20.799> and<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:21.069> quarter<00:03:21.340> kills<00:03:21.819> or<00:03:22.060> something

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
five and a quarter kills or something

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.809 
five and a quarter kills or something
which<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.319> really<00:03:23.530> weird<00:03:23.739> because<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.340> guess

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
which is really weird because I guess

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.129 
which is really weird because I guess
you<00:03:24.940> can<00:03:25.060> get<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.269> from<00:03:25.329> getting<00:03:25.540> assistant

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
you can get it from getting assistant

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.750 
you can get it from getting assistant

really<00:04:00.190> i<00:04:00.220> have<00:04:00.609> been<00:04:00.730> using<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.060> set<00:04:01.239> up<00:04:01.329> a

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
really i have been using the set up a

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:02.909 
really i have been using the set up a
lot<00:04:01.569> here<00:04:01.690> when<00:04:01.840> I'm<00:04:01.930> sniping<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:02.349> really<00:04:02.769> do

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
lot here when I'm sniping I really do

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.839 
lot here when I'm sniping I really do
like<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.250> because<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:05.290> not<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.859> rigs<00:04:06.430> insanely

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
like it because it's not a rigs insanely

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.309 
like it because it's not a rigs insanely
hard<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.180> get<00:04:07.329> like<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.569> first<00:04:07.780> guy<00:04:07.959> she<00:04:07.989> gives

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
hard to get like the first guy she gives

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.190 
hard to get like the first guy she gives
5<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:08.919> then<00:04:09.609> I<00:04:09.940> think<00:04:10.329> it's<00:04:10.419> seven<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.019> eight

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
5 and then I think it's seven and eight

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.680 
5 and then I think it's seven and eight
or<00:04:11.590> eight<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.730> nine<00:04:12.910> something<00:04:13.359> like<00:04:13.480> as

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
or eight and nine something like as

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.620 
or eight and nine something like as
seven<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.319> eight<00:04:14.410> sounds<00:04:14.709> more<00:04:14.829> like<00:04:14.859> it<00:04:15.130> but

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
seven and eight sounds more like it but

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.890 
seven and eight sounds more like it but
oh<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:17.320> remember<00:04:17.770> what<00:04:17.890> it<00:04:17.980> is<00:04:18.270> 750<00:04:19.270> and<00:04:19.480> eight<00:04:19.690> I

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
oh I remember what it is 750 and eight I

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.860 
oh I remember what it is 750 and eight I
think<00:04:20.260> or<00:04:21.100> something<00:04:21.610> like<00:04:22.030> that<00:04:22.090> anyways<00:04:22.510> but

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
think or something like that anyways but

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.140 
think or something like that anyways but
if<00:04:23.410> they're<00:04:23.650> not<00:04:23.680> super<00:04:24.100> high<00:04:24.370> killstreaks<00:04:24.700> so

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
if they're not super high killstreaks so

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.390 
if they're not super high killstreaks so
you<00:04:25.450> can<00:04:25.630> still<00:04:26.050> be<00:04:26.290> pretty<00:04:26.590> aggressive<00:04:27.250> with

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
you can still be pretty aggressive with

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.160 
you can still be pretty aggressive with
a<00:04:27.430> sniper<00:04:27.790> not<00:04:28.600> that<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:28.780> made<00:04:28.960> an<00:04:29.020> aggressive

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
a sniper not that I made an aggressive

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.330 
a sniper not that I made an aggressive
in<00:04:29.380> this<00:04:29.470> gameplay<00:04:29.650> but<00:04:29.890> I<00:04:29.950> can<00:04:30.100> be<00:04:30.190> pretty

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
in this gameplay but I can be pretty

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.460 
in this gameplay but I can be pretty
aggressive<00:04:30.820> with<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.480> sniper<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:32.080> still

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
aggressive with a sniper and still

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.740 
aggressive with a sniper and still
consistently<00:04:33.310> get<00:04:33.550> these<00:04:33.730> killstreaks<00:04:34.390> late

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
consistently get these killstreaks late
