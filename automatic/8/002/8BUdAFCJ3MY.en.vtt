going<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.060> take<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.270> piece<00:02:03.649> coat<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
going to take a piece coat it in the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.670 
going to take a piece coat it in the
flour<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.869> drop<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> oil<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
flour and drop it in the oil and

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.569 
flour and drop it in the oil and
hopefully<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.039> doesn't<00:02:08.280> explode

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.140 

and<00:02:12.579> that's<00:02:12.879> how<00:02:13.000> we<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:16.000> my

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and that's how we do it I like my

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.210 
and that's how we do it I like my
scrapple<00:02:16.629> extra<00:02:17.049> crispy<00:02:17.439> so<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:17.920> longer<00:02:18.189> you

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
scrapple extra crispy so the longer you

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.860 
scrapple extra crispy so the longer you
fry<00:02:18.549> it<00:02:18.579> obviously<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.269> more<00:02:19.390> crispy<00:02:19.750> it's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
fry it obviously the more crispy it's

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.479 
fry it obviously the more crispy it's
going<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.079> be<00:02:20.230> folks<00:02:20.769> at<00:02:20.920> home<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.340> my
