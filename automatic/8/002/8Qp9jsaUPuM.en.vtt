00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello welcome to weave cane today 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.160
 I want to teach how to make a simulator 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.709
 for our aquarium very much 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.900
 economic and very simple we are going to 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.670
 need a plastic cup 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.710
 transparent especially especially for 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.320
 see what happens inside and back the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.900
 task a flexible tube 06 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.730
 also transparent would be best for 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.789
 can see if any stone is left 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.099
 inside the school and a knife with 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.590
 the more the better it sharpened tip 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.710
 that you do not have a daughter, the process is very 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.040
 simple a hole is made 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.040
 at 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.760
 graphing with patience a lot of patience 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.100
 because if we go very fast it is possible 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.100
 to lower the glass is practical 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.390
 we have to repeat the operation is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.390
 important not to go over the hole 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.949
 use the burr 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.070
 obtain 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.520
 a fixation that prevents the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.920
 water around and make the task easier 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.689
 to make the siphon so simple made 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.300
 that we do not have to put any type 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.930
 of material like 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.930
 A) Yes 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.070
 South American 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.340
 when we believe that it is approaching 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:44.920
 size we need 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.920
 testing 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.229
 ah 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.560
 if it fits surely this first time what 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.560
 that for him I have not done better to check 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.720
 ah 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.670
 what we have 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.400
 we check now 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.260
 we swear it's almost almost 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.580
 now 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.200
 we have already entered what we do is 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.060
 keep pulling 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.390
 in this way that was long and that for 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.390
 outside 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.110
 an amount inside enough 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.110
 big enough so that when you move it 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.720
 now let's see how to use it from the 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.750
 source 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.040
 well I present my aquarium once 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.440
 we have turned off 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.900
 the issue and the bomb 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.350
 we open the lid and I will show you 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.430
 because this method is so good 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.470
 for 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.160
 from the water of kilowatts-hour 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.160
 it is caught 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.770
 it would fill the glass and just like that 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.400
 by communicating vessel would already be 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.890
 extracting the water 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.890
 see what quick actions 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.210
 now let's proceed to your face 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.210
 catch 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.079
 it's going away 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.910
 and we see how the described 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.370
 remains of food and so on that can be 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.370
 get accumulated in the background 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.070
 when using the glass society does not come out 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.280
 because it's just going through 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.280
 here 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.430
 so we can use then this 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.130
 water if we do not want to create the bathroom 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.680
 directly because I use it for 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.160
 plants 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:04.690
 taking advantage of the water carries 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.870
 nutrients generated by fish and 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:11.080
 bacteria as would the incoming and 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.510
 the nitrites the remains of detritus and 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.990
 organic matter in general be good 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.390
 water with fertilizer 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.050
 and this is all I hope you have 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:27.750
 liked and if you like to like 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.750
