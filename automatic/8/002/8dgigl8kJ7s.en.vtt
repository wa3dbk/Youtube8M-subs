00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.940
 ah 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.900
 hi techno indret friends i hope that 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.640
 be 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.710
 super mega, good, well, how can you 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.040
 watch this new electoral video today 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.360
 end as a solution to the problem of 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.390
 overheating in the PC of the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.340
 computers usually happens when you 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.550
 you have many programs installed as 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.820
 many programs running what 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.300
 happens is that the pc is overloaded 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.950
 and what happens is that it activates the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.560
 fans that each has 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.590
 our computers and that's why it sounds 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.080
 Well, it does not specify well 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.240
 then I looking on the internet 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.180
 finding out since the problem with 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.610
 the computer type I found a program 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:24.250
 very good that works for me 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.330
 perfection then it is very good what 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.410
 you do 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.800
 control as good the controllers 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.870
 so that redundancy what is good 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.300
 control them and get off the fans 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.490
 and how to close all programs and 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.130
 institutions is a hand weighs almost nothing 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.820
 I do not know how much it weighs but it does not weigh 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.700
 a lot very good program then in the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.430
 description of the video pastes the link of the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.310
 official page for you to download it 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.720
 which would be good this is a 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.920
 server because study of problems 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.229
 original 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.670
 good here this lift 4.47 can 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.540
 have later to be able to show 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.770
 versions of 5.52 the ones that leave you 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.770
 you have here to download the latest version 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.680
 and there is no addiction to caffeine 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.750
 of revision to another page here 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:50.650
 well now I know where the file is 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.530
 like youtube or google with good download 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.629
 and download these attractions and the steps 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.930
 of desks preferably where the 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.470
 from your location can past file 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.140
 to the desk 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.510
 278 hours on the desk 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.330
 such in which the right execute as 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.710
 administrator and has the windows xp 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.570
 give him double 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.570
 but is that the mind in harbin 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.630
 we have all the boxes 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.710
 marked and the first 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.260
 I just arrived without having 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.310
 predetermined 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:37.310
 and installs as you see it does not delay 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.310
 campelo 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.510
 to open it 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.330
 when asked to resign 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.700
 well we hope here 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.910
 also all the drivers or 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.720
 system drivers everything that goes 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.720
 to control 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.680
 it can be improved maybe a few seconds 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.640
 we lack minutes so be patient 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.640
 in that part 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.440
 good friends , I already opened the program 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.750
 completely then as I told you 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.009
 previously it will take several minutes 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.410
 number 22 minutes so be my computer 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.410
 as quickly as possible it takes a bit 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.470
 - in our systems install all 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.479
 the green bars mean with your 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.210
 computer while you have many 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.729
 institution programs and it must close 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.310
 programs and let them rest a bit 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.660
 for what and restart it later 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.690
 they are until you are sad that tells us 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.030
 well the temperatures plus computer 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.560
 when he was traveling millions working 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.820
 well oil south and when you enter and 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.669
 after you're hot it's already in degrees 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.840
 because superior that sounds in danger and can 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.840
 put another identity 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.719
 to do that 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.060
 in automatic 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:30.969
 fan speed 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.909
 automatic we look for that castilla and then 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:37.650
 we started to walk all the drivers that 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:41.720
 they have at home and contacts work 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:46.970
 as we know that working these 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:51.620
 signs because the looks I looked at and more 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.900
 will start with at least 50 time if your 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.889
 computer 1 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.060
 after those five minutes not 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.210
 he answered is still as hot from 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.320
 water scarce and applies is under that 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.680
 operation as Luis say continuous as 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.070
 if nothing 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.889
 well there are more functions 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:18.139
 I remind you that we can 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:22.400
 affect your typical pc now 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:25.030
 and well here exotix is ​​also an option 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.670
 to improve 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.060
 but the performance that we have made of 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.060
 magic 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.760
 and well there's also starts 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.100
 to improve position 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.550
 there are other functions to fall down this is 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.670
 to see 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.689
 graphs this goes for all 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:50.439
 systems temperature 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:54.759
 we have everything here they are not looking for that 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:58.199
 second a temperature and speed of 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.199
 the fans 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:13.840
 and voltages 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.840
 the roads seems like a why 

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:25.060
 good 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:26.449
 the range speed greater 50 and a 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.699
 speed 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:31.639
 and a friend I think that was all 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.650
 this electoral video we have in another 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.620
 holes 3 and after easy and with the 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:39.259
 game clicks and then the videos asked that 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:43.240
 out to my channel all until the next 

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:43.240
 thank you lying means
