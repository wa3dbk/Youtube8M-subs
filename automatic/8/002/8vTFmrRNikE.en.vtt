00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
tablet I think the price is a bit too

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.870 
tablet I think the price is a bit too
high<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.500> tablet<00:01:28.799> competing<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:29.729> some

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
high for this tablet competing with some

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880 
high for this tablet competing with some
of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.030> other<00:01:30.210> tablets<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.140> still<00:01:31.740> really

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
of the other tablets but I still really

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.530 
of the other tablets but I still really
like<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> design<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.729> tablet<00:01:33.000> knee

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
like the design with this tablet knee

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.569 
like the design with this tablet knee
alright<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.590> coming<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.100> number<00:01:35.189> three<00:01:35.549> is

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
alright so coming in at number three is

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.510 
alright so coming in at number three is
the<00:01:35.759> iPad<00:01:36.270> Mini<00:01:36.570> now<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.170> iPad<00:01:37.619> Mini<00:01:38.100> starts<00:01:38.460> I

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the iPad Mini now the iPad Mini starts I

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.149 
the iPad Mini now the iPad Mini starts I
think<00:01:38.700> lowest<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.210> 334<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.470> 16<00:01:40.979> gigabyte

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
think lowest of 334 the 16 gigabyte

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.149 
think lowest of 334 the 16 gigabyte
version<00:01:41.790> Wi-Fi<00:01:42.600> version<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> reason<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
version Wi-Fi version so the reason the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.010 
version Wi-Fi version so the reason the
iPad<00:01:44.579> Mini<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.180> list<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
iPad Mini is on this list is because the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.160 
iPad Mini is on this list is because the
iPad<00:01:46.439> has<00:01:46.770> probably<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> best<00:01:47.790> apps<00:01:48.299> for

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
iPad has probably the best apps for

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.770 
iPad has probably the best apps for
tablets<00:01:49.439> right<00:01:50.130> now<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
tablets right now so in the in the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.530 
tablets right now so in the in the
7-inch<00:01:52.500> range<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.369> believe<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.850> think<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.450> has

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
7-inch range I believe I think it has

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.179 
7-inch range I believe I think it has
some<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> best<00:01:54.990> applications<00:01:55.290> that's<00:01:55.979> why

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
some of the best applications that's why

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.789
