both<00:02:48.939> have<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.540> claim<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.169> the<00:02:50.349> crown<00:02:50.590> and

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.559 

well<00:02:53.829> it<00:02:53.980> goes<00:02:54.189> a<00:02:54.430> lot<00:02:54.549> of<00:02:54.700> back<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:54.849> forth<00:02:55.030> but

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
well it goes a lot of back and forth but

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:05.729 
well it goes a lot of back and forth but
in<00:02:56.439> the<00:02:56.620> end<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:57.849> ends<00:02:58.599> up<00:02:58.689> as<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:58.989> civil<00:02:59.500> war
