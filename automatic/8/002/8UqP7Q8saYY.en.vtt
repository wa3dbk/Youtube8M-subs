00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
AJ Lee asked for her I guess you can say

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.119 
AJ Lee asked for her I guess you can say
rematch<00:02:19.420> even<00:02:20.049> though<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.319> been<00:02:20.499> after<00:02:20.769> so

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
rematch even though it's been after so

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.789 
rematch even though it's been after so
long<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.939> guess<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.810> Daniel<00:02:23.200> Bryan<00:02:23.439> runned

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
long but I guess the Daniel Bryan runned

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.199 
long but I guess the Daniel Bryan runned
and<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.069> was<00:02:24.189> going<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:24.609> long<00:02:24.819> before<00:02:24.999> they

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:09.969 
you would think that in an XT being

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.520 
you would think that in an XT being
developmental<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.959> it<00:03:11.139> doesn't<00:03:11.409> really

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
developmental and it doesn't really

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.920

count<00:03:11.859> on<00:03:12.129> your<00:03:12.400> record<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:13.629> would<00:03:13.750> think

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
count on your record you would think

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.720 
count on your record you would think
that<00:03:14.049> debited<00:03:14.500> B<00:03:14.590> would<00:03:14.829> be<00:03:14.859> you<00:03:15.280> know<00:03:15.370> letting

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
that debited B would be you know letting

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.490
