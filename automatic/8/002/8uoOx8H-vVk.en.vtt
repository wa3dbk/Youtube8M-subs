00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.280 
because that will make programs
automatically<00:01:54.450> lower<00:01:54.630> your<00:01:54.840> volume<00:01:54.960> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
automatically lower your volume and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.260 
automatically lower your volume and
adjust<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> settings<00:01:55.920> where<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.030> probably

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
adjust the settings where you probably

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.580 
adjust the settings where you probably
wouldn't<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.409> probably

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
wouldn't like it to you just probably

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.580 
wouldn't like it to you just probably
just<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.979> keep<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.189> same<00:01:59.340> way<00:01:59.509> now<00:02:00.509> that's<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
just to keep the same way now that's the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.980 
just to keep the same way now that's the
first<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.299> first<00:02:03.390> issue<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
first that can be the first issue the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.950 
first that can be the first issue the
second<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:04.890> could<00:02:05.640> be<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.390> were<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.659> skype

microphone settings it should be checked
that<00:02:37.030> could<00:02:37.209> be<00:02:37.299> another<00:02:37.540> issue<00:02:37.750> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
that could be another issue it

level it'll automatically go up and down

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.410 
level it'll automatically go up and down
according<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:41.829> how<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:41.980> speak<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.640> it's<00:02:43.060> just

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
according to how you speak and it's just

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.880 
according to how you speak and it's just
another<00:02:43.599> one<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.780> those<00:02:43.900> issues<00:02:44.110> that's<00:02:44.319> the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
another one of those issues that's the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.250 
another one of those issues that's the
second<00:02:45.250> option<00:02:45.489> for<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.000> if<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:47.110> were<00:02:47.230> using

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
second option for that if you were using

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.690 
second option for that if you were using
Skype<00:02:47.739> now<00:02:48.870> with<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.379> lot<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.799> other

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
Skype now with that a lot of other

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.849 
Skype now with that a lot of other
programs<00:02:52.180> have<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.840> same<00:02:53.049> feature<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.470> believe

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
programs have the same feature I believe

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.890 
programs have the same feature I believe
I<00:02:54.069> heard<00:02:54.280> one<00:02:54.489> time<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:54.819> steam<00:02:55.120> did<00:02:55.420> but<00:02:55.750> it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
I heard one time that steam did but it

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.449 
I heard one time that steam did but it
wasn't<00:02:56.140> really<00:02:56.349> an<00:02:56.500> issue<00:02:56.590> for<00:02:56.709> me<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.129> I<00:02:57.160> doubt

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
wasn't really an issue for me so I doubt

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.759 
wasn't really an issue for me so I doubt
that<00:02:57.700> would<00:02:57.790> be<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.030> cause<00:02:58.599> but<00:02:59.410> go<00:02:59.530> ahead<00:02:59.650> and

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
that would be the cause but go ahead and

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.580 
that would be the cause but go ahead and
check<00:02:59.890> your<00:03:00.099> um<00:03:00.510> your<00:03:01.510> recording<00:03:01.930> devices<00:03:02.170> and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
check your um your recording devices and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.110 
check your um your recording devices and
then<00:03:02.859> check<00:03:03.190> your<00:03:03.220> skype<00:03:03.579> if<00:03:03.760> that's<00:03:03.910> what<00:03:04.030> it

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
then check your skype if that's what it

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.449 
then check your skype if that's what it
is<00:03:04.239> or<00:03:04.540> whatever<00:03:05.410> program<00:03:05.890> you're<00:03:06.160> using<00:03:06.220> to

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
is or whatever program you're using to

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.039 
is or whatever program you're using to
record<00:03:06.670> your<00:03:06.879> voice<00:03:06.970> make<00:03:07.480> sure<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.840> it

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
doesn't do the same thing because nobody

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.490 
doesn't do the same thing because nobody
likes<00:03:10.180> your<00:03:10.269> microphone<00:03:10.629> volume<00:03:11.079> being<00:03:11.230> real
