00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
well this is what 100 kilos looks like

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.950 
well this is what 100 kilos looks like
and<00:00:11.050> that's<00:00:11.740> what<00:00:12.010> John<00:00:12.730> Gabriel<00:00:13.269> managed<00:00:13.809> to

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
and that's what John Gabriel managed to

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.380 
and that's what John Gabriel managed to
lose<00:00:14.200> without<00:00:14.650> dieting<00:00:15.639> that's<00:00:15.849> John<00:00:16.180> there

in the before shot and this is what he

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.420 
in the before shot and this is what he
looked<00:00:18.970> like<00:00:19.060> when<00:00:19.390> he<00:00:19.420> weighed<00:00:19.949> 186<00:00:20.949> kilos

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
looked like when he weighed 186 kilos

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.790 
looked like when he weighed 186 kilos
but<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:22.090> weight<00:00:22.270> came<00:00:22.539> off<00:00:22.600> and<00:00:23.110> he<00:00:23.380> kept<00:00:23.619> on

for whatever reason right now your body

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.190 
for whatever reason right now your body
thinks<00:00:39.489> it<00:00:40.000> needs<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.360> weight<00:00:40.630> in<00:00:40.870> order<00:00:41.140> to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
thinks it needs the weight in order to

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.319 
thinks it needs the weight in order to
be<00:00:41.320> safe<00:00:41.590> and<00:00:42.370> I<00:00:42.760> had<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:42.940> very<00:00:43.059> solid

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
be safe and I had a very solid

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.639 
be safe and I had a very solid
biochemistry<00:00:43.989> background<00:00:44.410> from<00:00:44.559> the

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
biochemistry background from the

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.049 
biochemistry background from the
University<00:00:45.040> of<00:00:45.070> Pennsylvania<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:45.700> I<00:00:45.760> gave<00:00:45.940> me

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
University of Pennsylvania and I gave me

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.510 
University of Pennsylvania and I gave me
enough<00:00:46.270> of<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:46.870> background<00:00:47.020> to<00:00:47.590> go<00:00:48.160> through<00:00:48.399> and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
enough of a background to go through and

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.950 
enough of a background to go through and
do<00:00:48.610> all<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.760> research<00:00:48.910> on<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.450> internet<00:00:49.809> and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
do all the research on the internet and

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.869 
do all the research on the internet and
I<00:00:50.410> spent<00:00:50.680> hours<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.010> day<00:00:51.250> studying

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
I spent hours a day studying

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.310 
I spent hours a day studying
biochemistry<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:52.750> I<00:00:52.780> discovered<00:00:53.289> something

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
biochemistry and I discovered something

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.350 
biochemistry and I discovered something
really<00:00:53.920> incredible<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.789> that<00:00:54.969> our

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
really incredible and that is that our

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.200 
really incredible and that is that our
bodies<00:00:55.660> have<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.840> fat<00:00:56.140> switch<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:58.090> is

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
bodies have a fat switch and this is

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.850 
bodies have a fat switch and this is
part<00:00:58.390> of<00:00:58.420> our<00:00:58.510> genetic<00:00:58.629> program<00:00:59.350> our<00:00:59.530> genetic

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
part of our genetic program our genetic

activated your body goes into that
storage<00:01:04.479> mode<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:04.989> you<00:01:05.350> will<00:01:05.469> gain<00:01:05.619> weight

being<00:01:56.049> so<00:01:56.139> bad<00:01:56.560> all<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.609> research<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.090> I<00:01:58.149> did

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.239 
being so bad all the research that I did
