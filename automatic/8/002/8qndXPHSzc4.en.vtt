00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.130
 The Pentax K 30 combines great 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.950
 Handling with good design and is both 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.000
 Dustproof as well as waterproof but you 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.460
 also offers more than just 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.550
 water resistance the photos are just like that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.480
 good as for example the nikon d5100 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.849
 or canon 600d with up to 6 images per 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.429
 a solid 16 megapixel 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.800
 image sensor and a pile keypads 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 features offers the pentax k 30 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.540
 your basic price of 850 euros 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.940
 little something for everyone when taking photos 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.700
 with the k 30 it is noticeable that the handle 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.590
 something more complicated than the k 53 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.129
 the housing is a bit thinner and also 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.930
 lighter 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.059
 the camera has a fast 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.489
 Reaction time and offers many manual 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.680
 inspect and feel in spite of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.699
 Rubber seals work just as well 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.739
 leave like the other dslr with the 18 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.469
 135 mm lens, the photos are something 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.390
 blurred than expected overall but 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.820
 the picture quality is pretty good the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.470
 camera produces strong colors or 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.409
 moonlight works the autofocus 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.189
 The k30 is only better for disappointing 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.890
 video fans 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.659
 she takes hd videos missing on her 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.150
 but the basic skills for high end 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.909
 there is neither a micro nor videos 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.470
 a hdmi connection and pentax only has 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.330
 a mono microphone installed 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.100
 That's why there is not really one 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.080
 compelling ground videos with the k30 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.490
 except if it really is 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.860
 absolutely necessary 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.470
 pentax choice for the kit lens that 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.750
 After all, almost 900 euros has cost us 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.490
 Not much impressed almost all kids 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.740
 which we have found online with 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.409
 the 18 to 55 millimeter lens 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.869
 that did not deliver that waterproof 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.140
 pentax offers but for a good reason 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.549
 a waterproof lens that from the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.890
 Excluding kit does not really matter 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.450
 sense 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.490
 advantageous is that the k30 many 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.680
 However, it does take controls 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.049
 until you really have everything on it 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.689
 camera has more motivational filters 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.729
 and effects than many other dsl offers 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.079
 But little recording tips and info too 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.149
 the individual functions 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.459
 of course you can also start with the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.350
 Start k30 right away so easy 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.030
 operate like the dsw of kern 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.100
 but she is not the best 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.080
 The k30 is a sturdy one for all 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.080
 outdoor camera for under 1000 euro 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.120
 looking for bloody novice is the k30 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.430
 not quite so suitable and for fans of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.830
 video recordings anyway not with the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.200
 right lens but the k30 can 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.700
 places are taken the other dsl 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.700
 he just would not survive
