00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 sustainability is our subject 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.160
 of today 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.560
 We prepared a very 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.719
 interesting thing about a couple who decided 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.090
 turn waste into waste 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.599
 decorated home the idea was so 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.800
 sure that the creation became a hobby one 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.029
 chair or else a lot of old stuff 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.420
 apparently would not do for more 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.330
 nothing right wrong all the source of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.820
 inspiration for renan and juliana they are 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.740
 architects and in this place at the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.530
 where are the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.649
 objects needed to create this 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.020
 even create that there we'll come here 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.480
 like a little girl at Christmas at the end 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.940
 of recessions 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.039
 a lot of thing that looks like net rubbish 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.840
 everything wrapped thrown but we're going 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.820
 choosing people is going to find pieces 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.039
 that you can use those that neither 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.539
 It seems that you can use it, you get a 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.820
 tell me this is no use 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.190
 for nothing and only gives a treatment her 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.989
 revive and we can use what we have already 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.180
 it is not useful for many people to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.000
 thinking is another if you leave the couple 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.299
 spend hours watching here analyze from there 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.390
 until they choose the material was made or 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.189
 almost perfect everything as if it were a 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.340
 valuable piece 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.700
 only reused a lot of variety of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.560
 wooden products glass iron nÃ© 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.659
 sometimes you find something that already exists 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 also projects a chair but does not 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.950
 to be used as a chair more 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.320
 always seize your feet or enjoy the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.829
 detail each of each object that you 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.810
 do you think for an exclusive piece 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.970
 the specific suddenly had an idea and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.970
 comes behind what would fit into the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.329
 idea that we thought we one 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.040
 sustainable purchase is well if display is 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.229
 today the sustainability that is our 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.060
 is to try to work with these 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.969
 materials that people sometimes find 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.369
 that has no way to reuse how 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.759
 enjoy and transform into a play 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.460
 home of day-to-day use on a mobile phone at last 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.200
 see that pile of rubble scattered here 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.360
 you can not imagine that it could be 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.610
 used for another purpose 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.560
 already imagined this piece of wood being 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.440
 a door objects or even 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.810
 a piece of decoration this is possible 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.150
 here in the house of the kingdom of Juliana herself 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.099
 they used trash as raw material 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.500
 to decorate the environment 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.390
 are doors that turned pictures pieces 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.590
 wood that gave rise to the support 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.030
 plants and here even the glass is 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.900
 reused and look what charm is in 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.450
 kitchen 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.209
 the tree trunk became a lamp and the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.120
 coffee filter then served as a basis for 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.120
 a lamp and in the backyard of the house 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.350
 wood and bottle bottles gave life to the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.860
 vertical garden 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.140
 there is creativity that people put together 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.780
 all the pieces the ideas and renan people 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.299
 Sit down and talk, and what do you have? 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.590
 make with each specific part in this 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.540
 have to licha 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.519
 sometimes you have to wash off the excess 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.049
 some dirt from something that 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.690
 come in the pieces ne 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.030
 from there that come the way we think 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.790
 Even if we are working on it, we 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.190
 fixtures the gardens the pieces of 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.530
 decor and the best of everything is 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.700
 transform objects at a very 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.739
 low 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.739
 the luminaire for example stayed in 10 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.900
 this support 18 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.150
 the idea was so certain that the orders 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.130
 that have already begun to appear 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.890
 we both people working with 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.190
 an idea of â€‹â€‹sustainability not only in the 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.069
 product but also sustainability in the 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.560
 time to market this piece then 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.660
 I did not pay anything human raw material 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.489
 as larouche several woods and such 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.069
 then it does not charge the customer the matter 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.760
 press not only leave the labor 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.980
 materials 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.160
 this is cheap and practical because then 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.650
 let go of creativity the idea of 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.530
 couple and furnish the whole house with 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.040
 sustainable creations what was in the 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:17.850
 here junk one comes alive 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:19.829
 It is very interesting to win renan 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.870
 for Juliana for the great idea 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.740
 example of initiative that we can use 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.740
 in our day to day
