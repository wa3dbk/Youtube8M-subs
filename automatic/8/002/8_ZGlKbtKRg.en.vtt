00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.630 

you're<00:02:33.170> really<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.680> trainer<00:02:34.099> what<00:02:34.459> they're

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640

you're really a trainer what they're
things<00:02:34.879> amazed<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:45.739> you're<00:02:45.950> waiting<00:02:46.190> for<00:02:46.550> them

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
things amazed so you're waiting for them

00:02:46.670 --> 00:03:21.520 
things amazed so you're waiting for them
to<00:02:46.849> offer<00:02:47.060> behavior<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.780> they<00:03:20.930> get<00:03:21.140> funky

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
to offer behavior so they get funky

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.589 
to offer behavior so they get funky
color<00:03:21.890> like<00:03:22.250> yellow<00:03:22.630> white<00:03:24.280> they're<00:03:25.599> red

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
green blind all the same colors that we

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.220 
green blind all the same colors that we
can<00:03:35.120> see<00:03:35.299> just<00:03:35.329> they<00:03:35.690> see<00:03:35.750> them<00:03:36.049> a<00:03:36.079> little

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
can see just they see them a little

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:54.119 
can see just they see them a little
different

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.140 

she's<00:03:55.129> so<00:03:55.370> focused<00:03:56.170> she's<00:03:57.170> not<00:03:58.120> distracted<00:03:59.120> by

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
she's so focused she's not distracted by

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.759 
she's so focused she's not distracted by
me<00:03:59.510> or<00:04:01.120> mm-hmm

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
me or mm-hmm

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.170 
me or mm-hmm
you<00:04:03.769> can<00:04:03.920> tell<00:04:04.159> the<00:04:04.310> difference<00:04:04.730> when<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.000> dog

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
you can tell the difference when the dog

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:21.370 
you can tell the difference when the dog
is<00:04:05.209> your<00:04:05.599> so<00:04:05.840> training<00:04:19.900> so<00:04:20.900> if<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.079> was<00:04:21.199> starting

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
is your so training so if I was starting

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.409 
is your so training so if I was starting
with<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.680> dog<00:04:21.829> course<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.310> we<00:04:22.370> just<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.850> would

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
with the dog course and we just I would

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:36.310 
with the dog course and we just I would
probably<00:04:23.900> do<00:04:24.080> like<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:35.360> know<00:04:35.389> present<00:04:36.110> it

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
probably do like you know present it

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.800 
probably do like you know present it
they<00:04:36.979> almost<00:04:37.130> always<00:04:37.460> come<00:04:37.760> right<00:04:38.060> great

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
they almost always come right great

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.540 
they almost always come right great
that's<00:04:39.229> so<00:04:39.380> now<00:04:39.560> rather<00:04:39.800> than<00:04:40.010> yes<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:43.250> when<00:04:43.520> I

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
that's so now rather than yes and when I

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.950 
that's so now rather than yes and when I
want<00:04:43.850> to<00:04:43.940> take<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.090> break<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:44.600> would<00:04:44.810> actually

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
want to take a break I would actually

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.890 
want to take a break I would actually
just<00:04:45.229> keep<00:04:45.830> this<00:04:46.039> off<00:04:46.389> mm-hmm<00:04:47.419> because<00:04:47.810> I

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
just keep this off mm-hmm because I

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.439 
just keep this off mm-hmm because I
wouldn't<00:04:48.139> want<00:04:48.289> to<00:04:48.350> miss<00:04:49.090> chances<00:04:50.090> to

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
wouldn't want to miss chances to

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.270 
wouldn't want to miss chances to
reinforce<00:04:50.990> right<00:04:51.440> so<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.740> she's<00:04:51.919> out<00:04:52.070> you're

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
reinforce right so the she's out you're

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.100 
reinforce right so the she's out you're
pushing<00:04:52.669> it<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.000> nothing's<00:04:53.300> happening<00:04:53.840> right

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
pushing it and nothing's happening right

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.870 
pushing it and nothing's happening right
she<00:04:54.800> might<00:04:55.010> think<00:04:57.160> okay<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.190> really<00:04:58.550> want<00:04:58.820> her

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
she might think okay I really want her

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.400 
she might think okay I really want her
to<00:04:58.940> do<00:04:59.120> it<00:04:59.240> even<00:04:59.330> if<00:04:59.510> I'm<00:04:59.660> not<00:04:59.690> here<00:04:59.960> so<00:05:00.169> when

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
to do it even if I'm not here so when

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.740 
to do it even if I'm not here so when
I'm<00:05:00.530> first<00:05:00.800> teaching<00:05:01.430> a<00:05:01.460> new<00:05:01.760> dog<00:05:02.240> who<00:05:02.539> doesn't

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
I'm first teaching a new dog who doesn't

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.960 
I'm first teaching a new dog who doesn't
know<00:05:03.020> how<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.530> nose<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:04.310> target<00:05:04.760> or<00:05:04.849> anything

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
know how to nose to target or anything

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.140 
know how to nose to target or anything
like<00:05:05.150> that<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:05.660> would<00:05:06.289> take<00:05:06.500> this<00:05:06.710> away<00:05:07.060> mm-hmm

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
like that I would take this away mm-hmm

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.400 
like that I would take this away mm-hmm
and<00:05:08.300> when<00:05:08.599> I<00:05:08.630> was<00:05:08.780> done<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:08.930> just<00:05:09.020> said<00:05:09.320> it<00:05:09.380> on

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
and when I was done I just said it on

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.600 
and when I was done I just said it on
the<00:05:09.470> counter<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:09.889> then<00:05:10.010> I<00:05:10.099> come<00:05:10.310> back<00:05:10.340> and

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
the counter and then I come back and

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.850 
the counter and then I come back and
maybe<00:05:10.699> do<00:05:10.880> another<00:05:10.910> session<00:05:11.449> okay<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:12.560> you

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
maybe do another session okay and you

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.230 
maybe do another session okay and you
could<00:05:13.039> do<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.160> inside<00:05:13.550> you<00:05:13.940> could<00:05:14.030> do<00:05:14.150> it

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
could do it inside you could do it

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.270 
could do it inside you could do it
wherever<00:05:14.389> but<00:05:15.020> it<00:05:15.199> might<00:05:15.349> work<00:05:15.560> faster<00:05:16.039> if<00:05:16.160> you

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
wherever but it might work faster if you

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.080 
wherever but it might work faster if you
work<00:05:16.940> where<00:05:17.180> you<00:05:17.210> want<00:05:17.510> right<00:05:18.639> uh-huh<00:05:19.639> and

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
work where you want right uh-huh and

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.400 
work where you want right uh-huh and
then<00:05:20.389> gradually<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:20.900> would<00:05:21.020> put<00:05:21.169> it<00:05:21.229> on<00:05:21.289> the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
then gradually it would put it on the

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.909 
then gradually it would put it on the
wall<00:05:21.590> but<00:05:21.919> so<00:05:22.070> yeah<00:05:22.280> I'm<00:05:22.400> waiting<00:05:22.639> for<00:05:23.030> her<00:05:23.919> to

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
wall but so yeah I'm waiting for her to

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.980 
wall but so yeah I'm waiting for her to
touch<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:25.760> well<00:05:26.210> what<00:05:26.330> she<00:05:26.449> does<00:05:26.599> I'm<00:05:26.780> clicking

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
touch it well what she does I'm clicking

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.540 
touch it well what she does I'm clicking
and<00:05:27.169> reinforcing<00:05:27.889> right

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
and reinforcing right

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.010 
and reinforcing right
but<00:05:28.789> the<00:05:28.910> way<00:05:29.000> you're<00:05:29.180> doing<00:05:29.300> it<00:05:29.510> too<00:05:29.660> is<00:05:29.840> fine

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
but the way you're doing it too is fine

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.879 
but the way you're doing it too is fine
put<00:05:30.199> a<00:05:30.260> treat<00:05:30.500> in<00:05:30.650> here<00:05:30.919> mm-hmm<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:33.320> that's

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
put a treat in here mm-hmm and that's

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.219 
put a treat in here mm-hmm and that's
great<00:05:34.190> because<00:05:34.370> it<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.789> know<00:05:34.820> sort<00:05:35.090> of

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
great because it you know sort of

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.930 
great because it you know sort of
encourages<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.349> dog<00:05:36.530> to<00:05:36.710> go<00:05:36.830> up<00:05:36.949> to<00:05:37.130> it<00:05:37.250> right

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
encourages the dog to go up to it right

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.240 
encourages the dog to go up to it right
and<00:05:38.930> then<00:05:39.229> I<00:05:39.260> would<00:05:39.470> just<00:05:39.620> say<00:05:39.770> you<00:05:39.800> want<00:05:40.099> to<00:05:40.130> be

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
and then I would just say you want to be

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.560 
and then I would just say you want to be
careful<00:05:42.159> that<00:05:43.159> if<00:05:43.250> you<00:05:43.370> keep<00:05:43.550> you<00:05:43.940> put<00:05:44.150> treats
