kind of going to evolve to keep up with
it<00:00:37.739> well<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.550> think<00:00:39.210> you're<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.480> seeing<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
it well I think you're just seeing a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.900 
it well I think you're just seeing a
shift<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.350> consumer<00:00:40.680> behavior<00:00:41.040> where<00:00:41.520> people

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
shift in consumer behavior where people

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.790 
shift in consumer behavior where people
are<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.239> know<00:00:42.270> slowly<00:00:42.690> becoming<00:00:43.350> more<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
are you know slowly becoming more and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
are you know slowly becoming more and
more<00:00:43.980> digitally<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.210> distribution

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
more digitally you know distribution

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.360 
more digitally you know distribution
aware<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.200> wanting<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.739> kind<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.190> their

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
aware and wanting to kind of get their

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.010 
aware and wanting to kind of get their
games<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.760> direction<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:48.930> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
games that direction and I think it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.330 
games that direction and I think it
makes<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.410> lot<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.590> sense<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.950> World<00:00:50.250> of

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
makes a lot of sense for World of

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.850 
makes a lot of sense for World of
Warcraft<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:51.149> by<00:00:51.809> definition<00:00:51.870> everyone

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
Warcraft because by definition everyone

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.049 
Warcraft because by definition everyone
that<00:00:52.949> plays<00:00:53.039> world<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> warcraft<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.910> online

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
that plays world of warcraft is online

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.850 
that plays world of warcraft is online
already<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.809> they're<00:00:55.230> already<00:00:55.440> receiving

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
already and they're already receiving

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.220 
already and they're already receiving
you<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.160> very<00:00:56.430> large<00:00:56.640> patches<00:00:57.140> you<00:00:58.140> know

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you know very large patches you know

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.959 
you know very large patches you know
like<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.770> now<00:00:58.949> downloaded<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.699> four

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
like I think we now downloaded like four

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.569 
like I think we now downloaded like four
gig<00:01:00.120> patches<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.750> our<00:01:00.870> user<00:01:01.230> base<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.770> for

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
gig patches to our user base and for

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.860 
gig patches to our user base and for
them<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.059> downloading<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> game

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
them you know downloading the game

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.479 
them you know downloading the game
digitally<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.100> makes<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> lot<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
digitally is it just makes a lot of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.010 
digitally is it just makes a lot of
sense<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.210> you're<00:01:06.600> already<00:01:06.750> seeing

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
sense and I think you're already seeing

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.899 
sense and I think you're already seeing
like<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.770> across<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> industry<00:01:08.460> more

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
like you know across the industry more

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.580 
like you know across the industry more
and<00:01:09.030> more<00:01:09.210> digital<00:01:09.600> distribution<00:01:09.840> happens<00:01:10.439> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and more digital distribution happens so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.990 
and more digital distribution happens so
I<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.790> that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
I think it's just kind of going that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240 
I think it's just kind of going that
direction<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:13.170> doubt<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.680> retail<00:01:14.010> would<00:01:14.130> ever

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
direction I doubt if retail would ever

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.190 
direction I doubt if retail would ever
go<00:01:14.610> away<00:01:14.700> or<00:01:14.909> anything<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.750> wouldn't

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
go away or anything so I wouldn't

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.420 
go away or anything so I wouldn't
predict<00:01:16.439> anything<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.310> do

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
predict anything like that but I do

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.770 
predict anything like that but I do
think<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> become<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.720> know

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
think it's going to become you know

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.300 
think it's going to become you know
increasingly<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.409> way<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.830> gamers<00:01:20.159> ever

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
increasingly a way that gamers ever

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
increasingly a way that gamers ever
wanna<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.640> their<00:01:20.759> games<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.750> last<00:01:21.780> world<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
wanna get their games the last world of

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.200 
wanna get their games the last world of
warcraft<00:01:22.950> expansion<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.820> big<00:01:24.090> at

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
warcraft expansion was just so big at

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.429 
warcraft expansion was just so big at
retail<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> heard<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.140> gotten

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
retail have you heard have you gotten

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.080 
retail have you heard have you gotten
any<00:01:25.560> kind<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.830> resistance<00:01:26.250> from<00:01:26.700> them<00:01:26.909> with

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
any kind of resistance from them with

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
any kind of resistance from them with
releasing<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.659> way<00:01:27.780> well<00:01:28.530> i<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
releasing it this way well i think you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.700 
releasing it this way well i think you
know<00:01:29.340> they<00:01:29.880> would<00:01:30.270> always<00:01:30.420> love<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.500> no

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
know they would always love to have no

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
know they would always love to have no
digital<00:01:31.920> distribution<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.880> i<00:01:32.909> think

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
digital distribution you know i think

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
digital distribution you know i think
