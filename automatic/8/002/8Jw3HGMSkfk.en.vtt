00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
stove I have a MSR whisper light so it

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.539 
stove I have a MSR whisper light so it
runs<00:03:42.030> on<00:03:42.180> unleaded<00:03:42.540> gasoline<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.459> have

runs on unleaded gasoline and I have

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.710 
runs on unleaded gasoline and I have
much<00:03:44.760> smaller<00:03:44.880> fuel<00:03:45.299> model<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.690> think

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
much smaller fuel model I think

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.020

sometimes<00:03:46.260> too<00:03:46.350> but<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.829> 1<00:03:47.640> liter<00:03:47.730> this

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
sometimes too but the 1 liter this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.370 
sometimes too but the 1 liter this
thing's<00:03:48.239> got<00:03:48.450> such<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.630> big<00:03:48.780> tank<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.230> never
