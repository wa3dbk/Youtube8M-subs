00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.660
 Hi everyone, I'm Lucas's gentleman. 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.930
 photographer school the photographer was 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.710
 teacher of photography is also today 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.530
 our video tip will be about books 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:25.119
 how to charge is when you make a book 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:27.310
 the essay the first important thing 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.670
 When do you want to work on this? 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.010
 testing market is to define what kind of 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.469
 customer even pick up if it gets customers 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.469
 c and d of classes in class b 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.829
 when working with children of the 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.600
 early or most important classes. 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.059
 most of the time it takes 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.639
 consideration is the price of labor then 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.460
 you will be competing with a job that 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:53.559
 has a price margin the gain per 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.289
 rehearsal will be very small but you will 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.729
 do a lot of trials 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.519
 already working with clients of the 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:03.760
 niches a and b will work you do - 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.890
 trials but at the same time you will have 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.860
 a higher profit per test you go 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.980
 earn more at each rehearsal am 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.450
 but a second of that very reduced number 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.190
 there's a rule I always mention that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.220
 no photographer gets stuck in 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.160
 Work has been hard work is 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.950
 because you are charging below what the 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.870
 market expects copper to have little 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.510
 job is charging up than the 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.360
 market waiting for your work 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.160
 each customer identifies a quality in the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.380
 your clients work different from 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.830
 sometimes prefer a type of work in 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.240
 relation to the other but in general a customer 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.850
 will not pay 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.010
 few customers will pay if the price 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.760
 is above the quality that the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.490
 customer thinks he has to identify 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.070
 how much you want to charge is very difficult 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.170
 and also depends on a series of varies 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.090
 variables that have, for example, 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.820
 city ​​that everything is to be a capital 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.890
 if it was not previously the are more 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.960
 cheap 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.440
 depends also on how such a profile of the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.530
 market today with this wave 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.340
 of urban fish trials of clubs 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.720
 shopping 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.860
 the impression that the trials have 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.970
 has greatly reduced what I call 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.840
 value impression is for example the people 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.120
 police charge for example 600 reais and 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.310
 customer is accustomed to seeing no fish 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.830
 purchase clubs in groupon 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.420
 of life is 90 reais and ninety-nine 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.370
 real 120 reais 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.890
 this is the average price you see in these 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.879
 buying clubs already comes from 80 of 40 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.129
 finally 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.690
 But what, what is it, what do I call it? 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.840
 value impression is that the same customer 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.060
 that he does not do this test of 100 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.640
 reais and ninety-five reais 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.950
 he gets the impression that 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.720
 you can charge this amount for a test 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.450
 any factor that can there and cover this 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.700
 value being that this is not true what 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.819
 If it is true, if we make a 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.440
 lot of trials at this value suddenly 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.910
 some profit we may have 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.739
 or at least this can be a 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.690
 initial investment that will win 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.769
 lots of money in no time and it's going to 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.319
 pay with work 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.239
 then to the customer even though he 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.160
 do not do this essay it ends up having 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.569
 this impression of value then it is 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.120
 accustomed to seeing the value always by 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.730
 double digit example and it arrives it looks 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.940
 the budget has 600 reais there in the test 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.220
 in the value of leaving is already half as 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.590
 that someone can buy 95 and 600 are 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.170
 very disparate values ​​this is over 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.170
 slightly lowering market values 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.209
 another important thing is considered 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.549
 When do you want to work with this? 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.709
 How much do you want to pledge if I 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.299
 I do four tests a month 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.190
 and I want to win for example a thousand and 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.680
 two hundred reais I have to charge for 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.079
 back of 500 real commissioner if I 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.120
 I want to earn 1500 reais in the month 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.579
 I have to charge around 600 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.190
 always has a margin of 100 reais 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.410
 expenditures that are spent even 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.870
 I have delivered all the photos on high I already speak 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.250
 on the form of delivery to the work of 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.630
 work delivery 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.950
 but even if you deliver all the 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.349
 High photos you have to consider 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.690
 a range of 100 reais in the test that 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.940
 you will spend with displacement with the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.729
 hd with several equipment a series of 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.480
 factors if you want to look 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.580
 video tip from alan and talking about 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.700
 about the cost of photographic equipment 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.620
 course of photographing a wedding but 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.870
 also serves to get an idea of ​​how 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.940
 the photography course works is very 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.630
 very important to know how many photos 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.550
 You are going to deliver to the customer 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.280
 I defend the thesis that we should 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.010
 have little photo per customer for example and 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.110
 He came out of that hearing 20 photos I 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.690
 I deliver around 200 photos in low 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.820
 and low quality because the delivery of 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.650
 200 photos under the photos that the upload 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.660
 for the signed customer with a 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.000
 Basic edition for the customer to choose the 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.980
 photos and it already has a panorama all 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.310
 You know but the most important thing for me is 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.780
 that the final choice of the photos is 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.280
 small the choice of photos who goes 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.340
 wanting on high will want to reveal 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.020
 Because it has to be small because in my 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.830
 case as job the way I 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.390
 job 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.040
 these photos that I give up 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.350
 or printed and makes a 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.210
 complete treatment that I call 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.460
 complete treatment take olheira take 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.970
 the mark of thorn and draw some signs 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.840
 of skin cellulite these things to us 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.730
 works hard and when are you going to do it? 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.550
 a test when delivering a 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.340
 I work like this in this way with 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.110
 this one with this quality not treating well 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.240
 in photoshop photo 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.700
 we'll be around 15 to 20 minutes 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.970
 per photo so if you promise to 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.950
 package you deliver 100 photos you go 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.590
 spending a lot of time and dictating their 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:01.680
 photos when you get many photos 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.620
 you go beyond spending a lot of time 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.960
 end up hiding the good pictures of the 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.150
 package that you deliver from 100 photos 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.070
 So good photos will be kind of 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.230
 lost in photos more or less this 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.480
 also happens when many 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.720
 The good man in the middle of the 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.640
 less then it ends up disqualifying the 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.150
 work that worsens the quality of 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.330
 job 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.390
 another reason to give yourself few photos 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.950
 is that if the customer liked the result 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.930
 He will end up buying certain pictures and 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.420
 then the great thing about making money 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.090
 making the sites get the 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.400
 customer buy extra photos get one 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.220
 customer to buy new products from you 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.110
 if they sell the test with a high cd 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.020
 from that day on high you 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.940
 also offer a photobook of that 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.850
 and this new product that you are going to 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.980
 to interlig that you delivery charge us 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.660
 an amount that will cover the costs of 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.030
 you will give a profit margin then 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.460
 these products related to a banner 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.170
 for example 15 year trial that the 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.180
 girl on that one banner to sign the 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.070
 friendships such products 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.830
 that make it easier for you 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.830
 achieve a higher profit per test 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.480
 very important also to facilitate the 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.760
 work for you and make you 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.160
 to profit more from each trial and 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.250
 try to maintain a pattern of light in a 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.470
 determined 71 determined not 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.210
 determined a test look because 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.700
 this test look if you do with 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.980
 the light rounded the light 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.870
 evenly matched throughout it will Poupatempo 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.190
 in the issue i will only be able to do more 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.820
 trials per month 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:38.130
 no one makes more good money this 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.530
 I did not speak of specific values but to 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.210
 who wants to know the values ​​he charges 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.640
 Punishments just sent me an email that I 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.710
 I link my pdf as it presents 

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.600
 a budget and then you will have a 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.890
 idea of ​​values is this personal 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.890
 Thank you and see you next time
