00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.540 

if<00:00:00.900> you<00:00:01.350> have<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.680> find<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.010> lowest<00:00:02.190> common

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
if you have to find the lowest common

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.720 
if you have to find the lowest common
multiple<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:03.449> two<00:00:03.750> numbers<00:00:04.400> then<00:00:05.400> all<00:00:05.609> you

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
multiple of two numbers then all you

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.570 
multiple of two numbers then all you
need<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.940> do<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.629> right<00:00:07.200> there<00:00:07.589> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
need to do is a right there the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.910 
need to do is a right there the
multiples<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.330> birth<00:00:09.570> times<00:00:09.929> tables<00:00:10.559> until

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
multiples of birth times tables until

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.210 
multiples of birth times tables until
you<00:00:11.580> reach<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:13.099> multiple<00:00:14.099> which<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:15.000> both

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
you reach a multiple which is in both

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.040 
you reach a multiple which is in both
lists<00:00:17.220> all<00:00:17.910> right<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.359> let's<00:00:18.539> home<00:00:18.750> like<00:00:18.930> an

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
lists all right so let's home like an

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.290 
lists all right so let's home like an
example<00:00:19.590> one<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.609> we're<00:00:20.760> going<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.939> find<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
example one so we're going to find the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.840 
example one so we're going to find the
lowest<00:00:21.630> common<00:00:21.840> multiple<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.430> shorten

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
lowest common multiple so you shorten

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.759 
lowest common multiple so you shorten
that<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.150> LCM<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.810> 8<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.890> 12<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.570> let<00:00:28.439> me<00:00:28.590> write

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
that to LCM of 8 and 12 so let me write

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.590 
that to LCM of 8 and 12 so let me write
down<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.730> first<00:00:30.029> five<00:00:30.269> multiples<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.109> 8<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
down the first five multiples of 8 and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.360 
down the first five multiples of 8 and
we<00:00:33.600> canõt<00:00:33.840> write<00:00:34.110> down<00:00:34.320> some<00:00:34.530> more<00:00:34.620> later<00:00:34.890> if

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
we canõt write down some more later if

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.639 
we canõt write down some more later if
we<00:00:35.640> need<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> first<00:00:36.809> five<00:00:37.050> multiples

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
we need to so the first five multiples

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.760 
we need to so the first five multiples
of<00:00:37.770> 8<00:00:37.980> are<00:00:38.309> 8<00:00:39.469> 16<00:00:40.469> 24<00:00:41.460> 32<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:44.000> 40<00:00:45.410> let's<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
of 8 are 8 16 24 32 and 40 let's do the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.790 
of 8 are 8 16 24 32 and 40 let's do the
same<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.340> our<00:00:48.090> 12<00:00:48.570> times<00:00:48.899> table<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.710> that's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
same with our 12 times table so that's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.610 
same with our 12 times table so that's
right<00:00:50.100> down<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:50.730> multiples<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.329> 12<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.469> about

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
right down here multiples of 12 so about

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:02.569 
right down here multiples of 12 so about
12<00:00:53.449> 24<00:00:54.449> 36<00:00:55.370> 48<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:58.070> 60<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.649> compare<00:01:02.100> both

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
12 24 36 48 and 60 so if we compare both

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.539 
12 24 36 48 and 60 so if we compare both
lists<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.049> first<00:01:04.290> multiple<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.070> come<00:01:05.280> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
lists the first multiple we come to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.840 
lists the first multiple we come to
which<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> same<00:01:06.619> in<00:01:07.619> both<00:01:07.680> times<00:01:08.280> tables

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
which is the same in both times tables

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
which is the same in both times tables
is<00:01:09.659> 24<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> therefore<00:01:13.200> our<00:01:13.439> lowest<00:01:13.920> common

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
is 24 so therefore our lowest common

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.670 
is 24 so therefore our lowest common
multiple<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.729> 8<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.240> 12<00:01:16.009> is<00:01:17.009> 24<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.380> let's<00:01:19.500> do

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
multiple of 8 and 12 is 24 so let's do

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
multiple of 8 and 12 is 24 so let's do
one<00:01:19.860> more<00:01:19.890> example<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.000> time<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.390> need<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
one more example so this time I need to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.929 
one more example so this time I need to
find<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> lowest<00:01:22.110> common<00:01:22.439> multiple<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:23.250> 15

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
find the lowest common multiple of 15

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.380 
find the lowest common multiple of 15
and<00:01:24.479> 9<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.920> that's<00:01:25.979> write<00:01:26.310> down<00:01:26.610> our<00:01:26.909> first

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and 9 so that's write down our first

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.450 
and 9 so that's write down our first
five<00:01:28.080> multiples<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.829> 15<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.570> about<00:01:30.720> 15<00:01:31.490> 30<00:01:32.490> 45

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
five multiples of 15 so about 15 30 45

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.730 
five multiples of 15 so about 15 30 45
60<00:01:36.200> 75<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.640> example<00:01:39.060> 1<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.560> need

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
60 75 so just like example 1 if you need

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.530 
60 75 so just like example 1 if you need
any<00:01:40.920> more<00:01:40.950> multiples<00:01:41.520> later<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.329> can

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
any more multiples later then we can

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.350 
any more multiples later then we can
continue<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.110> list<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> do<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> same<00:01:45.149> with

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
continue the list so do the same with

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.410 
continue the list so do the same with
the<00:01:45.450> nines<00:01:45.720> 9<00:01:47.119> 18<00:01:48.119> 27<00:01:48.869> 36<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:51.950> 45<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:54.030> let's<00:01:54.210> see

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the nines 9 18 27 36 and 45 so let's see

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.770 
the nines 9 18 27 36 and 45 so let's see
if<00:01:54.509> we've<00:01:54.689> got<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> multiple<00:01:55.290> now<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:56.100> both

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
if we've got a multiple now in both

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.660 
if we've got a multiple now in both
lists<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.960> we<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.170> 45<00:02:01.920> here

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
lists but as you can see we have 45 here

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.590 
lists but as you can see we have 45 here
and<00:02:03.560> 45<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> our<00:02:06.060> lowest<00:02:06.360> common

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and 45 here so our lowest common

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.870 
and 45 here so our lowest common
multiple<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.940> 15<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.509> 9<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:10.619> 45

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
multiple of 15 and 9 is 45

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.120 
multiple of 15 and 9 is 45
thanks<00:02:13.880> for<00:02:14.000> watching
