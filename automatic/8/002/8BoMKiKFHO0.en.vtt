for multiplayer but as of right now they

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.389 
for multiplayer but as of right now they
are<00:00:38.030> strictly<00:00:39.030> horde<00:00:39.300> maps<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.370> have

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
are strictly horde maps so here we have

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.460 
are strictly horde maps so here we have
a<00:00:41.489> sniper

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.230

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
come down further if you look to the

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.750 
come down further if you look to the
right<00:00:49.390> there's<00:00:49.630> a<00:00:49.690> huge<00:00:50.110> open<00:00:50.500> courtyard<00:00:50.980> all

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
right there's a huge open courtyard all

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.680 
right there's a huge open courtyard all
right<00:00:53.490> the<00:00:54.490> maps<00:00:54.700> look<00:00:54.880> pretty<00:00:55.120> symmetrical

right the maps look pretty symmetrical

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.770 
right the maps look pretty symmetrical
in<00:00:56.560> the<00:00:56.680> middle<00:00:56.920> there's<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.160> boom<00:00:57.340> shot<00:00:57.780> it's

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.000 
in the middle there's a boom shot it's
probably<00:00:58.870> going<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.170> swap<00:00:59.440> out<00:00:59.650> for<00:00:59.890> like

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
probably going to swap out for like

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.860 
probably going to swap out for like
digger<00:01:00.280> or<00:01:00.400> something<00:01:03.420> come<00:01:04.420> over<00:01:04.660> here<00:01:04.839> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
are completely symmetrical all right now

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.830

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
are going to be fucking hectic and the

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.170 
are going to be fucking hectic and the
team<00:01:28.260> that<00:01:28.410> doesn't<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:28.980> the<00:01:29.070> boom<00:01:29.220> shot<00:01:29.520> is

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
guys will probably take this scenic

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.250 
guys will probably take this scenic
route<00:01:40.440> here<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:42.080> try<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.230> go<00:01:43.410> up<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
route here and try and go up here and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.830 
route here and try and go up here and
grab<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:48.050> hammer<00:01:49.050> of<00:01:49.200> dawn<00:01:49.290> responds<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.220> here

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
grab the hammer of dawn responds up here

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.900 
grab the hammer of dawn responds up here
hammer<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.020> dawn<00:01:52.080> spawns<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:52.920> down

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
hammer of dawn spawns right here down

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.380 
hammer of dawn spawns right here down
lower<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.330> grenades<00:01:54.690> so<00:01:55.580> in<00:01:56.580> a<00:01:56.820> sense<00:01:56.850> it's

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
lower the grenades so in a sense it's

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.590 
lower the grenades so in a sense it's
kind<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.140> crossbreed<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.600> memorial

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
kind of like a crossbreed of memorial

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.020 
kind of like a crossbreed of memorial
and<00:02:02.360> Jacinto<00:02:03.360> kind<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.400> in<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.460> way<00:02:05.580> that<00:02:05.880> is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and Jacinto kind of in the way that is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.969 
and Jacinto kind of in the way that is
designed<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.050> also<00:02:07.200> has<00:02:07.440> a<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.590> hint

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
designed but it also has a little hint

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.400 
designed but it also has a little hint
of<00:02:08.899> let's<00:02:09.899> say<00:02:10.080> fuel<00:02:10.560> depot<00:02:11.330> with<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.540> duel

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
of let's say fuel depot with the duel

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.340 
of let's say fuel depot with the duel
and<00:02:13.590> snipers<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.370> each<00:02:14.550> side<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:15.330> know<00:02:15.420> so

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and snipers on each side you know so

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.990 
and snipers on each side you know so
yeah<00:02:16.530> there's<00:02:17.040> more<00:02:17.220> than<00:02:17.370> one<00:02:17.520> way<00:02:17.550> out<00:02:17.880> of

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
yeah there's more than one way out of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.910 
yeah there's more than one way out of
Spahn<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.630> will<00:02:18.720> help<00:02:18.750> with<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.260> spawn

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
Spahn so that will help with the spawn

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.130 
Spahn so that will help with the spawn
