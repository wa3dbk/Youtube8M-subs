00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.130
 hello people it's me, I'm in 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.660
 Berlin 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.460
 it's freezing cold out here 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.500
 have - a clearly this is not that great 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.480
 But we come to the hot topic 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.090
 this is the shop associated with the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.490
 iphone interview with the iphone 4s and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.410
 with the iphone 5 we are a location above 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.830
 bluetooth connects to 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.960
 make 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.730
 to shoot down information that is whole 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.670
 other thing and there are really cool 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:39.550
 things here and show you is going around 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:41.830
 this is the gb 6900 a for the clock 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.129
 shopping-tour 600 that is also the form 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.750
 the two shock most known 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.990
 and how exactly that works 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.000
 me now 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.680
 as a main feature of which one can say is 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.540
 that is a normal cookies in the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.970
 was broken 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.640
 the salaries are known that is so 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.620
 around broken glass 20 bar waterproof so 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.050
 the whole thing I explain leads itself 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.910
 Director that is a great thing and 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.500
 the main features are that they only 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.660
 when i react to it for example 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.220
 get an e-mail on the iphone 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.630
 the times when I call 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.150
 rows get that will be the same 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.400
 Perform or the time of day application 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.770
 eg not removed from the iphone 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.300
 or because I am is the mature 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.320
 is that only in a position that easy 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.200
 I always tell you to tour 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.950
 Just as an example on one 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.460
 Press button 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.290
 I'm looking for a new iphone 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.870
 and if I bridge up here again 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.610
 the glass tippl the alarm 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.560
 and I always have it 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.570
 found that with the tap on the glass 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.550
 also offers the pure e-mail 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.810
 or both incoming calls that goes 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.820
 also by vibration that with a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.670
 train together that even the clock 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.130
 makes it noticeable by vibration here that 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.410
 i just received an information on 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.050
 1 what is really the main features 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.780
 that is to recognize those calls 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.100
 if you can in the cell phone and of course it 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.310
 also on the clock at these the verbund 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.430
 another time bluetooth 4.0 4.0 I come 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.890
 but at the same time said, but immediately comes 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.600
 station one and maybe i'll show 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.230
 how it makes itself recognizable 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.650
 I can with help there now comes 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.720
 Call 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.510
 then I see here I can make this 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.500
 Just press the call on the glass 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.390
 push off 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.310
 the sound thing I do not have to 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.260
 wait or call the caller for hours 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.120
 let it ring but he knows okay 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.940
 this man who is worth the wait now 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.440
 just not available bluetooth 4.0 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.810
 I already indicated that it 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.090
 a whole whole technology is new 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.410
 quasi new on the market, so to speak 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.910
 the market and so it is very 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.070
 energy efficient so we use the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.450
 also one soon the shock is the reason 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.770
 namely that I am able to 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.130
 a single normal battery 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.920
 Fuel cell this clock in connection 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.810
 with the conscious connectivity for up to 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.060
 to use it for two years and that is very 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.750
 very long and very interesting that it 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.750
 is possible at all 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.760
 this benefit or the main feature 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.790
 this bluetooth 4.0 is just that 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.620
 as good as they hardly use electricity 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.270
 otherwise it is a great thing that the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.360
 Clock itself is with an availability 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.860
 to acquire in the trade 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.990
 twenties watertight there are in four 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.880
 Thanks a lot to different colors 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.880
 from school to Berlin until then
