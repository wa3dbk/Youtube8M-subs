 30 year old man from Eindhoven that I expect to leave 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.310
 cause is the people from Eindhoven played the Japanese media 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.880

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.409
 violent yes it is forgetting but sometimes it is but it is something that goes with it 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.610
 ups and downs our team is really through and you just have to keep going
