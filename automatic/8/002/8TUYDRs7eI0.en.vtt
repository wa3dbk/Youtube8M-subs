local anesthetic block followed by
excision<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.820> nail<00:02:06.390> border<00:02:06.780> that's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
excision of the nail border that's

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.440 
excision of the nail border that's
growing<00:02:07.290> into<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.680> skin<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:09.420> have

growing into the skin if you have

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.540 
growing into the skin if you have

chronic ingrown toenails there are

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.130 
chronic ingrown toenails there are

procedures that we can do

procedures that we can do
where<00:02:13.800> we<00:02:13.950> destroy<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.610> matrix<00:02:15.090> where<00:02:15.360> the
