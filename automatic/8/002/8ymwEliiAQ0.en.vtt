00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.369
 we are about 1000 meters above 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.520
 level of the sea we still have a summit 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.870
 to reach 2,000 meters 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.490
 let's look for this city where 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.160
 supposedly living beings 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.510
 extraterrestrials this all done in 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.280
 stone was built by 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.690
 extraterrestrials stone by stone 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.570
 distract from their ships and descend 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.660
 with its antigravity rays we are going to 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.140
 keep showing them the terrestrial city 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.140
 losses 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.110
 we follow you on the road in the city 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.290
 lost is awesome like a jungle 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.300
 and all the way you can observe it 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.940
 sees very little, it will be growing from 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.520
 stone 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.820
 it's awesome you can follow this 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.820
 as well 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.549
 the researchers in the lost city 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.729
 let's show the caves where they lived 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.250
 before 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.579
 with stone doors and here what 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.259
 we find it is like a claw marked on 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.780
 the stone 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.960
 we know that these beings have four 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.710
 claw fingers well here is 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.729
 marked the stone as fossilized 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.729
 from thousands of years ago 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.950
 we have to keep showing the city 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.439
 lost 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.860
 the researchers where you always go to 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.860
 know the truth
