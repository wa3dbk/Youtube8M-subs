00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
to be able to get them up but you need

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.950 
to be able to get them up but you need
to<00:01:20.520> bend<00:01:20.729> them<00:01:20.909> over<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.479> they're<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to bend them over so they're not in the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.740 
to bend them over so they're not in the
way<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.380> put<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:22.740> new<00:01:22.860> door<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.750> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
don't want to hit the drywall so what I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.170 
don't want to hit the drywall so what I
usually<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.210> take<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> take<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> screwdriver

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
usually do is take a take a screwdriver

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.120 
usually do is take a take a screwdriver
and<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:33.020> pound<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.070> then

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and just pound it out like that and then

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.510 
and just pound it out like that and then
use<00:01:35.549> your<00:01:35.579> hammer<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:38.280> bend<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.700> back<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.960> way

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.730 

generally<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.700> enough<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:46.200> door<00:01:46.619> is

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
generally that's enough and the door is

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530 
generally that's enough and the door is
going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.009> clear<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.060> problem

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
going to clear if you have a problem

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.880 
going to clear if you have a problem
with<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:48.960> you'll<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.380> take<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> pair

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
with it then you'll have to take a pair

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.219 
with it then you'll have to take a pair
of<00:01:49.920> pliers<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.540> bend<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.720> break<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:51.990> off

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
of pliers and bend it and break it off

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.319
