the material handling challenges we face

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.830 
the material handling challenges we face
is<00:00:07.830> as<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.490> have<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:09.000> number<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.750> different

maintenance<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.510> definitely<00:00:28.199> helpful<00:00:28.470> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
maintenance is definitely helpful to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.529 
maintenance is definitely helpful to
bring<00:00:29.070> somebody<00:00:29.340> from<00:00:29.640> outside<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.330> how<00:00:30.480> to

define that vision or define the metrics

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.630 
define that vision or define the metrics
and<00:00:33.480> look<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.590> know<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.800> different<00:00:35.190> aspects

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and look you know in different aspects

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.889 
and look you know in different aspects
of<00:00:35.850> our<00:00:36.050> operation<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.620> were<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.920> practice<00:00:38.489> of

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
of our operation we were in practice of

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.569 
of our operation we were in practice of
implementation<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.170> warehouse<00:00:40.620> primarily

implementation of I warehouse primarily

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.200 
implementation of I warehouse primarily
and<00:00:41.850> then<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:43.260> were<00:00:43.500> decided<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.160> go<00:00:45.000> with

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and then we were decided to go with

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.180 
and then we were decided to go with
using<00:00:45.840> metric<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.320> far<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> engineering

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
using metric as far as the engineering

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790 
using metric as far as the engineering
labor<00:00:47.370> standards<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:49.079> looking<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.559> both

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
labor standards so in looking at both

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.160 
labor standards so in looking at both
solutions<00:00:50.449> a<00:00:52.520> or<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> guess<00:00:53.850> idea<00:00:54.270> too<00:00:54.809> well

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
solutions a or I guess idea too well

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650 
solutions a or I guess idea too well
well<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.340> offers<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.120> doesn't<00:00:57.360> if

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
well what one offers that one doesn't if

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
well what one offers that one doesn't if
we<00:00:57.809> were<00:00:57.930> able<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.230> bring<00:00:58.680> both<00:00:59.190> together<00:00:59.430> easy

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
we were able to bring both together easy

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.849 
we were able to bring both together easy
metrics<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.899> our<00:01:01.050> warehouse<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.710> would

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
metrics in our warehouse that would

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.810 
metrics in our warehouse that would
provide<00:01:02.219> us<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> total<00:01:02.930> warehouse<00:01:03.930> solution

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
provide us a total warehouse solution

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.580 
provide us a total warehouse solution
similar<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> other<00:01:06.450> peanut<00:01:07.110> butter<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
similar to the other peanut butter and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.090 
similar to the other peanut butter and
the<00:01:08.070> Chocolate<00:01:08.270> analogy<00:01:09.270> where<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.500> there

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the Chocolate analogy where it's there

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.800 
the Chocolate analogy where it's there
much<00:01:11.400> better<00:01:11.549> together<00:01:11.970> than<00:01:12.060> they<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:12.479> part

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
much better together than they are part

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.570 
much better together than they are part
three<00:01:13.350> things<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.830> occur<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.280> building

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
three things have to occur in a building

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.010 
three things have to occur in a building
either<00:01:14.700> improve<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> man<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.659> improve<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
either improve the man you improve the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.399 
either improve the man you improve the
method<00:01:16.380> or<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.680> improve<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> machine<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.659> are

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
method or you improve the machine so are

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.710 
method or you improve the machine so are
we<00:01:19.770> didn't<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.130> know<00:01:20.460> where<00:01:20.939> our<00:01:21.210> man<00:01:21.450> was

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
we didn't really know where our man was

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
we didn't really know where our man was
in<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> building<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.860> knew<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.070> needed<00:01:23.310> some

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
in the building we knew we needed some

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.700 
in the building we knew we needed some
technology<00:01:24.150> enhancements<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.900> started

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
technology enhancements that started

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.200 
technology enhancements that started
highlighting<00:01:26.159> processes<00:01:26.820> where<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.090> had

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
highlighting processes where we had

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.060 
highlighting processes where we had
opportunities<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.170> those<00:01:28.500> opportunities

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
opportunities and those opportunities

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.039 
opportunities and those opportunities
really<00:01:29.880> became<00:01:30.150> highlighted<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.900> have

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
really became highlighted when you have

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.370 
really became highlighted when you have
a<00:01:31.079> true<00:01:31.920> labor<00:01:32.579> management<00:01:32.850> system<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:34.079> an

out warehouse program first because we

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.399 
out warehouse program first because we
had<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.240> set<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> logic<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.049> what<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.380> were

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
had to set the logic of what we were

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.020 
had to set the logic of what we were
trying<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:49.890> what<00:01:50.130> job<00:01:50.310> comes<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:50.880> need

trying to do what job comes do we need

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.760 
trying to do what job comes do we need
what<00:01:51.509> are<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.899> monitor<00:01:52.350> what

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
what are we going to monitor what

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.289 
what are we going to monitor what
systemic<00:01:53.250> things<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.119> what

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
systemic things can we do and what

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.810 
systemic things can we do and what
things<00:01:54.509> are<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:55.020> systemic<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.610> brought

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
things are not systemic then we brought

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.340 
things are not systemic then we brought
in<00:01:57.000> easy<00:01:57.149> metrics<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.780> they<00:01:57.840> looked<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.170> all

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
in easy metrics and they looked at all

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.350 
in easy metrics and they looked at all
the<00:01:58.530> job<00:01:58.740> codes<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.159> we<00:01:59.310> decide<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.030> we

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the job codes that we decide is it we

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.660

with the ocean checklist now done

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.550 
with the ocean checklist now done
electronically<00:02:39.210> which<00:02:39.870> actually<00:02:40.080> reduced

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
electronically which actually reduced

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.740 
electronically which actually reduced
our<00:02:40.710> time<00:02:40.890> 48<00:02:41.310> minutes<00:02:41.670> down<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.240> two<00:02:42.420> minutes

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
our time 48 minutes down to two minutes
