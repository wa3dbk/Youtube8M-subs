00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.000
 or that of the world to whom I whine 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.750
 again reb and to create it is about 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.320
 mod 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.539
 Sanchez Jesus mod super funny and 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.119
 sure you're going to like a lot is going to 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.929
 add a single craft or a single object 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.300
 and what is going to be a chest that is going to 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.919
 Keep collecting the things that you have 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.470
 the soil is going to be a kind of 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.970
 rumba type vacuum so 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.160
 I will quickly explain how 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.380
 craft how we will be able to use it and 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.660
 then I will teach you how to install the mortals 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.240
 so quickly we're going to start 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.980
 see and these here are going to be the 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.640
 cracking this is going to be the crafter or 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.200
 final the sugar inches is worth 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.390
 the first thing first of all we go 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.680
 to have to create the head that is going to 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.650
 do this way with green wool 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.300
 sand a skeleton wii head no 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.880
 so you see we're going to have to go 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.920
 to the neder and black wool to make the 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.420
 body part of the body we are going to have 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.369
 than to use black wool and a 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.500
 very well once we have these two 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.229
 objects we will be able to create half 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.570
 upper body that is going to be this 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.460
 so you see it is very easy going 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.140
 to be able to do also our legs and 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.750
 the feet to do the legs again 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.299
 black wool white wool and for the feet 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.070
 black wool and white wool so with 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.409
 these other two objects we will be able to 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.450
 make us the lower part of the body 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.810
 it's worth this way so once 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.299
 created these two these two parts we 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 we can tinker solar inches that 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.979
 will do in this way the part 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.590
 upper a chest and the lower part 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.500
 very well as you see already puts here is nike 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.100
 mag raid more right click to pick it up 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.280
 and it tells us that it collects absorbs the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.429
 objects as one as a robot vacuum cleaner 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.190
 rumba and it tells us holy craft and 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.409
 supply and so nothing once you 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.179
 we have it fretted we come here and 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.179
 to place it right click you see 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.580
 look what monkey and in addition to miniature 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.400
 what is going to do is going to continue 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.080
 Wherever we go, it's worth for a kid if 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.290
 we are throwing things or we are 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.230
 they are falling worth for example 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.519
 make that little noise and pick it up like that 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.989
 that if we now right click on 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.909
 he opened it and has a space of two 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.170
 chests to be like a double chest and 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.370
 you see we would have both of ccoo 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.349
 they are here super handsome you see how we 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.010
 is following the for let's throw him 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.560
 a couple of objects better 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.269
 I 'm picking up I'm picking everything up 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.909
 everything we can throw or everything that 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.950
 is going to find if we are breaking 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.110
 the soil to go picking up seeds 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.650
 falls and finds them also going to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.940

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.510
 He is very handsome and the little sound he makes 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.510
 already 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.370
 so ideally so to have it 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.260
 inside our house so if they go away 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.030
 falling things when we grow some 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.070
 so, what he will do will be 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.570
 automatically pick us up as you see 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.180
 how is it going to serve us so we look for 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.970
 here and it's going to albert sharing you see 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.490
 its speed but gradually it will 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.800
 cleaning that more useful things has going 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.080
 to be able to raise heights very important so 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.470
 that if we come here it's going to come 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.560
 following ok let's throw here already 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.450
 another solar inches and you see we've 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.030
 decided without any problem and get off 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.040
 It's also going to be able to go down, you can see how 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.560
 it has automatically gone through here and goes 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.680
 coming 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.970
 so we have a super robot vacuum cleaner 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.550
 smart and also good in this case 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.490
 it also reports a little bit so 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.250

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.100
 the escape and as we see we have everything 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.750

 I want we could come and leave here and 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.410
 if you notice, we are saving a 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.790
 double chest inside another chest is worth 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.250
 say all the objects that we had 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.060

 You can also take them to 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.640
 the mine or that while we are going 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.500
 then he will pick up the things that are 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.230
 we fall or if we do not have more space 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.870
 he will pick them up by the way 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.460

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.690
 to be able to kill us we're going too 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.910
 to be able to kill is worth it now if I put 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.950
 here a sword because we can give that 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.400

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.110
 poor to see if we kill him and as you can see 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.639

 forge and once installed we will have 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.120
 that download the engine that I leave the 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.550
 describes in the description of the video the 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.320

 minecraft and here there will be another folder 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.780
 call mod
