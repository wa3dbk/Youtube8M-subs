00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
be followed by this slide so when you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.619 
be followed by this slide so when you
see<00:00:38.220> this<00:00:38.340> don't<00:00:38.610> counter-attack<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.449> ready

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
see this don't counter-attack get ready

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540 
see this don't counter-attack get ready
to<00:00:39.750> dodge<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.500> legume<00:00:40.770> bees<00:00:40.920> most<00:00:41.129> iconic

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
to dodge the legume bees most iconic

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.459 
to dodge the legume bees most iconic
attack<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> quick<00:00:42.420> slide<00:00:42.719> forward<00:00:43.199> on<00:00:43.320> its

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
attack is a quick slide forward on its

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.470 
attack is a quick slide forward on its
stomach<00:00:43.770> when<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.309> two<00:00:44.520> legs<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.030> attack<00:00:45.300> has

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
stomach when on two legs this attack has

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.180 
stomach when on two legs this attack has
a<00:00:45.510> quick<00:00:45.780> Telegraph<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.500> went<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.710> four<00:00:46.980> legs

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
a quick Telegraph but went on four legs

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.189 
a quick Telegraph but went on four legs
the<00:00:47.370> Gumby<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.969> use<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> almost<00:00:48.750> instantly

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
the Gumby can use this almost instantly

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.779 
the Gumby can use this almost instantly
so<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.680> good<00:00:49.800> idea<00:00:49.949> to<00:00:50.190> not<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.640> front

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so it's a good idea to not be in front

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.130 
so it's a good idea to not be in front
of<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.359> on<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.629> fours

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
of it if it's on all fours

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.479 
of it if it's on all fours
when<00:00:52.320> enraged<00:00:52.590> legume<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.129> use<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.340> move

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
when enraged legume we can use this move

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.040 
when enraged legume we can use this move
twice<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.030> quick<00:00:54.149> succession<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.929> ready

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
twice in quick succession so be ready

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810 
twice in quick succession so be ready
for<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> second<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:55.739> embracing<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.609> bunny

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820

on whatever's behind it this movie cover

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.399 
on whatever's behind it this movie cover
is<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.299> fair<00:01:18.450> amount<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.720> distance<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.290> it's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
is a fair amount of distance so if it's

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.569 
is a fair amount of distance so if it's
coming<00:01:19.650> after<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> should<00:01:20.250> dodge<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.520> the
