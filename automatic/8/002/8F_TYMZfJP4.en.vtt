00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.829
 Welcome to a 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.449
 new episode - it's a bit longer 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.100
 since the last episode 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.629
 so it will be a bit more today 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.360
 We do not give and talk about news for so long 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.890
 around it we start our own first 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.030
 one with a news to a set that 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.129
 next week is coming out 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.629
 premium gold wants return of the wing 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.210
 or better said in europe premiere 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.190
 Gold 2 there were over the over the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.110
 Last weeks so some new cards 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.059
 will be announced among others will be the 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.979
 mathematicians get their reprint 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.840
 blooming flower bulb masked 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.070
 hero sink is there in there too be very 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.110
 nice for us the cd player 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.970
 fate destroying magician in 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.009
 the dark matter dragon will look like that 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.380
 here will hit and, of course, how 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.060
 Everyone now knows the lava chain 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.679
 a very nice card dividends 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.229
 has finally earned and actually 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.429
 what would not have gotten from the 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.869
 size is you think that 's just the one 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.340
 Gelding by konami or times 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.479
 really a very sensible at 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:39.290
 we leave your opinion simply 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:40.520
 in the comments below what to come to 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.180
 next topic namely the advanced 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.890
 edition turn a successor 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.240
 are from special edition as well as the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.399
 so far we have cut off 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.740
 seen as salmon edition, although not so 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.600
 great and yes, the super Hessian 20 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.290
 cruel you can see how they beat each other 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.119
 become 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.619
 I have no big hope there 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.270
 Wish me back video special edition 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.369
 what do you think what I think your opinion 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.110
 do you have one for that and if yes in the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.880
 comments then come short times in the deck 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.409
 what I usually do not - 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.149
 because it does not appeal to me personally 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.789
 interested in far east get the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.170
 now really great support to 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.540
 different things get the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.269
 to a merger stalker card own 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.640
 fusions monster which is pretty good and 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.440
 even a separate year tuneup with the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.060
 they can make big and whole 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.500
 nice to throw a lot in the cemetery 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.989
 I'm curious what's to come 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.280
 because then you can follow right afterwards 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.540
 maybe also ritual at the high 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.100
 level who even the rituals right 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.840
 nice and I'm curious what's there 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.549
 still comes very interesting as in 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.290
 have developed far and so far and they 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.310
 actually gets a monster that one 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.610
 can summon again that 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.600
 tuner 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.090
 That's exactly what we need 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.740
 even more monsters have become normal 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.150
 we have yet to summon 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.950
 not so many so it is also a 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.300
 very good thing again see something with 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.010
 the deck still in their next time 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.930
 will happen son next 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.910
 we then the plates itb ateliers or 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.060
 however you speak out, yes 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.920
 generic satellite so to speak for each 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.520
 deck and its effect is actually 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.070
 relatively irrelevant except for diamond for 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.660
 all yes what all this card of course 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.400
 clearly playable and clear 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.900
 makes interesting for other text 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.310
 but what interests me even more 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.270
 actually the second effect of this 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.680
 map we read again briefly by close 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.420
 you materials in front of this card 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.570
 skip the next train of yours 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.570
 opponent 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.020
 we do not have this theme worth it 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.520
 shit written age you have everything 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.080
 do it yourself but we do the same 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.330
 continue with new announcements now 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.520
 we the galaxies iclone what a kind 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.080
 mission rauter drove a bit 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.850
 breakthrough skill mixed together 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.500
 is something very interesting card 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.910
 could be in the future as soon as you join 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.650
 Us comes out if through this card 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.480
 it will now be possible for every work 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.459
 more than with the same card 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.200
 several beckum to destroy what we did 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.730
 so far not so had and I 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.170
 think of the konami the whole 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.510
 spelled traction cards are traded and 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.430
 every so always so its a little minus 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.380
 or plus gives like stop tornado twister 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.910
 or even this card and I am 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.080
 curious how this card will establish itself 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.400
 luckily we do not scribble otherwise 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.660
 you would immediately throw away the msc 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.250
 what do you think of the map 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.780
 think she 'll be fine when I hit 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.239
 maybe very nice in wildeck 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.340
 be like all inferno or leitzmann 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.570
 What is your opinion she likes me 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.130
 in the comments 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.169
 so and now comes to support for 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.310
 We have a lot of old decks 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.989
 had many new announcements 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.549
 within the last few weeks and others 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.770
 get german is a new monster 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.750
 the number five ranges they simply 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.640
 Namely, rivalry can grow 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.770
 German chocolate ohso we still 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:37.500
 other changes do not happen like that 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:39.300
 relevant come in March to one 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.950
 fire deck and, so to speak, we break out 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.620
 Earth and make a volcano 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.940
 why does it really fit that? 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.310
 Gives a new card for the celebration 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.050
 queen a great great 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.640
 volcano from the break out the fire 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.040
 want to be king on your celebration 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.990
 island 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.820
 and this card should enter the deck 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.250
 help a little bit by finally 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.690
 the deck allows cards to move faster 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.430
 to destroy the hand and also monster 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.870
 just to weaken from then on 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.400
 Let's see if that is the card on the 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.690
 Full maintenance has been great 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.950
 you will always see a stone there 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.600
 In any case, you can then useless 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.220
 fire kings from the hand destroy around 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.850
 to trigger any facts I am 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.290
 already curious 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.110
 as soon as she comes out of us unfortunately 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.550
 I also believe it an exclusive for 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.470
 A year, that is, if they are 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.520
 can not get so early with us from 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.290
 water will be a new year ago 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.210
 rural map namely the atlantic 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.030
 prince the extremely good for that 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.880
 Atlantic or he is thick for the mm 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.290
 as well as anyways whatsoever 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.180
 oakland is now better in mails than 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.190
 in their own way that's just that 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.560
 card on the waiting for us and 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.720
 also mails but definitely a very 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.090
 nice standalone card the easy 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.680
 super easy search allows and also 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.390
 still stuff weakens and thus with 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.340
 Simply meadows with a map 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.350
 courageously allowed there is certainly happy 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.850
 not only me and / but also some 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.530
 other players like to mails again 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.610
 or just play countries 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.110
 want to see how the map 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.000
 adjust if very, very good 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.230
 strong and let's see how strong they are on 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.520
 But the end will come again 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.020
 back to the deck what I have 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.760
 has played and indeed with it 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.080
 reached my very first top level 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.070
 has kites himself and the 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.480
 were very much support 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.100
 announced, among other things, a new one 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.360
 fusions monster what overload for already 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.370
 that's what makes chemistry much better 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.290
 rampage stretch a bit 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.490
 batty and pretty much attack 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.570
 Can vary depending on how many monsters you have 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.740
 in the cemetery lies through his 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.390
 own effect thereby can however 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.700
 pretty much attack and with limite 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.380
 rowe it gets pretty unfair though 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.150
 That's not all about kites 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.830
 there is even a new monster now 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.050
 for the deck that over the nice ones 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.000
 Mr. nova can pack over and that 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.940
 just pretty sick 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.650
 200 items for each material easy 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.910
 explain an opposing day monster 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.980
 do not even have to be the specials hello 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.390
 ah, you're pretty shitty and yahoos 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.430
 I can just portals the portals 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.810
 negate effect by a patch haye 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.830
 This is not unfair at all here because of me 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.540
 Next year, too , we want to 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.950
 can suck in new material again 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.670
 either from your side or from 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.770
 My side 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.030
 patience wilfried for every train that 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.280
 all easy together in a salad 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.900
 discovered how shopping like tuco you think 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.580
 that this card is exactly what alba 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.750
 I have used kites, I think so 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.340
 In any case, it is a very very 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.780
 Nice strong card is the deck 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.160
 Definitely something to modify it 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.560
 is more himself dragon only give when 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.419
 more dragon yourself 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.240
 infinity in germany then or 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:07.440
 infinite or infiniti one looks at me 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.850
 that will be the end in any case 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.290
 is a very nice card to see if 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.310
 there is more to come anyway 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.690
 what they already get with 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.010
 pretty much already these two new cards 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.690
 crass and then come last but not least 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.940
 even a bit oldschool stuff 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.889
 namely the two nice men red eyes 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.600
 gets very much support and that 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:23.850
 a bit so connected to the old one 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.169
 summoned skull and fusions 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.070
 namely, get their own taxi 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.810
 fusion card 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.250
 they get their own wine of 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.480
 legends so to speak the blackstone of 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.070
 laying down and they get one 

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.350
 retail version of the black skull 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.240
 The kite is quite in itself 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.560
 has and not only that the standard formula 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.300
 monsters also get a gemini 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.620
 monster form delivered the deck yet 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.510
 should do a little better 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.760
 they get their own trading and 

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.979
 a separate kind of hunting wm-train 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.570
 see very deep support for the monument 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:50.040
 that's almost track level what 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.870
 Everything comes out in the next sex 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.100
 for red eyes I'm curious 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.870
 Now I'm just waiting for one 

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.430
 black magic of the track still exists 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.960
 but should not come in any case 

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.160
 these were the julius for these 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.810
 week I hope you liked it 

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.229
 we see you next time to 

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.229
 bye bye
