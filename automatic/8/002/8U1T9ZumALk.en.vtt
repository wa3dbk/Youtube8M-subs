00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
you know I don't think that arguing

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.870 
you know I don't think that arguing
about<00:01:13.030> whether<00:01:13.899> addiction<00:01:14.680> is<00:01:14.979> real<00:01:15.399> or<00:01:15.850> not

about whether addiction is real or not

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.830 
about whether addiction is real or not
real<00:01:16.390> is<00:01:16.630> really<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.500> point<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:19.090> issue<00:01:19.270> is

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
real is really the point the issue is

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.040 
real is really the point the issue is
are<00:01:20.380> some<00:01:20.860> people<00:01:21.250> playing<00:01:21.549> too<00:01:21.850> much<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:22.630> I

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.600 
are some people playing too much and I
don't<00:01:23.229> think<00:01:23.409> anybody<00:01:23.770> would<00:01:23.950> argue<00:01:23.979> that

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
don't think anybody would argue that

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.790 
don't think anybody would argue that
there<00:01:24.880> are<00:01:25.000> definitely<00:01:25.569> people<00:01:25.750> who<00:01:25.960> play<00:01:26.350> too

there are definitely people who play too

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.910 
there are definitely people who play too
much<00:01:27.039> and<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:28.600> they're<00:01:28.840> playing<00:01:29.080> too<00:01:29.319> much<00:01:29.530> and

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
much and if they're playing too much and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.169 
much and if they're playing too much and
it's<00:01:30.250> impairing<00:01:30.819> their<00:01:30.970> life<00:01:31.240> in<00:01:31.569> any<00:01:31.720> way

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
it's impairing their life in any way

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.639 
it's impairing their life in any way
sometimes<00:01:34.179> only<00:01:34.509> in<00:01:34.750> small<00:01:35.080> ways<00:01:35.289> sometimes

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
sometimes only in small ways sometimes

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.680 
sometimes only in small ways sometimes
in<00:01:36.009> major<00:01:36.250> ways<00:01:36.549> but<00:01:36.819> if<00:01:36.909> someone's<00:01:37.270> having<00:01:37.479> a

in major ways but if someone's having a
life<00:01:37.929> impairment<00:01:38.770> then<00:01:39.549> it's<00:01:39.970> a<00:01:40.119> problem<00:01:40.659> some

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
life impairment then it's a problem some

people<00:01:41.380> like<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:41.950> term<00:01:42.159> problematic<00:01:43.000> play

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
people like the term problematic play

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.460 
people like the term problematic play
compulsive<00:01:45.100> play<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:46.539> some<00:01:46.810> people<00:01:47.080> say<00:01:47.289> hey

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
compulsive play and some people say hey

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.620 
compulsive play and some people say hey
let's<00:01:47.709> just<00:01:47.950> call<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.190> addiction<00:01:48.819> personally

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
let's just call it addiction personally

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.419 
let's just call it addiction personally
I<00:01:49.659> don't<00:01:49.929> think<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.350> matters<00:01:50.500> what<00:01:50.860> we<00:01:50.890> call<00:01:51.250> it

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
I don't think it matters what we call it

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.059 
I don't think it matters what we call it
we<00:01:51.549> could<00:01:51.759> argue<00:01:52.569> about<00:01:52.600> jargon<00:01:53.319> forever<00:01:53.740> and

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
we could argue about jargon forever and

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.249 
we could argue about jargon forever and
not<00:01:54.729> really<00:01:55.030> get<00:01:55.180> anywhere<00:01:55.570> but<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.869> point<00:01:56.109> is

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
not really get anywhere but the point is

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.310 
not really get anywhere but the point is
what's<00:01:56.530> healthy<00:01:56.829> play<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:58.810> does<00:01:59.049> play

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
what's healthy play and when does play

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.139 
what's healthy play and when does play
become<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.770> problem<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.549> think<00:02:00.759> that's<00:02:00.939> what

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
become a problem and I think that's what

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.140 
become a problem and I think that's what
we're<00:02:01.299> trying<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.600> figure<00:02:01.810> out

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.530 

well<00:02:04.900> that's<00:02:05.290> an<00:02:06.130> area<00:02:06.490> where<00:02:06.820> we<00:02:07.000> need<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.240> do

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
well that's an area where we need to do

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.530 
well that's an area where we need to do
a<00:02:07.570> lot<00:02:07.810> more<00:02:07.870> research<00:02:08.290> I<00:02:09.070> think<00:02:09.490> anyone<00:02:10.240> who's

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
a lot more research I think anyone who's

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.150 
a lot more research I think anyone who's
played<00:02:10.570> particularly<00:02:11.560> in<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.550> MMO<00:02:13.060> genre

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
played particularly in the MMO genre

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.690 
played particularly in the MMO genre
knows<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:16.050> probably<00:02:17.050> more<00:02:17.710> than<00:02:18.100> one<00:02:18.400> or<00:02:18.670> two

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
knows of probably more than one or two

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
that I mean to the point that they're

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.030 
that I mean to the point that they're
not<00:02:25.060> taking<00:02:25.660> care<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.200> normal<00:02:26.560> functions

not taking care of the normal functions
of<00:02:27.190> life<00:02:27.400> education<00:02:28.710> work<00:02:31.260> hygiene<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.500> an

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
of life education work hygiene is an

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.190 
of life education work hygiene is an
issue<00:02:32.980> some<00:02:33.370> people<00:02:33.670> stop<00:02:33.940> bathing<00:02:34.210> brushing

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
issue some people stop bathing brushing

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.070 
issue some people stop bathing brushing
their<00:02:35.350> teeth<00:02:35.760> they<00:02:36.760> stop<00:02:37.030> eating<00:02:37.450> regularly

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
their teeth they stop eating regularly

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.350 
their teeth they stop eating regularly
they<00:02:38.320> stop<00:02:38.650> exercising<00:02:39.070> they<00:02:39.670> stop<00:02:39.970> seeing

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
they stop exercising they stop seeing

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.280 
they stop exercising they stop seeing
friends<00:02:40.840> they<00:02:40.990> start<00:02:41.880> stop<00:02:42.990> doing<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.140> normal

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
friends they start stop doing the normal

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.500 
friends they start stop doing the normal
kinds<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:44.920> recreation<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.730> they<00:02:45.880> used<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.300> do

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
kinds of recreation that they used to do

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.300 
kinds of recreation that they used to do
so<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.170> think<00:02:47.380> anytime<00:02:47.890> someone<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:50.070> what<00:02:51.070> I'd

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
so I think anytime someone is what I'd

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.430 
so I think anytime someone is what I'd
say<00:02:51.520> as<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.640> therapist<00:02:52.230> starting<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.320> have

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
say as a therapist starting to have

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.080 
say as a therapist starting to have
functional<00:02:53.740> impairment<00:02:54.730> or<00:02:54.880> their

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
functional impairment or their

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.950 
functional impairment or their
functioning<00:02:55.750> isn't<00:02:57.090> normal<00:02:58.090> it's<00:02:58.240> different

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
functioning isn't normal it's different

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.630 
functioning isn't normal it's different
than<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.200> way<00:02:59.320> they<00:02:59.530> used<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.920> be<00:03:00.010> before<00:03:00.490> they

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
than the way they used to be before they

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.700 
than the way they used to be before they
started<00:03:01.030> gaming<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.630> think<00:03:02.200> that's<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.500> sign

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
started gaming I think that's a sign

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.060 
started gaming I think that's a sign
there's<00:03:02.980> something<00:03:03.400> wrong<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.860> know<00:03:05.980> you

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
there's something wrong you know you

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.860 
there's something wrong you know you
could<00:03:06.430> talk<00:03:06.670> forever<00:03:06.940> about<00:03:07.240> how<00:03:07.810> to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
could talk forever about how to

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.660 
could talk forever about how to
determine<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.920> that's<00:03:09.130> one<00:03:09.400> thing<00:03:09.610> that

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
determine that and that's one thing that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.090 
determine that and that's one thing that
I<00:03:09.820> think<00:03:09.940> therapists<00:03:10.750> are<00:03:11.080> looking<00:03:11.709> at<00:03:11.860> and

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
I think therapists are looking at and

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.250 
I think therapists are looking at and
trying<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.489> determine<00:03:12.850> when<00:03:13.209> does<00:03:13.420> normal

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
trying to determine when does normal

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.960 
trying to determine when does normal
play<00:03:14.560> which<00:03:15.010> when<00:03:15.190> we<00:03:15.250> talk<00:03:15.430> about<00:03:15.700> game<00:03:15.940> play

play which when we talk about game play

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.840 
play which when we talk about game play
it's<00:03:16.390> supposed<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.840> be<00:03:17.020> something<00:03:17.290> that's

the<00:03:44.000> thing<00:03:44.180> we're<00:03:44.329> really<00:03:44.510> looking<00:03:44.720> at<00:03:45.049> here

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
the thing we're really looking at here

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.110 
the thing we're really looking at here
is<00:03:45.500> what<00:03:45.980> kind<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.400> treatment<00:03:46.849> is<00:03:46.970> effective

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
what will really help and that's the

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.630 
what will really help and that's the
thing<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:51.319> think<00:03:51.440> at<00:03:51.920> this<00:03:52.129> point<00:03:52.430> we

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
thing that I think at this point we

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.039 
thing that I think at this point we
don't<00:03:52.760> have<00:03:52.909> nearly<00:03:53.239> enough<00:03:53.690> information

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
don't have nearly enough information

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.550 
don't have nearly enough information
about<00:03:54.560> one<00:03:55.459> of<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.819> concerns<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:57.019> have<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.319> that

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
about one of the concerns I have is that

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.530 
about one of the concerns I have is that
there<00:03:57.890> are<00:03:57.980> so<00:03:58.159> many<00:03:58.280> different<00:03:58.879> reasons

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
there are so many different reasons

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.860 
there are so many different reasons
people<00:04:00.019> play<00:04:00.790> player<00:04:01.790> motivations<00:04:02.540> and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
because maybe real life doesn't give

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.540 
because maybe real life doesn't give
them<00:04:26.240> that<00:04:26.449> many<00:04:26.630> opportunities<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:28.400> think

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
them that many opportunities so I think

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.760 
them that many opportunities so I think
we<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.120> understand<00:04:29.630> player<00:04:29.930> motivation

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
we have to understand player motivation

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.570 
we have to understand player motivation
and<00:04:31.039> then<00:04:31.789> we<00:04:32.000> can<00:04:32.210> understand<00:04:33.190> what<00:04:34.190> needs

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
and then we can understand what needs

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.129 
and then we can understand what needs
are<00:04:34.910> being<00:04:35.630> met<00:04:35.750> by<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.710> game<00:04:37.250> play<00:04:37.639> and<00:04:38.139> are

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
are being met by the game play and are

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.650 
are being met by the game play and are
those<00:04:39.650> needs<00:04:40.039> that<00:04:40.550> perhaps<00:04:41.030> are<00:04:41.240> not<00:04:41.270> being

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
those needs that perhaps are not being

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.360 
those needs that perhaps are not being
met<00:04:41.870> in<00:04:41.900> real<00:04:42.289> life<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.949> if<00:04:43.070> they're<00:04:43.220> not

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
met in real life and if they're not

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.700 
met in real life and if they're not
being<00:04:43.639> met<00:04:43.820> in<00:04:43.940> real<00:04:44.120> life<00:04:44.360> people<00:04:44.750> will<00:04:45.380> tend

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
being met in real life people will tend

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.650 
being met in real life people will tend
to<00:04:45.800> turn<00:04:46.039> more<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.580> more<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.120> game<00:04:47.330> play

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
to turn more and more to the game play

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.110 
to turn more and more to the game play
to<00:04:47.720> get<00:04:48.110> those<00:04:48.349> needs<00:04:48.590> met<00:04:48.770> so<00:04:49.220> when<00:04:49.820> we<00:04:49.940> talk

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
to get those needs met so when we talk

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.200 
to get those needs met so when we talk
about<00:04:50.150> treatment<00:04:51.099> we<00:04:52.099> have<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.520> understand

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
about treatment we have to understand

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.170 
about treatment we have to understand
what<00:04:54.050> are<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.320> deficits<00:04:54.919> in<00:04:55.099> real<00:04:55.370> life<00:04:55.639> if

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
what are the deficits in real life if

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.930 
what are the deficits in real life if
that's<00:04:56.599> what's<00:04:56.930> happening<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.650> try<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.699> find

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
that's what's happening and try and find

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.390 
that's what's happening and try and find
a<00:04:59.090> way<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.780> help<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.199> person<00:05:00.440> work<00:05:00.860> that<00:05:01.190> out

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
a way to help the person work that out

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.490 
a way to help the person work that out
in<00:05:01.789> other<00:05:02.270> words<00:05:02.539> if<00:05:02.750> they're<00:05:02.930> failing<00:05:03.380> in

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
in other words if they're failing in

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.250 
in other words if they're failing in
school<00:05:04.270> because<00:05:05.270> perhaps<00:05:05.960> they<00:05:06.110> have<00:05:06.229> a

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
school because perhaps they have a

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
school because perhaps they have a
learning<00:05:06.440> disability

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
learning disability

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.640 
learning disability
is<00:05:08.210> that<00:05:08.570> something<00:05:09.050> that<00:05:09.080> needs<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.620> be

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
is that something that needs to be

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.620 
is that something that needs to be
addressed<00:05:10.039> and<00:05:10.630> therefore<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:12.409> need<00:05:12.620> to

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
addressed and therefore the need to

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.450 
addressed and therefore the need to
spend<00:05:14.630> so<00:05:14.810> many<00:05:14.930> hours<00:05:15.169> in<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.590> game<00:05:15.860> then

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
spend so many hours in the game then

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.279 
spend so many hours in the game then
that<00:05:16.760> need<00:05:17.030> would<00:05:17.240> go<00:05:17.419> down<00:05:17.659> if<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.110> other

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
that need would go down if the other

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.370 
that need would go down if the other
problems<00:05:18.740> were<00:05:18.919> addressed
