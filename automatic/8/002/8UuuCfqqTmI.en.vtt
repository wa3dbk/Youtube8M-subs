need to do and hopefully we're not going
to<00:02:29.730> make<00:02:29.850> too<00:02:29.880> much<00:02:30.180> miss<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:31.370> turn<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.550> steam

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
to make too much miss is turn the steam

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.090 
to make too much miss is turn the steam
knob

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.020 

the<00:02:38.670> machine<00:02:39.000> produces<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.540> lot<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:40.050> steam<00:02:41.030> what

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
the machine produces a lot of steam what

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.400 
the machine produces a lot of steam what
we're<00:02:42.240> required<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.720> do<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:43.050> these<00:02:43.230> little

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
we're required to do with these little

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.070 
we're required to do with these little
machines<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:45.120> they<00:02:45.330> only<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.900> a

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
machines is because they only have a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.280 
machines is because they only have a
single<00:02:46.200> boiler<00:02:47.040> inside<00:02:47.490> as<00:02:47.810> after<00:02:48.810> we've<00:02:48.930> made

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
single boiler inside as after we've made

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.580 
single boiler inside as after we've made
our<00:02:49.740> cup<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.460> genome<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.030> cool<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.200> boiler

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
our cup of genome is cool the boiler

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.370 
our cup of genome is cool the boiler
down<00:02:52.800> now<00:02:53.760> we<00:02:53.820> do<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.360> by<00:02:54.690> drawing<00:02:55.200> water

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
down now we do that by drawing water

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.800 
down now we do that by drawing water
through<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.490> pannarello<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.510> premium

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
through the pannarello on the premium

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.160 
through the pannarello on the premium
and<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.920> little<00:02:59.160> steam<00:02:59.460> arm<00:02:59.700> on<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.150> extra<00:03:00.600> so

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
and the little steam arm on the extra so

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.460 
and the little steam arm on the extra so
we<00:03:01.320> start<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.770> pump

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
we start the pump

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.450 
we start the pump
we<00:03:03.920> open<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.340> steamer<00:03:04.960> and<00:03:06.010> as<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.250> can<00:03:07.400> see

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
we open the steamer and as you can see

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:16.010 
we open the steamer and as you can see
any<00:03:08.360> existing<00:03:09.290> as

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.790 

so<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:17.130> can<00:03:17.430> take<00:03:17.930> anywhere<00:03:18.930> up<00:03:18.990> to<00:03:19.200> 20<00:03:19.560> seasons

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
so it can take anywhere up to 20 seasons

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.160 
so it can take anywhere up to 20 seasons
so<00:03:20.280> we<00:03:20.460> are<00:03:20.580> avoiding<00:03:21.240> motion<00:03:23.810> fantastic<00:03:24.810> and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
so we are avoiding motion fantastic and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.610 
so we are avoiding motion fantastic and
now<00:03:25.860> we're<00:03:26.070> ready<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.430> brew<00:03:26.610> another<00:03:26.850> coffee

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
now we're ready to brew another coffee

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.750 
now we're ready to brew another coffee
so<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.770> fundamental<00:03:29.370> difference<00:03:29.670> between

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
so the fundamental difference between

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.450 
so the fundamental difference between
the<00:03:30.030> two<00:03:30.150> machines<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.960> the<00:03:31.260> premium<00:03:31.890> has<00:03:32.160> that

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
the two machines is the premium has that

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.990 
the two machines is the premium has that
OneTouch<00:03:33.120> facility<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:34.230> touch<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.650> once<00:03:35.000> it's

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
OneTouch facility you touch it once it's

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.780 
OneTouch facility you touch it once it's
ready<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.360> mix<00:03:36.660> them<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:41.040> cool<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.430> model

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
ready to mix them and to cool this model

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.610 
ready to mix them and to cool this model
down<00:03:42.170> we<00:03:43.170> just<00:03:43.280> touch<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.490> front<00:03:45.410> touch<00:03:46.410> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
down we just touch the front touch the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.610 
down we just touch the front touch the
center<00:03:46.920> button<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:48.750> automatically<00:03:49.380> does

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
center button and it automatically does

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.070 
center button and it automatically does
the<00:03:49.890> same<00:03:50.130> for<00:03:51.030> more<00:03:51.240> information<00:03:51.840> on<00:03:51.930> these
