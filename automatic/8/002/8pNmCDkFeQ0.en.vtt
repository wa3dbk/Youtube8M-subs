Hagel's<00:04:28.400> embryos<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.750> think<00:04:29.990> there's

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
Hagel's embryos and I think there's

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.080 
Hagel's embryos and I think there's
consensus<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.100> community<00:04:31.610> that<00:04:31.850> that's

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
consensus in the community that that's

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.350

either<00:04:32.900> air<00:04:33.350> or<00:04:33.970> project<00:04:34.970> you'll<00:04:35.120> make<00:04:35.270> your

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
either air or project you'll make your

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.450 
either air or project you'll make your
question<00:04:35.780> sure<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.680> there<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:37.040> think<00:04:37.370> what

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460
