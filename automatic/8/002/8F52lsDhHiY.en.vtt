00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hi, people are going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.310
 hidden but not any 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.810
 Shepherd's pie 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.500
 I'm thinking that Mother's Day is 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.250
 arriving and this is the hiding place that has 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.470
 creamy catupiry and covered with mashed potatoes 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.570
 from baroa to what you have to people calls 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.369
 the yellow lord bill 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.869
 There we are, but the coolest is that 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.699
 dish is against us here below 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.380
 when you call yellow sweet potato but the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.150
 The coolest thing about this dish is, I guess. 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.830
 to do in advance you make a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.990
 through the serum that can be seen 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.610
 The way you can do with 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.920
 advance for until he lunches 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.680
 liked the suggestion before this equality 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.550
 and then it is only with the oven in time 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.170
 conclude 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.170
 Let's do it, let's go 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.679
 the first part of our hiding place is 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.539
 very easy right 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.000
 yes we have to see what 's in 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.939
 line with the method kingdom luck but me 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.009
 she made whole because they do not need 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.479
 capital or anything will lead to 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.450
 My hunger, we'll get her out later. 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.880
 bone and gives a peek should contain 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.580
 of the kingdom's menu and we'll put a 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.229
 cup of white wine is efficient in 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 really do not need much time to 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.009
 People are still going to do a little sticking 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.380
 of her before setting up the hiding place 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.920
 then I found white wine and 4 tablespoons 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.630
 shoyu soup and I will do so because 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.700
 I have a great script for this 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.399
 waterfall clothes liked the show them 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.080
 always give taste pretty cool huh 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.209
 there is no other like that we did 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.190
 You put it on too. 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.319
 thing more that these people will cover that 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.610
 it must be anchored we will 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.470
 to use but when suddenly that 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.470
 cook in just that 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.130
 going there were in the 240 degree high liner 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.180
 with about 40 minutes there 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.780
 That thing is a joke with a 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.270
 bottle with a bar with this new phase 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.970
 To see if it's cooked, do not let her 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.620
 but it does not have reform while 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.260
 little cookie is in the oven casting the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.240
 People only get baroa for those who do not 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.900
 Do you know how to potato baroa this here? 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.040
 also 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.960
 I think SÃ£o Paulo was in 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.300
 I do not know, man . 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.180
 tell us we have the chance to 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.440
 To note is that my father calls it the week when 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.160
 buy at the supermarket was in 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:42.920
 label lady like potato baroa eu 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:46.770
 I think that barone burns target being so 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.350
 escondidinho costs there she's got 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:55.350
 mashed potatoes so it's very chic 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:57.240
 Mashed potato talking I love this 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.030
 combination but if you also want to 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.700
 can substitute for normal potatoes 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.320
 cassava is good too but I think 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.739
 that these classes here are a 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.739
 a little different 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.400
 this word is very funny is that the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.100
 people are doing here is Tuscan to 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.800
 The potato guide is leaving in 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.800
 small pieces less exposure is only you 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.510
 needs to be modified and not done 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.140
 cute because it's not just that anymore 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.140
 they had 6 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.819
 here was cooking more or less one 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.910
 half an hour 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.920
 is the point is also get a knife to thread 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.800
 and she listens cooked 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.300
 so it is but to settle too much that is 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.099
 Too much cooking, she's going to turn 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.840
 take off in the water but we are 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.840
 recovering one meter and coffee 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:35.139
 many people the person that the elderly 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:38.050
 It was like this, it's a beautiful opel. 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.520

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.289

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.669
 Black pepper 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.910

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.330
