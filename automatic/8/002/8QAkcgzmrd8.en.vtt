 our guest tonight of passage in paris 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.290
 while school holidays began 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.460
 of the Toussaint it is abderrafie zouiten 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.829
 Director General of the National Office 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.050
 Moroccan Tourism Mr. Zouiten 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.669
 good evening good evening thank you for being with us 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.199
 we will talk about the destination morocco 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.150
 of course first of all a word 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.560
 since to all this anxiety around 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.110
 mullahs is what Morocco goes or 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.969
 not give up the organization of the 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.699
 africa cup of nations which is a 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.050
 major football event that 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.600
 must take place at the beginning of the year 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.579
 next horse on january february 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.190
 no morocco does not give up you know 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.920
 bola and pandemic to take very much 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.140
 seriously and Morocco from the start was 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.079
 in peak 1 compared to all the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.219
 prevention to avoid any risk to the 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.739
 Moroccan population 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.390
 in that there had been heard checks 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.969
 which are made from countries that 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.579
 are affected but also on arrival 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.530
 and Morocco follows the recommendations of 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.120
 the world health organization that 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.850
 recommended to avoid and 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.830
 much bigger gatherings and 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.170
 the can you know it's thousands 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.210
 of supporters who arrives one on a country 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.370
 or in any case the organizing country and 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.250
 this is a major risk to you 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.150
 imagine a single case during can this 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.940
 that it can generate 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.070
 same worry season as in january and 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.290
 next February the outbreak may still 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.970
 to have progressed we do not know 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.770
 why Morocco wanted a postponement 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.200
 for precisely that's what you 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.050
 ask the postponement of the peta did 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.180
 any effect this I often repeat this 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.280
 precisely the recommendations of the om 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.260
 is the World Health Organization 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.300
 but he does not say we stop 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.300
 no longer organizing is not present at all 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.220
 managed that this carry forward to justly allow 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.590
 to better appreciate the evolution of the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.840
 situation and I believe that the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.940
 responsible for the caf are absolutely 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.830
 aware of the issue and confederation 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.870
 crazy African altogether so a 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.490
 real party is that the cut 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.380
 of Africa nations ah this is the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.120
 fourth media event on the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.710
 global plan 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.210
 so it is important to avoid 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.370
 transform what was going to be a party 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.650
 in disaster or a nightmare 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.870
 so ask you for postponement when 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.220
 will we know if you get it or not 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.650
 because they said that also others 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.060
 country if not to organize the cut no 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.180
 you are not in the scenario there I 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.220
 believe that the Moroccan has done very well 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.530
 prepared for this the organization of 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.000
 this January 2015 edition of big 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.160
 means have been deployed 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.200
 it is quite normal that a principle 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.210
 of precaution which is extremely 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.590
 important for the health of our 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.380
 compatriots and in a general way 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.310
 of everything that would come to attend 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.200
 this holiday and there is in principle I believe 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.180
 in the decision had to be taken early 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.980
 November I believe November 2nd and you 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.870
 think so it will be a decision of 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.490
 report I think so and we wish it 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.560
 now I think it's a 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.460
 decision that will be discussed with our friends 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.410
 from the caf 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.030
 they are quite aware and in 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.070
 fully understand the position of the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.410
 Morocco in this sense I come now to 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.450
 the destination Morocco precisely counts 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.010
 given this context he already had a 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.750
 geopolitical context that does not touch 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.900
 Morocco but which affects the Middle East 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.780
 who could weigh 1.1 kilograms and forgive them 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.190
 French and then now there is this 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.989
 epidemic that does not affect Morocco but 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.220
 you say there are trips one is 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.780
 obliged to monitor and that's it can 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.489
 also worried is the destination 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.110
 Morocco is not in decline while 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.290
 precisely French tourists 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.480
 constitute the main sources of 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.820
 Morocco tourism and destination 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.560
 Morocco is doing well when we look at 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.910
 figures since the beginning of this year 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.040
 compared to the same time of the year 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.489
 last we are changing + 5 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.110
 % and the case of the French market is 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.600
 also present well we have a 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.940
 growth of + 5% I recall that the 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.489
 Morocco is the first destination 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.500
 from France 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.090
 so Morocco has fundamentals and 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.440
 that they are and it's true here also those 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.489
 Moroccans living in France who go 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.650
 visit their family 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.120
 not quite and so but the figure 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.769
 of two million tourists cg 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.630
 essentially French so that's 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.920
 in Morocco is positioned as I 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.300
 do it because our self I have seen 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.040
 states people of the trip who says balla in this 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.690
 moment we still have a lot less 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.590
 reservations to Morocco because it 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.110
 is this climate of worry 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.640
 I think you have to look at what I have 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.030
 explained just now of evolution on 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.410
 is we 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.239
 evolution of positive despite a 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.889
 extreme embarrassment at the start of the 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.520
 france both for a context 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.040
 economic a political context is the 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.740
 Morocco destination to fundamentals of 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.930
 fundamental quality the quality of 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.020
 tourist infrastructure assets 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.580
 of these different regions the quality of 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.560
 its welcome the world economic forum 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.240
 just sorted quite recently 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.130
 Morocco as the third 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.350
 most welcoming destination at 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.700
 world and you know Morocco to lead 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.070
 very important reforms 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.950
 initiated by his majesty the king since 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.919
 fifteen years of political reforms that 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.900
 have allowed it to stabilize 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.910
 change the country so a 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.010
 awareness in terms of maturity 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.320
 policy also on the part of 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.000
 different actors and I believe when we 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.650
 that no amalgam can be done 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.030
 between Morocco and what can happen 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.590
 in other parts of the world 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.870
 so there is no after you from 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.490
 French frilosity despite what we 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.440
 hear from travel agents 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.370
 he looks because for example we know 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.229
 who is also by a French tourist 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.520
 who instead but it does not concern that the 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.750
 Morocco to go to the Maghreb say to themselves 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.669
 today i'm going to greece because 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.530
 prices have dropped 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.870
 absolutely not i come back from marrakech 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.430
 yesterday where there is the country group held its 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.680
 convention you know that the group has 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.990
 took the lead globally 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.340
 there were 200 travel agencies he 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.530
 are big events going on 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.210
 to hold in Morocco soon as the 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.710
 entrepreneurial global this myth 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.900
 you have big productions 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.039
 cinematographic who come or who 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.140
 are underway in Morocco 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.700
 this is the case of james bond new james 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.810
 bond is also mission 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.570
 impossible 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.979
 we saw a version 5 with tom cruise 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.330
 we have the film festival 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.820
 marrakech international 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.620
 so you see all these events are 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.419
 locomotives for the future is done 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.950
 and the French know them well 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.270
 are close to Morocco who know 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.729
 very well this destination 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.860
 so we can continue to shape them 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.020
 my dog ​​no problem then 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.180
 abderrafie zouiten are currently two 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.990
 exhibitions in paris one was 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.010

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.060
 contemporary Morocco at the institute of 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.010
 Arab world there too the exhibition on the 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.650
 Morocco medieval look to it are two 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.990
 highlights for the relationship 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.160
 franco moroccan soulim years but i 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.949
 believe that we must put into perspective 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.720
 these two exposures she is in 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.180
 right line of the strategy and 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.699
 the impulse given by His Majesty the King 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.560
 mohamed 6 stops cultural dimension and 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.410
 the organization of these two exhibitions 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.259
 the louvre with medieval Morocco 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.120
 the one also from lima that's the art 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.669
 absolutely contemporary at the institute of 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.550
 Arab world will enter one of the facets 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.620
 of this wealth of heritage

 intangible of Morocco both on the 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.050
 cultural plan with magnificent the 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.789

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:04.470
 Arabic but also medieval Morocco 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:07.380
 which also shows the evolution of 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.060
 the history of Morocco and its relationship to 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.860
 times with europe and africa

 the africanity of morocco and something 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.580
 also extremely important in 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.729
