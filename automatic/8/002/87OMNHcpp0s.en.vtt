about this one is it's a snap back you
don't<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.079> push

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
don't like for this one you just push

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.600 
don't like for this one you just push
down<00:01:59.180> and<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.540> comes<00:02:00.750> off<00:02:01.280> but<00:02:02.280> for<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
down and then it comes off but for this

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.569 
down and then it comes off but for this
one<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.390> gotta<00:02:03.890> pull<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.009> off<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.460> I

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
one you actually gotta pull it off and I

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.710 
one you actually gotta pull it off and I
think<00:02:05.640> that's<00:02:05.969> more<00:02:06.840> safe<00:02:07.280> safer<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:09.479> we're

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
think that's more safe safer so we're

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.729 
think that's more safe safer so we're
going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.110> put<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.590> battery

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.910

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.259 

they<00:02:27.680> should<00:02:27.920> do<00:02:28.069> turn<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.489> very<00:02:28.819> differently

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
they should do turn on very differently

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.369 
they should do turn on very differently
about<00:02:29.739> one<00:02:30.739> way<00:02:31.550> darker<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.720> it's

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
about one way darker this one it's

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:47.910 
about one way darker this one it's
pretty<00:02:33.620> light<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:46.000> when<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.120> go<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.330> your<00:02:47.480> menu

you'll know this that's like the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.140 
you'll know this that's like the
intensity<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:54.709> get<00:02:54.980> your<00:02:55.010> six<00:02:55.670> main

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150
