00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello everyone and welcome to yes and 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.269
 gamma on recently held e3 2014 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.050
 electronics art has announced battlefield 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.690
 hardline 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.420
 but they not only showed the game but also 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.090
 right there launched the beta version of the project 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.060
 we play it and hurry you 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.060
 tell what is good new battles 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.830
 well or bad battlefield hardline it 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.810
 new part of the famous series 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.910
 multiplayer shooters only if 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.520
 battlefield previously was dedicated to war 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.370
 whether it be world war two or 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.350
 vietnam whether war is in the future now 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 the series turned into such 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.660
 Cossack-robbers we have cops and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.420
 we have criminals and all tasks 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.969
 associated with the theft of money and other 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.820
 criminal cases and this is actually 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.550
 the most important problem is hardline but about 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.160
 this later most people were afraid that 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.800
 the new battlefield will be like a series 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.469
 Payday which is widely known today 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.359
 among amateurs and multiplayer shooters 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.760
 mostly cooperative but it 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.090
 absolutely unfounded fears because 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.549
 that the battlefield in fact has not changed 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.030
 all repay day we and groups of four 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.590
 man shoot computer npc 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.740
 the battlefield is still two teams 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.350
 just now instead of 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.630
 capture points on the map they perform 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.330
 certain tasks in beta 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.970
 There are two modes of latma not or 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.130
 blood money and for hiace i mean 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.040
 robbery in mode was a hoax 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.520
 there is a lot of money in the middle of the card 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.560
 and respectively both teams and cops and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.350
 Pristupniki should lomanut to this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.840
 heap grab as much cash as possible 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.170
 and drag your vault 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.030
 but the situation is complicated by the fact that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.950
 first you can shoot a man 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.009
 who transfers money pick money 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.590
 he and drag yourself storage or 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.770
 you can brazenly steal money from 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.810
 The repositories of the enemy are the team that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.909
 will collect 5 million faster 2 won 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.220
 it begets a lot 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.100
 opportunities and tactics because 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.710
 you can win now in several ways 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.970
 you don't have to break a lot of money 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.670
 catch 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.240
 enemies who drag their money on their 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.160
 the base 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.950
 it adds variety to the game 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.500
 really second mode of robbery 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.510
 much more interesting though as if not the first 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.280
 already look like a normal game in it 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.320
 the city is going armored convoy 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.980
 criminals stop him blowing 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.520
 everything 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.720
 and then they have to perform in stages 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.090
 certain actions 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 first they have to open the trucks they 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.830
 put bombs on them and protect 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.080
 respectively, until the bombs exploded 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.520
 police can neutralize them if 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.190
 all the same bombs exploded 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.110
 then the criminals grab the loot and 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.510
 try to escape shoot 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.150
 Naturally from the cops if they succeed they 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.180
 won if all the time the cops 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.760
 prevented them from either leaving or blowing up the van 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.130
 and defeated the jacket of such regimes even 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.770
 never had a battlefield and this 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.290
 really highlights the game but 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.320
 even battlefield 4 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.459
 was already more team oriented 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.040
 play and honestly play alone in 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.440
 it was almost meaningless if 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.430
 new project goes even further on the same 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.750
 the road itself 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.489
 if you start playing it 1 then 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.530
 most likely you will just shoot 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.739
 and you will not understand what you need 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.170
 do however if you play a team 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.760
 you will act together someone 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.980
 will be the driver someone will 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.040
 shoot someone will cover 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.170
 human then vat bag with money and 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.660
 it will generate a huge amount 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.540
 interesting situations that could not 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.459
 happen in the battlefield earlier plus so 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.070
 how has changed with this who changed and 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.680
 gameplay it has become much faster since 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.860
 cards are now smaller and you do not need to 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.350
 long run to the places where everything happens 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.739
 the most interesting thing more on the base 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.290
 each team is transport and yet 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.900
 one player rides this transport in to 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.150
 the most interesting point you can like 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.190
 would sleep in his car or in 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.739
 helicopter plus each team has 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.930
 specially fortified game 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.630
 hvik in which you can also always 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.030
 revive but unfortunately a little 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.970
 brings transport physics because 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.550
 she was some kind of a tank 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.930
 galleries although there is no heavy equipment 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.360
 the hardest is really here 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.789
 armored car you basically will drive on 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.800
 motorcycles and cars 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:42.349
 but unfortunately they are also managed 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.780
 hard as some armored cars 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.789
 well at least they are now very easy 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.069
 versed with automata and 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.919
 machine guns for Vanyushin on maps all so 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:54.590
 same present and it is still strong 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.080
 changes the battlefield if you use that 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.130
 or another trigger for example on the card in 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.400
 beta versions 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.949
 you can bring down the crane and if it falls 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.069
 then he would like to build an extra 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.389
 frankly speaking the bridge 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:11.150
 hardline battlefield is played in 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.210
 great the game has become much faster and 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.370
 more dynamic and more fun especially if you 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.949
 naturally there are also very friends 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.750
 happy and the performance of the game which 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.930
 even in beta version 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.659
 produces solid fps and on weak machines 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.270
 it's very funny because the battlefield 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.729
 4 is still working through the stump-deck 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.750
 judging by the beta of the battlefield hardline 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:37.250
 only two problems first all 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:41.060
 what's happening in this game doesn't have at all 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:44.360
 no point it's a battlefield he's about 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.199
 war and what we are now running for 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.440
 in money 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:51.860
 somehow not very like reality then 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.960
 there are cities empty there are no people but for 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.900
 several hundred thousand dollars 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.060
 there is literally a war on the streets 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.520
 cities and only lazy did not have time 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.310
 joke on this topic but this is a niggle from 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.080
 purely from the semantic point of view of gameplay 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.630
 it does not interfere 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.210
 the second problem is that to 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.009
 Unfortunately, the hardline is somehow not very pulling 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.520
 for a full game 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:19.250
 rather on such a big dlc because 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.919
 as you remember in battlefield 2 was 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.319
 addition hurry odds for sosa in battlefield3 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.139
 addition of claus apartments which is just 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:28.820
 were about these shootings in close 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:32.000
 rooms and 1 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.820
 personal action with various gadgets Tom 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.820
 same klups of apartments with were these hooks and 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.950
 cats but hardline somehow sell like 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.320
 full game even in spite of everything 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.110
 applications of electronics art representatives 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.810
 about the fact that they do not want to turn the series 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:51.020
 in the pipeline but we are in this situation nothing 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:53.900
 we can not do a conclusion on hardline 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.480
 such as if you were a fan of the series and you 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.300
 do not mind the money you can safely order 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.540
 this is a good old battle only now 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.220
 she became even faster and more fun 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.470
 I advise others to pass by and not 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.440
 try to find in the new battlefield 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.540
 what attracts hundreds of thousands of players 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.300
 around the world or you battlefield 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.540
 like it or not just like a penny 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:20.180
 but with you was a commander necessary and gamma 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.640
 by the way battlefield hardline you can 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:26.060
 preorder in our online store 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.950
 the game comes out on October 21st but i'm still 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.580
 I ask you to like and write 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.780
 comments and repost our videos to everyone 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.170
 thank you for your attention 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.960
 there are commanders of detachments before communication 

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:41.330
 about which you can revive big 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.490
 some of the equipment works in many modes 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.650
 like spawn points also tune 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.780
 secondary and anti-tank weapons 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.340
 among which again there are platitudes 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.000
 like rocket launchers and a lot of charger 

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.000
 grenade launcher
