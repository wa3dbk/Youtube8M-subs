kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.090> pricey<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:46.050> found<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.829> drugstore

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
kind of pricey I have found a drugstore

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.139 
kind of pricey I have found a drugstore
priced<00:00:48.300> alternative<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.399> NYC

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
priced alternative and it's the NYC

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.689 
priced alternative and it's the NYC
sunny<00:00:51.539> bronzer<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.890> I've<00:00:53.039> been<00:00:53.219> using<00:00:53.399> that

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
sunny bronzer so I've been using that

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.270 
sunny bronzer so I've been using that
and<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.059> think<00:00:54.090> that's<00:00:54.449> under<00:00:54.750> five<00:00:54.960> dollars<00:00:55.500> so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and I think that's under five dollars so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
and I think that's under five dollars so
currently<00:00:57.059> I'm<00:00:57.360> using<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.780> instead<00:00:58.140> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
currently I'm using that instead of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.130 
currently I'm using that instead of
buying<00:00:58.590> another<00:00:58.949> NARS<00:00:59.699> one<00:01:00.059> even<00:01:00.870> though<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> do

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
buying another NARS one even though I do

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
buying another NARS one even though I do
really<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.160> pricey<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.699> think

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
really like it it's so pricey I think

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.429 
really like it it's so pricey I think
it's<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:04.280> between<00:01:05.280> 35<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.030> 45<00:01:06.630> dollars<00:01:07.229> so

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
it's like between 35 and 45 dollars so

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.910 
it's like between 35 and 45 dollars so
that<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.710> pretty<00:01:07.950> pricey<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.920> bronzer

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that it's pretty pricey for and bronzer

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.300 
that it's pretty pricey for and bronzer

of course it was a fraction of the price
it<00:03:02.430> was<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:03.000> think<00:03:03.209> L'Oreal's<00:03:03.690> new<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.470> like

it was I think L'Oreal's new one I like
the<00:03:05.340> Garnier<00:03:05.760> but<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.540> tends<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.410> like<00:03:07.620> have

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
the Garnier but it tends to like have

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.309 
the Garnier but it tends to like have
some<00:03:08.190> kind<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.400> reaction<00:03:08.549> with<00:03:09.030> my<00:03:09.180> skin<00:03:09.569> so

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.250 
some kind of reaction with my skin so
I'm<00:03:10.440> hoping<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.950> l'oreal<00:03:11.370> one<00:03:12.180> does<00:03:13.019> better

right<00:05:37.580> now<00:05:37.760> I<00:05:37.790> think<00:05:37.940> we're<00:05:38.210> using<00:05:38.860> like<00:05:39.860> the

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
right now I think we're using like the

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.620 
right now I think we're using like the
sugarplum<00:05:41.030> one<00:05:41.480> from<00:05:41.900> last<00:05:42.230> Christmas<00:05:42.500> and

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
sugarplum one from last Christmas and

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.890 
sugarplum one from last Christmas and
then<00:05:44.630> in<00:05:45.020> November<00:05:45.310> we<00:05:46.310> had<00:05:46.700> creamy<00:05:47.060> pumpkin<00:05:47.360> I

think this actually lasted a little bit

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.470 
think this actually lasted a little bit
longer<00:05:50.030> maybe<00:05:50.960> it<00:05:51.110> was<00:05:51.140> like<00:05:52.330> middle<00:05:53.330> of
