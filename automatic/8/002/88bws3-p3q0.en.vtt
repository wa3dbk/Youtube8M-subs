00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:47.569 
when you're here try to avoid making it
a<00:01:45.840> triangle<00:01:46.139> right<00:01:46.380> squeeze<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> tight<00:01:47.429> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
a triangle right squeeze it tight and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.980 
a triangle right squeeze it tight and
try<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.819> keep<00:01:47.999> it<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.479> narrow<00:01:48.840> as

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
try to keep it as like narrow as

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.440 
try to keep it as like narrow as
possible<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> tube<00:01:49.979> type<00:01:50.459> of<00:01:50.609> shape<00:01:50.789> so<00:01:51.359> it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
possible like a tube type of shape so it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.039 
possible like a tube type of shape so it
really<00:01:51.659> comes<00:01:51.929> out<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:53.459> nice<00:01:53.929> all<00:01:54.929> right

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
really comes out you know nice all right

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.129 
really comes out you know nice all right
so<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.319> got<00:01:55.439> that's<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:56.069> time<00:01:56.780> go<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.929> over

00:01:58.129 --> 00:01:58.139 
so you got that's one time go it over

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.690 
so you got that's one time go it over
again

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
again

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.859 
again
always<00:01:59.700> keeping<00:02:00.029> your<00:02:00.149> pointer<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.689> you

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
always keeping your pointer here you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.719 
always keeping your pointer here you
throw<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.170> over<00:02:01.499> because<00:02:01.679> you<00:02:01.799> need<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.520> like

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
throw it over because you need to like

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.269 
throw it over because you need to like

in<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:19.940> another<00:02:20.940> thing<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.480> always<00:02:21.810> almost

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
in and another thing it always almost

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.020 
in and another thing it always almost
always<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.950> get<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.220> right<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.580> comes<00:02:23.790> out

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030

always if you get it right it comes out
with<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> dimple<00:02:24.630> which<00:02:24.990> also<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> nice<00:02:26.130> feature

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
with a dimple which also a nice feature

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.850 
with a dimple which also a nice feature
to<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.120> that's<00:02:27.780> basically<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.500> double

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
to it and that's basically the double

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.160 
to it and that's basically the double
foreign<00:02:29.160> hand<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.510> see<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:30.780> not<00:02:30.900> that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
foreign hand you can see it's not that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.960 
foreign hand you can see it's not that
perfect<00:02:31.440> triangle<00:02:32.100> sometimes<00:02:32.610> actually

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
perfect triangle sometimes actually

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.340 
perfect triangle sometimes actually
comes<00:02:33.150> out<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.330> little<00:02:33.450> better<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.080> more
