challenging<00:00:19.920> parts<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> game<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:22.140> I

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
challenging parts of the game so I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.870 
challenging parts of the game so I
wasn't<00:00:22.500> expecting<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.279> be<00:00:23.400> tough<00:00:23.609> at<00:00:23.760> all

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
wasn't expecting this to be tough at all

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.450 
wasn't expecting this to be tough at all
and<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> died<00:00:24.390> maybe<00:00:25.289> five<00:00:25.920> or<00:00:25.949> six<00:00:26.070> times

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and I died maybe five or six times

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.460 
and I died maybe five or six times
because<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.480> rocket<00:00:27.720> launcher<00:00:27.990> people<00:00:28.289> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
because shooting while moving is tricky

finicky on this this controller and I

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.359 
finicky on this this controller and I
know<00:01:52.780> it's<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.049> weak<00:01:53.229> excuse<00:01:53.710> folks<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:54.280> it's

know it's a weak excuse folks and it's

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.889 
know it's a weak excuse folks and it's
something<00:01:54.549> that<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.820> can<00:01:55.000> definitely<00:01:55.479> work<00:01:55.659> on

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
something that I can definitely work on

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.870 
something that I can definitely work on
after<00:01:56.680> time<00:01:57.130> I'd<00:01:57.340> probably<00:01:57.520> get<00:01:57.759> really

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
after time I'd probably get really

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.480 
after time I'd probably get really
comfortable<00:01:58.210> with<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:58.600> but<00:01:58.869> I<00:01:59.369> recorded<00:02:00.369> this

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
comfortable with it but I recorded this

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.730 
comfortable with it but I recorded this
guide<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:00.970> space<00:02:01.179> of<00:02:01.330> two<00:02:01.479> days<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:02.200> you

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
guide in the space of two days so you

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.289 
guide in the space of two days so you
know<00:02:02.860> it<00:02:03.130> was<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.250> quick<00:02:03.490> it's<00:02:03.789> a<00:02:03.850> nice<00:02:04.030> quick

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
know it was a quick it's a nice quick

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.350 
know it was a quick it's a nice quick
one<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:04.780> can't<00:02:05.079> exactly<00:02:05.850> take<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.000> time<00:02:07.210> to

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
one so I can't exactly take the time to

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.830 
one so I can't exactly take the time to
get<00:02:07.479> super<00:02:07.869> good<00:02:08.019> at<00:02:08.140> everything<00:02:09.630> but<00:02:10.630> if<00:02:10.750> you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
get super good at everything but if you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.199 
get super good at everything but if you
want<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.230> there<00:02:11.410> is<00:02:11.500> plenty<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.489> Metal<00:02:13.180> Gear

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
want that there is plenty of Metal Gear

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.910 
want that there is plenty of Metal Gear

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
but this is about the point when I start

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.040 
but this is about the point when I start
getting<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.920> rhythm<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.250> little<00:02:24.460> bit<00:02:24.580> better

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
getting the rhythm a little bit better

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.520 
getting the rhythm a little bit better
and<00:02:26.050> my<00:02:26.200> hand<00:02:26.380> starts<00:02:26.740> doing<00:02:26.920> what<00:02:27.040> it's<00:02:27.160> told

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
and my hand starts doing what it's told

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.200 
and my hand starts doing what it's told
but<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.800> end<00:02:30.010> up<00:02:30.160> hurting<00:02:30.340> myself<00:02:30.580> as<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.030> keep

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
but I end up hurting myself as I keep

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.530 
but I end up hurting myself as I keep
mentioning<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:33.670> dumb<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.120> don't<00:02:34.300> know<00:02:34.390> why

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
mentioning it's so dumb I don't know why

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.910 
mentioning it's so dumb I don't know why
I<00:02:34.570> did<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.260> might<00:02:38.380> be<00:02:38.470> thinking<00:02:38.500> well

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
I did it and you might be thinking well

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.050 
I did it and you might be thinking well
why<00:02:39.070> didn't<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.280> restart

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
why didn't you restart

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.870 
why didn't you restart
well<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:41.770> section<00:02:42.160> because<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:42.580> not<00:02:42.730> that

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
well this section because it's not that

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.370 
well this section because it's not that
challenging<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.540> all<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> damage<00:02:43.900> I'm<00:02:44.140> doing

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
challenging and all the damage I'm doing

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.470 
challenging and all the damage I'm doing
here<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.680> pretty<00:02:44.830> much<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.220> myself<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.880> random

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480

soldiers<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.170> got<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> checkpoint<00:02:48.520> before<00:02:48.940> an

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
soldiers I got to a checkpoint before an

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.020 
soldiers I got to a checkpoint before an
ad<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:50.080> didn't<00:02:50.530> save<00:02:50.770> in<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.550> sequence

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
ad I didn't save in this sequence

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.300 
ad I didn't save in this sequence
because<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.660> was<00:02:52.750> too<00:02:52.840> busy<00:02:53.020> recording<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:54.100> this

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
because I was too busy recording so this

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.330 
because I was too busy recording so this
is<00:02:54.460> my<00:02:54.580> checkpoint<00:02:55.000> now<00:02:55.410> with<00:02:56.410> tiny<00:02:56.710> life<00:02:56.980> and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
is my checkpoint now with tiny life and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.210 
is my checkpoint now with tiny life and
on<00:02:57.970> this<00:02:58.150> sequence<00:02:58.570> where<00:02:58.830> there's<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.920> ton<00:03:00.190> of

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
on this sequence where there's a ton of

on this sequence where there's a ton of
dudes<00:03:00.490> with<00:03:00.790> rocket<00:03:01.090> launchers<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.510> do

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
dudes with rocket launchers that do

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
dudes with rocket launchers that do
massive<00:03:02.110> damage<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:04.360> these<00:03:04.930> early<00:03:04.990> guys<00:03:05.470> don't

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
massive damage so these early guys don't

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.900 
massive damage so these early guys don't
matter<00:03:05.980> because<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.340> don't<00:03:06.520> have<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.820> hit

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
matter because you don't have to hit

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.020 
matter because you don't have to hit
them<00:03:07.120> if<00:03:07.240> you<00:03:07.330> can't<00:03:07.540> hit<00:03:07.720> them<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.560> know<00:03:08.680> it's

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
them if you can't hit them you know it's

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.550 
them if you can't hit them you know it's
it's<00:03:10.030> pretty<00:03:10.210> tricky<00:03:10.600> but<00:03:10.690> it's<00:03:10.840> definitely

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
it's pretty tricky but it's definitely

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.630 
it's pretty tricky but it's definitely
possible<00:03:11.830> I<00:03:13.800> just<00:03:14.800> don't<00:03:14.980> even<00:03:15.070> try<00:03:15.340> access

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
possible I just don't even try access

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.670 
possible I just don't even try access
circuit<00:03:16.060> but<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.750> first<00:03:16.960> person<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.410> really

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
circuit but the first person you really

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.950 
circuit but the first person you really
have<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:17.980> kill<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.400> these<00:03:18.580> these<00:03:19.480> guys<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
have to kill of these these guys in the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.570 
have to kill of these these guys in the
guy<00:03:20.080> in<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.230> roof<00:03:20.410> guy<00:03:20.770> on<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:20.980> roof<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.280> super

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
guy in the roof guy on the roof is super

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.840 
guy in the roof guy on the roof is super
involved<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.090> don't<00:03:22.180> kill<00:03:22.450> him<00:03:22.630> you're<00:03:22.780> dead

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
involved you don't kill him you're dead

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.370 
involved you don't kill him you're dead
and<00:03:24.850> then<00:03:24.970> when<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.180> kill<00:03:25.360> these<00:03:25.510> two<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.990> ends

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
and then when you kill these two it ends

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.960 
and then when you kill these two it ends
the<00:03:26.530> sequence<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.190> move<00:03:27.370> on<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> next

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
the sequence and you move on to the next

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.710 
the sequence and you move on to the next
part<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:30.130> next<00:03:30.160> part<00:03:30.550> involves<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.240> think<00:03:31.600> it's

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
part the next part involves I think it's

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.300 
part the next part involves I think it's
four<00:03:32.050> dudes<00:03:32.290> rushing<00:03:32.770> it<00:03:32.860> either<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.160> have<00:03:33.280> to

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
four dudes rushing it either you have to

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.949 
four dudes rushing it either you have to
shoot<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.880> then<00:03:34.060> when<00:03:34.240> you<00:03:34.330> drive<00:03:34.570> background

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
shoot and then when you drive background

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.060 
shoot and then when you drive background
there's<00:03:35.140> gonna<00:03:35.230> be<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.410> rocket<00:03:35.709> launch<00:03:35.830> a<00:03:35.950> guy

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
doing instead of killing the driver if

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.529 
doing instead of killing the driver if
you<00:04:52.780> kill<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.139> sidecar<00:04:53.590> person<00:04:54.330> you'll<00:04:55.330> not

you kill the sidecar person you'll not

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.330 
you kill the sidecar person you'll not
spawn<00:04:55.810> any<00:04:55.990> more<00:04:56.199> enemies<00:04:56.349> and<00:04:56.770> nothing<00:04:57.190> can

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
spawn any more enemies and nothing can

out the sequence you'll notice I hit the
driver<00:05:00.759> on<00:05:01.030> those<00:05:01.180> two<00:05:01.360> shots<00:05:02.070> wasn't<00:05:03.070> really

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
driver on those two shots wasn't really

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.100 
driver on those two shots wasn't really
intentional<00:05:03.580> that<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.330> aim<00:05:04.479> is<00:05:04.750> swinging

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
intentional that the aim is swinging

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.230 
intentional that the aim is swinging
around<00:05:05.320> so<00:05:05.770> much<00:05:06.009> it<00:05:06.669> can<00:05:06.910> be<00:05:07.030> difficult

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
around so much it can be difficult

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.900 
around so much it can be difficult
sometimes<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.960> shoot<00:05:08.229> who<00:05:08.380> you<00:05:08.530> want<00:05:08.770> I<00:05:09.130> suck

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
so that helps because I messed it up I

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.890 
so that helps because I messed it up I
decide<00:05:15.820> to<00:05:15.970> just<00:05:16.120> shoot<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.389> driver<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:16.810> on

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.640 
rifle even though it's really cool like
everything<00:05:49.690> about<00:05:49.840> it<00:05:50.050> except<00:05:50.259> for<00:05:50.289> shooting

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
shagger heart because I learned by

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.790 
shagger heart because I learned by
watching<00:05:59.620> a<00:05:59.860> speedrun<00:06:00.099> a<00:06:00.550> couple<00:06:01.030> years<00:06:01.270> back

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
watching a speedrun a couple years back

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.619 
watching a speedrun a couple years back
the<00:06:02.800> I<00:06:03.069> say<00:06:03.550> years<00:06:03.819> back<00:06:04.030> which<00:06:04.300> one<00:06:04.449> was<00:06:04.599> it

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
the I say years back which one was it

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:05.939 
the I say years back which one was it
might<00:06:04.900> been<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.050> more<00:06:05.229> recent<00:06:05.409> one<00:06:05.620> a<00:06:05.710> couple

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
might been a more recent one a couple

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.659 
might been a more recent one a couple
months<00:06:06.069> back<00:06:06.340> that<00:06:07.800> you<00:06:08.800> can<00:06:08.979> damage<00:06:09.220> the<00:06:09.370> SHA

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
months back that you can damage the SHA

months back that you can damage the SHA
go<00:06:09.819> hard<00:06:10.000> before<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.389> fight<00:06:10.629> and<00:06:10.990> it'll<00:06:11.199> make

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
go hard before the fight and it'll make

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:12.659 
go hard before the fight and it'll make
it<00:06:11.500> a<00:06:11.560> little<00:06:11.680> bit<00:06:11.830> quicker<00:06:11.949> but<00:06:12.340> because<00:06:12.580> I'm

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
it a little bit quicker but because I'm

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.010 
it a little bit quicker but because I'm
not<00:06:12.699> going<00:06:13.000> for<00:06:13.150> any<00:06:13.240> kind<00:06:13.449> of<00:06:13.509> crazy<00:06:13.630> speed

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
not going for any kind of crazy speed

not going for any kind of crazy speed
run<00:06:14.169> or<00:06:14.259> anything<00:06:14.349> I<00:06:14.620> don't<00:06:14.650> really<00:06:15.039> have<00:06:15.250> to

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
run or anything I don't really have to

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.120 
run or anything I don't really have to
well<00:06:16.389> it's<00:06:16.750> an<00:06:16.870> excuse<00:06:17.259> to<00:06:17.409> practice<00:06:17.860> the

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
well it's an excuse to practice the

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.890 
well it's an excuse to practice the
reload<00:06:18.460> consoles<00:06:18.909> with<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.120> RPG<00:06:19.240> for<00:06:19.810> the

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
reload consoles with the RPG for the

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.830 
reload consoles with the RPG for the
shag<00:06:20.080> or<00:06:20.229> hard<00:06:20.380> fight<00:06:21.389> any<00:06:22.389> excuse<00:06:22.810> to

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
shag or hard fight any excuse to

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.529 
shag or hard fight any excuse to
practices<00:06:23.440> is<00:06:23.680> a<00:06:23.710> decent<00:06:23.949> one<00:06:24.130> for<00:06:24.430> me<00:06:24.520> so<00:06:24.759> try

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
practices is a decent one for me so try

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.480 
practices is a decent one for me so try
to<00:06:25.569> take<00:06:25.750> outside<00:06:26.169> car<00:06:26.409> guys<00:06:26.650> but<00:06:27.039> I<00:06:27.310> think

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
to take outside car guys but I think

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.399 
to take outside car guys but I think
Suge<00:06:27.940> ahead<00:06:28.150> just<00:06:28.360> drives<00:06:28.630> over<00:06:28.870> him<00:06:29.110> anyway

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
Suge ahead just drives over him anyway

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.370 
Suge ahead just drives over him anyway
and<00:06:30.099> then<00:06:31.000> we<00:06:31.090> get<00:06:31.240> to<00:06:31.479> to<00:06:31.930> practice<00:06:32.259> the

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
and then we get to to practice the

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.400 
and then we get to to practice the
reload<00:06:32.680> cancelling

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.620 

so<00:06:36.010> at<00:06:36.130> this<00:06:36.220> point<00:06:36.520> I<00:06:36.760> think<00:06:37.120> I've<00:06:37.360> got<00:06:37.510> the

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
so at this point I think I've got the

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.260 
so at this point I think I've got the
rhythm<00:06:37.780> down<00:06:38.080> on<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.890> trigger<00:06:39.180> kind<00:06:40.180> of

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
rhythm down on the trigger kind of

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.030 
rhythm down on the trigger kind of
climatized<00:06:40.750> to<00:06:41.050> it<00:06:42.990> after<00:06:43.990> this<00:06:44.080> video<00:06:44.290> of<00:06:44.470> mr.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
climatized to it after this video of mr.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.020 
climatized to it after this video of mr.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
first phase is easy but I don't get it

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.060 
first phase is easy but I don't get it

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 
but nowhere near the same amount and

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.520 
but nowhere near the same amount and
I've<00:07:36.370> only<00:07:36.520> ever<00:07:36.610> beaten<00:07:36.970> now<00:07:37.870> look<00:07:38.020> aside<00:07:38.230> for

I've only ever beaten now look aside for
once<00:07:38.830> because<00:07:39.730> I<00:07:39.820> really<00:07:40.120> didn't<00:07:40.360> like<00:07:40.510> it

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.040 
once because I really didn't like it

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.310 
once because I really didn't like it
which<00:07:42.040> is<00:07:42.250> an<00:07:43.150> opinion<00:07:43.570> that<00:07:43.600> stuns<00:07:43.990> a<00:07:44.110> lot<00:07:44.230> of

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:44.320 
which is an opinion that stuns a lot of

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.230 
which is an opinion that stuns a lot of
people<00:07:44.620> but<00:07:45.220> I've<00:07:45.430> got<00:07:45.580> some<00:07:45.760> really<00:07:46.120> really

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
people but I've got some really really

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.270 
people but I've got some really really
strong<00:07:46.390> feelings<00:07:47.020> about<00:07:47.200> that<00:07:47.350> game<00:07:47.590> and<00:07:47.830> I'm

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 
strong feelings about that game and I'm

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.250 
strong feelings about that game and I'm
hoping<00:07:48.670> to<00:07:48.850> go<00:07:48.970> back<00:07:49.180> to<00:07:49.360> it<00:07:49.450> and<00:07:49.600> what<00:07:49.990> played

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:50.260 
hoping to go back to it and what played

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.410 
hoping to go back to it and what played
again<00:07:50.530> with<00:07:50.740> an<00:07:50.830> open<00:07:51.100> mind<00:07:51.340> to<00:07:51.880> try<00:07:52.090> and<00:07:52.210> enjoy

it a little bit better and I've got a

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.880 
it a little bit better and I've got a
great<00:07:54.970> excuse<00:07:55.360> now<00:07:55.570> because<00:07:55.930> it's<00:07:56.500> one<00:07:56.740> of<00:07:56.830> the

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.890 
great excuse now because it's one of the
