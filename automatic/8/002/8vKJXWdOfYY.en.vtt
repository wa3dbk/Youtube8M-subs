00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.620
 Hello and welcome to his other little video from more video 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.620
 SPD today I present you a useful accessory in my eyes 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.929
 the Apple iPad 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.679
 With its help, I can almost make the Apple iPad into a full-fledged netbook 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.960
 transform if we all know 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.110
 is the iPad due to the missing keyboard due to the lack of real ones 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.400
 Keyboard I would like to say in the first place in devices to be comfortable on the 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.500
 Sofa to surf there on the Internet to watch videos 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.210
 and to do one or the other well-kept game 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.070
 does not want to work with more productive speaks power-point presentation only 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.219
 Files exe files or similar 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.379
 of course, first of all, I would first like to work on the right one 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.179
 Software instructed by Apple from the App Store and secondarily also ne 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:47.489
 clever keyboard because on this screen keyboard you can indeed 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.210
 relatively well enter websites but I would like to longer texts so 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.470
 do not write 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.870
 you see in front of you 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.390
 a so-called Apple iPad Schopper 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.850
 looks a bit like care 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.880
 Notebook consists of from Lena 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.040
 record stores 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.810
 we see 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.610
 New England manufactured by the company Geers Earth manufactured in China and the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.940
 special about this body is the fact 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.380
 that you are here 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.250
 to have a blood test rather directly installed that means it can both the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.530
 Apple iPad 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.660
 to watch the video insert here 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.630
 as well as working directly with it in netbook 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.550
 if the topic looks at the page 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.710
 can you do that 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.000
 Write texts and similar for sure now this keyboard directly 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.550
 with the iPad the paddock already there is indeed a collection branch on the 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.910
 The top you have to press before, of course, activate blood Osama iPad 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.050
 and is given on a course the man must enter on the keyboard and 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.110
 Ratz the ride 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.300
 The whole thing has already come 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.850
 think that built-in Baku 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.689
 "The brightest according to the manufacturer about 90 hours of play time in real 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.720
 Test I have it only fair but week in the business he would like to say 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.230
 not 24 hours 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.580
 but for a week you can then comfortably author and author texts 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.300
 something similar 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.130
 if you have to say we have a micro usb standard board down here right here 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.639
 just comes in the squad because with the included USB charger bag 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.859
 The device charging after about five hours it is fully charged one can wonderful 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.179
 collaborate 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:18.739
 the keyboard itself is made up of the silicone it is way too of course 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.499
 light 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.669
 but the kit feeling is getting used to was possible Â» 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.549
 said Witter Keys our important feedback exists at this 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.870
 Keyboard not yet 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.870
 because the keys are not made of plastic 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.689
 Where the keys are just silicone you can not research it's here 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.429
 so a butter soft freezing wet one can do with it after a certain 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.649
 Familiarization period of a deep rewrite 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:44.169
 how does it all work in practice after you have paired the keyboard 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.349
 Of course, now you have the possibility that Apple is not a market 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.209
 Buy connectivity and 20 euros and he sound like usb-keyboard 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.339
 have presented another video but if you consider the duel this 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.070
 complete volume including keyboard of this Korber 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.230
 only after 70 euros I think for the much better because on more mobile 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.340
 Alternative Youth for example, the bavarian and the program on 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.409
 says she wanted to add a new note 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.379
 and then easy 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.879
 on the keyboard 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.579
 absolutely normal 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.829
 Burlo write with the special character enter-key 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.829
 if you listen so carefully 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.669
 one hears the risk examined and it wants to decide trifles 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.419
 that you do not disturb your neighbors either 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.790
 has the disadvantage that you have this right haptic feedback as you get it from 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:36.899
 right keyboard he just does not know so bold that is in my eyes but 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.429
 absolutely no problem 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.429
 we can also write it with him, of course 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.599
 Labbadia wanted to write to the connection to a few 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.599
 One should e-mail the test 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:03.319
 this country is 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.439
 there was agreement here 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.439
 this works in every application 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.049
 Wismar 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.440
 such as the apple products like percent keynote best 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.440
 presentation program 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.110
 then we have her in where you too 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.879
 is little 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:25.999
 Dorsten 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.169
 In the meantime, five search dogs have received a relatively large number of programs 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.209
 because I actually complete the thing now as a laptop replacement 

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:34.930
 use 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.639
 that unfortunately I have to visit the mini-programs so yet 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.639
 Everyone is here because I synced the thing again and again 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.919
 so there's Peters that's the Apple word, so to speak 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.860
 So if you are a completely new one 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.860
 Create documents 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.650
 you had 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:05.919
 we can just now 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.919
 go ahead and replace the data 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.240
 Umlauts are also available on the keyboard 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.360
 that is the one thing is the keyboard itself, he is in english that means it 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.370
 a cool tips for the car 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.860
 But is directly in German law that is it in the saloon is directly from the iPad 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.589
 when 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:27.539
 then counts 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.089
 edited so that you do not have to change here you write then 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:31.870
 really like on the german keyboard 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.270
 that sometimes takes a bit of getting used to the keys 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.260
 are not so labeled here for example to underline this 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.169
 is this 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.360
 around SZ available 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.279
 but you get used to the man relatively quickly 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:46.379
 around the keyboard you normally also have to be a bit in the back of your mind 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.379
 got from r from APC keyboard 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.309
 then there is no problem 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.609
 If you want to be on the very safe side you have to open the Apple iPad 

00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:57.199
 change the English language of course then renounce 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.009
 umlauts 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.300
 that in my eyes not so happy solution 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.569
 and there you should have the no keyboard 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.869
 to learn to empty out so a little bit by rote I say make normal 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:10.039
 Keyboards are also implemented here 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.749
 this keyboard she said 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:16.169
 not that now Plus Ultra can not give in my eyes, too, writes the ck 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.909
 a case replace but also for people who just do not want to have a netbook 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.479
 is the combination Apple iPad 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.000
 and this one sets the tattoo so you just want the Weser 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:29.750
 Manufacturer in China is another 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.830
 with good combination for me personally that's enough 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.729
 Disadvantage of the whole is just stupid makes the Apple iPad is not straight 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.009
 more attractive in terms of size 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.979
 We are already a bit as bookable as possible 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.249
 So the weight of the new strain has increased neatly 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:47.360
 but you can still do it well in the Bundestag 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.599
 only in his briefcase transport the key advantage is just 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.539
 can write much more pleasant with this keyboard 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:56.710
 the duration seen 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.960
 as with the ritual on-screen keyboard 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.300
 made spatial that he is not so intrusive relatively quickly 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.580
 assembled 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.279
 that almost had the whole thing 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:11.089
 that's it Matthias or palm rest is the laps 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:13.220
 can write a relatively good 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.770
 and also has the advantage that you now the device in this mode too 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.770
 can use to watch videos 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.330
 That's it! To this little keyboard more information is needed 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.620
 At the moment, he has made the internet about the films he has been using 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.010
 almost 70 euros 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.630
 including bluetooth keyboard as well as contrasts built-in battery and 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.680
 Charger usb cable 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.360
 summarized about 90 hours you certainly have a good alternative that one 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.230
 or others 

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.220
 Chamber will come out even a seminar built-in keyboard completely 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.510
 Plastic I'm curious how that will look 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.089
 until then that's a good alternative for me 

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:53.199
 and for one or the other of you sure 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.419
 I just say a lot of fun with the video would be happy if I too 

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:57.900
 watch my other videos 

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.300
 good is
