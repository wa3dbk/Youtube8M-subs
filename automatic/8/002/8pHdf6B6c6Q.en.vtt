00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
and you have the Camaros which are

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.320 
and you have the Camaros which are
almost<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.950> same<00:02:26.980> thing<00:02:27.400> as<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.550> Firebird<00:02:28.090> I

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
almost the same thing as a Firebird I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.270 
almost the same thing as a Firebird I
just<00:02:28.540> feel<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.860> Firebirds<00:02:29.860> are<00:02:30.010> maybe<00:02:30.160> just

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
just feel that Firebirds are maybe just

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.979 
just feel that Firebirds are maybe just
a<00:02:30.520> little<00:02:30.550> bit<00:02:30.850> sleeker<00:02:31.239> looking<00:02:31.780> than<00:02:31.959> the

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
a little bit sleeker looking than the

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.920 
a little bit sleeker looking than the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930

aren't fast or they don't really have
some<00:02:45.040> power<00:02:45.250> under<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.850> hood<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.390> just<00:02:46.840> think
