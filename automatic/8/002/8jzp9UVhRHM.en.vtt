have the hair we want it and do a three
strand<00:01:55.380> inverted<00:01:56.100> braid<00:01:57.979> nothing<00:01:58.979> too<00:01:59.159> fancy

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
strand inverted braid nothing too fancy

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.029 
strand inverted braid nothing too fancy
or<00:01:59.610> complicated<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.410> see<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> didn't<00:02:04.950> do

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
or complicated you can see I didn't do

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.680 
or complicated you can see I didn't do
it<00:02:05.129> too<00:02:05.280> tight<00:02:05.550> against<00:02:06.000> her<00:02:06.060> head<00:02:06.300> because<00:02:06.509> I

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
it too tight against her head because I

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.350 
it too tight against her head because I
want<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.959> to<00:02:07.080> be<00:02:07.200> soft<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.700> look<00:02:08.970> kind<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.239> like

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
want it to be soft and look kind of like

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.640 
want it to be soft and look kind of like
a<00:02:09.509> summery<00:02:09.929> beach<00:02:10.640> like<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:12.000> fun<00:02:12.180> braid

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.399 

again<00:02:18.650> when<00:02:18.859> you<00:02:18.950> get<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:19.340> end<00:02:20.260> just<00:02:21.260> go

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
again when you get to the end just go

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.589 
again when you get to the end just go
ahead<00:02:21.469> and<00:02:21.709> put<00:02:21.859> that<00:02:22.040> rubber<00:02:22.579> band<00:02:22.909> back<00:02:23.239> into

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
ahead and put that rubber band back into

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.020 
ahead and put that rubber band back into
the<00:02:23.719> end<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.459> we're<00:02:25.459> going<00:02:25.579> to<00:02:25.670> pull<00:02:25.819> both

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
the end of it we're going to pull both

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.860 
the end of it we're going to pull both
of<00:02:26.150> those<00:02:26.269> out<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.599> minute

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
of those out in a minute

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.770 
of those out in a minute
so<00:02:27.109> it<00:02:27.170> doesn't<00:02:27.319> matter<00:02:27.560> too<00:02:27.799> much<00:02:28.390> okay<00:02:29.420> now

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
so it doesn't matter too much okay now

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.990 
so it doesn't matter too much okay now
this<00:02:30.019> third<00:02:30.230> piece<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.890> what<00:02:31.640> we're<00:02:31.760> going<00:02:31.879> to

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
this third piece is what we're going to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.390 
this third piece is what we're going to
use<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.359> our<00:02:32.480> lacing<00:02:32.930> strand<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:33.920> what<00:02:34.129> we<00:02:34.250> want

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
use is our lacing strand so what we want

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.679 
use is our lacing strand so what we want
to<00:02:34.459> do<00:02:34.549> is<00:02:34.670> take<00:02:34.879> these<00:02:35.030> two<00:02:35.209> pieces<00:02:35.389> and

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
to do is take these two pieces and

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.869 
to do is take these two pieces and
combine<00:02:35.930> them<00:02:36.230> together<00:02:36.409> but<00:02:37.250> obviously<00:02:37.700> we

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
combine them together but obviously we

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.610 
combine them together but obviously we
can't<00:02:38.090> do<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.420> without<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:39.139> piece<00:02:39.409> in<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
can't do that without this piece in the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.440 
can't do that without this piece in the
middle<00:02:39.769> so<00:02:40.639> I'm<00:02:40.700> going<00:02:40.879> to<00:02:40.909> take<00:02:41.060> my<00:02:41.239> index

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
middle so I'm going to take my index

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.479 
middle so I'm going to take my index
finger<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.170> my<00:02:42.260> thumb<00:02:42.620> I'm<00:02:43.069> just<00:02:43.310> going<00:02:43.430> to

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
put it right through I'm going to grab

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.420 
put it right through I'm going to grab
that<00:02:46.659> middle<00:02:47.659> strand<00:02:48.010> I'm<00:02:49.010> going<00:02:49.159> to<00:02:49.220> go<00:02:49.280> back

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
that middle strand I'm going to go back

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.009 
that middle strand I'm going to go back
over<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.760> this<00:02:49.879> side<00:02:49.939> and<00:02:50.419> again<00:02:50.540> same<00:02:50.989> thing

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
we make sure we get it waist all the way

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.790 
we make sure we get it waist all the way
down<00:03:36.849> as<00:03:37.849> far<00:03:38.090> as<00:03:38.120> we<00:03:38.209> can

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.760 

maybe<00:03:42.460> one<00:03:42.760> more<00:03:42.990> on<00:03:43.990> this<00:03:44.140> one<00:03:46.770> you're

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
maybe one more on this one you're

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.530 
maybe one more on this one you're
obviously<00:03:47.950> going<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.430> run<00:03:48.580> out<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.730> hair

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
obviously going to run out of hair

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.210 
obviously going to run out of hair
oh<00:03:50.340> we've<00:03:51.340> got<00:03:51.520> one<00:03:51.730> more<00:03:51.910> just<00:03:52.630> enough<00:03:52.930> the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.560 

end<00:03:57.220> gets<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.580> little<00:03:57.790> bit<00:03:58.000> trickier<00:03:58.360> just

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
end gets a little bit trickier just

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.660 
end gets a little bit trickier just
because<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.840> braids<00:03:59.050> a<00:03:59.170> little<00:03:59.380> tighter<00:03:59.670> now

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
because the braids a little tighter now

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.850 
because the braids a little tighter now
when<00:04:00.820> you<00:04:00.940> get<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.270> end<00:04:01.450> remove<00:04:02.350> all<00:04:02.650> of

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
when you get to the end remove all of

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.120 
when you get to the end remove all of
these<00:04:03.450> rubber<00:04:04.450> bands<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:04.960> we<00:04:05.080> had<00:04:05.290> this<00:04:05.890> time

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
these rubber bands that we had this time

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.560 
these rubber bands that we had this time
I'm<00:04:06.280> going<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.460> take<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.700> little<00:04:07.000> elastic<00:04:07.240> that

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
I'm going to take a little elastic that

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.540 
I'm going to take a little elastic that
matches<00:04:07.630> our<00:04:08.080> hair<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.980> it<00:04:09.100> just<00:04:09.310> kind<00:04:09.490> of

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
matches our hair so it just kind of

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.060 
matches our hair so it just kind of
