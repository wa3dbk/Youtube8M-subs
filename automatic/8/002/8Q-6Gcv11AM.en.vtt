00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.440 

hello<00:00:01.140> guys<00:00:02.090> here<00:00:03.090> I<00:00:03.240> have<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:04.140> DC<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.740> AC

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
hello guys here I have the DC to AC

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.320 
hello guys here I have the DC to AC
voltage<00:00:06.450> converter<00:00:07.130> it<00:00:08.130> will<00:00:08.490> convert<00:00:09.000> from

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
voltage converter it will convert from

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:20.990 
voltage converter it will convert from
12<00:00:10.290> volts<00:00:10.710> DC<00:00:12.469> to<00:00:15.949> two<00:00:16.949> hun<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:18.590> see<00:00:19.760> on<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
12 volts DC to two hun I see on the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.670 
12 volts DC to two hun I see on the
multimeter<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.279> 250<00:00:23.279> volts<00:00:24.060> ac<00:00:24.689> because<00:00:25.410> there

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
multimeter so 250 volts ac because there

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.060 
multimeter so 250 volts ac because there
is<00:00:25.830> no<00:00:26.010> load<00:00:26.250> attached<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> transformer<00:00:27.779> I

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
is no load attached to the transformer I

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.299 
is no load attached to the transformer I
use<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.269> 12<00:00:31.189> 10<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.870> 220<00:00:33.870> volts<00:00:34.309> toroidal

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
use a 12 10 to 220 volts toroidal

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.030 
use a 12 10 to 220 volts toroidal
transformer<00:00:36.770> it<00:00:37.770> makes<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.879> makes<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:40.040> noise

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
transformer it makes it makes a noise

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.360 
transformer it makes it makes a noise
right<00:00:41.489> now<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.770> adjusted

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
right now because it is not adjusted

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.150 
right now because it is not adjusted
properly<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:46.980> 50<00:00:47.550> Hertz<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:49.980> on

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
properly to 50 Hertz as you can see on

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.810 
properly to 50 Hertz as you can see on
the<00:00:50.309> oscilloscope<00:00:50.809> on<00:00:51.809> oscilloscope<00:00:52.820> those

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the oscilloscope on oscilloscope those

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.729 
the oscilloscope on oscilloscope those
are<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.379> frequency<00:00:55.520> waves<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:58.109> frequency

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
are the frequency waves the frequency

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.170 
are the frequency waves the frequency
now<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.160> set<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.899> 54<00:01:00.899> heads<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.969> can

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
now is set to 54 heads and as you can

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
now is set to 54 heads and as you can
see<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.530> waves<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.979> dots<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.700> soy<00:01:05.909> doll<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
see the waves are dots in a soy doll so

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.240 
see the waves are dots in a soy doll so
you<00:01:07.770> cannot<00:01:08.070> use<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.780> converter<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:11.159> power

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
you cannot use this converter to power

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.440 
you cannot use this converter to power
laptops<00:01:14.250> TVs<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:16.560> know<00:01:16.759> because<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.150> can

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
laptops TVs you know because it can

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.390 
laptops TVs you know because it can
damage<00:01:19.140> them<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.700> easily<00:01:20.880> instead<00:01:21.509> for

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
damage them you can easily instead for

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.300 
damage them you can easily instead for
light<00:01:24.680> for<00:01:25.700> different<00:01:26.700> power<00:01:26.970> tools<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:29.130> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
light for different power tools but as I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.190 
light for different power tools but as I
told<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.570> cannot<00:01:30.930> use<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:32.540> too<00:01:36.200> expensive

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
told you you cannot use it too expensive

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.160 
told you you cannot use it too expensive
compared<00:01:38.130> equipment<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.210> TV<00:01:39.630> laptops

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
compared equipment like TV laptops

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.530 
compared equipment like TV laptops
monitors<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:44.540> circuit

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
monitors so as you can see the circuit

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.560 
monitors so as you can see the circuit
is<00:01:45.689> working<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.500> sorry<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.119> having<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
is working and sorry for not having a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.069 
is working and sorry for not having a
load<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.079> light<00:01:49.680> bulb<00:01:49.950> bulb<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.820> my<00:01:50.850> case<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.509> do

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
load a light bulb bulb in my case I do

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
load a light bulb bulb in my case I do
not<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> small<00:01:52.979> power<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.840> but<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.939> hope<00:01:56.939> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
not have a small power one but I hope I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.010 
not have a small power one but I hope I
will<00:01:57.329> buy<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.509> soon<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:59.180> prove<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
will buy one soon and prove you that the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.730 
will buy one soon and prove you that the
secret<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.310> working<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:03.500> will<00:02:04.500> post
