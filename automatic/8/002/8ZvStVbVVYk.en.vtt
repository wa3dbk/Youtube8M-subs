00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:08.710
 today we will learn to disarm the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.800
 blackberry 9530 good after turning it off 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.510
 Yes now 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.280
 we remove what is the battery 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.940
 we remove 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.390
 these two screws 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.390
 ah 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.700
 in this case they can be done for many 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.640
 reasons mainly for problems in 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.489
 touch we expel from this capital to 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.489
 get up we removed these two screws 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.540
 another can be for moisture also 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.360
 it can be a reason 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.930
 I'm afraid what is here 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.620
 is not ready or does not need to remove the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.370
 two from here first expelling this 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.370
 tapita also 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.009
 after removing it 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:19.579
 now if what we do is put the one 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:23.210
 your own or fasts in the tools 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:26.479
 specials that are worked to make 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.119
 yours and not in general of any harm here 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.990
 on the good team card 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.929
 we eject this 31 from the touch other 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.990
 from the display and we eject this 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.600
 we can also disconnect what is 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.200
 this 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.439
 west of here but in this case not what 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.439
 make 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.580
 because I can only do them the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.580
 teaching here that makes you say is a 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.979
 interesting trick and it's these parts 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.500
 here they originally bring about 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.990
 original rubbers this is cautious what 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.180
 they do is suppress that touch and touch 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.179
 this little button that is here in 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.989
 half commonly this little buttons 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.970
 sulfate and it is difficult for it to work that 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.180
 press the equipment then you 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.420
 I recommend that they take it out 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.180
 the piece of paper on top and use what 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.360
 is the draft with a clean shield what 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.980
 They are the two extremes that's all good 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.700
 for the moment in this way you 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.030
 they can change what is auricular 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.730
 what is the tactile the display make it 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.459
 maintenance of sulfatar the equipment is 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.360
 find wet or do what is 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.239
 work inside the card that is is 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.209
 replacing in a component that is 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.560
 defective you need to generate some 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.800
 change 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.020
 well not only this is interesting they are 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.440
 very many interesting things about 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.989
 all the equipment that exists in 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.140
 these moments and that come for this 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.099
 year ending the year 2012 so 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.110
 I want to invite you to subscribe and 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.569
 know that these are truly issues 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.390
 for everyone for you as a user or 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.750
 for the person who is working this 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.180
 kind of things you can implement in your 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.730
 labor field as such 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.890
 something else that I can not forget and are 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.870
 these blank pieces of paper that bring it 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.120
 all the blackberrys and they are about 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.230
 I tell you that what they do 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.840
 is to identify if the equipment has fallen 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.109
 wet or not to say that there are 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.379
 account if the paper the ph is found 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.489
 red is because he has certainly fallen 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.489
 wet to your blackberry
