because the batteries were dead or the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.580 
because the batteries were dead or the

these<00:01:37.770> segments<00:01:38.219> where<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.729> into<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
these segments where you go into the

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.059 
these segments where you go into the
place<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.840> know<00:01:40.259> warn<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.859> fire

protective<00:01:41.609> equipment<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.210> everything<00:01:42.270> else

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
protective equipment and everything else

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.440 
protective equipment and everything else
and<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> takes<00:01:43.289> that<00:01:43.740> long<00:01:43.799> right<00:01:44.609> to<00:01:45.030> go<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.299> in

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and it takes that long right to go up in

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.029 
and it takes that long right to go up in
the<00:01:45.509> week<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.929> saw<00:01:46.139> the<00:01:46.200> story<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.590> burned<00:01:46.889> a

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
the week you saw the story we burned a

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.149 
the week you saw the story we burned a
house<00:01:47.219> down<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.729> Chicago<00:01:48.539> and<00:01:48.979> within<00:01:49.979> two

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
house down in Chicago and within two

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.459 
house down in Chicago and within two
minutes<00:01:50.459> the<00:01:50.999> house<00:01:51.179> was<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.170> fly<00:01:52.289> yet

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
minutes the house was was up and fly yet

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.050 
minutes the house was was up and fly yet
so<00:01:52.649> there's<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.889> dual<00:01:53.189> kind<00:01:53.579> that's<00:01:53.789> kind<00:01:53.999> of

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
so there's a dual kind that's kind of

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.760 
so there's a dual kind that's kind of
new<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.539> right<00:01:54.719> what<00:01:55.109> is<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.319> one<00:01:55.530> down<00:01:55.709> here

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
new all right what is this one down here

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.059 
new all right what is this one down here
so<00:01:56.429> this<00:01:56.670> we're<00:01:56.909> talking<00:01:57.299> about

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
so this we're talking about

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.769 
so this we're talking about
interconnected<00:01:59.069> alarms<00:01:59.789> a<00:01:59.969> lot<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.509> new

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:00.779 
interconnected alarms a lot of new

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:02.779 
interconnected alarms a lot of new
construction<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.799> alarms<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.369> already

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
construction the alarms are already

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.309 
construction the alarms are already
hardwired<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.719> are<00:02:03.810> all<00:02:03.990> interconnected

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
hardwired and are all interconnected

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.609 
hardwired and are all interconnected
which<00:02:05.249> basically<00:02:05.459> means<00:02:05.969> one<00:02:06.840> alarm<00:02:07.109> goes<00:02:07.380> off

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
which basically means one alarm goes off

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.429 
which basically means one alarm goes off
they<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.340> go<00:02:08.550> off<00:02:09.179> what<00:02:09.509> now<00:02:09.659> that's<00:02:09.899> smart<00:02:10.200> so

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439 
they all go off what now that's smart so

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.170 
they all go off what now that's smart so
I<00:02:10.470> live<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.979> big<00:02:11.159> house<00:02:11.370> sure<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.970> there's<00:02:12.120> a

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
fire in the basement that alarm

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.699 
fire in the basement that alarm
goes<00:02:13.939> off<00:02:14.150> your<00:02:14.810> alarm<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.140> also<00:02:15.379> going<00:02:15.499> to<00:02:15.590> go

goes off your alarm is also going to go

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.890 
goes off your alarm is also going to go
off<00:02:15.890> better<00:02:16.489> smart<00:02:16.879> now<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.269> really<00:02:17.510> here<00:02:17.810> is
