 disable it of course a function that 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.970
 will allow you to throw them 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.800
 elements on the screen it is full of others 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.990
 things that can be very useful for 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.250
 your ipod touch or obviously he 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.170
 must be equipped with ipod touch 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.990
 fourth generation 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.599
 so first madrid the aj and we 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.250
 check well that our ipod touch and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.989
 well under version 5.1 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.030
 once you've done that move is 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.559
 sure you got it's called 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.000
 left-green so to see you 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.379
 go in general you get off everything 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.440
 in the bottom in news here for 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.789
 accessibility support 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.590
 then we have all his functions that we will 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.480
 not activated Russian and their perception 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.910
 par 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.199
 the section in my list here so I 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.280
 advise you before the iv act of 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.780
 launch a plan to the wills its brands 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.869
 and state the advice because it's 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.790
 really the famous idea is useless but 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.830
 you are still not once 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.000
 you have chosen makes a board that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.220
 will change the controls altogether 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.040
 alcohol will be more babies but that's 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.409
 not yet it will be more like that so we 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.960
 come back down everything down in 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.420
 remaining the accessibility section and we 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.180
 will go all the way down a triple triple 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.119
 click on the main fight button 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.210
 between moms disable them 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.759
 and so you're going to mark select 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.189
 asked is easier than one is 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.149
 happened once you leave the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.740
 settings and you come back to your globe 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.600
 and we will activate the voiceover section 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.500
 so we support three times as I was 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.790
 asked for attention one two three 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.259
 here we have these three functions that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.610
 appears and you only need to acquire one 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.610
 so we will leave her 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.250
 so here we see who nuances the 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.709
 elements on the screen so I removed 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.540
 denounces the concessions or ten years so 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.600
 to select an element 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.240
 touch here is for example we will open 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.920
 the reminders to open it is two 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.440
 once quickly once the element 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.260
 selected once your iphone and 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:38.840
 you press twice quickly 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:42.310
 anywhere on the screen 1 2 so that's it 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.030
 he denounces everything that is said the same 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.230
 here 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.459
 and then we can come back to our 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.959
 springboard by pressing only that's it 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.690
 after selecting the same thing 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.269
 to change to pass very simple so 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.730
 to slide the pages as against them 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.860
 but we change and just do not put 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.380
 three fingers like soula like these 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:09.070
 and of the church and here we click 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.070
 doubleclick 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.250
 so we can really and not that's all 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.959
 what we want is complicated 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.260
 so here they really have everything 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.500
 we want anticipated PC running endless 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.329
 after we see well it will be the godfather 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.660
 who really really says everything after 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.660
 it is of course operations 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.130
 notification and select more than 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.610
 details a three fingers like 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.610
 the three two orders 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.739
 it's complicated I do not arrive it's a 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.350
 really pampered including the racecourse 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.030
 animal or what once you have to 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.470
 foot it can be as convenient for 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.480
 say for example percentage of 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.579
 batteries that are not available 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.880
 small if not the safest battery 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.880
 job 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:22.630
 do not really forget all the details by 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:32.710
 example the bars for the time and 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:33.820
 after we can say the weather so here we go 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.530
 it's quite practical 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:46.810
 they will be little and no it's really 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:51.610
 all for love so then speaking 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.020
 of course and so after there was 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.150
 many who galley to disable it 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.380
 but in fact it's not complicated like 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.360
 you did you my technique and that 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.169
 you have to sign gesture 3 pressed on 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.100
 the home button 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.100
 but we will do it a fold 3 x 1 2 3 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.460
 so that's a little easier for 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.050
 enable or give it the best 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.940
 picture and go down with three fingers 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:21.100
 it is a little irritating it is necessary that after 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:26.470
 a support on two teams he told me on 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:29.020
 in applied twice and this voiceover 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.690
 is disabled the ipod is back to the 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.130
 normal or and I'm down but 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.300
 that's over and he controls normal 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.350
 so it did not damage the ipod since 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.680
 it's in iowa 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.680
 5 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.950
 and therefore learn for example on 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.160
 facebook it's back to normal if 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:53.290
 I press on my honor his poster the 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.940
 fault to the martys sadi more and better us 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.030
 so here after I advise you 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:02.060
 to remove the sort the assignment the 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.200
 tripe the clip because after your ipad 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.060
 is a bit longer 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.750
 when you have the options you do 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.970
 disable like this 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.460
 according to my tickets it's faster to 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.910
 come back so that was how 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.790
 statement there how to turn off 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.570
 voiceover very easily I tell you to 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.570
 soon for a new video
