this<00:00:25.920> booster<00:00:26.840> originally<00:00:27.840> i<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.080> had<00:00:28.199> this

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
this booster originally i just had this

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.839 
this booster originally i just had this
booster<00:00:28.890> track<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.340> extend<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.730> out<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
booster track here extend it out a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.250 
booster track here extend it out a
little<00:00:29.939> bit<00:00:30.060> further<00:00:30.300> gave<00:00:30.539> all<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> booths

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
little bit further gave all the booths

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.290 
little bit further gave all the booths
that<00:00:31.410> needed<00:00:31.730> but<00:00:32.730> i'm<00:00:32.820> using<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.120> because

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that needed but i'm using this because

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
that needed but i'm using this because
it's<00:00:33.420> gonna<00:00:33.540> make<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.660> little<00:00:33.930> bit<00:00:34.050> more

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
it's gonna make a little bit more

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.490 
it's gonna make a little bit more
compact<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> little<00:00:35.280> bit<00:00:35.370> more<00:00:35.489> reliable<00:00:35.940> um

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
compact in a little bit more reliable um

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.420 
compact in a little bit more reliable um
basically<00:00:37.579> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.730> see<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:40.129> we<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.280> this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
basically you can see here we have this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.529 
basically you can see here we have this
magazine<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.809> cards<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:44.329> stacked<00:00:45.329> up

magazine with cards in it stacked up

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.029 
magazine with cards in it stacked up
that's<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> ladder<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.379> side<00:00:46.620> which<00:00:46.770> keeps

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
that's a ladder on that side which keeps

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.779 
that's a ladder on that side which keeps
them<00:00:47.219> aligned<00:00:47.550> inside<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> magazine<00:00:49.550> you<00:00:50.550> can

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
them aligned inside the magazine you can

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.790 
them aligned inside the magazine you can
take<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> cart<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.730> drop<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.289> into<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.590> loader

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
take a cart and drop it into the loader

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.599 
take a cart and drop it into the loader
here<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:58.140> hits<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> collision<00:00:58.949> booster<00:00:59.340> gets

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
here it hits the collision booster gets

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.180 
here it hits the collision booster gets
boosted<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.120> into<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> magazine<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.440> loads

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
boosted up into the magazine and loads

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.060 
boosted up into the magazine and loads
and<00:01:03.110> if<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.260> notice<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.650> i'm<00:01:04.739> using<00:01:04.799> only

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and if you notice here i'm using only

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.490 
and if you notice here i'm using only
one<00:01:05.489> collision<00:01:06.000> booster<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.689> cards<00:01:07.110> inside

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
one collision booster for cards inside

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.820 
one collision booster for cards inside
the<00:01:07.770> booster<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:08.820> there<00:01:09.530> there's<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.650> half

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the booster down there there's a half

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.440 
the booster down there there's a half
step<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> door<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> doors

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
step here and a door here the doors

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
step here and a door here the doors
controlled<00:01:12.869> by<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> switch<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:14.340> what

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
controlled by a switch and that's what

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.890 
controlled by a switch and that's what
sends<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> car<00:01:15.090> down<00:01:15.180> its<00:01:15.360> ways<00:01:15.570> when<00:01:15.810> this

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
sends the car down its ways when this

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.890 
sends the car down its ways when this
door<00:01:16.229> opens<00:01:17.090> there<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.210> four<00:01:18.420> cuts<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.780> there

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
door opens there are four cuts in there

door opens there are four cuts in there
in<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.080> collision<00:01:19.439> booster<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.790> check

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
in that collision booster you can check

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.179 
in that collision booster you can check

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
to build those shows you to basics and i

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.609 
to build those shows you to basics and i
can<00:01:27.210> use<00:01:27.360> both<00:01:27.630> sides<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.290> collision

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
can use both sides of this collision

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.210 
can use both sides of this collision
booster<00:01:29.100> here

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
booster here

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.580 
booster here
if<00:01:30.790> you<00:01:30.940> notice<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.300> track<00:01:31.570> meets<00:01:31.900> right<00:01:32.230> here

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
if you notice the track meets right here

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.940 
if you notice the track meets right here
at<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.830> forward<00:01:33.190> corner<00:01:34.320> now<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.530> forward

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
at the forward corner now to a forward

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.580 
at the forward corner now to a forward
corner<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.460> booster<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:38.200> the

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
corner of that booster and because the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.680 
corner of that booster and because the
cart<00:01:39.280> when<00:01:39.550> it<00:01:39.670> drops<00:01:39.880> onto<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.210> track<00:01:40.480> is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
cart when it drops onto the track is

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.150 
cart when it drops onto the track is
dropping<00:01:41.050> out<00:01:41.110> of<00:01:41.170> that<00:01:41.350> forward<00:01:41.680> corner<00:01:42.040> it's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
dropping out of that forward corner it's

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.890 
dropping out of that forward corner it's
pretty<00:01:42.700> much<00:01:42.820> guaranteed<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.300> always<00:01:43.540> go<00:01:43.870> out

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
pretty much guaranteed to always go out

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.330 
pretty much guaranteed to always go out
the<00:01:44.170> same<00:01:44.350> direction<00:01:44.530> because<00:01:44.860> it<00:01:45.010> can't<00:01:45.220> go

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
the same direction because it can't go

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.920 
the same direction because it can't go
back<00:01:45.550> there's<00:01:46.540> no<00:01:46.720> track<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.320> play<00:01:47.710> it<00:01:47.860> back

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
back there's no track to play it back

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.450 
back there's no track to play it back
and<00:01:49.930> that<00:01:50.050> sends<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.470> up<00:01:50.560> on<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.310> highway

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
and that sends it up on to the highway

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.670 
and that sends it up on to the highway
here<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.420> basically<00:01:55.570> when<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.380> push<00:01:56.650> a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
here and so basically when I push a

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.370 
here and so basically when I push a
button<00:01:57.660> over<00:01:58.660> there<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.890> going<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:01.260> turn<00:02:02.260> to

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
button over there it's going to turn to

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.590 
button over there it's going to turn to
this<00:02:02.500> day<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.800> open<00:02:03.220> which<00:02:03.729> allows<00:02:04.060> these<00:02:04.300> cuts

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
this day to open which allows these cuts

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.380 
this day to open which allows these cuts
to<00:02:04.840> fall<00:02:05.080> down<00:02:05.190> this<00:02:06.190> car<00:02:06.460> starts<00:02:06.910> it<00:02:07.030> going

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
to fall down this car starts it going

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.260 
to fall down this car starts it going
and<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.660> gets<00:02:07.780> onto<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.490> track<00:02:09.490> here<00:02:09.820> gets

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
and it gets onto the track here gets

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.900 
and it gets onto the track here gets
boosted<00:02:10.720> up<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.020> around<00:02:11.310> hits<00:02:12.310> this<00:02:12.550> ladder

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
boosted up and around hits this ladder

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.490 
boosted up and around hits this ladder
which<00:02:13.209> prevents<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.690> from<00:02:13.780> going<00:02:13.870> all<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.410> way

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
which prevents it from going all the way

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.660 
which prevents it from going all the way
flush<00:02:14.770> with<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.100> block<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.550> that's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
flush with that block and that's

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.190 
flush with that block and that's
important<00:02:16.150> because<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.330> causes<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.930> very

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
important because that causes the very

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.350 
important because that causes the very
back<00:02:17.560> corner<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.160> cart<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.670> get<00:02:19.120> hung<00:02:19.270> up

and this booster will propel you for
absurd<00:02:45.379> distances<00:02:46.599> we're<00:02:47.599> about<00:02:47.749> five

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
absurd distances we're about five

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.869 
absurd distances we're about five
kilometers<00:02:48.769> right<00:02:49.010> now<00:02:49.159> from<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.459> main<00:02:49.639> hub

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
kilometers right now from the main hub

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.369 
kilometers right now from the main hub
and<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.180> do<00:02:50.239> not<00:02:50.420> have<00:02:50.629> any<00:02:50.810> supplementary

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
and I do not have any supplementary

and I do not have any supplementary
boosters<00:02:51.889> between<00:02:52.340> here<00:02:52.639> and<00:02:52.760> there<00:02:53.349> to<00:02:54.349> get

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:54.499 
boosters between here and there to get

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.229 
boosters between here and there to get
me<00:02:54.590> where<00:02:54.739> I'm<00:02:54.829> going<00:02:55.099> so<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.609> that<00:02:55.849> booster

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
me where I'm going so that that booster

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.729 
me where I'm going so that that booster
will<00:02:56.420> carry<00:02:56.659> me<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.930> full<00:02:57.139> distance<00:02:57.379> of<00:02:57.650> about

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
will carry me the full distance of about

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.129 
will carry me the full distance of about
five<00:02:58.099> kilometers<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:59.239> will<00:02:59.389> probably<00:02:59.629> go<00:02:59.900> for

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
five kilometers it will probably go for

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:05.580 
five kilometers it will probably go for
the<00:03:00.260> map<00:03:00.760> um<00:03:02.170> due<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.379> new<00:03:03.609> electric<00:03:04.609> rail

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
the map um due to the new electric rail

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.420 
the map um due to the new electric rail
these<00:03:06.590> are<00:03:06.739> not<00:03:06.799> really<00:03:07.040> completely

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
these are not really completely

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.640 
these are not really completely
necessary<00:03:07.639> anymore<00:03:08.290> but<00:03:09.290> when<00:03:09.409> you're<00:03:09.530> going

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
necessary anymore but when you're going

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.860 
necessary anymore but when you're going
really<00:03:09.889> long<00:03:10.129> distances<00:03:10.669> on<00:03:10.999> straight<00:03:11.569> shot

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
really long distances on straight shot

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.800 
really long distances on straight shot
with<00:03:12.049> no<00:03:12.200> stop<00:03:12.739> play<00:03:12.950> points<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.430> middle

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
with no stop play points in the middle

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.240 
with no stop play points in the middle
it<00:03:14.810> can<00:03:15.019> be<00:03:15.109> handy<00:03:15.439> to<00:03:15.469> use<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.680> booster<00:03:16.099> like

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
it can be handy to use a booster like

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.839 
it can be handy to use a booster like
this<00:03:16.810> because<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:18.709> sets<00:03:19.069> that<00:03:19.280> max<00:03:19.549> speed

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
this because it sets that max speed

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.599 
this because it sets that max speed
really<00:03:20.120> immediately<00:03:20.689> and<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.980> can<00:03:22.159> save<00:03:22.430> on

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
really immediately and you can save on

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.119 
really immediately and you can save on
all<00:03:22.699> the<00:03:22.879> resources<00:03:23.239> of<00:03:23.510> building<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.129> gold

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
all the resources of building the gold

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.830 
all the resources of building the gold
track<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.849> whole<00:03:26.030> distance<00:03:28.719> so<00:03:29.719> that's

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
track the whole distance so that's

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.539 
track the whole distance so that's
basically<00:03:30.530> right<00:03:31.069> there<00:03:31.219> that's<00:03:31.340> my

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
basically right there that's my

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.659 
basically right there that's my
autoloading<00:03:32.409> compact<00:03:33.409> booster<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:34.310> notice<00:03:34.549> a

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
autoloading compact booster you notice a

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.990 
autoloading compact booster you notice a
vertical<00:03:35.090> space<00:03:35.329> here<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:37.400> does<00:03:37.549> take<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.760> quite

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
vertical space here it does take a quite

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.119 
vertical space here it does take a quite
a<00:03:38.030> bit<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.239> vertical<00:03:38.629> space<00:03:38.810> but<00:03:38.959> that's

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
a bit of vertical space but that's

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.369 
a bit of vertical space but that's
purely<00:03:40.129> for<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.489> size<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.909> the<00:03:41.000> magazine<00:03:41.449> what

purely for the size of the magazine what
we<00:03:42.500> have<00:03:42.650> here<00:03:43.099> is<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:44.480> edge<00:03:45.469> trigger<00:03:45.979> or<00:03:46.220> a

second on this one on this side it's
that<00:04:05.629> that<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:05.989> important<00:04:06.470> because<00:04:06.709> if<00:04:07.129> it

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
that that is important because if it

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.069 
that that is important because if it
opens<00:04:07.489> for<00:04:07.849> longer<00:04:08.180> than<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.359> split<00:04:08.659> second

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
opens for longer than a split second

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.749 
opens for longer than a split second
then<00:04:09.229> more<00:04:09.859> than<00:04:09.979> one<00:04:10.099> cart<00:04:10.370> would<00:04:10.519> fall<00:04:10.729> down

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:10.759 
then more than one cart would fall down

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.460 
then more than one cart would fall down
through<00:04:11.299> the<00:04:11.389> lawyer<00:04:11.599> so<00:04:11.870> this<00:04:11.989> is<00:04:12.139> just<00:04:12.259> a

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
through the lawyer so this is just a

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.249 
through the lawyer so this is just a
guarantee<00:04:13.189> that<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.459> autoloader<00:04:14.019> only<00:04:15.019> sends

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259 
guarantee that the autoloader only sends

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.529 
guarantee that the autoloader only sends
one<00:04:15.439> card<00:04:15.709> at<00:04:15.829> a<00:04:15.889> time<00:04:16.099> you<00:04:17.090> don't<00:04:17.299> need<00:04:17.389> that

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
one card at a time you don't need that

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.860 
one card at a time you don't need that
on<00:04:17.659> the<00:04:17.750> other<00:04:17.870> side<00:04:18.789> you<00:04:19.789> can<00:04:20.090> make<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.299> super

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
on the other side you can make a super

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.240 
on the other side you can make a super
compact<00:04:21.320> version<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.949> this<00:04:22.099> which<00:04:22.780> basically

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
compact version of this which basically

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.730 
compact version of this which basically
has<00:04:25.250> this<00:04:25.659> bottom<00:04:26.659> track<00:04:26.930> here<00:04:27.229> just<00:04:27.500> wrap

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
has this bottom track here just wrap

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.850 
has this bottom track here just wrap
around<00:04:28.340> okay<00:04:28.940> this<00:04:29.449> bottom<00:04:29.780> track<00:04:29.960> here<00:04:30.229> just

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
around okay this bottom track here just

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.310 
around okay this bottom track here just
wrap<00:04:31.099> around<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> booster<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.320> directly

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
wrap around the booster and directly

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.450 
wrap around the booster and directly
back<00:04:33.530> up<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.740> this<00:04:33.860> side<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.219> that<00:04:34.340> would

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
back up to this side and that would

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.459 
back up to this side and that would
allow<00:04:34.639> you<00:04:34.699> to<00:04:34.940> simply<00:04:35.300> drop<00:04:35.599> a<00:04:35.630> cart<00:04:35.990> into<00:04:36.229> the

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
allow you to simply drop a cart into the

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.240 
allow you to simply drop a cart into the
loader<00:04:36.650> here<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.159> have<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.210> automatically

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
loader here and have it automatically

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.159 
loader here and have it automatically
drop<00:04:40.250> down<00:04:40.460> here<00:04:40.729> and<00:04:40.849> load<00:04:41.030> makes<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.050> only

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
drop down here and load makes it only

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.529 
drop down here and load makes it only
one<00:04:42.380> button<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.770> operate<00:04:43.250> saves<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.210> ton<00:04:44.479> of

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
one button to operate saves a ton of

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:45.969 
one button to operate saves a ton of
space<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:45.169> can<00:04:45.259> make<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.530> an<00:04:45.590> incredibly

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
space you can make it an incredibly

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:46.760 
space you can make it an incredibly
compact

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
compact

construction um if you were to do it
that<00:04:54.449> way<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:55.440> would<00:04:55.530> still<00:04:55.770> load<00:04:56.009> itself

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
that way and it would still load itself

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.129 
that way and it would still load itself
to<00:04:56.610> ensure<00:04:56.970> that<00:04:57.120> was<00:04:57.300> seen<00:04:57.509> out<00:04:57.599> waiting<00:04:57.900> for

you<00:05:16.229> can<00:05:16.379> kind<00:05:17.340> of<00:05:17.370> get<00:05:17.490> an<00:05:17.520> idea<00:05:17.639> of<00:05:18.259> the

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
you can kind of get an idea of the

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.180 
you can kind of get an idea of the
dimensions<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:20.280> takes<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.669> build<00:05:20.819> this<00:05:22.190> in

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
dimensions it takes to build this in

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.659 
dimensions it takes to build this in
case<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:23.490> want<00:05:23.669> to<00:05:23.699> build<00:05:23.819> one<00:05:23.970> yourself<00:05:25.669> but
