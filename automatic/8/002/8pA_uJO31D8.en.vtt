00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
an alkaline so on the top what i've done

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.910 
an alkaline so on the top what i've done
is<00:01:32.909> i<00:01:33.150> put<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.689> reference<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.439> starting

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
is i put for reference the starting

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.280 
is i put for reference the starting
point<00:01:35.189> where<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> LED<00:01:35.850> started<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
point where the LED started and on the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.499 
point where the LED started and on the
bottom<00:01:37.439> you'll<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:37.979> how<00:01:38.460> they<00:01:38.759> decay<00:01:39.329> over

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
bottom you'll see how they decay over

00:01:39.509 --> 00:02:43.900 
bottom you'll see how they decay over
time<00:01:39.950> let's<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.130> started

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.069 

that<00:02:44.910> looks<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.239> pretty<00:02:45.480> much<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.810> can<00:02:45.930> get

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
that looks like pretty much you can get

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.199 
that looks like pretty much you can get
an<00:02:46.230> hour<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.709> half<00:02:46.860> maybe<00:02:47.130> two<00:02:47.579> hours<00:02:47.610> out

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
an hour and a half maybe two hours out

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.940 
an hour and a half maybe two hours out
of<00:02:48.239> these<00:02:48.450> rechargeables<00:02:49.200> which<00:02:49.560> i<00:02:49.680> think<00:02:49.739> is

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
of these rechargeables which i think is

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.830 
of these rechargeables which i think is
pretty<00:02:50.130> good<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.670> you'll<00:02:51.239> notice<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
pretty good and you'll notice that the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.809 
pretty good and you'll notice that the
outline<00:02:52.230> start<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.709> die<00:02:52.889> off<00:02:52.920> pretty<00:02:53.459> quickly

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
outline start to die off pretty quickly

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.960 
outline start to die off pretty quickly
after<00:02:54.150> two<00:02:54.510> hours<00:02:54.829> in<00:02:55.829> terms<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.220> their<00:02:56.430> output

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
after two hours in terms of their output

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.319 
after two hours in terms of their output
but<00:02:57.690> I've<00:02:57.930> been<00:02:58.260> running<00:02:58.950> them<00:02:59.250> right<00:02:59.549> now<00:02:59.850> for

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
but I've been running them right now for

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.479 
but I've been running them right now for
over<00:03:00.510> 16<00:03:01.109> hours<00:03:01.260> downstairs<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.370> they're

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
over 16 hours downstairs and they're

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.640 
over 16 hours downstairs and they're
still<00:03:02.760> going<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:03.930> you're<00:03:04.079> using<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.470> for

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
still going so if you're using it for

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.590 
still going so if you're using it for
something<00:03:04.829> like<00:03:05.069> maybe<00:03:05.340> camping<00:03:05.730> alkalines

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
something like maybe camping alkalines

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.449 
something like maybe camping alkalines

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
might be the way to go but you're using

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.180 
might be the way to go but you're using
it<00:03:08.670> more<00:03:08.819> for<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.299> studio<00:03:09.630> lighting<00:03:10.049> or<00:03:10.350> an

brighter<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.480> background<00:03:22.019> what<00:03:22.290> are<00:03:22.380> we

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
brighter in the background what are we

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.160 
brighter in the background what are we
using<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.889> for<00:03:23.569> hour<00:03:24.569> and<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.780> half<00:03:24.900> two<00:03:25.079> hours

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
using it for hour and a half two hours

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.750 
using it for hour and a half two hours
is<00:03:25.440> pretty<00:03:25.560> good<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.220> just<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:26.730> know

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
is pretty good and you can just you know

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.550 
is pretty good and you can just you know
swap<00:03:27.120> these<00:03:27.329> suckers<00:03:27.630> out<00:03:27.930> as<00:03:28.109> you<00:03:28.349> need<00:03:28.530> to

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
swap these suckers out as you need to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.289 
swap these suckers out as you need to
during<00:03:29.010> your<00:03:29.160> shoot<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.030> appears<00:03:30.060> that

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
during your shoot so it appears that

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.199 
during your shoot so it appears that
these<00:03:30.540> batteries<00:03:31.099> on<00:03:32.099> fully<00:03:32.609> charged<00:03:33.030> are

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
these batteries on fully charged are

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.020 
these batteries on fully charged are
about<00:03:33.420> eight<00:03:33.599> point<00:03:34.049> three<00:03:34.190> volts<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.400> when

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
about eight point three volts and when

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.970 
about eight point three volts and when
they're<00:03:36.239> dead<00:03:36.510> they're<00:03:36.870> totally<00:03:37.470> dead<00:03:37.650> when<00:03:37.950> I

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
they're dead they're totally dead when I

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.530 
they're dead they're totally dead when I
took<00:03:38.099> them<00:03:38.340> out<00:03:38.489> after<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.970> test<00:03:39.209> their

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
took them out after the test their

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.629 
took them out after the test their
registered<00:03:40.019> zero<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:41.310> pretty<00:03:41.549> much

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
registered zero so pretty much

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.860 
registered zero so pretty much
everything<00:03:42.060> about<00:03:42.239> these<00:03:42.450> batteries<00:03:42.810> are

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
everything about these batteries are

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.650 
everything about these batteries are
great<00:03:43.319> I<00:03:43.620> got<00:03:43.919> three<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.310> them<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:45.239> only<00:03:45.450> thing

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
great I got three of them the only thing

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.190 
great I got three of them the only thing
that's<00:03:45.959> not<00:03:46.290> great<00:03:46.799> is<00:03:47.540> how<00:03:48.540> long<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.959> takes

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
that's not great is how long it takes

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.050 
that's not great is how long it takes
three<00:03:49.500> charge<00:03:49.799> them<00:03:50.040> I'm<00:03:50.220> recharging<00:03:50.880> one

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
three charge them I'm recharging one

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
right now it's been in the wall for over

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.080 
right now it's been in the wall for over
two<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.439> a<00:03:55.530> half

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
two and a half

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.229 
two and a half
and<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.510> thing<00:03:56.690> is<00:03:56.750> still<00:03:57.110> not<00:03:57.290> done<00:03:57.530> charging

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
and the thing is still not done charging

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.850 
and the thing is still not done charging
I<00:03:59.239> don't<00:03:59.989> know<00:04:00.050> if<00:04:00.170> it's<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.319> function<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.739> the

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
I don't know if it's a function of the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.559 
I don't know if it's a function of the
charger<00:04:01.220> but<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.819> charger<00:04:02.209> i<00:04:02.300> bought<00:04:02.540> was

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
i'll put the link to all these batteries

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.979 
i'll put the link to all these batteries
and<00:04:12.739> battery<00:04:12.890> charges<00:04:13.340> in<00:04:13.549> my<00:04:13.700> show<00:04:14.510> notes<00:04:14.780> on

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
and battery charges in my show notes on

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.020 
and battery charges in my show notes on
my<00:04:15.110> website<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:16.070> i<00:04:16.400> don't<00:04:16.729> know<00:04:16.790> if<00:04:16.880> this<00:04:16.970> is

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
my website so i don't know if this is

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.969 
my website so i don't know if this is
the<00:04:17.150> charger<00:04:17.750> if<00:04:17.870> it's<00:04:17.989> like<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.139> slow<00:04:18.530> trickle

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
the charger if it's like a slow trickle

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.520 
the charger if it's like a slow trickle
charge<00:04:19.370> type<00:04:19.760> thing<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.690> maybe<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.229> holds<00:04:21.470> a

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
charge type thing and maybe it holds a

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.560 
charge type thing and maybe it holds a
charge<00:04:21.739> better<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.340> have<00:04:22.760> no<00:04:22.970> idea<00:04:23.120> but<00:04:23.300> if

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
charge better I have no idea but if

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.060 
charge better I have no idea but if
anybody<00:04:23.930> knows<00:04:24.139> of<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:24.440> charger<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:24.919> goes

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
anybody knows of a charger that goes

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.460 
anybody knows of a charger that goes
faster<00:04:25.520> this<00:04:25.669> one<00:04:25.910> maybe<00:04:26.690> they<00:04:27.080> can<00:04:27.260> charge

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
faster this one maybe they can charge

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.379 
faster this one maybe they can charge
them<00:04:27.680> in<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:27.800> half<00:04:28.070> hour<00:04:28.280> or<00:04:28.520> an<00:04:28.729> hour<00:04:28.940> instead

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
them in a half hour or an hour instead

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.330 
them in a half hour or an hour instead
of<00:04:29.720> like<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.229> don't<00:04:30.620> know<00:04:30.800> it's<00:04:31.010> probably<00:04:31.100> gonna

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
of like I don't know it's probably gonna

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.070 
of like I don't know it's probably gonna
finish<00:04:31.580> in<00:04:31.760> about<00:04:31.850> three<00:04:32.240> hours<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.780> think

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
finish in about three hours I think

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.650 
finish in about three hours I think
that's<00:04:33.229> what<00:04:33.410> it<00:04:33.500> was<00:04:33.530> before<00:04:34.360> please<00:04:35.360> let<00:04:35.540> me
