00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 ladies and gentlemen, I greet you all today 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.950
 we're going to see how to transform the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.970
 our windows 8 and windows 7 windows 8 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:19.080
 Yes, yes 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:21.660
 windows 7 windows 8 unfortunately ok 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.580
 then below you will find the indies 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.789
 description you can choose between the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.650
 online and offline between 32 64 bit 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.360
 I downloaded the 64 bit off line 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.010
 64-ticket operating system one 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.160
 Once this is done, let's click on you 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.770
 which we do not start the installation 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.170
 it is precisely the identical version I repeat it 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.360
 I say in the first place accepted the terms is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.379
 kicked everything you say no to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.030
 everything you want to install ok 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.129
 select everything i say go one 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.180
 small premise is not exactly identical 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.039
 to windows 8 fortunately own 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.530
 identical I drive under no we say that one 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.129
 species is as if it were almost more similar 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.020
 to the beta versions that are 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.479
 come out in prey leysin a few words that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.640
 have come out with windows 8 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.450
 at the end you have to remember stalling ria 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.790
 for the computer and here it is all right 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.040
 a slightly particular change not 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.619
 It is exactly identical to Windows 8 for more 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.030
 pignoli is fine then already as before 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.759
 what appears to us a little less a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.470
 little tutorial let's call it so on 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.280
 how to use the mouse that there may be 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.470
 help 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.729
 okay in this case do not show it 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.520
 more at the next reboot then son the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.260
 start up pictures explains the bla tutorial 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.190
 bla bla 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.770
 we see ok and this is our system 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.360
 for the windows 7 operating system between 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.710
 played in this sort of let's call it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.320
 windows 8 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.330
 here it is, the windows are more or less 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.880
 always remained the same has changed little 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.800
 and nothing short of icons 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.080
 logically the display of the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.820
 icons are different let's see already 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.149
 on our schools resources on ours 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.670
 computers that are in different ways 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.240
 how nice to repeat different panel of 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.070
 control and interview by category 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.290
 some are large some with 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.880
 when you arrive the same ones have changed 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.610
 but as always in large and 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.620
 small will always be in a nutshell 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.700
 those of the original guidos in the mouth 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.490
 that of windows 7 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.920
 here we have small axs in a few 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.240
 words where you can carry 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.360
 what you need 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.550
 open tabs and closed tabs 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.230
 you can customize now i 'm not 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.090
 rho yacht with custom lights 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.740
 tweaked nice little computer and 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.540
 when you become good it's not because you are good at it 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.320
 people take you but why you 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.720
 also learn by yourself in this case from 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.370
