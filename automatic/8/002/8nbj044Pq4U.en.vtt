00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.029
 in Germany today on 3d printers 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.190
 print chocolate figures 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.720
 American specialists are improving 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.070
 technology that allows you to print 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.460
 human skin 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.169
 Uses 3d printing and tone wood paper 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.359
 and all this could be learned daily 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.669
 open doors at the center of 3d technology 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.640
 May 16, 2013 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.140
 The scope of 3d printing is very 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.539
 diverse and latitude 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:34.660
 particularly used in education 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.000
 any student who is engaged in the form 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.780
 design modeling can its 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.230
 idea to create a chat and show touch 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.670
 if we look dismantle the building 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.110
 architect who is engaged 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.690
 designing some complicated 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.890
 constructions and buildings deals more 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.380
 creativity and routine work performs 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.500
 a machine 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.110
 One plastic already have a 3d printer 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.739
 which prints several materials 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.859
 right away 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.499
 that's just such a plastic regula not they 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:10.960
 at the roofs and make a prototype of shoes 

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:13.450
 nike use such utensils 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.280
 interview center 3d technology from day to 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.880
 the day awaits the appearance of such a printer and 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.100
 at home 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.409
 although similar machines the company more than once already 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.329
 delivered 3d printing for its customers 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.740
 under the order delivery to anywhere in the world 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.689
 necessary equipment 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.429
 and recently the company began to develop 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.950
 another direction of virtual 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.109
 promoters that underlie such 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.299
 virtual promoters of course this 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:38.409
 backprojection thin film reverse 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.490
 projection gives the image through the projector 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.219
 and 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.709
 absolutely any image is projected 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.749
 it can be like a person who 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:51.399
 presented in this case it can 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:53.409
 be a virtual thing that can 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.469
 teach talk to attract 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.650
 more customer demand i am very 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:02.220
 responsible and work capable 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.400
 labor the day and night trading 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.470
 centers banks public institutions 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.580
 soon filled with virtual 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.619
 employees who without interruption on 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.330
 lunch will be able to quickly and clearly convey 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.340
 any information not your customers 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.840
 Perhaps in Tomsk will appear soon and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.090
 virtual interactive windows 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.770
 which are not uncommon in large cities 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.140
 in general, the future is fast 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.770
 approaching and at the center of 3d technology to 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.770
 ready for him 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.110
 but
