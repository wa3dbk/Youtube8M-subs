00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello bass galley playing is starting 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.420
 but a check point watch the news 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.250
 here in bjc quoted you have not yet made the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.960
 enrollment in the channel or click on 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.820
 below to know everything about the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.280
 world of games one of the largest 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.949
 Promises Crime Unit access was a map 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.420
 totally gigantic and now this map 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.600
 leaked and it looks like it really starts 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.970
 confirmed the leak appeared in reddit at 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.230
 amount of map detail 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.900
 impresses by showing a device never 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.490
 view before the games and the coolest of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.340
 all is that the player will be able to enter 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.559
 approximately 25% of households 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 makes the experience even more offensive 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.000
 but this is it is that the map is real even 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.510
 remembering of course is that the ce 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.230
 arrive pcs-4 xbox one on the 28th of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.390
 October 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.739
 ubisoft had already said that waiting for a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.960
 a little and to start the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.120
 development of hot dogs 2 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.739
 But this of course does not mean that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.480
 they can not come out asking me 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.370
 what do we want in the next game? 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.230
 the company is sending emails to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.390
 players with a questionnaire that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.789
 she will help improve the next game 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.650
 from the hot dogs series which is a good request 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.030
 of the ubi since even if leaving 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.430
 relatively well 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
 a lot of people complained about the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.630
 commented game and found bysoft not 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.159
 demanded mail and also say that you think 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 which has to improve in the sequence and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.640
 now news about xbox the year 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.920
 first it seems that we will have 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 a cut in the price of the console 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.960
 We will also have a white console 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.930
 with the 17 overdrive them together and some 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.700
 not so good details about direct x 12 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.369
 only one image is displayed announcing a 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.560
 cut price of 50 euros appeared from the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.450
 nothing on the spanish xbox site 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.090
 besides her we also had the hashtag 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.000
 xbox games call indicating that the cut 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.799
 can be announced there at the jamerson event 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.509
 console white has been shown on the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.310
 french me with 6 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.689
 according to the announcement the version will be by 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.439
 same edition price without kinect ie 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.509
 399 euros 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.729
 worth remembering that before only employees 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.290
 access to this measurement 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.399
 Is she going to get here too? 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.530
 what do you think? 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.960
 and to close the subject xbox the staff 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.630
 I decided the net does not look like much 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.369
 excited about the arrival of direct x 12 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.500
 no xbox one 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.450
 on the resolution according to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.760
 resort arrival developer goes 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.409
 increase polygon count but not 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.150
 will change nothing in resolution 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.190
 microsoft itself had already commented 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.989
 that the resource was not going to bring changes 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.239
 and that it would be more useful for 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.159
 to improve programmers' lives 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.659
 meanwhile we wait for the 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.829
 update the dashboard that will 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.780
 facilitate navigation and 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.190
 sharing as you can see in 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.780
 news down here 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.810
 I think I just needed to say on twitter. 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.010
 announcing neighborhood beach shock Mr. 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.530
 although we do not know yet 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.299
 neither the release date nor the price of the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.549
 game at least we already have some 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.230
 other information and even shopping malls 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.480
 of course the game graphics suffered 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.180
 Great, well, this has to happen. 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.010
 even to provide mobile games but only 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.560
 this does not disturb anyone and it seems that 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.390
 the gameplay by the touchpad is very good 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.280
 Of course people who will never 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.560
 precision of a joystick more 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.150
 The game seems to be a good 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.980
 investment for those who enjoy playing in 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.510
 mobile devices 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.250
 but when we know the game 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.099
 will arrive and ask for 4 ipad 2 ipad is iphone 5 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.840
 iphone 5 if iphone 5 c 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.310
 otherwise has not been told anything just 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.500
 take the game to other systems 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.880
 operating but if you want to track 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.750
 news is just to keep an eye on our 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.120
 site 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.639
 people a recent study states that staying 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.700
 playing too long can give 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.099
 hallucinations with the sound of the game in question 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.840
 effects can include voice and 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.949
 other game sounds 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.750
 according to researchers about 12% of 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:41.970
 1,244 people interviewed affirmed 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.010
 suffer some kind of hallucination with the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.829
 sound of the games even after they have 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.349
 thrown by the searches these hallucinations 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.599
 happen only after long sessions of the 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.160
 game such as a full day and 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.870
 the effects did not last long then 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.519
 They can rest assured that nothing is 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.949
 been said here is a reason for much 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.870
 concern and already know that it is 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.940
