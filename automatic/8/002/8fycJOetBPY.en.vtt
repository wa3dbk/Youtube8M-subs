it's<00:04:00.670> an<00:04:00.760> air<00:04:00.910> diffuser<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.959> get<00:04:02.110> rid<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.290> the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
it's an air diffuser to get rid of the

it's an air diffuser to get rid of the
air<00:04:02.530> underneath<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.160> car<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.640> try<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.599> get<00:04:04.750> it

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
air underneath the car and try to get it

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
because the more turbulence there is

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.089
