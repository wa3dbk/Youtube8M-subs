00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it and there'd be a lot of energy as a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.830 
it and there'd be a lot of energy as a
result<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.519> her<00:00:26.730> percent<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.420> sense<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
result so her percent in that sense is a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.950 
result so her percent in that sense is a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
thought to myself I pitched you with

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.039 
thought to myself I pitched you with
adding<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.850> few<00:01:51.000> more<00:01:51.060> routers<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.630> could<00:01:51.840> tip

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
adding a few more routers I could tip

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.170 
adding a few more routers I could tip
this<00:01:52.200> at<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.439> hundred<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> same<00:01:53.610> time<00:01:53.850> I

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
this at a hundred but at the same time I

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.420 
this at a hundred but at the same time I
wanted<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.049> able<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> record<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.280> they

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
wanted to be able to record so they

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
wanted to be able to record so they
could<00:01:56.610> share<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.689> let's<00:01:58.259> just

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
could share this with you so let's just

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.490 
could share this with you so let's just
imagine<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.979> 64<00:01:59.700> percent<00:01:59.729> just<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.659> gns3<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
imagine that 64 percent just for gns3 is

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.310 
imagine that 64 percent just for gns3 is
not<00:02:02.460> acceptable<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.780> want<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
not acceptable and we want to get that

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.289 
not acceptable and we want to get that
down<00:02:04.500> how<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.219> our<00:02:05.700> first<00:02:06.090> thing

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
down how do we do that our first thing

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.180 
down how do we do that our first thing
that<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.540> want<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.229> use<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.829> big

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that we want to do is use this big

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.190 
that we want to do is use this big
button<00:02:08.729> right<00:02:08.879> here<00:02:08.910> called<00:02:09.360> stop<00:02:09.810> we're

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
button right here called stop we're

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.040 
button right here called stop we're
gonna<00:02:10.289> stop<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.860> madness<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.489> get<00:02:12.060> my<00:02:12.270> CPU

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
gonna stop the madness and get my CPU

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.850 
gonna stop the madness and get my CPU
down<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.530> a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
down to a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.460 
down to a
measurable<00:02:14.360> agreeable<00:02:15.360> level<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.140> now<00:02:16.290> it's

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
measurable agreeable level so now it's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.560 
measurable agreeable level so now it's
going<00:02:16.650> down<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.040> three<00:02:17.340> three<00:02:17.850> percent<00:02:18.300> five

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
going down to three three percent five

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.270 
going down to three three percent five
percent<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:19.110> that's<00:02:19.230> with<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.830> recording

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.880 
percent and that's with the recording
software<00:02:20.460> that's<00:02:21.270> going<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.690> now<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.650> tune

this here's how you do it you take one I
repeat<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:26.400> router<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.600> bring<00:02:27.810> just

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
repeat one router and you bring just

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.350 
repeat one router and you bring just

there's no timeout on the console just

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.199 
there's no timeout on the console just
like<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.380> routers<00:03:14.280> if<00:03:14.550> there's<00:03:14.910> ever<00:03:15.120> a

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
like that the routers if there's ever a

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.270 
like that the routers if there's ever a
time<00:03:15.270> when<00:03:15.930> they're<00:03:16.200> waiting<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:16.920> somebody

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
time when they're waiting for somebody

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.320 
time when they're waiting for somebody
to<00:03:17.400> press<00:03:17.640> Enter

for example a console session times out

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.289 
for example a console session times out
it's<00:03:20.310> waiting<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.670> press<00:03:20.850> ENTER<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.150> get<00:03:21.269> a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
out of gns3 as well so doing that will

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.060 
out of gns3 as well so doing that will
prevent<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:27.090> timeout<00:03:28.019> which<00:03:28.470> will<00:03:28.650> prevent<00:03:28.920> it

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
prevent a timeout which will prevent it

prevent a timeout which will prevent it

so<00:05:01.409> now<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:02.009> one<00:05:02.310> is<00:05:02.340> working<00:05:02.909> we<00:05:03.330> can<00:05:03.479> go<00:05:03.599> and

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
so now that one is working we can go and

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.480 
so now that one is working we can go and
bring<00:05:03.840> up<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.080> rest<00:05:04.259> so<00:05:04.949> there<00:05:05.190> should<00:05:05.370> be<00:05:05.400> a

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
bring up the rest so there should be a

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.270 
bring up the rest so there should be a
little<00:05:05.789> load<00:05:06.150> as<00:05:06.389> all<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.409> i/os<00:05:07.740> has<00:05:08.039> come

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
little load as all the i/os has come

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.499 
little load as all the i/os has come
into<00:05:08.520> play<00:05:08.699> and<00:05:08.940> they're<00:05:09.060> all<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.360> routers

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.210 
into play and they're all the routers
are<00:05:09.780> booted<00:05:10.020> up<00:05:10.169> but<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:10.770> shouldn't<00:05:11.069> be<00:05:11.099> a

they're coming up let me give you
another<00:05:15.240> tip<00:05:15.659> on<00:05:16.280> troubleshooting<00:05:17.280> let's<00:05:17.490> say

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
another tip on troubleshooting let's say

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.839 
another tip on troubleshooting let's say
you<00:05:17.669> have<00:05:17.849> idle<00:05:18.569> PC<00:05:18.930> that<00:05:19.139> is<00:05:19.349> set<00:05:20.220> yet<00:05:20.729> you

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
you have idle PC that is set yet you

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.309 
you have idle PC that is set yet you
bring<00:05:21.090> new<00:05:21.270> routers<00:05:21.690> in<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.050> for<00:05:22.169> whatever

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
bring new routers in and for whatever

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.350 
bring new routers in and for whatever
reason<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:23.039> goes<00:05:23.490> higher<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:23.759> higher<00:05:24.240> and

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
reason it goes higher and higher and

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.510 
reason it goes higher and higher and
higher<00:05:24.449> I'm<00:05:25.110> gonna<00:05:25.470> freeze<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:25.949> screen<00:05:26.340> just

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
higher I'm gonna freeze the screen just

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.279 
higher I'm gonna freeze the screen just
for<00:05:26.699> a<00:05:26.759> moment<00:05:26.880> here's<00:05:27.720> what<00:05:27.870> we<00:05:27.960> could<00:05:28.110> do

gonna make sure they all get an enter
there's<00:06:40.290> nobody<00:06:40.530> waiting<00:06:40.890> on<00:06:41.100> me<00:06:41.280> and<00:06:41.580> that

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
there's nobody waiting on me and that

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.060 
there's nobody waiting on me and that
indeed<00:06:42.090> was<00:06:42.360> the<00:06:42.510> case<00:06:42.720> and<00:06:43.050> the<00:06:43.620> secret<00:06:43.950> is

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
indeed was the case and the secret is

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.970 
indeed was the case and the secret is
don't<00:06:44.400> leave<00:06:44.790> these<00:06:45.060> routers<00:06:45.390> waiting<00:06:46.380> for<00:06:46.950> a

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
don't leave these routers waiting for a

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.460 
don't leave these routers waiting for a
prompt<00:06:47.610> in<00:06:47.820> from<00:06:48.420> the<00:06:48.510> user<00:06:48.690> and<00:06:49.050> that<00:06:49.350> was

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
prompt in from the user and that was

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.440 
prompt in from the user and that was
bringing<00:06:49.710> the<00:06:49.920> CPU<00:06:50.310> really<00:06:50.580> high<00:06:50.730> so<00:06:51.270> now

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
bringing the CPU really high so now

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.120 
bringing the CPU really high so now
we've<00:06:51.870> got<00:06:52.080> five<00:06:52.380> routers<00:06:52.800> they're<00:06:53.010> all

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
we've got five routers they're all

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.000 
we've got five routers they're all
running<00:06:53.520> they're<00:06:53.820> all<00:06:53.910> active<00:06:54.330> and<00:06:54.680> my<00:06:55.680> CP

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
running they're all active and my CP

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.670 
running they're all active and my CP
utilization<00:06:56.610> is<00:06:56.930> under<00:06:57.930> 10%

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
utilization is under 10%

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.410 
utilization is under 10%
so<00:06:58.890> in<00:06:59.040> this<00:06:59.130> environment<00:06:59.460> I've<00:07:00.030> got<00:07:00.210> a<00:07:00.240> pretty

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
so in this environment I've got a pretty

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.270 
so in this environment I've got a pretty
hefty<00:07:00.660> machine<00:07:01.080> that<00:07:01.290> being<00:07:01.560> the<00:07:01.740> case<00:07:01.980> I

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
hefty machine that being the case I

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.910 
hefty machine that being the case I
could<00:07:02.610> probably<00:07:02.880> put<00:07:03.090> 30<00:07:03.420> routers<00:07:04.230> on<00:07:04.530> this

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
could probably put 30 routers on this

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.280 
could probably put 30 routers on this
topology<00:07:05.130> and<00:07:05.790> have<00:07:06.240> them<00:07:06.450> all<00:07:06.600> working<00:07:06.870> and

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
topology and have them all working and

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.780 
topology and have them all working and
still<00:07:07.560> be<00:07:07.860> in<00:07:07.950> fine<00:07:08.220> shape

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:08.790 
still be in fine shape

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.360 
still be in fine shape
so<00:07:09.240> my<00:07:09.390> friends<00:07:09.810> in<00:07:10.080> this<00:07:10.290> micro<00:07:10.950> nugget<00:07:11.220> we've

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
so my friends in this micro nugget we've

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.580 
so my friends in this micro nugget we've
taken<00:07:11.580> a<00:07:11.700> look<00:07:11.790> specifically<00:07:12.450> at<00:07:12.720> how<00:07:13.530> to

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
taken a look specifically at how to

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.090 
taken a look specifically at how to
reduce<00:07:14.070> the<00:07:14.670> overhead<00:07:15.300> of<00:07:15.740> gns3

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 
reduce the overhead of gns3

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.540 
reduce the overhead of gns3
by<00:07:17.550> simply<00:07:18.030> modifying<00:07:18.360> or<00:07:18.930> tweaking<00:07:19.440> the<00:07:20.070> idle

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.550 
by simply modifying or tweaking the idle

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.820 
by simply modifying or tweaking the idle
PC<00:07:20.910> value<00:07:21.240> I<00:07:21.470> hope<00:07:22.470> this<00:07:22.620> has<00:07:22.800> been

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
PC value I hope this has been

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.530 
PC value I hope this has been
