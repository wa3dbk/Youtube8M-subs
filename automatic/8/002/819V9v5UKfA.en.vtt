hello<00:00:05.109> let's<00:00:05.920> talk<00:00:06.130> about<00:00:06.279> successive

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.090 
hello let's talk about successive

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.299 
hello let's talk about successive
division<00:00:07.509> today<00:00:07.769> successive<00:00:08.769> division<00:00:09.190> is

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
division today successive division is

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.550 
division today successive division is
part<00:00:09.940> of<00:00:10.059> numbers<00:00:10.480> but<00:00:11.019> it<00:00:11.170> is<00:00:11.290> a<00:00:11.320> typical

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:11.560 
part of numbers but it is a typical

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.970 
part of numbers but it is a typical
application<00:00:11.980> of<00:00:12.610> the<00:00:13.030> division<00:00:13.600> algorithm

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
application of the division algorithm

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.589 
application of the division algorithm
when<00:00:14.980> a<00:00:15.220> number<00:00:15.550> is<00:00:15.700> divided<00:00:16.240> by<00:00:16.390> another

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
when a number is divided by another

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.870 
when a number is divided by another
number<00:00:16.869> and<00:00:17.199> then<00:00:17.590> whatever<00:00:17.920> the<00:00:18.160> quotient<00:00:18.699> is

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
number and then whatever the quotient is

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.790 
number and then whatever the quotient is
again<00:00:19.269> divided<00:00:19.599> so<00:00:20.230> let's<00:00:20.439> look<00:00:20.560> at<00:00:20.710> the

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
again divided so let's look at the

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.069 
again divided so let's look at the
division<00:00:21.249> algorithm<00:00:21.579> first<00:00:21.970> dividend<00:00:22.929> is

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:23.079 
division algorithm first dividend is

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.679 
division algorithm first dividend is
equal<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.679> divisor<00:00:24.070> into<00:00:24.849> quotient<00:00:25.239> plus<00:00:25.570> the

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
equal to divisor into quotient plus the

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.079 
equal to divisor into quotient plus the
remainder<00:00:25.839> so<00:00:26.409> how<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:27.099> successive<00:00:27.759> division

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:28.089 
remainder so how the successive division

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.839 
remainder so how the successive division
happened<00:00:28.419> let's<00:00:29.169> look<00:00:29.319> at<00:00:29.439> this<00:00:29.649> the<00:00:30.399> dividend

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
happened let's look at this the dividend

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.780 
happened let's look at this the dividend
is<00:00:30.999> divided<00:00:31.630> by<00:00:31.749> the<00:00:31.810> first<00:00:32.169> divisor<00:00:32.710> we<00:00:33.610> get<00:00:33.760> a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
is divided by the first divisor we get a

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.340 
is divided by the first divisor we get a
remainder<00:00:34.090> and<00:00:34.420> we<00:00:34.600> get<00:00:34.720> a<00:00:34.750> quotient

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
remainder and we get a quotient

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.170 
remainder and we get a quotient
now<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.680> quotient<00:00:36.250> becomes<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:37.000> next

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
now the quotient becomes the next

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.420 
now the quotient becomes the next
dividend<00:00:37.660> and<00:00:37.750> we<00:00:38.230> have<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.440> new<00:00:39.010> divider

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
dividend and we have a new divider

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.029 
dividend and we have a new divider
coming<00:00:39.850> in<00:00:40.000> so<00:00:40.600> new<00:00:40.809> divisor<00:00:41.170> divides<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.890> new

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
coming in so new divisor divides the new

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.000 
coming in so new divisor divides the new
quotient<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.840> gives<00:00:43.840> us<00:00:43.989> another<00:00:44.320> quotient

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
quotient and gives us another quotient

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.979 
quotient and gives us another quotient
now<00:00:45.340> this<00:00:45.519> another<00:00:45.879> quotient<00:00:46.449> goes<00:00:46.660> further

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
now this another quotient goes further

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.169 
now this another quotient goes further
and<00:00:47.350> get<00:00:47.590> divided<00:00:47.920> by<00:00:48.039> a<00:00:48.070> third<00:00:48.460> divisor<00:00:48.820> so

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
and get divided by a third divisor so

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.840 
and get divided by a third divisor so
this<00:00:49.929> is<00:00:50.140> how<00:00:50.350> successive<00:00:51.129> division<00:00:51.489> happens

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
this is how successive division happens

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.360 
this is how successive division happens
let's<00:00:52.510> look<00:00:52.660> at<00:00:52.780> how<00:00:53.019> it<00:00:53.320> is<00:00:53.589> put<00:00:53.829> into<00:00:54.100> a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
let's look at how it is put into a

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.419 
let's look at how it is put into a
formula<00:00:55.170> let's<00:00:56.170> work<00:00:56.710> backwards

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
formula let's work backwards

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.700 
formula let's work backwards
the<00:00:57.969> last<00:00:58.300> division<00:00:58.870> first<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.499> last

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
the last division first the last

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.369 
the last division first the last
division<00:01:00.100> is<00:01:00.219> divisive<00:01:00.850> 3<00:01:01.300> into<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.079> quotient

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
division is divisive 3 into the quotient

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.100 
division is divisive 3 into the quotient
3<00:01:02.890> plus<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.519> remainder<00:01:03.820> 3<00:01:04.180> now<00:01:04.600> this<00:01:04.809> becomes

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
3 plus the remainder 3 now this becomes

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.220 
3 plus the remainder 3 now this becomes
the<00:01:05.290> innermost<00:01:05.560> portion<00:01:05.980> this<00:01:06.850> becomes<00:01:07.750> the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
the innermost portion this becomes the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.600 
the innermost portion this becomes the
next<00:01:08.800> quotient<00:01:09.760> so<00:01:10.300> next<00:01:10.510> question<00:01:10.990> x<00:01:11.710> divisor

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
next quotient so next question x divisor

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.210 
next quotient so next question x divisor
2<00:01:12.940> plus<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:13.660> remainder<00:01:13.960> 2<00:01:14.290> now<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:14.890> becomes

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
2 plus the remainder 2 now this becomes

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.440 
2 plus the remainder 2 now this becomes
the<00:01:15.370> first<00:01:15.760> quotient

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
the first quotient

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.510 
the first quotient
then<00:01:16.960> it<00:01:17.350> is<00:01:17.530> multiplied<00:01:17.950> by<00:01:17.980> the<00:01:18.160> first

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
then it is multiplied by the first

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.400 
then it is multiplied by the first
divisor<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.330> first<00:01:19.570> remainder<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:20.110> added

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
divisor and the first remainder is added

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.140 
divisor and the first remainder is added
so<00:01:20.590> this<00:01:21.070> is<00:01:21.220> how<00:01:21.370> we<00:01:21.430> get<00:01:21.730> the<00:01:21.880> original

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
so this is how we get the original

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.810 
so this is how we get the original
number<00:01:22.560> let's<00:01:23.560> look<00:01:23.740> at<00:01:23.860> a<00:01:23.890> question<00:01:24.430> how

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
number let's look at a question how

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.200 
number let's look at a question how

let's divide it the number becomes 3 30

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.780 
let's divide it the number becomes 3 30
60<00:03:41.150> plus<00:03:41.509> 270<00:03:42.109> and<00:03:42.290> if<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.769> divide<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.159> by<00:03:43.189> 21

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
60 plus 270 and if you divide it by 21

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.780 
60 plus 270 and if you divide it by 21
we<00:03:44.060> see<00:03:44.209> that<00:03:44.359> 336<00:03:45.259> is<00:03:45.439> completely<00:03:45.979> divided<00:03:46.250> it

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
we see that 336 is completely divided it

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.610 
we see that 336 is completely divided it
is<00:03:46.939> only<00:03:47.150> 270<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:47.989> we<00:03:48.139> should<00:03:48.290> be<00:03:48.379> worried

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
is only 270 that we should be worried

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.030 
is only 270 that we should be worried
about

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
about

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.969 
about

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:51.979 
which gives us a remainder of 18 so we

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:55.119 
which gives us a remainder of 18 so we
get<00:03:52.189> the<00:03:52.579> answer<00:03:52.909> is<00:03:53.060> 18<00:03:53.439> how<00:03:54.439> do<00:03:54.500> we<00:03:54.709> solve<00:03:54.949> it

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
get the answer is 18 how do we solve it

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.179 
get the answer is 18 how do we solve it

write all the divisors 8 7 6 on the top

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.809 
write all the divisors 8 7 6 on the top
row<00:04:05.689> and<00:04:05.900> we<00:04:06.349> have<00:04:06.469> write<00:04:06.680> all<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:07.310> remainders

in<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:08.150> bottom<00:04:08.419> row<00:04:08.569> which<00:04:08.689> is<00:04:08.719> 6<00:04:09.049> 5<00:04:09.229> 4<00:04:09.500> now<00:04:10.370> let

in the bottom row which is 6 5 4 now let

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.009 
in the bottom row which is 6 5 4 now let
us<00:04:10.609> have<00:04:10.729> a<00:04:10.819> look<00:04:11.000> there<00:04:11.509> are<00:04:11.629> some<00:04:11.810> blue

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
us have a look there are some blue

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.839 
us have a look there are some blue
arrows<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:12.530> there<00:04:12.650> are<00:04:12.739> some<00:04:12.859> red<00:04:13.039> arrows<00:04:13.340> now

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
arrows and there are some red arrows now

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.580 
arrows and there are some red arrows now
the<00:04:13.909> blue<00:04:14.209> arrows<00:04:14.569> suggest<00:04:15.139> we<00:04:15.319> have<00:04:15.439> to

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
the blue arrows suggest we have to

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.009 
the blue arrows suggest we have to
multiply<00:04:15.909> whereas<00:04:16.909> the<00:04:17.120> red<00:04:17.299> arrows<00:04:17.630> suggest

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
multiply whereas the red arrows suggest

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.319 
multiply whereas the red arrows suggest
we<00:04:18.169> have<00:04:18.289> to<00:04:18.440> add<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:19.280> when<00:04:19.430> we<00:04:19.549> multiply<00:04:19.729> the

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
we have to add so when we multiply the

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.480 
we have to add so when we multiply the
last<00:04:20.659> 2<00:04:20.900> remainder<00:04:21.320> which<00:04:21.469> is<00:04:21.620> for<00:04:21.889> by<00:04:22.430> the

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
last 2 remainder which is for by the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.990 
last 2 remainder which is for by the
previous<00:04:23.060> divisor<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:23.870> 4<00:04:24.349> into<00:04:24.710> 7<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.219> then<00:04:25.820> we

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
previous divisor so 4 into 7 and then we

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.240 
previous divisor so 4 into 7 and then we
add<00:04:26.270> 5<00:04:26.779> to<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:26.990> number<00:04:27.289> so<00:04:27.409> four<00:04:27.770> sevens<00:04:28.130> are

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
add 5 to that number so four sevens are

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.230 
add 5 to that number so four sevens are
28<00:04:28.669> +<00:04:28.940> 5

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
28 + 5

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.529 
28 + 5
gives<00:04:29.630> us<00:04:29.780> third-degree<00:04:30.080> now<00:04:30.860> 33<00:04:31.460> is<00:04:31.759> then

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
gives us third-degree now 33 is then

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.870 
gives us third-degree now 33 is then
multiplied<00:04:33.050> by<00:04:33.289> the<00:04:33.349> previous<00:04:33.800> divisor<00:04:34.069> so<00:04:34.340> 33

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
multiplied by the previous divisor so 33

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.950 
multiplied by the previous divisor so 33
into<00:04:35.000> 8<00:04:35.360> plus<00:04:36.229> 6<00:04:36.830> now<00:04:37.370> 33<00:04:37.880> into<00:04:38.000> 8<00:04:38.210> plus<00:04:38.449> 6<00:04:38.720> will

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
into 8 plus 6 now 33 into 8 plus 6 will

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.499 
into 8 plus 6 now 33 into 8 plus 6 will
give<00:04:39.110> us<00:04:39.259> 270<00:04:39.919> so<00:04:40.400> this<00:04:40.639> is<00:04:40.819> how<00:04:40.970> we<00:04:41.030> get<00:04:41.389> the

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
give us 270 so this is how we get the

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.719 
give us 270 so this is how we get the
remainder<00:04:41.930> if<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.620> look<00:04:42.830> closely<00:04:43.130> we<00:04:43.639> are

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
remainder if you look closely we are

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.550 
remainder if you look closely we are
only<00:04:43.940> bothered<00:04:44.330> about<00:04:44.630> remainder<00:04:45.259> in<00:04:45.440> the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
only bothered about remainder in the

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.870 
only bothered about remainder in the
both<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.860> questions<00:04:46.370> that<00:04:46.460> you<00:04:46.610> have<00:04:46.699> tackled

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
both the questions that you have tackled

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.719 
both the questions that you have tackled
so<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.810> is<00:04:47.930> not<00:04:48.199> the<00:04:48.440> quotient<00:04:48.949> or<00:04:49.099> the<00:04:49.400> divisor

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
so it is not the quotient or the divisor

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.430 
so it is not the quotient or the divisor
that<00:04:49.880> we<00:04:50.180> are<00:04:50.270> more<00:04:50.509> bothered<00:04:50.690> about<00:04:50.930> we<00:04:51.349> are

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
that we are more bothered about we are

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.409 
that we are more bothered about we are
more<00:04:51.650> bothered<00:04:51.979> about<00:04:52.069> the<00:04:52.340> remainder<00:04:52.610> which

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
more bothered about the remainder which

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.589 
more bothered about the remainder which
is<00:04:53.660> easily<00:04:54.169> found<00:04:54.500> out<00:04:54.710> by<00:04:55.130> this<00:04:55.190> small<00:04:55.819> method

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
is easily found out by this small method

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.230 
is easily found out by this small method
and<00:04:56.780> an<00:04:57.139> easy<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.680> calculate<00:04:57.889> so<00:04:58.729> let's<00:04:58.940> use

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
and an easy to calculate so let's use

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.939 
and an easy to calculate so let's use
this<00:04:59.479> in<00:04:59.720> finding<00:05:00.110> more<00:05:00.289> remainders<00:05:00.800> in

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
this in finding more remainders in

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.090 
this in finding more remainders in
successive<00:05:01.520> division
