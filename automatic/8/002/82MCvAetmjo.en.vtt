00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.270 
you both need to hit those two buttons
those<00:01:33.210> two<00:01:33.360> locations<00:01:33.750> at<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.620> exact<00:01:35.070> same

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
those two locations at the exact same

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.920 
those two locations at the exact same
time<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.700> can't<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.210> mean<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.630> literally

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
time and it can't be I mean it literally

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.020 
time and it can't be I mean it literally
has<00:01:37.230> to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.710> exact<00:01:38.280> same<00:01:38.520> time<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.790> had

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
has to be the exact same time I had

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.850 
has to be the exact same time I had
quite<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> trouble<00:01:40.170> doing<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.530> at

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
quite a lot of trouble doing this at

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.370 
quite a lot of trouble doing this at
first<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.180> buddy<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.479> found<00:01:43.050> that<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
first with my buddy I found that the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.290 
first with my buddy I found that the
best<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.520> pick<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.030> time

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
best way to do this was to pick a time

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.590 
best way to do this was to pick a time
on<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.229> counter<00:01:46.800> so<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:47.880> instance<00:01:47.940> we

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
on the the counter so for instance we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.860 
on the the counter so for instance we
would<00:01:48.750> say<00:01:48.930> okay<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.710> 49<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.940> know<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.180> 4930

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
would say okay so at 49 you know up 4930

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.969 
would say okay so at 49 you know up 4930
we're<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> hit<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.440> at<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.590> same<00:01:52.770> time

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
we're going to hit it at the same time

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.469 
we're going to hit it at the same time
and<00:01:53.190> then<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.400> we'd<00:01:53.729> wait<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.090> counter<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and then so we'd wait for the counter to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.480 
and then so we'd wait for the counter to
get<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.690> 49<00:01:55.020> 30<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.409> both<00:01:55.620> hit<00:01:55.830> it<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.370> if

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
get to 49 30 and we both hit it see if

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.980 
get to 49 30 and we both hit it see if
you<00:01:56.549> hit<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.909> wrong<00:01:57.000> time<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.750> sound

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
you hit it at the wrong time this sound

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.310 
you hit it at the wrong time this sound
appears

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.899 

but<00:02:02.320> if<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.649> both<00:02:02.799> hit<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.100> at<00:02:03.219> the<00:02:03.340> exact<00:02:03.670> same

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
but if you both hit it at the exact same

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.880 
but if you both hit it at the exact same
time<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.659> actually<00:02:04.840> works<00:02:05.409> then<00:02:05.770> you'll

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
time and it actually works then you'll

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.469 
time and it actually works then you'll
hear<00:02:06.039> this<00:02:06.219> sound

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.990

Island I don't know how that didn't kick
off<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.800> idea<00:03:04.670> there<00:03:04.910> would<00:03:04.970> be<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.120> dinosaur

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
off the idea there would be a dinosaur

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.570 
off the idea there would be a dinosaur
on<00:03:05.750> here<00:03:05.900> somewhere<00:03:06.290> but<00:03:06.500> we<00:03:07.069> did<00:03:07.190> go<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.459> see

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
on here somewhere but we did go and see

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.190
