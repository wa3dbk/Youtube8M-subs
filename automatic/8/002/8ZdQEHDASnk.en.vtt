that's<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.560> nutrient<00:00:23.039> thing<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
that's a nutrient thing this is the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.080 
that's a nutrient thing this is the
let's<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.599> Bibb<00:00:28.199> lettuce<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.340> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
let's see this Bibb lettuce here and a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.849 
let's see this Bibb lettuce here and a
couple<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.480> these<00:00:30.599> leaves<00:00:30.810> I've<00:00:31.109> noticed<00:00:31.529> Bibb

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
couple of these leaves I've noticed Bibb

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.440 
couple of these leaves I've noticed Bibb
lettuce<00:00:32.130> really<00:00:32.669> doesn't<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> be

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
lettuce really doesn't like to be

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.500 
lettuce really doesn't like to be
crowded<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> does<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.850> crowded<00:00:36.239> in

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
crowded and if it does get crowded in

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.889 
crowded and if it does get crowded in
the<00:00:36.600> leaves<00:00:36.870> lay<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.620> each<00:00:37.800> other<00:00:38.210> they'll<00:00:39.210> get

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the leaves lay on each other they'll get

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.130 
the leaves lay on each other they'll get
this<00:00:40.110> kind<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.500> funky<00:00:40.950> nasty<00:00:41.460> looking<00:00:42.140> stuff

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
this kind of funky nasty looking stuff

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.529 
this kind of funky nasty looking stuff
on<00:00:43.350> them<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.860> Bibb<00:00:44.610> lettuce<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.090> think<00:00:45.120> needs<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
on them so Bibb lettuce I think needs to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.630 
on them so Bibb lettuce I think needs to
be<00:00:45.600> spaced<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.410> bit<00:00:46.530> more<00:00:46.710> ate<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> bunch

hundred and nine of them out here let me
show<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.659> couple<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.260> quick<00:01:13.799> things

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.670 
show you a couple of little quick things
that<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.580> discovered<00:01:15.060> I'm<00:01:15.500> painting<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
that I discovered I'm painting the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
that I discovered I'm painting the
buckets<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.460> prevents<00:01:18.000> light<00:01:18.210> pruning<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
buckets it prevents light pruning of the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
buckets it prevents light pruning of the
roots<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> also<00:01:19.850> camouflages<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.180> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
roots but it also camouflages it so I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.120 
roots but it also camouflages it so I
get<00:01:21.479> less<00:01:21.810> black<00:01:22.259> from<00:01:22.619> my<00:01:22.740> Neighborhood

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
get less black from my Neighborhood

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.240 
get less black from my Neighborhood
Association<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> found<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:25.830> when<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
Association and what I found was when I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.060 
Association and what I found was when I
paint<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.729> bucket<00:01:27.350> just<00:01:28.350> after<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> paint<00:01:28.950> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
paint a bucket just after the paint is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.710 
paint a bucket just after the paint is
set<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.640> bit<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.119> take<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> pencil

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
set up a little bit I can take a pencil

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.270 
set up a little bit I can take a pencil
and<00:01:31.189> just<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.180> scratch<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.290> paint<00:01:34.920> so

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and just it will scratch the paint so

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.890 
and just it will scratch the paint so
the<00:01:35.400> white<00:01:35.579> bucket<00:01:35.820> shines<00:01:36.299> through<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the white bucket shines through and I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.719 
the white bucket shines through and I
can<00:01:37.079> write<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.500> bucket<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.610> I've

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
can write on the bucket what I've

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.539 
can write on the bucket what I've
planted<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> real<00:01:40.020> easy<00:01:40.049> way<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
planted and that's a real easy way to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.249 
planted and that's a real easy way to
mark<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:42.000> bucket<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:43.020> what's

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
mark your bucket so that you know what's

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.139 
mark your bucket so that you know what's
in<00:01:43.470> them<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
in them and then you can just do it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.929 
in them and then you can just do it
again<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.570> again<00:01:45.810> each<00:01:45.990> year<00:01:46.430> peas<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.759> got

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
again and again each year peas have got

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.840

carry their nutrients up to the plant so

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.720 
carry their nutrients up to the plant so
I<00:02:20.040> added<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.510> my<00:02:21.510> little<00:02:21.960> teeny<00:02:22.380> tiny

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
I added that my little teeny tiny

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.540 
I added that my little teeny tiny
tomatoes<00:02:23.730> from<00:02:24.000> seed<00:02:24.440> think<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.770> see<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
tomatoes from seed think you can see a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.660 
tomatoes from seed think you can see a
couple<00:02:27.300> little<00:02:27.630> plants<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.350> stuck<00:02:28.650> three<00:02:29.070> about

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
couple little plants I stuck three about

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.380 
couple little plants I stuck three about
three<00:02:30.000> seeds<00:02:30.650> per<00:02:31.650> bucket<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.400> my<00:02:33.120> thought

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
three seeds per bucket and my thought

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.850 
three seeds per bucket and my thought
was<00:02:33.830> if<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:35.070> work<00:02:35.340> great<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:37.320> just<00:02:37.590> take

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
was if they work great I can just take

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.340 
was if they work great I can just take
my<00:02:37.890> scissors<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.060> trim<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.230> I'm

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
now I had wanted to learn how to bend

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.300 
now I had wanted to learn how to bend
electrical<00:03:32.760> conduit<00:03:33.269> anyway<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.010> went<00:03:35.220> on

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
electrical conduit anyway so I went on

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.350 
electrical conduit anyway so I went on
YouTube<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.989> downloaded<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:38.120> couple<00:03:39.120> of

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.570 
I went and I bought this stuff you can
use<00:03:44.370> PVC<00:03:45.180> pipe<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:46.440> electrical<00:03:47.040> conduit

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
use PVC pipe the electrical conduit

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.490 
use PVC pipe the electrical conduit
allows<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.299> go<00:03:48.450> more<00:03:48.660> straight<00:03:49.110> up<00:03:49.140> and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
allows you to go more straight up and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.190 
allows you to go more straight up and
over<00:03:49.920> where<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.760> PVC<00:03:51.269> pipe<00:03:51.540> will<00:03:51.840> just<00:03:52.019> be<00:03:52.170> a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
over where the PVC pipe will just be a

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.920 
over where the PVC pipe will just be a
smooth<00:03:52.590> arc<00:03:52.950> but<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.820> just<00:03:54.060> took<00:03:54.209> my<00:03:54.269> drill<00:03:54.720> bit

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
smooth arc but I just took my drill bit

do the square foot beds you can just

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.860 
do the square foot beds you can just
build<00:05:00.700> one<00:05:00.970> this<00:05:01.090> one<00:05:01.270> I<00:05:01.300> still<00:05:01.419> have<00:05:01.750> the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
build one this one I still have the

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.150 
build one this one I still have the
plastic<00:05:02.440> over<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:03.330> but<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.900> conduit<00:05:05.500> comes<00:05:05.860> in

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
plastic over it but the conduit comes in

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.110 
plastic over it but the conduit comes in
10<00:05:06.490> foot<00:05:06.820> sticks<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:08.680> you<00:05:08.710> can<00:05:09.100> just<00:05:09.370> build<00:05:09.970> a

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
10 foot sticks so you can just build a

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.290 
10 foot sticks so you can just build a
little<00:05:10.410> 4x4<00:05:11.410> frame<00:05:11.830> out<00:05:12.250> of<00:05:12.430> two<00:05:12.550> by<00:05:12.700> twos<00:05:12.970> that

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
little 4x4 frame out of two by twos that

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.320 
little 4x4 frame out of two by twos that
will<00:05:13.480> set<00:05:13.750> right<00:05:13.780> down<00:05:14.050> on<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.470> ground<00:05:14.770> and

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
will set right down on the ground and

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.570 
will set right down on the ground and
then<00:05:16.330> Bend<00:05:16.990> your<00:05:17.230> 10<00:05:17.440> foot<00:05:17.740> stick<00:05:18.160> this<00:05:18.400> is

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
then Bend your 10 foot stick this is

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.650 
then Bend your 10 foot stick this is
actually<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.950> think<00:05:20.950> it's<00:05:21.220> 36<00:05:21.910> inches<00:05:22.150> high<00:05:22.630> so

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
actually I think it's 36 inches high so

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.750 
actually I think it's 36 inches high so
there's<00:05:23.140> plenty<00:05:23.470> of<00:05:23.740> room<00:05:23.979> under<00:05:24.340> there<00:05:24.580> and

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
there's plenty of room under there and

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.030 
there's plenty of room under there and
you<00:05:25.330> don't<00:05:25.570> even<00:05:25.720> have<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:26.320> hinge<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:26.890> or

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
you don't even have to hinge it or

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.300 
you don't even have to hinge it or
attach<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:27.760> a<00:05:27.790> 4<00:05:28.150> by<00:05:28.300> 4<00:05:28.330> foot<00:05:28.930> bed<00:05:29.320> so<00:05:30.190> that's

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
attach it to a 4 by 4 foot bed so that's

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.659 
attach it to a 4 by 4 foot bed so that's
a<00:05:30.520> garden<00:05:30.940> idea<00:05:31.330> for<00:05:31.720> those<00:05:31.900> of<00:05:32.169> you<00:05:32.410> who<00:05:32.710> want
