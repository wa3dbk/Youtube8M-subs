00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.100
 delicious dish here we have the pejerrey 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.560
 the only thing that stops is to pepper the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.870
 pejerrey and there I will go through flour 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.420
 in this case I have chuño to come out 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.270
 a little more crispy I will use 4 for 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.450
 make a single dish with a toothpick 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.250
 what I'm going to do is enter here 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.250
 fold it 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.920
 and put the little ball 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.920
 there is look in this way notice 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.560
 is 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.920
 ideal temperature 150 degrees so that 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.020
 crispy the tea that reigned 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.860
 I'm warmed up here 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.380
 my pan of a little oil here 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.500
 not a lot of oil I'm going to put the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.630
 carrot 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.050
 I'm going to put the yellow one and the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.050
 habit 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.880
 then the pepper 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.010
 I do not want to fry them remember if not 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.200
 only a sofrito as they say for 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.200
 let loose all its flavor 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.470
 I will add the heads of first 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.030
 the Chinese onion 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.030
 and then now only this 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.119
 not just made a little bit of sauce 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.580
 soy vinegar rice if you do not have 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.310
 rice vinegar do not worry they can 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.590
 using vinegar to take home water 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.619
 a little bit to lower the intensity of 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.340
 the soy sauce and now let's put it 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.340
 sugar 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.960
 now this what we are going to do is 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.250
 hope that the first boil is already 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.289
 starting to boil over there so that 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.269
 it is protects kings too they are already 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.580
 fried and all you have to do is 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.920
 introduce the silverside here and what 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.989
 we do is turn off our kitchen to 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.989
 first boil and let's put 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.050
 the juice 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.379
 come here we have the seeds of 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.910

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.250
 look how everything changes 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.550
 there is good here we have our 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.489
 pickled oriental fish and they 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.970
 I recommend accompanying him with an arrocito 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.970
 White 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.360
