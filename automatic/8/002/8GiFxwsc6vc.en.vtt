00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
foundation here that is amazing so I've

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.430 
foundation here that is amazing so I've
had<00:04:38.310> quite<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.910> surprising<00:04:39.360> day<00:04:39.780> really<00:04:40.260> I

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
had quite a surprising day really I

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.620 
had quite a surprising day really I
honestly<00:04:40.650> can't<00:04:41.250> believe<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.910> this<00:04:42.180> makeup

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
honestly can't believe that this makeup

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.540 
honestly can't believe that this makeup
look<00:04:42.690> is<00:04:42.990> done<00:04:43.200> without<00:04:43.350> foundation<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.520> I

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
look is done without foundation so I

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.270 
look is done without foundation so I
think<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:44.880> could<00:04:45.030> say<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:45.830> 10<00:04:46.830> minute<00:04:47.130> miracle

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
think I could say that 10 minute miracle

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.720 
think I could say that 10 minute miracle
has<00:04:47.640> done<00:04:47.820> its<00:04:48.000> job<00:04:48.200> despite<00:04:49.200> my<00:04:49.730> initial

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
has done its job despite my initial

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.150 
has done its job despite my initial
hesitation<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.930> actually<00:04:52.590> I'm<00:04:52.680> also<00:04:52.830> very

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
hesitation and actually I'm also very

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.460 
hesitation and actually I'm also very
pleased<00:04:53.550> with<00:04:53.790> what<00:04:54.390> it<00:04:54.540> does<00:04:54.720> on<00:04:54.750> my<00:04:54.990> hands<00:04:55.380> I

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
pleased with what it does on my hands I

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.980 
pleased with what it does on my hands I
must<00:04:55.890> admit<00:04:56.100> when<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.820> came<00:04:57.630> here<00:04:57.750> this<00:04:57.930> morning

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
must admit when I came here this morning

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.340 
must admit when I came here this morning
it<00:04:58.380> was<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.530> really<00:04:59.040> early<00:04:59.280> start<00:05:00.230> thanks<00:05:01.230> so

it was a really early start thanks so
late<00:05:01.560> for<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:02.630> but<00:05:03.630> it<00:05:03.750> was<00:05:03.870> dark<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.380> gloomy

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
late for that but it was dark and gloomy

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.220 
late for that but it was dark and gloomy
on<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:05.010> train<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:06.150> hadn't<00:05:06.750> really<00:05:06.990> put<00:05:07.110> any

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
on the train and I hadn't really put any

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.290 
on the train and I hadn't really put any
makeup<00:05:07.440> on<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.070> so<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.280> was<00:05:08.430> all<00:05:08.610> huddled<00:05:09.030> up<00:05:09.180> in

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
makeup on and so I was all huddled up in

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.470 
makeup on and so I was all huddled up in
my<00:05:09.450> coat<00:05:10.490> painting<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.640> bit<00:05:12.000> self-conscious

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
my coat painting a bit self-conscious

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.960 
my coat painting a bit self-conscious
actually<00:05:13.200> and<00:05:13.410> just<00:05:13.620> sort<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:13.970> uninteresting

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
actually and just sort of uninteresting

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.610 
actually and just sort of uninteresting
and<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.240> think<00:05:15.390> my<00:05:15.480> journey<00:05:15.750> home<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.410> going<00:05:16.530> to

and I think my journey home is going to

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.400 
and I think my journey home is going to
be<00:05:16.770> quite<00:05:16.980> different<00:05:17.220> really<00:05:17.730> because<00:05:18.600> now<00:05:19.380> i
