00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
attack as fast as possible you really

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.139 
attack as fast as possible you really
just<00:02:01.890> got<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.189> play<00:02:02.340> three<00:02:02.549> even<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.969> can

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
just got to play three even if you can

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.030 
just got to play three even if you can
sometimes<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.290> too<00:02:04.619> many<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.920> them

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
sometimes get you know too many of them

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.310 
sometimes get you know too many of them
from<00:02:05.490> there<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:06.000> two<00:02:06.329> bottomless<00:02:06.810> to

from there we have two bottomless to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.249 
from there we have two bottomless to
torrential<00:02:07.819> to<00:02:08.819> mirror<00:02:09.179> force<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:10.140> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
torrential to mirror force I like to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.410 
torrential to mirror force I like to
play<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.590> Tecton<00:02:10.920> breakthrough<00:02:11.370> skill<00:02:11.640> this

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
play the Tecton breakthrough skill this

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.110 
play the Tecton breakthrough skill this
is<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> car<00:02:12.810> that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
is a car that

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.430 
is a car that
I<00:02:13.150> think<00:02:13.269> it's<00:02:13.360> kind<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.599> a<00:02:13.720> little<00:02:13.870> underrated

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
I think it's kind of a little underrated

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.250 
I think it's kind of a little underrated
and<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.940> lot<00:02:16.239> of<00:02:16.269> people<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.870> think<00:02:17.080> should

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and a lot of people I think should

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.589 
and a lot of people I think should
should<00:02:17.830> really<00:02:18.159> give<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.459> chance<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.970> know

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
should really give it a chance I know

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.750 
should really give it a chance I know
people<00:02:19.720> kind<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.230> overlooked<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.280> I've

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
people kind of overlooked it and I've

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.250 
people kind of overlooked it and I've
kind<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.150> tossed<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.510> off<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.750> side<00:02:22.840> but<00:02:23.230> I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
kind of tossed it off to the side but I

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.140 
kind of tossed it off to the side but I
think<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.620> be<00:02:23.709> really<00:02:23.739> useful<00:02:23.980> especially<00:02:24.730> if

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
think can be really useful especially if

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.100 
think can be really useful especially if
you're<00:02:25.239> playing<00:02:25.390> against<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.780> deck<00:02:25.930> like
