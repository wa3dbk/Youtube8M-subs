back part of the science okay that's
what<00:00:19.700> you're<00:00:19.850> looking<00:00:19.880> at<00:00:20.150> there<00:00:20.210> then

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.410 

your<00:00:24.070> stomach<00:00:24.429> goes<00:00:24.580> forward<00:00:25.090> into<00:00:25.390> the

your stomach goes forward into the

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.140 
your stomach goes forward into the
pyloric<00:00:26.019> portion<00:00:26.439> which<00:00:26.650> is<00:00:26.769> right<00:00:27.039> there

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
pyloric portion which is right there

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.359 
pyloric portion which is right there
okay<00:00:28.150> at<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:29.050> pyloric<00:00:29.710> portion<00:00:30.160> of<00:00:30.279> the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
okay at the pyloric portion of the

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.100 
okay at the pyloric portion of the
stomach<00:00:30.609> you're<00:00:31.359> going<00:00:31.630> to<00:00:31.750> have<00:00:31.899> it

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
stomach you're going to have it

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.080 
stomach you're going to have it
squeezing<00:00:32.980> off<00:00:33.160> before<00:00:33.699> it<00:00:33.760> hits<00:00:33.940> the

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
squeezing off before it hits the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.380 
squeezing off before it hits the
intestine<00:00:34.720> and<00:00:35.460> that's<00:00:36.460> called<00:00:36.760> your<00:00:36.970> pyloric

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
intestine and that's called your pyloric

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.060 
intestine and that's called your pyloric
sphincter<00:00:37.710> harvest<00:00:38.710> being<00:00:38.949> beside

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.180 

but<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.760> right<00:00:45.060> here<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.680> inching<00:00:47.070> off

but it's right here that inching off

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.319 
but it's right here that inching off
right<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:47.940> pyloric

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
right there that's your pyloric

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.720 
right there that's your pyloric
sphincter<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:49.290> coming<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.070> pinches<00:00:50.430> off

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
sphincter it's coming it pinches off

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.010 
sphincter it's coming it pinches off
right<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.120> same<00:00:51.270> place<00:00:51.450> we<00:00:51.630> have<00:00:51.750> all<00:00:51.870> these

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
right the same place we have all these

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.530 
right the same place we have all these
long<00:00:52.650> finger<00:00:53.040> like<00:00:53.220> projections<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:54.059> either

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
long finger like projections here either

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.170 
long finger like projections here either
your<00:00:54.840> pilot's<00:00:55.440> pika<00:00:55.800> okay<00:00:56.550> that's<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.059> these

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
your pilot's pika okay that's what these

are all right here so once you are past
your<00:01:00.629> pyloric<00:01:00.989> sphincter<00:01:01.110> you're<00:01:01.440> now

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
your pyloric sphincter you're now

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.950 
your pyloric sphincter you're now
officially<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.430> intestine<00:01:02.970> and<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.840> have

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
officially in the intestine and you have

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
officially in the intestine and you have
a<00:01:03.989> lot<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.140> fatness<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.759> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
a lot of fatness we are in the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.999 
a lot of fatness we are in the
intestines<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.050> first<00:01:07.440> lucid<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
intestines and the very first lucid and

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.300 
intestines and the very first lucid and
customs<00:01:08.550> right<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.479> your<00:01:10.110> duodenum<00:01:10.590> okay

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
customs right here is your duodenum okay

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.150 
customs right here is your duodenum okay
you<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.640> how<00:01:11.759> it's<00:01:11.940> looping<00:01:12.300> yes<00:01:12.660> okay<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.440> the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
you see how it's looping yes okay in the

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.040 
you see how it's looping yes okay in the
loop<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.550> duodenum<00:01:14.880> you'll<00:01:15.570> find<00:01:15.900> your

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
loop of the duodenum you'll find your

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.590 
loop of the duodenum you'll find your
pancreas<00:01:16.530> which<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> huge<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.030> fish<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
pancreas which is huge in this fish I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
pancreas which is huge in this fish I
need<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.200> dynamics<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.800> cruise<00:01:20.039> but

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
need to go with dynamics and cruise but

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.680 
need to go with dynamics and cruise but
in<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.910> one<00:01:21.560> you'll<00:01:22.560> see<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.250> lot<00:01:24.240> smaller

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
in this one you'll see a lot smaller

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.290 
in this one you'll see a lot smaller
okay<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:26.100> pancreas<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> log<00:01:26.910> center

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
okay your pancreas is the log center

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.050 
okay your pancreas is the log center
here<00:01:27.630> or<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.110> okay<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.550> first<00:01:29.759> loop<00:01:29.940> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
here or here okay in the first loop of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.120 
here or here okay in the first loop of
the<00:01:30.119> door<00:01:30.300> actually<00:01:31.170> sorry

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.190 

then<00:01:35.130> we're<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.450> educate<00:01:36.990> your

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
then we're going to educate your

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.170 
then we're going to educate your
intentions<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> female<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.880> anus

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
intentions in the female out your anus

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.740 
intentions in the female out your anus
and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.710> urine<00:01:41.429> and<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.000> egg<00:01:42.149> come<00:01:42.539> out

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and then the urine and the egg come out

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.990 
and then the urine and the egg come out
the<00:01:42.899> eurozone<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:44.280> managed<00:01:44.789> by<00:01:44.969> the
