00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:06.609 
all right now I've run into this problem

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.459 
all right now I've run into this problem
where<00:00:07.599> I<00:00:08.080> upgraded<00:00:08.769> from<00:00:09.400> Windows<00:00:09.820> Vista

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
where I upgraded from Windows Vista

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.970 
where I upgraded from Windows Vista
64-bit<00:00:11.469> to<00:00:11.830> Windows<00:00:12.309> 7<00:00:12.670> 64<00:00:12.879> bit

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.000 

I<00:00:16.070> did<00:00:16.609> a<00:00:16.670> clean<00:00:16.910> install<00:00:17.330> beforehand<00:00:18.140> my<00:00:18.410> my

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
I did a clean install beforehand my my

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.090 
I did a clean install beforehand my my
fingerprint<00:00:19.580> utility<00:00:19.880> worked<00:00:20.060> just<00:00:20.240> fine

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.230 

now

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.910 

let's<00:00:28.750> see<00:00:29.080> if<00:00:29.199> if<00:00:29.650> I<00:00:29.769> get<00:00:29.949> this<00:00:30.070> error

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.819 

yeah<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:36.630> guessing<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.290> most<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.739> you

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
yeah and I'm guessing that most of you

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.440 
yeah and I'm guessing that most of you
are<00:00:37.860> getting<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> same<00:00:38.489> thing

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
are getting the same thing

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:51.110 
are getting the same thing
a<00:00:40.680> very<00:00:41.680> simple<00:00:41.950> way<00:00:42.130> to<00:00:42.190> fix<00:00:42.460> this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.540 

if<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.900> is<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.350> driver<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.490> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
if this is the driver that you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.220 
if this is the driver that you
downloaded<00:00:54.060> you're<00:00:54.360> having<00:00:54.600> much<00:00:54.750> problems

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
downloaded you're having much problems

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560 
downloaded you're having much problems
with<00:00:55.380> that<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.680> got<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.010> from<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.940> Shiva

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
with that you got it from the Shiva

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.380 
with that you got it from the Shiva
website<00:00:57.960> itself<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.530> new<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.890> for

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
website itself the new one for

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.950 
website itself the new one for
any<00:01:00.929> new<00:01:01.199> laptop<00:01:01.710> any<00:01:02.039> upgrade<00:01:02.429> for<00:01:02.640> Windows<00:01:02.940> 7

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.070 

what<00:01:06.560> happens<00:01:06.979> is<00:01:07.190> somewhere<00:01:07.790> on<00:01:08.240> your<00:01:08.659> system

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
what happens is somewhere on your system

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.630 
what happens is somewhere on your system
that<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:09.350> know<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.040> thought<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.340> cleaned

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
that you know you thought you cleaned

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.450 
that you know you thought you cleaned
out<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:11.060> still<00:01:11.240> have<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.740> safe<00:01:12.740> fingerprints

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
out you still have a safe fingerprints

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.600 
out you still have a safe fingerprints
and<00:01:13.810> when<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:14.900> log<00:01:15.170> on<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:15.680> try<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.130> enroll

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
and when you log on you try to enroll

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.060 
and when you log on you try to enroll
new<00:01:16.790> fingerprints<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:18.560> already<00:01:18.800> have<00:01:18.950> them

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
new fingerprints you already have them

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.730 
new fingerprints you already have them
on<00:01:19.220> there<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:19.670> can't<00:01:19.909> save<00:01:20.150> them<00:01:20.560> so<00:01:21.560> what

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
on there so it can't save them so what

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.020 
on there so it can't save them so what
you<00:01:21.830> need<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.040> do<00:01:22.220> is<00:01:22.430> you<00:01:22.640> need<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:22.790> come<00:01:23.000> over

of you never saw before click on

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.340 
of you never saw before click on
biometric<00:01:31.570> devices<00:01:32.789> actually<00:01:33.789> hold<00:01:34.329> on

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
biometric devices actually hold on

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.630 
biometric devices actually hold on
haha

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.910

you'll<00:01:43.750> see<00:01:43.950> change<00:01:44.950> biometric<00:01:45.759> settings<00:01:46.150> go

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
you'll see change biometric settings go

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.700 
you'll see change biometric settings go
ahead<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:46.659> go<00:01:46.750> over<00:01:46.780> here<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:48.930> if<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.560> click

all information from

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.200 
all information from
previous<00:01:59.320> fingerprint<00:01:59.860> enrollments<00:02:00.400> so<00:02:01.060> go

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
previous fingerprint enrollments so go

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.260 
previous fingerprint enrollments so go
ahead<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:01.420> turn<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.630> off<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.170> save<00:02:02.740> it<00:02:03.270> go

allow users to log on windows using
their<00:02:10.240> fingerprints<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.360> see<00:02:13.600> you're

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
their fingerprints now you see you're

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.980 
their fingerprints now you see you're
not<00:02:13.900> enrolled

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.900
