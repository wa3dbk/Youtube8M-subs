00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.580 
bring up their children to do the same
thing<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:33.940> it's<00:02:34.270> all<00:02:34.420> rich<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.870> no<00:02:34.990> vomit<00:02:35.380> it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.289 
thing so it's all rich and no vomit it
never<00:02:35.860> gets<00:02:36.070> there

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.589 

and<00:02:40.299> so<00:02:41.340> therefore<00:02:42.340> it's<00:02:42.849> so<00:02:43.030> important

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
and so therefore it's so important

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.929 
and so therefore it's so important
instead<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:44.260> question<00:02:44.709> what<00:02:45.610> do<00:02:45.819> I

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
instead of this question what do I

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.360 
instead of this question what do I
desire
