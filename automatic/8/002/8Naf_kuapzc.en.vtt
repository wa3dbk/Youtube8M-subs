actual<00:04:18.799> fact<00:04:18.859> everyone<00:04:19.549> just<00:04:19.730> left<00:04:19.910> and

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
actual fact everyone just left and

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.800 
actual fact everyone just left and
I<00:04:20.840> couldn't<00:04:21.530> do<00:04:21.650> anything<00:04:22.000> yeah<00:04:23.000> I<00:04:23.240> am<00:04:23.420> spawn

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
I couldn't do anything yeah I am spawn

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.710 
I couldn't do anything yeah I am spawn
raping<00:04:24.260> them<00:04:24.410> I<00:04:24.560> am<00:04:24.710> killing<00:04:25.100> them<00:04:25.480> but<00:04:26.480> once

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
raping them I am killing them but once

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.470 
raping them I am killing them but once
you<00:04:26.960> join<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.440> game<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:28.030> think<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.180> should<00:04:29.450> be

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
you join the game I think it should be

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.170 
you join the game I think it should be
impossible<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.800> if<00:04:31.040> they<00:04:31.250> do<00:04:31.310> leave<00:04:31.850> they

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
impossible and if they do leave they

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.870 
impossible and if they do leave they
take<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.480> massive<00:04:32.990> hit<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:34.430> their<00:04:34.610> level

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
take a massive hit to their level

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.450 
take a massive hit to their level
because<00:04:35.360> once<00:04:35.570> you<00:04:35.690> join<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:35.990> game<00:04:36.290> you<00:04:37.190> should

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
because once you join a game you should

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.360 
because once you join a game you should
be<00:04:37.669> committed<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.870> stay<00:04:39.560> in<00:04:39.710> that<00:04:39.860> game<00:04:40.100> and

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
be committed to stay in that game and

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.520 
be committed to stay in that game and
the<00:04:40.880> last<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.389> final<00:04:41.510> thing<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.230> hate<00:04:42.470> about
