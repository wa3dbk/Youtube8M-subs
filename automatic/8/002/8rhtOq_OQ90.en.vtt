00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
I just thought let us think for now

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.420 
I just thought let us think for now
goodnight<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:40.829> probably<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> be

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
goodnight so it's probably going to be

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.310 
goodnight so it's probably going to be
the<00:00:41.579> easiest<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.210> start<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> back<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the easiest to start with the back of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.470 
the easiest to start with the back of
the<00:00:43.440> parking<00:00:43.829> brake<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.700> go<00:00:44.820> ahead<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.059> grab

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the parking brake so go ahead and grab

the parking brake so go ahead and grab
the<00:00:45.629> back<00:00:45.780> looks<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.950> now<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the back looks like this and now the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
the back looks like this and now the
first<00:00:47.910> thing<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.149> want<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.690> put<00:00:48.960> this

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
through and now feed that bolt through
now<00:01:36.540> later<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.020> when<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.560> fine-tune

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
now later on when we fine-tune

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.080 
now later on when we fine-tune
everything<00:01:38.189> we're<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:38.939> this

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
everything we're going to get this

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.810 
everything we're going to get this
adjusted<00:01:39.770> perfectly<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.520> go

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
adjusted perfectly but for now just go

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.609 
adjusted perfectly but for now just go
ahead<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.299> slide<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
ahead and slide it all the way to the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.950 
ahead and slide it all the way to the
top<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.850> reason<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.329> do<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
top now the reason you do this is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.319 
top now the reason you do this is
because<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.710> didn't<00:01:46.979> put<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> other<00:01:47.430> side<00:01:48.149> of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
because we didn't put the other side of

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.730 
because we didn't put the other side of
the<00:01:48.420> parking<00:01:48.720> brake<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.229> handle<00:01:49.590> side

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the parking brake on the handle side

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.859 
the parking brake on the handle side
that<00:01:49.950> goes<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> make<00:01:50.310> doing<00:01:50.579> seats<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.450> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that goes to make doing seats so in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.600 
that goes to make doing seats so in
order<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.290> make<00:01:52.409> sure<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.920> enough<00:01:53.189> cable

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
order to make sure we have enough cable

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.130 
order to make sure we have enough cable
we<00:01:54.030> want<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> get<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.689> loose<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.049> possible

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
we want to get this as loose as possible

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
we want to get this as loose as possible
before<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.100> make<00:01:56.250> any<00:01:56.460> adjustments<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.000> for

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
before we make any adjustments just for

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.870 
before we make any adjustments just for
installation<00:01:58.020> purposes<00:01:58.369> now<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.430> point<00:01:59.759> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
installation purposes now the point of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.280 
installation purposes now the point of
this<00:02:00.090> knot<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> keep<00:02:00.990> everything

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this knot is just to keep everything

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.670 
this knot is just to keep everything

tight so go ahead and tighten that up

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.550 
tight so go ahead and tighten that up
and<00:02:05.009> now<00:02:05.700> check<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.060> out<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.329> good<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.600> go<00:02:06.780> so

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
and now check it out it's good to go so

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.350 
and now check it out it's good to go so
you<00:02:07.619> see<00:02:07.860> how<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> looser<00:02:09.030> right<00:02:09.149> here

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you see how this is a looser right here

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.249

how to adjust this right now while I'm
here<00:02:11.810> if<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.260> loosen<00:02:13.709> if<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> handle<00:02:14.610> was

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
here if this is loosen if the handle was

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.729 
here if this is loosen if the handle was
already<00:02:15.060> installed<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:16.079> what<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.409> would<00:02:16.560> do

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
already installed and what you would do

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.740 
already installed and what you would do
is<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.549> would<00:02:17.579> unscrew<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.299> little<00:02:18.510> bit

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
is you would unscrew this a little bit

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.160 
is you would unscrew this a little bit
tighten<00:02:19.439> this<00:02:19.530> one<00:02:19.590> up<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.980> little<00:02:20.010> bit<00:02:21.170> until

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
tighten this one up a little bit until

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.990 
tighten this one up a little bit until
this<00:02:22.319> gets<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.650> little<00:02:22.890> bit<00:02:23.010> tighter<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.790> that's

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
this gets a little bit tighter so that's

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.819 
this gets a little bit tighter so that's
how<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.150> adjust<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:24.959> for<00:02:25.170> now<00:02:25.290> I'm<00:02:25.590> just
