still good still good got a pop-up flash
as<00:00:55.079> normal<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> hot<00:00:56.129> shoe<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.520> want<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
as normal with a hot shoe if you want to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.700 
as normal with a hot shoe if you want to
change<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> TTL<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.090> 60<00:01:00.090> million

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
change to the TTL now this is 60 million

change to the TTL now this is 60 million
megapixels<00:01:01.969> CMOS<00:01:02.969> sensor<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.750> XR<00:01:05.510> and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
megapixels CMOS sensor with the XR and

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.649 
megapixels CMOS sensor with the XR and
basically<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> EXR<00:01:07.860> does<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.430> full<00:01:09.330> auto

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
basically what the EXR does is full auto

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.350 
basically what the EXR does is full auto
mode<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:13.320> senses<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.820> scenes<00:01:15.090> any

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
mode so it it senses all the scenes any

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.820 
mode so it it senses all the scenes any
scene<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.810> you're<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.380> change<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
scene that you're in it will change the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.450 
scene that you're in it will change the
scene<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.460> settings<00:01:18.350> accordingly<00:01:19.350> say<00:01:20.280> it's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
scene the settings accordingly say it's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.460 
scene the settings accordingly say it's
a<00:01:20.549> moving<00:01:20.939> object<00:01:21.060> or<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:23.729> port<00:01:24.540> rate<00:01:24.930> or

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a moving object or it's a port rate or

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.469 
a moving object or it's a port rate or
you're<00:01:25.770> outside<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.520> high<00:01:26.729> light<00:01:27.030> or<00:01:27.299> you're

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
you're outside and high light or you're

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.230 
you're outside and high light or you're
inside<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.320> low<00:01:28.560> light<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.460> will<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.030> will

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
inside with low light it will it will

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.929 
inside with low light it will it will
counteract<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> set<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> camera

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
counteract all them and set the camera

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.210 
counteract all them and set the camera
up<00:01:33.119> fully<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.470> take<00:01:34.710> them<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.040> thing

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
up fully for you to take them one thing

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.060 
up fully for you to take them one thing
I've<00:01:35.430> noticed<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> XR<00:01:36.479> when<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.470> zoom

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
I've noticed in the XR when you do zoom

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.480 
I've noticed in the XR when you do zoom
in<00:01:38.280> quite<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.060> long<00:01:39.329> way<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:40.740> does<00:01:40.979> take<00:01:41.220> quite<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
in quite a long way it does take quite a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.149 
in quite a long way it does take quite a
long<00:01:41.790> time<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.720> focus<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.409> whether<00:01:43.950> that's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
long time to to focus in whether that's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.389 
long time to to focus in whether that's
because<00:01:44.509> it's<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.560> know<00:01:46.590> adapting<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
because it's you know adapting the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.569 
because it's you know adapting the
settings<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.829> perceiving

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
settings are or just you know perceiving

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.670 
settings are or just you know perceiving
the<00:01:50.640> settings<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> needs<00:01:52.140> time<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.380> do

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the settings and and it needs time to do

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.469 
the settings and and it needs time to do
that<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.890> don't<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.240> quite

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
that I don't know but it can be quite

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810 
that I don't know but it can be quite
slow<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.229> don't<00:01:55.530> want<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> exile<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.640> can

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
slow if you don't want the exile you can

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
slow if you don't want the exile you can
have<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.180> automatic<00:01:57.899> mode<00:01:58.110> which<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
have just automatic mode which is

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.200 
have just automatic mode which is
quicker<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.430> zoom<00:01:59.759> in<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.399> know<00:02:02.549> manually

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
quicker to zoom in it you know manually

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.380 
quicker to zoom in it you know manually
and<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.530> focuses<00:02:04.530> quite<00:02:04.860> quickly<00:02:05.390> much

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and it focuses quite quickly much

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.300 
and it focuses quite quickly much
quicker<00:02:06.630> than<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.990> XR<00:02:07.439> although<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.920> excise

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
quicker than the XR although the excise

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.140 
quicker than the XR although the excise
is<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.819> fantastic<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.869> you're<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> novice<00:02:10.649> or

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
is a fantastic if you're a novice or

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.520 
is a fantastic if you're a novice or
basically<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.540> wanna<00:02:12.750> point<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.260> shoot

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
basically just wanna point and shoot

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.110 
basically just wanna point and shoot
but<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.760> fantastic<00:02:14.940> option<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:17.120> it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
but it's a fantastic option to have it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.630 
but it's a fantastic option to have it
has<00:02:18.270> advanced<00:02:18.810> mold<00:02:19.170> which<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.620> basically<00:02:20.100> you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
has advanced mold which is basically you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.010 
has advanced mold which is basically you
know<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.180> set<00:02:21.420> everything<00:02:21.510> your

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
know you can set everything your
