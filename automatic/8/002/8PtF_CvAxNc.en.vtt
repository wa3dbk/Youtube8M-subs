sort of aerobics class and here for me

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.290 
sort of aerobics class and here for me
it<00:02:17.510> was<00:02:17.630> just<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.990> lot<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.319> fun<00:02:18.650> like<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.300> wasn't

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
it was just a lot of fun like it wasn't

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.390 
it was just a lot of fun like it wasn't
hard<00:02:20.510> work<00:02:20.959> at<00:02:21.319> all<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:22.010> think<00:02:22.040> it's

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
hard work at all and I think it's

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.860 
hard work at all and I think it's
because<00:02:22.700> I'm<00:02:22.850> lighter<00:02:23.120> when<00:02:23.540> you're<00:02:23.660> lighter

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
because I'm lighter when you're lighter

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.620 
because I'm lighter when you're lighter
you<00:02:24.319> can<00:02:24.530> just<00:02:25.220> jump<00:02:25.520> around<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:25.940> much<00:02:26.150> easier

you can just jump around so much easier

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.320 
you can just jump around so much easier

over 3,000 calories a day on average

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.110 
over 3,000 calories a day on average
there<00:04:04.880> has<00:04:05.000> been<00:04:05.239> days<00:04:05.540> where<00:04:05.930> it's<00:04:06.049> just<00:04:06.230> been

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
there has been days where it's just been

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.650 
there has been days where it's just been
2,500<00:04:08.120> or<00:04:08.209> something<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.760> then<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:11.209> think<00:04:11.480> one

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
2,500 or something and then I think one

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.569 
2,500 or something and then I think one
day<00:04:11.690> I<00:04:11.930> even<00:04:12.260> ate<00:04:12.380> up<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.680> was<00:04:12.769> just<00:04:12.950> having<00:04:13.549> a

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
day I even ate up I was just having a

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.180 
day I even ate up I was just having a
real<00:04:13.790> hungry<00:04:14.239> day<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:14.780> ate<00:04:14.930> up<00:04:15.079> to<00:04:15.350> 4,000

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.080 
real hungry day and I ate up to 4,000
calories<00:04:17.289> so<00:04:18.289> it<00:04:19.010> is<00:04:19.160> different<00:04:19.489> every<00:04:20.060> day

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
calories so it is different every day

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.529

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
six to seven medium ones I think

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.470

sometimes<00:05:18.580> even<00:05:18.880> eight<00:05:20.310> or<00:05:21.310> with<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:21.880> larger

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480

and<00:05:27.340> six<00:05:27.670> larger<00:05:28.360> ones<00:05:28.740> so<00:05:30.090> definitely<00:05:31.090> not

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
and six larger ones so definitely not

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.350 
and six larger ones so definitely not
calorie<00:05:32.440> restricting<00:05:33.250> so<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.730> this<00:05:33.940> is<00:05:34.120> why

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360
