hi team this is Chris Abram from go math
today<00:00:26.860> we're<00:00:27.040> going<00:00:27.160> to<00:00:27.220> work<00:00:27.370> on<00:00:27.520> number<00:00:27.820> 27

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
today we're going to work on number 27

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.670 
today we're going to work on number 27
on<00:00:28.870> the<00:00:28.960> FTC<00:00:29.830> elementary<00:00:30.460> practice<00:00:30.970> test<00:00:31.680> this

on the FTC elementary practice test this

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.830 
on the FTC elementary practice test this
is<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:32.920> great<00:00:33.340> problem<00:00:33.700> to<00:00:34.030> review<00:00:34.390> some<00:00:34.600> core

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
is a great problem to review some core

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.330 
is a great problem to review some core
concepts<00:00:35.440> in<00:00:35.680> math<00:00:35.920> specifically<00:00:37.020> involving

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
concepts in math specifically involving

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.940 
concepts in math specifically involving
geometric<00:00:39.340> shapes<00:00:39.640> and<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:41.320> concept<00:00:41.800> today

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
geometric shapes and the concept today

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.080 
geometric shapes and the concept today
is<00:00:42.100> going<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.550> be<00:00:42.610> Nets<00:00:44.820> usually<00:00:45.820> when<00:00:45.940> we

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
is going to be Nets usually when we

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.910 
is going to be Nets usually when we
think<00:00:46.120> of<00:00:46.450> nets<00:00:46.720> we<00:00:47.020> think<00:00:47.260> about<00:00:47.380> a<00:00:48.239> 2d<00:00:49.239> object

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
think of nets we think about a 2d object

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.790 
think of nets we think about a 2d object
that<00:00:50.920> can<00:00:51.220> be<00:00:51.430> folded<00:00:51.790> into<00:00:52.270> a<00:00:52.510> 3d<00:00:53.500> object<00:00:55.800> so

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
that can be folded into a 3d object so

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.939 
that can be folded into a 3d object so
here's<00:00:57.070> how<00:00:57.220> number<00:00:57.640> 27<00:00:58.330> goes<00:00:58.510> says<00:00:59.140> which<00:00:59.769> of

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
here's how number 27 goes says which of

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.140 
here's how number 27 goes says which of
the<00:01:00.010> following<00:01:00.190> two-dimensional

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
the following two-dimensional

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.119 
the following two-dimensional
representations<00:01:02.050> can<00:01:02.260> be<00:01:02.320> folded<00:01:02.650> into<00:01:02.980> a

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
representations can be folded into a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.930 
representations can be folded into a
cube<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.870> these<00:01:05.019> are<00:01:05.170> all<00:01:05.460> ABC<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.580> D<00:01:06.700> are<00:01:06.790> all

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
cube so these are all ABC and D are all

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.110 
cube so these are all ABC and D are all
two-dimensional<00:01:07.900> representations<00:01:08.800> that<00:01:09.120> if

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
two-dimensional representations that if

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.570 
two-dimensional representations that if
we<00:01:10.330> folded<00:01:10.780> them<00:01:10.930> up<00:01:11.200> we're<00:01:11.830> hoping<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.250> get<00:01:12.520> a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
we folded them up we're hoping to get a

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.399 
we folded them up we're hoping to get a
cube<00:01:13.000> or<00:01:13.210> a<00:01:13.300> 3d<00:01:14.170> object<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.700> cube<00:01:16.150> there<00:01:16.540> it's

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
cube or a 3d object that cube there it's

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.280 
cube or a 3d object that cube there it's
gonna<00:01:17.650> look<00:01:17.860> like<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.360> we're<00:01:22.600> going<00:01:22.930> from

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
gonna look like this so we're going from

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:34.080 
gonna look like this so we're going from
2d<00:01:25.860> right<00:01:27.030> 2d<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.420> 3d<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:33.400> looking<00:01:33.790> at<00:01:33.910> this

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
2d right 2d to 3d when looking at this

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.190 
2d right 2d to 3d when looking at this
problem<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.950> know<00:01:36.070> it's<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.550> little<00:01:36.730> tricky

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
problem you know it's a little tricky

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.570 
problem you know it's a little tricky
unless<00:01:38.200> you've<00:01:38.500> worked<00:01:38.800> with<00:01:38.950> metal<00:01:39.220> lots

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
unless you've worked with metal lots

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.240 
unless you've worked with metal lots
it's<00:01:40.240> hard<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.750> sometimes<00:01:41.020> match<00:01:41.620> it<00:01:41.860> up<00:01:41.980> I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
it's hard to sometimes match it up I

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.430 
it's hard to sometimes match it up I
want<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.210> point<00:01:43.390> out<00:01:43.570> first<00:01:43.780> what<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.140> correct

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
want to point out first what the correct

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.920 
want to point out first what the correct
answer<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.270> correct<00:01:46.510> answer

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
answer is a is the correct answer

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.340 
answer is a is the correct answer
a<00:01:47.110> if<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:48.100> cut<00:01:48.880> along<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.480> lines<00:01:49.750> here<00:01:50.140> along

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
a if you cut along the lines here along

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.660 
a if you cut along the lines here along
the<00:01:50.530> edges<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.730> folded<00:01:52.360> up<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.920> all<00:01:53.920> the

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
the edges and you folded up a all the

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.460 
the edges and you folded up a all the
faces<00:01:55.120> would<00:01:55.300> line<00:01:55.540> up<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:55.900> all<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> edges

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
faces would line up and all the edges

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.200 
faces would line up and all the edges
would<00:01:56.620> line<00:01:56.860> up<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.070> form<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.520> cube<00:01:57.850> there<00:01:58.120> would

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
would line up to form a cube there would

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.470 
would line up to form a cube there would
be<00:01:58.240> no<00:01:58.540> overlapping<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.410> faces<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.300> all<00:02:01.300> the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
be no overlapping of faces and all the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.990 
be no overlapping of faces and all the
edges<00:02:01.840> would<00:02:02.020> be<00:02:02.140> touching<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.880> the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
edges would be touching so a is the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.430 
edges would be touching so a is the
correct<00:02:04.240> answer<00:02:04.800> now<00:02:05.800> what's<00:02:06.010> wrong<00:02:06.220> with<00:02:06.400> B

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
correct answer now what's wrong with B

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.050 
correct answer now what's wrong with B
well<00:02:08.440> B<00:02:08.470> if<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:08.860> cut<00:02:09.160> along<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.580> edges<00:02:09.759> and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
well B if you cut along the edges and

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.790 
well B if you cut along the edges and
you<00:02:10.119> folded<00:02:10.569> it<00:02:10.690> up<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:11.110> would<00:02:11.200> actually<00:02:11.410> would

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
you folded it up it would actually would

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.270 
you folded it up it would actually would
have<00:02:11.950> one<00:02:12.459> extra<00:02:12.970> edge<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.930> side<00:02:14.200> now<00:02:15.010> one

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
have one extra edge on this side now one

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.520 
have one extra edge on this side now one
extra<00:02:15.610> edge<00:02:15.760> would<00:02:15.970> kind<00:02:16.239> of<00:02:16.390> flip<00:02:16.870> over<00:02:17.080> and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
extra edge would kind of flip over and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.290 
extra edge would kind of flip over and
double<00:02:17.920> overlap<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.730> there<00:02:19.000> would<00:02:19.120> be<00:02:19.150> a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
double overlap and there would be a

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.600 
double overlap and there would be a
missing<00:02:19.780> top<00:02:20.170> piece<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.190> B<00:02:21.370> could<00:02:21.580> be

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
missing top piece so B could be

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.540 
missing top piece so B could be
eliminated<00:02:21.879> for<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.480> reason<00:02:22.930> C<00:02:23.620> well<00:02:24.370> if<00:02:24.430> you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
eliminated for that reason C well if you

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.720 
eliminated for that reason C well if you
look<00:02:24.760> at<00:02:24.879> C<00:02:25.180> after<00:02:25.480> cutting<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.530> out<00:02:26.730> it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
look at C after cutting it out it

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.250 
look at C after cutting it out it
actually<00:02:27.910> there<00:02:28.360> would<00:02:28.480> be<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.629> whole<00:02:28.900> bunch<00:02:29.110> of

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
actually there would be a whole bunch of

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.619 
actually there would be a whole bunch of
places<00:02:29.379> it<00:02:29.800> would<00:02:29.890> overlap<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:31.090> C<00:02:31.299> wouldn't

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
places it would overlap so C wouldn't

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.110 
places it would overlap so C wouldn't
work<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.049> D<00:02:32.680> what's<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> major<00:02:33.609> problem<00:02:33.999> with

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
work and D what's the major problem with

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.110 
work and D what's the major problem with
D

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
D

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.559 
D
well<00:02:35.599> a<00:02:35.750> cube<00:02:36.080> has<00:02:36.260> how<00:02:36.470> many<00:02:36.650> faces<00:02:37.120> six<00:02:38.120> faces

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
well a cube has how many faces six faces

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.589 
well a cube has how many faces six faces
and<00:02:38.810> D<00:02:39.769> only<00:02:39.890> has<00:02:40.160> five<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:40.910> there's<00:02:41.269> no<00:02:41.420> way

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
and D only has five so there's no way

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.009 
and D only has five so there's no way
that<00:02:41.810> D<00:02:41.989> could<00:02:42.200> fold<00:02:42.440> up<00:02:42.590> into<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:43.010> queue<00:02:44.019> all

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
that D could fold up into a queue all

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.809 
that D could fold up into a queue all
right<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.379> is<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.709> core<00:02:46.010> concept<00:02:46.640> behind

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
right this is the core concept behind

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.920 
right this is the core concept behind
nets<00:02:47.620> taking<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.680> two-dimensional<00:02:49.340> object

nets taking a two-dimensional object
using<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.230> form<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.620> three-dimensional

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.270 
using it to form a three-dimensional
shape<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:53.780> more<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.860> have<00:02:55.010> more

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
shape you have more you can have more

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.970

are not try well remember you have to
take<00:03:58.519> that<00:03:58.700> 2d<00:03:59.180> object<00:03:59.690> you<00:04:00.380> have<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.620> convert

you recognize that this one looks like
your<00:04:11.660> classic<00:04:11.959> net<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.590> cube<00:04:12.919> so<00:04:13.430> that's

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
your classic net of a cube so that's

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.390 
your classic net of a cube so that's
right<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.840> maybe<00:04:15.169> you<00:04:15.500> can<00:04:15.650> visualize<00:04:16.099> this

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
right and maybe you can visualize this

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.199 
right and maybe you can visualize this
one<00:04:16.700> is<00:04:16.910> actually<00:04:17.799> correct<00:04:18.799> as<00:04:19.010> well<00:04:19.209> you're

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
one is actually correct as well you're

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
means go to Google type in Nets and see

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.860

form an ice cube that's helpful because
the<00:04:46.070> more<00:04:46.250> practice<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:46.909> get<00:04:47.060> with<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.450> if

like this you'd be able to identify very
quickly<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:51.560> these<00:04:51.740> ones<00:04:52.130> are<00:04:52.280> nets<00:04:52.520> and

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
quickly that these ones are nets and

quickly that these ones are nets and
maybe<00:04:53.510> you'd<00:04:53.750> remember<00:04:53.900> these<00:04:54.440> ones<00:04:54.710> are<00:04:54.860> nets
