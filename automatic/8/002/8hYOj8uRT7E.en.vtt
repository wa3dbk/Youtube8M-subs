00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
color so i chose bordello which is a

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.000 
color so i chose bordello which is a
move<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:56.269> it's<00:03:57.109> pretty<00:03:57.409> much<00:03:57.650> what<00:03:59.799> you<00:04:00.799> would

I'm very very happy with this um I think
it<00:05:21.380> is<00:05:21.410> well<00:05:21.800> worth<00:05:22.040> the<00:05:22.430> money<00:05:22.910> that<00:05:23.210> they're

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
it is well worth the money that they're

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.270 
it is well worth the money that they're
asking<00:05:23.810> i<00:05:23.900> know<00:05:23.960> a<00:05:24.110> lot<00:05:24.200> of<00:05:24.350> people<00:05:24.500> had<00:05:24.980> said

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
asking i know a lot of people had said

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.280 
asking i know a lot of people had said
oh<00:05:25.460> this<00:05:25.760> is<00:05:25.820> too<00:05:26.090> expensive<00:05:26.390> for<00:05:26.810> what<00:05:27.020> it<00:05:27.170> is

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.830 
oh this is too expensive for what it is
i<00:05:27.620> disagree<00:05:28.580> i<00:05:28.610> think<00:05:29.060> this<00:05:29.420> is<00:05:29.570> very<00:05:29.600> good

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
i disagree i think this is very good

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.770 
i disagree i think this is very good
quality<00:05:30.260> i<00:05:30.590> think<00:05:30.920> the<00:05:31.070> palette<00:05:31.640> is<00:05:31.820> extremely

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
quality i think the palette is extremely

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.690 
quality i think the palette is extremely
well<00:05:32.990> made<00:05:33.290> and<00:05:33.620> nice<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.070> sturdy<00:05:34.310> for

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
well made and nice and sturdy for

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.690 
well made and nice and sturdy for
traveling<00:05:35.270> or<00:05:35.750> for<00:05:36.050> anything<00:05:36.260> really<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.890> I

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
traveling or for anything really and I

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.970 
traveling or for anything really and I
think<00:05:37.730> that<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.420> quality<00:05:38.720> of<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.290> eyeshadows

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
think that the quality of the eyeshadows

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.500 
think that the quality of the eyeshadows
is<00:05:40.280> awesome<00:05:41.030> and<00:05:42.430> so<00:05:43.430> much<00:05:43.640> better<00:05:43.910> than<00:05:44.300> they

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
is awesome and so much better than they

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.330 
is awesome and so much better than they
were<00:05:44.540> before<00:05:44.870> I<00:05:45.410> mean<00:05:45.680> like<00:05:45.890> I<00:05:46.040> said<00:05:46.250> before

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
were before I mean like I said before

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.460 
were before I mean like I said before
they<00:05:46.640> were<00:05:46.700> already<00:05:47.030> good<00:05:47.360> but<00:05:47.690> they're<00:05:48.170> even

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
they were already good but they're even

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.140 
they were already good but they're even
better<00:05:48.650> now<00:05:49.010> and<00:05:50.350> this<00:05:51.350> works<00:05:51.950> better<00:05:52.340> I<00:05:52.700> think

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
better now and this works better I think

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.290 
better now and this works better I think
as<00:05:53.360> a<00:05:53.420> concept<00:05:54.320> because<00:05:54.830> when<00:05:55.580> you<00:05:55.730> buy<00:05:55.970> those

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
as a concept because when you buy those

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.690 
as a concept because when you buy those
pre-made<00:05:56.930> palettes<00:05:57.530> that<00:05:57.620> they've<00:05:57.980> had<00:05:58.340> all

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
pre-made palettes that they've had all

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.480 
pre-made palettes that they've had all
these<00:05:59.060> years<00:05:59.420> there's<00:06:00.380> always<00:06:00.710> colors<00:06:01.310> in

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
these years there's always colors in

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.980 
these years there's always colors in
there<00:06:01.700> that<00:06:02.030> you're<00:06:02.270> not<00:06:02.420> going<00:06:02.600> to<00:06:02.660> be<00:06:02.750> crazy

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
there that you're not going to be crazy

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.630 
there that you're not going to be crazy
about<00:06:03.290> that<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:03.920> know<00:06:03.950> you're<00:06:04.340> not<00:06:04.430> going<00:06:04.520> to

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
about that you know you're not going to

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.900 
about that you know you're not going to
use<00:06:04.880> all<00:06:05.270> the<00:06:05.630> colors<00:06:06.140> because<00:06:06.730> everybody<00:06:07.730> has

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
use all the colors because everybody has

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.730 
use all the colors because everybody has
preferences<00:06:08.360> about<00:06:08.870> what<00:06:09.230> looks<00:06:09.440> good<00:06:09.560> on

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
preferences about what looks good on

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.880 
preferences about what looks good on
them<00:06:10.100> or<00:06:10.370> what<00:06:10.760> colors<00:06:11.180> they<00:06:11.210> enjoy<00:06:11.870> and<00:06:12.230> I

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
them or what colors they enjoy and I

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.980 
them or what colors they enjoy and I
just<00:06:13.100> think<00:06:13.310> a<00:06:13.430> lot<00:06:13.670> of<00:06:13.700> the<00:06:14.270> colors<00:06:14.840> got

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
just think a lot of the colors got

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.040 
just think a lot of the colors got
wasted<00:06:15.470> that<00:06:15.680> way<00:06:15.920> and<00:06:16.450> so<00:06:17.450> this<00:06:17.630> way<00:06:17.840> you're

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
wasted that way and so this way you're

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.870 
wasted that way and so this way you're
only<00:06:18.230> getting<00:06:18.620> what<00:06:18.980> you<00:06:19.160> know<00:06:19.430> you're<00:06:19.700> going

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
only getting what you know you're going

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.510 
only getting what you know you're going
to<00:06:19.940> use<00:06:20.210> and<00:06:20.570> I<00:06:21.350> just<00:06:21.860> think<00:06:22.070> it<00:06:22.160> works<00:06:22.340> out

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
to use and I just think it works out

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.380 
to use and I just think it works out
better<00:06:22.960> so<00:06:23.960> uh<00:06:24.830> what<00:06:25.520> else<00:06:25.700> there<00:06:26.000> was<00:06:26.120> one

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
better so uh what else there was one

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.940 
better so uh what else there was one
more<00:06:26.540> thing<00:06:26.750> I<00:06:26.870> wanted<00:06:27.110> to<00:06:27.200> tell<00:06:27.410> you<00:06:27.470> and<00:06:27.890> that

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
more thing I wanted to tell you and that

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.870 
more thing I wanted to tell you and that
is<00:06:28.400> that<00:06:29.240> you<00:06:29.720> cannot<00:06:30.230> get<00:06:30.530> all<00:06:30.920> the<00:06:31.220> colors<00:06:31.640> at

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
is that you cannot get all the colors at

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.480 
is that you cannot get all the colors at
every<00:06:32.300> place<00:06:32.480> that<00:06:32.630> sells<00:06:33.410> them<00:06:33.770> and<00:06:34.340> what<00:06:34.460> I

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
every place that sells them and what I
