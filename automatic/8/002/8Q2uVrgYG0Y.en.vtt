to<00:00:33.390> us<00:00:33.510> hear<00:00:33.690> about<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.649> park<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.100> ride<00:00:35.190> okay

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
to us hear about this park and ride okay

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.100 
to us hear about this park and ride okay
when<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> say<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.180> soaks<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.540> water<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
when I say it soaks up water like a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.040 
when I say it soaks up water like a
sponge<00:00:37.380> why<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.129> important<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:39.840> ad

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
sponge why is that important this ad

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.990 
sponge why is that important this ad
because<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.860> porous<00:00:41.250> material<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
because it's a porous material it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.180 
because it's a porous material it
actually<00:00:42.390> allows<00:00:42.480> water<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.230> filtrate<00:00:43.829> right

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
actually allows water to filtrate right

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.069 
actually allows water to filtrate right
through<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.640> concrete<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.050> can

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
through this concrete here as you can

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.520 
through this concrete here as you can
see<00:00:46.200> there's<00:00:46.980> more<00:00:47.340> holes<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.989> it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
see there's more holes there then it's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.290 
see there's more holes there then it's
not<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:49.860> compact<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:50.399> normal<00:00:50.700> concrete<00:00:50.879> is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
not as compact as normal concrete is

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
not as compact as normal concrete is
allows<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> water<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.260> drain<00:00:52.620> right<00:00:52.920> straight

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
allows the water to drain right straight

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.010 
allows the water to drain right straight
through<00:00:53.370> okay<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.180> we're<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> demo

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
through okay so we're going to do a demo

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.840 
through okay so we're going to do a demo
here<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> city's<00:00:55.980> water<00:00:56.219> truck<00:00:56.579> here

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
here with the city's water truck here

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.400 
here with the city's water truck here
okay<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.449> go<00:00:57.600> ahead<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.780> release<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> water

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
okay you go ahead and release the water

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
okay you go ahead and release the water
Pete<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.850> kind<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.809> are<00:01:00.899> we

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
Pete so we can kind of see what are we

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.450 
Pete so we can kind of see what are we
seeing<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:01.829> describe

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
seeing right here right now describe

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.529 
seeing right here right now describe
what's<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.300> demonstration

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
what's going on in this demonstration

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
what's going on in this demonstration
there's<00:01:04.199> quite<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> bit<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> water<00:01:05.040> coming<00:01:05.489> out

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
there's quite a bit of water coming out

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.210 
there's quite a bit of water coming out
if<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:06.150> regular<00:01:06.600> concrete<00:01:06.950> that<00:01:07.950> water

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
if this was regular concrete that water

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
if this was regular concrete that water
we'd<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.520> pulling<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.360> running<00:01:09.689> off<00:01:09.840> we're

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
we'd be pulling up and running off we're

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.350 
we'd be pulling up and running off we're
in<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.890> case<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:11.490> soaking<00:01:12.030> right

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
in this case it's actually soaking right

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.820 
in this case it's actually soaking right
straight<00:01:12.659> through<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.020> cement<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.590> going

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
straight through the cement and going

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260 
straight through the cement and going
back<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.400> actually<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.240> down

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
back you can actually see it going down

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
back you can actually see it going down
right<00:01:15.659> now<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.020> we're<00:01:16.200> talking<00:01:16.590> right<00:01:16.710> now

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
right now as we're talking right now

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.620 
right now as we're talking right now
there's<00:01:17.040> no<00:01:17.280> water<00:01:17.549> collecting<00:01:18.119> no

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
there's no water collecting no

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.240 
there's no water collecting no
absolutely<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.229> dissipating<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.920> into

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
absolutely it's dissipating right into

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
absolutely it's dissipating right into
the<00:01:20.369> ground<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.090> absolutely<00:01:21.240> amazing<00:01:21.659> so

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the ground it's absolutely amazing so

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.719 
the ground it's absolutely amazing so
what's<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> price<00:01:22.650> comparison<00:01:23.189> though<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
what's the price comparison though to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.600 
what's the price comparison though to
normal<00:01:24.210> concrete<00:01:24.799> initially<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.159> concrete

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
normal concrete initially this concrete

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.490 
normal concrete initially this concrete
is<00:01:26.759> more<00:01:27.119> expensive<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> has<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> longer

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
is more expensive but it has a longer

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.350 
is more expensive but it has a longer
life<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.130> compared<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> asshole<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.329> is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
life and compared to asshole which is

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.870 
life and compared to asshole which is
the<00:01:30.570> typical<00:01:30.840> material<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.530> used<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:32.159> put

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the typical material that's used to put
