00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.050 
elem veggies while this card's in play
all<00:04:47.650> veggies<00:04:48.040> are<00:04:48.160> worth<00:04:48.280> one<00:04:48.520> extra<00:04:48.820> point

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
all veggies are worth one extra point

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.020 
all veggies are worth one extra point

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.790 
when harvested and lucky charm while
this<00:04:52.210> car<00:04:52.419> is<00:04:52.510> in<00:04:52.600> play<00:04:52.780> all<00:04:53.020> players<00:04:53.380> may

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
this car is in play all players may

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.820 
this car is in play all players may
reroll<00:04:54.190> one<00:04:54.490> died<00:04:54.669> from<00:04:54.910> their<00:04:55.090> pool<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.830> have

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
reroll one died from their pool I have

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.230 
reroll one died from their pool I have
the<00:04:56.950> start<00:04:57.220> of<00:04:57.310> their<00:04:57.370> own<00:04:57.520> turn<00:04:57.760> if<00:04:57.880> they<00:04:58.000> wish

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
the start of their own turn if they wish

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.360 
the start of their own turn if they wish
so<00:04:58.900> that's<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.350> expansion<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.830> game<00:05:00.010> ends

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
so that's the expansion the game ends

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.710 
so that's the expansion the game ends
the<00:05:00.490> same<00:05:00.610> way<00:05:00.669> but<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.030> does<00:05:01.210> give<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.510> some

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
the same way but it does give you some

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.150 
the same way but it does give you some
different<00:05:02.110> opportunities<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.890> playing

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
different opportunities of playing

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.830 
different opportunities of playing
action<00:05:03.370> cards<00:05:03.820> we're<00:05:04.120> taking<00:05:04.240> advantage<00:05:04.750> of

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
action cards we're taking advantage of

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.180 
action cards we're taking advantage of
different<00:05:05.169> timing<00:05:05.560> depending<00:05:05.979> on<00:05:05.979> those

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
different timing depending on those

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.580 
different timing depending on those
events

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
events

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.810 
events
all<00:05:08.590> right<00:05:08.740> there's<00:05:08.980> the<00:05:09.070> expansion<00:05:09.580> for

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
all right there's the expansion for

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.150 
all right there's the expansion for
garden<00:05:10.600> dice<00:05:10.780> now<00:05:11.050> garden<00:05:11.410> dice<00:05:11.560> as<00:05:11.770> its<00:05:12.040> own

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
garden dice now garden dice as its own

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.090 
garden dice now garden dice as its own
is<00:05:12.580> a<00:05:12.880> very<00:05:13.390> good<00:05:13.720> base<00:05:13.960> game<00:05:14.320> in<00:05:14.650> fact<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:15.010> was

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
is a very good base game in fact I was

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.170 
is a very good base game in fact I was
surprised<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.670> see<00:05:15.820> that<00:05:15.850> there<00:05:16.030> was<00:05:16.120> an

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
surprised to see that there was an

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.670 
surprised to see that there was an
expansion<00:05:16.570> because<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:16.870> base<00:05:17.050> game<00:05:17.080> had<00:05:17.410> so

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
expansion because the base game had so

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.350 
expansion because the base game had so
much<00:05:17.830> going<00:05:17.890> for<00:05:18.190> it<00:05:18.370> you<00:05:18.820> have<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.090> family

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
much going for it you have the family

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.780 
much going for it you have the family
version<00:05:19.810> which<00:05:19.930> was<00:05:20.110> great<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.920> then<00:05:21.490> you<00:05:21.610> add

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
version which was great and then you add

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.430 
version which was great and then you add
the<00:05:21.820> regular<00:05:22.510> version<00:05:22.570> which<00:05:22.870> added<00:05:23.290> in<00:05:23.410> the

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
the regular version which added in the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.110 
the regular version which added in the
critters<00:05:24.100> that<00:05:24.310> allowed<00:05:24.520> you<00:05:24.640> to<00:05:24.760> go<00:05:24.910> eat

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
critters that allowed you to go eat

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.360 
critters that allowed you to go eat
people<00:05:25.480> seeds<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:25.930> stuff<00:05:26.110> excellent<00:05:26.980> then

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
people seeds and stuff excellent then

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.560 
people seeds and stuff excellent then
they<00:05:27.490> actually<00:05:27.730> have<00:05:27.850> another<00:05:28.030> little<00:05:28.300> mini

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
they actually have another little mini

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.300 
they actually have another little mini
expansion<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.020> was<00:05:29.170> in<00:05:29.320> my<00:05:29.470> box<00:05:29.710> that<00:05:30.100> had<00:05:30.220> to

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
expansion that was in my box that had to

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.220 
expansion that was in my box that had to
do<00:05:30.400> with<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.640> gnomes<00:05:31.030> and<00:05:31.450> there<00:05:31.870> was<00:05:31.960> another

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
do with the gnomes and there was another

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.510 
do with the gnomes and there was another
it's<00:05:32.410> like<00:05:32.440> a<00:05:32.530> mini<00:05:32.770> expansion<00:05:33.250> that<00:05:33.310> was<00:05:33.430> in

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
it's like a mini expansion that was in

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.880 
it's like a mini expansion that was in
there<00:05:33.640> even<00:05:34.150> with<00:05:34.300> all<00:05:34.510> that<00:05:34.540> the<00:05:34.870> game<00:05:35.080> plenty

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
there even with all that the game plenty

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.660 
there even with all that the game plenty
so<00:05:35.980> there's<00:05:36.100> one<00:05:36.190> of<00:05:36.250> those<00:05:36.310> games<00:05:36.430> that<00:05:36.550> you

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
so there's one of those games that you

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.420 
so there's one of those games that you
don't<00:05:36.880> need<00:05:37.330> an<00:05:37.510> expansion<00:05:38.050> however<00:05:38.590> this<00:05:39.130> one

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
don't need an expansion however this one

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.910 
don't need an expansion however this one
is<00:05:39.580> very<00:05:39.910> good<00:05:40.210> and<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:40.360> like<00:05:40.600> it<00:05:40.810> again<00:05:41.590> it<00:05:41.710> adds

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
is very good and I like it again it adds

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.530 
is very good and I like it again it adds
having<00:05:42.520> those<00:05:42.610> action<00:05:43.000> cards<00:05:43.240> is<00:05:43.330> cool

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
having those action cards is cool

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.240 
having those action cards is cool
because<00:05:43.720> when<00:05:43.990> you<00:05:44.110> have<00:05:44.320> them<00:05:44.500> it<00:05:44.920> will<00:05:45.070> sort

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
because when you have them it will sort

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.710 
because when you have them it will sort
of<00:05:45.340> point<00:05:45.610> you<00:05:45.730> down<00:05:45.880> a<00:05:45.910> different<00:05:46.300> strategy<00:05:46.450> i

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
of point you down a different strategy i

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.940 
of point you down a different strategy i
like<00:05:46.960> how<00:05:47.080> some<00:05:47.260> of<00:05:47.320> them<00:05:47.470> are<00:05:47.590> those<00:05:47.680> take

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
like how some of them are those take

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.650 
like how some of them are those take
that<00:05:48.160> mechanical<00:05:48.640> you<00:05:48.730> can<00:05:48.850> haha<00:05:49.000> play<00:05:49.420> that

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
that mechanical you can haha play that

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.750 
that mechanical you can haha play that
and<00:05:49.870> take<00:05:50.290> it<00:05:50.440> make<00:05:50.890> you<00:05:51.040> moves<00:05:51.250> think<00:05:51.490> it<00:05:51.670> will

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
and take it make you moves think it will

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.820 
and take it make you moves think it will
swap<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.360> i<00:05:52.540> like<00:05:53.200> how<00:05:53.290> you<00:05:53.320> can<00:05:53.560> play<00:05:53.710> that

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
swap and i like how you can play that

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.320 
swap and i like how you can play that
take<00:05:54.130> that<00:05:54.340> i<00:05:54.520> like<00:05:54.700> some<00:05:54.850> of<00:05:54.880> them<00:05:55.060> add<00:05:55.300> a

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
take that i like some of them add a

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.880 
take that i like some of them add a
little<00:05:55.540> bit<00:05:55.690> more<00:05:55.840> of<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:55.990> random<00:05:56.290> Eleanor<00:05:56.590> you

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
little bit more of a random Eleanor you

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.230 
little bit more of a random Eleanor you
roll<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.160> dice<00:05:57.220> some<00:05:57.790> of<00:05:57.880> them<00:05:57.940> a<00:05:58.000> little<00:05:58.090> bit

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
roll the dice some of them a little bit

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.550 
roll the dice some of them a little bit
more<00:05:58.330> strategic<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:59.080> like<00:05:59.260> how<00:05:59.380> they're

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
more strategic and I like how they're

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.840 
more strategic and I like how they're
kind<00:05:59.740> of<00:05:59.770> distributed<00:06:00.340> between<00:06:00.400> those<00:06:00.700> three

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
kind of distributed between those three

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.700 
kind of distributed between those three
different<00:06:01.150> types<00:06:01.300> of<00:06:01.480> cards<00:06:01.750> i<00:06:01.990> also<00:06:02.530> like

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
different types of cards i also like

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.930 
different types of cards i also like
those<00:06:02.860> event<00:06:03.190> cards<00:06:03.490> when<00:06:03.580> they<00:06:03.640> come<00:06:03.790> up

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
those event cards when they come up

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.550 
those event cards when they come up
where<00:06:04.150> it<00:06:04.180> will<00:06:04.450> change<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.930> timing<00:06:05.260> of<00:06:05.500> when

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
where it will change the timing of when

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.710 
where it will change the timing of when
you<00:06:05.800> do<00:06:05.950> things<00:06:06.160> oh<00:06:06.400> you<00:06:06.820> don't<00:06:07.300> get<00:06:07.390> the<00:06:07.510> score

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
you do things oh you don't get the score

comes up huh I should have done it

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.390 
comes up huh I should have done it
earlier<00:06:10.840> now<00:06:11.350> I'm<00:06:11.440> gonna<00:06:11.530> have<00:06:11.620> to<00:06:11.770> wait<00:06:11.920> to<00:06:12.130> do

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
earlier now I'm gonna have to wait to do

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.440 
earlier now I'm gonna have to wait to do
that<00:06:12.430> maybe<00:06:12.670> I'll<00:06:12.820> work<00:06:12.940> on<00:06:13.060> something<00:06:13.270> else

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
that maybe I'll work on something else

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.210 
that maybe I'll work on something else
so<00:06:14.050> I<00:06:14.110> like<00:06:14.260> how<00:06:14.410> it<00:06:14.530> kind<00:06:14.680> of<00:06:14.800> like<00:06:14.950> gives<00:06:15.130> you

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
so I like how it kind of like gives you

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.650 
so I like how it kind of like gives you
a<00:06:15.280> little<00:06:15.400> bit<00:06:15.550> more<00:06:15.670> to<00:06:15.730> think<00:06:16.000> about<00:06:16.060> has

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
a little bit more to think about has

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.790 
a little bit more to think about has
obviously<00:06:17.050> a<00:06:17.110> little<00:06:17.170> bit<00:06:17.380> of<00:06:17.440> randomness<00:06:17.560> to

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
obviously a little bit of randomness to

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.070 
obviously a little bit of randomness to
it<00:06:17.950> but<00:06:18.700> I<00:06:18.730> think<00:06:18.970> it<00:06:19.060> does<00:06:19.180> add<00:06:19.360> another<00:06:19.720> level

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
it but I think it does add another level

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.750 
it but I think it does add another level
I<00:06:20.410> can't<00:06:20.950> say<00:06:21.040> I'm<00:06:21.100> gonna<00:06:21.190> play<00:06:21.340> with<00:06:21.460> this<00:06:21.550> all

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
I can't say I'm gonna play with this all

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.870 
I can't say I'm gonna play with this all
the<00:06:22.030> time<00:06:22.060> but<00:06:22.390> it<00:06:22.480> is<00:06:22.690> a<00:06:23.050> good<00:06:23.560> way<00:06:23.800> to<00:06:24.760> get

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
the time but it is a good way to get

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.970 
the time but it is a good way to get
even<00:06:25.090> more<00:06:25.450> out<00:06:25.510> of<00:06:25.720> this<00:06:26.050> little<00:06:26.530> dice<00:06:26.740> game

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980

even more out of this little dice game
