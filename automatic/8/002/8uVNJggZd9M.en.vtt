school<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> air<00:01:07.890> conditioning

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
school I think the air conditioning

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.859 
school I think the air conditioning
situation<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.090> very<00:01:09.210> different<00:01:09.330> depending<00:01:09.720> on

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
situation is very different depending on

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.890 
situation is very different depending on
schools<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.530> Korea<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.729> general<00:01:12.240> has<00:01:12.540> sort

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
schools I'm Korea it in general has sort

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
schools I'm Korea it in general has sort
of<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.110> an<00:01:13.380> electricity<00:01:13.799> shortage<00:01:14.520> because

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
of like an electricity shortage because

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
of like an electricity shortage because
of<00:01:14.990> shutting<00:01:15.990> down<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> nuclear

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
of shutting down one of the nuclear

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.560 
of shutting down one of the nuclear
reactors<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:20.000> there<00:01:21.000> people

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
reactors so because of that there people

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.789 
reactors so because of that there people
keep<00:01:21.689> saying<00:01:21.750> news<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.200> energy<00:01:22.500> shortage

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
keep saying news and energy shortage

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.890 
keep saying news and energy shortage
which<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.009> believe<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.479> hasn't

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
which I believe there is but it hasn't

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.920 
which I believe there is but it hasn't
not<00:01:25.799> something<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> businesses

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
not something you see like it businesses

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.880 
not something you see like it businesses
or<00:01:28.110> something<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.650> don't<00:01:28.860> really

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
or something you know you don't really

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.319 
or something you know you don't really
see<00:01:29.130> people<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.460> taking<00:01:29.790> off<00:01:29.909> lights<00:01:30.150> or

see people like taking off lights or

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.210 
see people like taking off lights or
things<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.070> matter

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
things like that but it's just a matter

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.830 
things like that but it's just a matter
like<00:01:32.369> schools<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.270> conscious<00:01:33.750> i

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
my school okay my classrooms never have

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.310 
my school okay my classrooms never have
air<00:01:38.729> conditioning<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.810> usually<00:01:40.110> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
air conditioning on they do usually a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.190 
air conditioning on they do usually a
fan<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> windows<00:01:41.490> open<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:42.200> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
fan they have the windows open on the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.690 
fan they have the windows open on the
fans<00:01:43.470> aren't<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:43.950> strategically<00:01:44.369> placed

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
fans aren't really strategically placed

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.370 
fans aren't really strategically placed
though<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> fans<00:01:46.140> were<00:01:46.290> in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
though because the if the fans were in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260 
though because the if the fans were in
front<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> windows<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.369> would<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.939> much

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
front of the windows it would be so much

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.899 
front of the windows it would be so much
better<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:49.140> bring<00:01:49.290> air<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> fans<00:01:50.729> are

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
better to bring air in but the fans are

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.240 
better to bring air in but the fans are
sort<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.229> ceiling<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> if

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
sort of like on the ceiling and if

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.950 
sort of like on the ceiling and if
you've<00:01:53.430> ever<00:01:53.610> had<00:01:53.759> ceiling<00:01:54.119> fans<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.630> they

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you've ever had ceiling fans like they

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.830 
you've ever had ceiling fans like they
just<00:01:55.110> sort<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.350> push<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.799> hot<00:01:55.950> air<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.280> down

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
just sort of push the hot air back down

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
just sort of push the hot air back down
so<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> room<00:01:58.170> still<00:01:58.590> feels<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.340> really

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
so the room still feels really really

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.539 
so the room still feels really really
hot<00:01:59.969> all<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.360> time<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.409> I'm<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.159> humid<00:02:02.520> in

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
hot all the time so I'm and so humid in

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
hot all the time so I'm and so humid in
my<00:02:02.700> classrooms<00:02:03.090> none<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.810> my<00:02:03.899> classrooms<00:02:04.259> have

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
my classrooms none of my classrooms have

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.219 
my classrooms none of my classrooms have
air<00:02:04.500> conditioning<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.479> my<00:02:06.990> office

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
air conditioning and then in my office

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.160 
air conditioning and then in my office
there<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:07.950> an<00:02:08.280> air<00:02:08.429> conditioner<00:02:08.910> we<00:02:09.810> didn't

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
there is an air conditioner we didn't

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.809 
there is an air conditioner we didn't
have<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.649> because<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.009> wasn't<00:02:11.250> working<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
have it on because it wasn't working and

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.490 
have it on because it wasn't working and
the<00:02:12.510> biggest<00:02:12.780> problem<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the biggest problem is that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.990 
the biggest problem is that
you<00:02:13.680> turn<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.070> air<00:02:14.280> conditioner<00:02:14.790> for

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
you turn on the air conditioner for

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.330 
you turn on the air conditioner for
longer<00:02:15.330> than<00:02:15.360> 30<00:02:15.810> minutes<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.560> shuts<00:02:17.010> off<00:02:17.190> my

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
longer than 30 minutes it shuts off my

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.750 
longer than 30 minutes it shuts off my
computer<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.440> yeah<00:02:20.040> not<00:02:20.340> really<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.580> good

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
computer so yeah not really a good

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.580 
computer so yeah not really a good
situation<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.540> again<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.080> sit<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.350> front<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.530> a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
situation so again I sit in front of a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.960 
situation so again I sit in front of a
window<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.100> put<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> fan<00:02:23.550> in<00:02:23.700> front<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
window so I put the fan in front of the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.280 
window so I put the fan in front of the
window<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.300> make<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.720> as<00:02:24.870> cool<00:02:25.110> as<00:02:25.260> possible

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the subways are extremely

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.210 
the subways are extremely
air-conditioned<00:03:04.020> like<00:03:04.380> inside<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.010> subway

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
air-conditioned like inside the subway

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.280 
air-conditioned like inside the subway
it<00:03:05.400> feels<00:03:05.610> really<00:03:05.820> nice<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:06.810> soon<00:03:07.050> as<00:03:07.170> you

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
right now because I just feel like I'm

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.009 
right now because I just feel like I'm
dying<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.360> I'm<00:03:18.420> like<00:03:18.540> looking<00:03:18.690> around<00:03:18.810> like

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
dying and I'm like looking around like

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.870 
dying and I'm like looking around like
no<00:03:19.200> one<00:03:19.350> else<00:03:19.500> feels<00:03:19.650> uncomfortable<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.700> me

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
no one else feels uncomfortable just me

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.660 
no one else feels uncomfortable just me
apparently<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.510> have<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.660> problem<00:03:22.459> but<00:03:23.459> also

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
apparently I have a problem but also

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.670 
apparently I have a problem but also
yeah<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.480> guess<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.930> thing<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.410> bought

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
yeah so I guess the thing that I bought

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.800 
yeah so I guess the thing that I bought
was<00:03:26.100> really<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.000> only<00:03:27.120> thing<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.540> brought

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
was really the only thing that I brought

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.539 
was really the only thing that I brought
didn't<00:03:28.320> bring<00:03:28.410> with<00:03:28.620> me<00:03:28.650> for<00:03:29.190> like<00:03:29.370> this

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
didn't bring with me for like this

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.940 
didn't bring with me for like this
season<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.090> I've<00:03:30.180> bought<00:03:30.840> here<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.530> my

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
season that I've bought here is my

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.460 
season that I've bought here is my
raincoat<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:33.330> this<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.630> basically<00:03:33.959> essential

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
raincoat and this is basically essential

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.030 
raincoat and this is basically essential
because<00:03:34.640> when<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.760> rain<00:03:36.000> started<00:03:36.660> it's<00:03:37.040> here

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
because when the rain started it's here

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.100 
because when the rain started it's here
it's<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:38.370> downpour<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.450> it's<00:03:39.630> not<00:03:39.810> like<00:03:39.959> it's

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
it's as downpour like it's not like it's

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.020 
it's as downpour like it's not like it's
just<00:03:40.260> like<00:03:40.320> shower<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.220> then<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.430> passes<00:03:41.700> in

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
just like shower and then it passes in

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.699 
just like shower and then it passes in
five<00:03:42.180> minutes<00:03:42.390> like<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.959> rain<00:03:43.140> is<00:03:43.170> intense

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
five minutes like the rain is intense

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.030 
five minutes like the rain is intense
it's<00:03:44.070> kind<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.549> sideways<00:03:45.320> so<00:03:46.320> an<00:03:46.560> umbrella<00:03:46.890> is

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it's kind of sideways so an umbrella is

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.890 
it's kind of sideways so an umbrella is
basically<00:03:47.640> useless<00:03:48.030> because<00:03:48.420> it's<00:03:48.780> gonna

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
basically useless because it's gonna

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.539 
basically useless because it's gonna
like<00:03:49.079> break<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.860> mean<00:03:50.010> lot<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.190> people<00:03:50.400> have

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
like break so I mean lot of people have

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.340 
like break so I mean lot of people have
umbrellas<00:03:51.060> right<00:03:51.209> now<00:03:51.360> but<00:03:51.989> I'm<00:03:52.079> pretty<00:03:52.230> sure

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
umbrellas right now but I'm pretty sure

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.600 
umbrellas right now but I'm pretty sure
on<00:03:52.530> typhoon<00:03:52.829> stuff<00:03:53.070> like<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.190> hits<00:03:53.459> you

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
really can't like umbrellas not useful

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.160 
really can't like umbrellas not useful

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
sort of can tie it into the hood but it

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.610

it fits really easily in the bag so like

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.290 
it fits really easily in the bag so like
if<00:06:54.740> it<00:06:54.890> starts<00:06:55.220> downpouring<00:06:55.460> I<00:06:55.910> can<00:06:56.030> just<00:06:56.150> put

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
this in also it's big enough that I can

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.520

put my purse underneath it which again I

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.400 
put my purse underneath it which again I
think<00:07:00.800> is<00:07:00.890> really<00:07:01.250> important<00:07:01.730> for<00:07:02.290> for<00:07:03.290> this

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
think is really important for for this

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.780 
think is really important for for this
kind<00:07:03.620> of<00:07:03.710> weather<00:07:03.830> because<00:07:04.310> this<00:07:04.520> isn't<00:07:04.730> the

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
kind of weather because this isn't the

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.010
