00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 
highest for Anaheim okay so like I said
it<00:01:31.740> only<00:01:31.890> shows<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.280> five<00:01:32.490> stats<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.909> shows

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it only shows you five stats that shows

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.609 
it only shows you five stats that shows
you<00:01:33.240> skating<00:01:33.630> shooting<00:01:33.900> hands<00:01:34.170> checking

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you skating shooting hands checking

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.830 
you skating shooting hands checking
defense<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.850> skating<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.390> shooting<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.810> think

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
defense for skating and shooting I think

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
defense for skating and shooting I think
what<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.229> does<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.799> averages<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> all

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
what it does is it just averages it all

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.450 
what it does is it just averages it all
out<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.350> speed<00:01:40.350> agility<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:41.040> averages

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
out so like speed agility it averages

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
out so like speed agility it averages
all<00:01:41.610> those<00:01:41.759> out<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.090> give<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.659> give<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.930> a
