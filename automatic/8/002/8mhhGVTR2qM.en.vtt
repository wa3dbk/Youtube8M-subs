 if Beijing needs to contact the European Union 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.980
 the first thing he calls is berlin they 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.080
 brussels germany plays a key role in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.070
 shaping the future relationship of Europe and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.840
 China she to me this role rather 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.060
 discoverer rather than experienced 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 middleman about 50 percent 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 European exports to China comes from 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.490
 Germany last year hand 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 made trade deals worth 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.630
 almost one hundred and forty five billion euros 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.930
 principles of cooperation were developed 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.640
 on special conditions 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.930
 nobody will disregard you 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.700
 the interest of all europe to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.980
 all countries participated in the collaboration 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.840
 however, some EU member states 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.550
 still out of work 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.710
 due to budget cuts measures tight 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.969
 saving will never help cope with 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.120
 a similar crisis 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.129
 they only aggravate the situation therefore 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.020
 German export industries now 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.410
 focus on growing chinese 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.020
 market 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.850
 however germany and china in this situation 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.710
 not just many began to wonder 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.450
 question on which side is 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.549
 Berlin in a low-price dispute 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 Chinese solar panels flooded 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.790
 the European market has also emerged 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.130
 worry that for the sake of increasing 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.140
 Germany's trade turnover ignores 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.450
 China's rights issues 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.369
 human German car giants 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.790
 seized on the opportunity to trade with 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.920
 China 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.900
 with both hands for the manufacturer 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.000

 China increased 10 times the following 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.329
 three years we plan to increase

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.680
 close cooperation with China and the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.079
 what our cars use there 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.960
 popular think it is good not only 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.340
 for us but for the whole automobile 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 industry of germany and is 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.700
 driving force for both internal 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.310
 production so for international 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.030
 of the market

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.700
 percent of total production 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.190
 Germany is a big part of this 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.349
 accounted for by China and the reason here 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.630
 not only that buyers from beijing 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.340

 luxury in the likeness of this but also in that 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.640
 Chinese companies are firmly entrenched in 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.440
 European market, we already sell Europe 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.390
 a lot of parts so why aren't we 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.190
 must watch more cars 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.820
 Chinese road production 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.820
 France Germany 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.560
 despite the low purchasing 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.240
 the ability of some countries members of the EU communication 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.020
 Germany with the European Union is still 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.790
 durable 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.800
