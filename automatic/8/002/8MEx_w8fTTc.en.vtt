it<00:00:23.120> is<00:00:23.270> one<00:00:23.450> of<00:00:23.480> my<00:00:23.630> dream<00:00:23.870> stunts<00:00:24.290> actually

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
it is one of my dream stunts actually

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.230 
it is one of my dream stunts actually
because<00:00:25.010> it's<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:25.340> one<00:00:25.520> thing<00:00:25.790> that<00:00:26.000> I<00:00:26.030> have

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
because it's the one thing that I have

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.960 
because it's the one thing that I have
not<00:00:26.420> done<00:00:26.480> in<00:00:27.080> a<00:00:27.410> big<00:00:27.860> rig<00:00:28.100> I've<00:00:28.400> flipped<00:00:28.700> them

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
not done in a big rig I've flipped them

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.990 
not done in a big rig I've flipped them
crush<00:00:29.870> them<00:00:30.110> every<00:00:30.320> which<00:00:30.470> way<00:00:30.500> you<00:00:30.710> can<00:00:31.000> and

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
crush them every which way you can and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.270 
crush them every which way you can and
one<00:00:32.119> thing<00:00:32.300> I<00:00:32.390> haven't<00:00:32.570> done<00:00:32.690> is<00:00:32.960> jump<00:00:33.470> a<00:00:33.739> truck

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
one thing I haven't done is jump a truck

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.790 
one thing I haven't done is jump a truck
and<00:00:34.460> trailer<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:35.210> I've<00:00:35.870> never<00:00:36.050> seen<00:00:36.320> it<00:00:36.440> done

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
and trailer and I've never seen it done

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.170 
and trailer and I've never seen it done
before<00:00:36.830> I<00:00:37.340> think<00:00:37.460> it's<00:00:37.700> a<00:00:37.820> true<00:00:38.030> legitimate

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
before I think it's a true legitimate

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.600 
before I think it's a true legitimate
first<00:00:38.750> starting<00:00:39.590> with<00:00:39.620> this<00:00:39.830> modelling<00:00:40.309> we're

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
first starting with this modelling we're

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.920 
first starting with this modelling we're
able<00:00:40.730> to<00:00:40.970> put<00:00:41.420> in<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.750> what<00:00:42.140> we<00:00:42.290> the<00:00:42.590> known<00:00:42.800> and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
able to put in the what we the known and

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.080 
able to put in the what we the known and
adjust<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.110> speed<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.650> ramp<00:00:45.830> angle<00:00:46.090> at

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
adjust the speed and the ramp angle at

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.810 
adjust the speed and the ramp angle at
these<00:00:47.450> speeds<00:00:47.840> at<00:00:48.170> those<00:00:48.440> angles<00:00:48.890> that<00:00:49.430> truck

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
these speeds at those angles that truck

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.090 
these speeds at those angles that truck
will<00:00:50.030> travel<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:50.660> distance<00:00:50.890> so<00:00:51.890> at<00:00:52.010> least

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
will travel that distance so at least

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.560 
will travel that distance so at least
we've<00:00:52.280> got<00:00:52.400> a<00:00:52.430> good<00:00:52.550> baseline<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:52.970> start<00:00:53.180> from

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
we've got a good baseline to start from

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.960 
we've got a good baseline to start from
how<00:00:53.900> much<00:00:54.020> drag<00:00:54.350> does<00:00:54.560> it<00:00:54.680> have<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.310> how<00:00:55.820> does

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
how much drag does it have and how does

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.310 
how much drag does it have and how does
it<00:00:56.090> affect<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.360> flight<00:00:56.600> of<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.780> truck<00:00:57.050> and

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
it affect the flight of the truck and

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.650 
it affect the flight of the truck and
then<00:00:58.190> what<00:00:58.460> does<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.820> trailer<00:00:59.150> do<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.570> how

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
then what does the trailer do and how

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.210 
then what does the trailer do and how
does<00:00:59.810> it<00:00:59.960> fly<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:00.590> how<00:01:00.680> does<00:01:00.800> that<00:01:00.860> affect<00:01:01.160> the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
does it fly and how does that affect the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.460 
does it fly and how does that affect the
landing<00:01:01.640> of<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.760> truck<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:02.350> think<00:01:03.350> it's

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
landing of the truck I think it's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.290 
landing of the truck I think it's
extremely<00:01:04.040> critical<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.670> hit<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.880> ramp<00:01:05.059> as

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
extremely critical to hit the ramp as

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.270 
extremely critical to hit the ramp as
straight<00:01:05.600> as<00:01:05.780> possible<00:01:05.869> we<00:01:06.860> have<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:06.979> great

like<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:36.110> ramps<00:01:36.410> are<00:01:36.530> very<00:01:36.860> substantial

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
like this the ramps are very substantial

like this the ramps are very substantial
we've<00:01:37.729> had<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.060> truck<00:01:38.300> up<00:01:38.479> on<00:01:38.630> here<00:01:38.869> we<00:01:39.020> don't

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
we've had the truck up on here we don't

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.719 
we've had the truck up on here we don't
see<00:01:39.410> any<00:01:39.619> flex<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.310> know<00:01:40.399> they're<00:01:40.580> really

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
see any flex you know they're really

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.480 
see any flex you know they're really
built<00:01:41.090> with<00:01:41.300> a<00:01:41.330> lot<00:01:41.539> of<00:01:41.569> bracing<00:01:42.130> out<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.310> some

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
built with a lot of bracing out of some

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.940 
built with a lot of bracing out of some
substantial<00:01:44.119> material<00:01:44.240> they're<00:01:44.720> very<00:01:44.899> heavy

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
substantial material they're very heavy

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.529 
substantial material they're very heavy
they're<00:01:46.340> going<00:01:46.459> to<00:01:46.520> be<00:01:46.640> tied<00:01:47.060> down<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.300> the

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
they're going to be tied down to the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.419 
they're going to be tied down to the
ground<00:01:47.780> as<00:01:48.050> well<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:48.530> there's<00:01:48.709> a<00:01:48.950> chance<00:01:49.280> of

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
ground as well so there's a chance of

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.389 
ground as well so there's a chance of
them<00:01:49.610> scooting<00:01:50.060> or<00:01:50.380> minimalized<00:01:51.399> I'm

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
them scooting or minimalized I'm

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.029 
them scooting or minimalized I'm
thinking<00:01:53.090> we're<00:01:53.240> gonna<00:01:53.360> see<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:54.560> bottom<00:01:54.890> of

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
thinking we're gonna see the bottom of

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.320 
thinking we're gonna see the bottom of
the<00:01:55.130> truck<00:01:55.399> not<00:01:55.640> including<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.119> tires

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
the truck not including the tires

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.089 
the truck not including the tires
dropping<00:01:56.869> out<00:01:57.020> but<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.349> bottom<00:01:57.679> of<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.890> truck

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
dropping out but the bottom of the truck

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.680 
dropping out but the bottom of the truck
and<00:01:58.280> trailer<00:01:58.490> would<00:01:58.819> be<00:01:59.209> somewhere<00:01:59.509> between

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
and trailer would be somewhere between

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.350 
and trailer would be somewhere between
eight<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.110> ten<00:02:00.470> feet<00:02:00.709> above<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.789> ground<00:02:01.819> out
