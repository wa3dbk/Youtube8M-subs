00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
and let's see what happens turn it off

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.109 
and let's see what happens turn it off
should<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.079> green<00:01:37.590> location<00:01:38.189> well<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
should get the green location well I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.399 
should get the green location well I
don't<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.390> any<00:01:39.540> notifications<00:01:40.229> here<00:01:40.380> I

don't have any notifications here I

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.700 
don't have any notifications here I
think<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:41.040> why<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.229> also<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.470> do

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
think that's why but on also you can do

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.819 
think that's why but on also you can do
audio<00:01:44.159> hacks<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> add<00:01:45.619> some<00:01:46.619> bass

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
audio hacks you can do a add some bass

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.630 
audio hacks you can do a add some bass
to<00:01:47.460> your<00:01:47.960> headphones<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> whatnot<00:01:49.560> which<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
to your headphones and whatnot which is

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880 
to your headphones and whatnot which is
kind<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> cool<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.390> other<00:01:52.079> little<00:01:52.530> things

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
kind of cool and other little things

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.670 
kind of cool and other little things
here<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.159> there<00:01:53.310> um<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.899> would<00:01:55.229> say<00:01:55.439> this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
here and there um but I I would say this

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.889 
here and there um but I I would say this
is<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.219> good<00:01:56.399> run<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.390> Galaxy
