it for me personally I actually do once

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.779 
it for me personally I actually do once
you<00:01:53.349> if<00:01:53.679> you're<00:01:53.860> if<00:01:54.099> you're<00:01:54.129> in<00:01:54.429> the<00:01:54.640> right

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
position these little hand it actually

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.910 
position these little hand it actually
is<00:01:57.759> very<00:01:58.479> very<00:01:59.020> efficient<00:01:59.409> that<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.590> can<00:01:59.770> my

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
is very very efficient that you can my

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.639 
is very very efficient that you can my
sensitivity<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:01.569> you<00:02:01.629> can<00:02:01.899> actually<00:02:02.049> you<00:02:02.619> can

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
sensitivity so you can actually you can

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.160 
sensitivity so you can actually you can
actually<00:02:02.770> do<00:02:03.189> sensitivity<00:02:03.959> Corrections<00:02:04.959> and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
actually do sensitivity Corrections and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.260 
actually do sensitivity Corrections and
they<00:02:05.770> can<00:02:05.979> kind<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.280> customize<00:02:06.459> a<00:02:06.729> little<00:02:07.149> bit

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
they can kind of customize a little bit

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:18.690 
they can kind of customize a little bit
more<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:16.079> very<00:02:17.079> very<00:02:17.290> good<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:18.220> there's<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.519> lot

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
more to very very good but there's a lot

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.080 
more to very very good but there's a lot
of<00:02:18.790> people

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.339 

you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.209> change<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.629> infant<00:02:27.870> method<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:28.260> you

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
you can change the infant method but you

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.530 
you can change the infant method but you
never<00:02:28.530> do<00:02:29.010> two<00:02:29.310> simultaneously<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:30.450> you

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
never do two simultaneously so if you

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.600 
never do two simultaneously so if you
choose<00:02:30.780> swiping<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.739> would<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> swipe<00:02:32.340> user

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
choose swiping you would be a swipe user

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.330 
choose swiping you would be a swipe user
if<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.910> choose<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:34.080> courtier<00:02:34.440> board<00:02:35.190> you'd

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
if you choose the courtier board you'd

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.290 
if you choose the courtier board you'd
be<00:02:35.459> using<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.760> gritty<00:02:35.970> people<00:02:36.239> or

be using the gritty people or

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.940 
be using the gritty people or
temperatures<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.110> along<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.470> device<00:02:37.680> what's

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
temperatures so along the device what's

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.880 
temperatures so along the device what's
what's<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.519> special<00:02:38.849> about<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.300> actual

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
what's so special about the actual

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.610 
what's so special about the actual
things<00:02:40.890> we<00:02:41.640> took<00:02:42.000> one<00:02:42.750> thing<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.080> want<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.349> point

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
things we took one thing I want to point

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.130 
things we took one thing I want to point
out<00:02:43.769> we<00:02:43.920> actually<00:02:44.010> chose<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:45.510> area<00:02:45.720> here<00:02:46.110> and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
out we actually chose this area here and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.539 
out we actually chose this area here and
created<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.860> touch<00:02:47.480> trackpad<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:50.370> can

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
created a touch trackpad so you can

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.369 
created a touch trackpad so you can
actually<00:02:50.670> use<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.360> touch<00:02:51.599> trackpad<00:02:51.840> on<00:02:52.290> the

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
actually use this touch trackpad on the

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.809 
actually use this touch trackpad on the
bottom<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:53.549> scroll<00:02:53.819> through<00:02:55.489> right<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.730> you

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
bottom of to scroll through right so you

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.400 
bottom of to scroll through right so you
would<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.720> actually<00:02:57.840> use<00:02:58.200> this

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
would have and you can actually use this

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.050 
would have and you can actually use this
the<00:02:58.830> one<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.310> one<00:02:59.459> feature<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.849> I<00:03:00.030> really

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
the one the one feature that I really

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.580 
the one the one feature that I really
like<00:03:00.329> rather<00:03:00.599> is<00:03:00.720> touch<00:03:00.959> keep<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.319> others

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
like rather is touch keep that others

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.650 
like rather is touch keep that others
trackpad<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.090> when<00:03:03.209> you're<00:03:03.329> entering

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
trackpad is that when you're entering

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.680 
trackpad is that when you're entering
text<00:03:04.099> it's<00:03:05.099> very<00:03:05.489> very<00:03:05.790> quickly<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.209> navigate

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
text it's very very quickly and navigate

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.819 
text it's very very quickly and navigate
around<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:07.739> texture<00:03:08.190> you're<00:03:08.340> entering<00:03:08.640> a

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
around the texture you're entering a

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.819 
around the texture you're entering a
variation<00:03:10.829> of<00:03:10.950> navigate<00:03:11.430> through<00:03:12.530> web<00:03:13.530> pages

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
variation of navigate through web pages

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.280 
variation of navigate through web pages
or<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.519> scroll<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> native<00:03:15.599> so<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.900> if<00:03:16.170> you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
or to scroll a native so if you if you

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.080 
or to scroll a native so if you if you
want<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.590> put<00:03:16.799> some<00:03:17.400> information<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:17.940> it's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
want to put some information and it's

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.490 
want to put some information and it's
just<00:03:18.269> easy<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.660> jump<00:03:18.840> one<00:03:19.079> field<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:19.410> another

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
just easy to jump one field to another

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.270 
just easy to jump one field to another
so<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.280> trackpad<00:03:20.610> obviously<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.950> think<00:03:22.950> as

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
so the trackpad obviously is I think as

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.150 
so the trackpad obviously is I think as
a<00:03:23.340> gradation<00:03:23.780> size<00:03:26.930> let's<00:03:27.930> say<00:03:28.170> three<00:03:28.739> yelling

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
a gradation size let's say three yelling

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.800 
a gradation size let's say three yelling
yeah<00:03:29.609> ish

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
yeah ish

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:42.550 
yeah ish
oh<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.620> can't<00:03:31.889> plug<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.280> back<00:03:32.310> in

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.119 

obviously<00:03:43.560> as<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.950> said<00:03:44.280> earlier<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.640> nice

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.740 

it's<00:03:50.129> a<00:03:50.219> lot<00:03:50.430> thinner<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.790> lot<00:03:51.060> lighter<00:03:51.329> yeah

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
it's a lot thinner a lot lighter yeah

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.259 
it's a lot thinner a lot lighter yeah
and<00:03:52.409> a<00:03:52.500> nice<00:03:52.709> light<00:03:53.069> device<00:03:53.400> although<00:03:53.730> I'm<00:03:54.090> not

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
and a nice light device although I'm not

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.289 
and a nice light device although I'm not
light<00:03:55.189> not<00:03:56.189> too<00:03:56.370> late<00:03:56.579> yeah<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.790> think<00:03:56.879> you<00:03:57.090> much

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
light not too late yeah I think you much

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.670 
light not too late yeah I think you much
so<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.659> think<00:03:57.719> you<00:03:57.900> need<00:03:58.019> some<00:03:58.200> substance

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
so I think you need some substance

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.780 
so I think you need some substance
behind<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:59.040> advice<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.489> they'll<00:03:59.609> certainly

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
behind it advice and they'll certainly

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.390 
behind it advice and they'll certainly
certainly<00:04:00.359> has<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.569> feel<00:04:01.069> but<00:04:02.069> for<00:04:02.250> me<00:04:02.370> I

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
certainly has that feel but for me I

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.179 
certainly has that feel but for me I
think<00:04:02.579> it's<00:04:02.909> it<00:04:03.420> maximizes<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.409> estate<00:04:04.980> we

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
think it's it maximizes the estate we

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.520 
think it's it maximizes the estate we
have<00:04:05.400> on<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.609> phone<00:04:05.819> they<00:04:06.419> give<00:04:06.629> you<00:04:06.810> your<00:04:07.049> nav
