00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
with the yeast so I have all of my

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.130 
with the yeast so I have all of my
ingredients<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.819> bread<00:01:33.030> machine<00:01:33.179> pan<00:01:33.749> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
ingredients in my bread machine pan and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.529 
ingredients in my bread machine pan and
be<00:01:34.530> sure<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.159> cover<00:01:35.399> all<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.999> liquid<00:01:36.359> with<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
be sure to cover all the liquid with a

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.179 
be sure to cover all the liquid with a
flour<00:01:36.929> so<00:01:37.259> make<00:01:37.499> sure<00:01:37.649> it<00:01:37.710> goes<00:01:37.799> all<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.069> way

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
flour so make sure it goes all the way

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
flour so make sure it goes all the way
to<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.520> edge<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> probably<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
to the edge and you probably know that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.950 
to the edge and you probably know that
but<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> always<00:01:40.969> mention<00:01:41.969> that<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.929> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
but I always mention that just so that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.440 
but I always mention that just so that
your<00:01:43.229> yeast<00:01:43.590> doesn't<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.520> wet<00:01:44.759> too<00:01:45.090> quickly

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
your yeast doesn't get wet too quickly

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450 
your yeast doesn't get wet too quickly
so<00:01:45.780> you'll<00:01:46.259> put<00:01:46.469> your<00:01:46.560> yeast<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.219> top

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
so you'll put your yeast right on top

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.480 
so you'll put your yeast right on top
you'll<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.539> hit<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.049> dough<00:01:49.439> setting<00:01:50.219> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
you'll just hit the dough setting and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.090 
you'll just hit the dough setting and
hit<00:01:50.969> start<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:52.289> will<00:01:52.530> make<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.889> dough

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
hit start and this will make the dough

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.459 
hit start and this will make the dough
for<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.090> use<00:01:54.569> your<00:01:54.600> own<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.289> then

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.970 
bit because you can already see how mine
are<00:04:12.560> larger<00:04:13.430> so<00:04:14.420> I'm<00:04:14.690> going<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:15.019> pop<00:04:15.440> this<00:04:15.709> in

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
are larger so I'm going to pop this in

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.550 
are larger so I'm going to pop this in
the<00:04:16.100> oven<00:04:16.280> at<00:04:16.729> 350<00:04:17.419> degrees<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.440> usually

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
the oven at 350 degrees and it usually

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.500 
the oven at 350 degrees and it usually
bakes<00:04:19.100> for<00:04:19.370> about<00:04:19.579> a<00:04:19.609> half<00:04:19.970> an<00:04:20.150> hour<00:04:20.329> so

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
bakes for about a half an hour so

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.990 
bakes for about a half an hour so
sometimes<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.440> little<00:04:21.590> longer<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.430> you'll

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
sometimes a little longer and you'll

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.790 
sometimes a little longer and you'll
just<00:04:23.150> want<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.450> make<00:04:23.600> sure<00:04:23.630> it's<00:04:24.200> nice<00:04:24.500> and

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
just want to make sure it's nice and

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.340 
just want to make sure it's nice and
golden<00:04:24.950> brown<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:25.790> it's<00:04:26.419> cooked<00:04:26.840> all<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.320> way

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
golden brown and it's cooked all the way

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.280 
golden brown and it's cooked all the way
through<00:04:27.889> so<00:04:28.250> um<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:29.270> won't<00:04:29.479> be<00:04:29.630> doughy<00:04:29.960> in

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
through so um it won't be doughy in

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.030 
through so um it won't be doughy in
between<00:04:30.740> each<00:04:30.919> ball<00:04:31.330> what<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.360> do<00:04:32.630> is<00:04:33.470> after

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
between each ball what I do is after

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.940 
between each ball what I do is after
about<00:04:34.550> 20<00:04:35.090> minutes<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.660> check<00:04:36.080> my<00:04:36.320> bread<00:04:36.620> and

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950
