00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
this guy he is better in his robot mode

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.190 
this guy he is better in his robot mode
he<00:04:16.680> looks<00:04:16.860> a<00:04:16.920> lot<00:04:17.010> better<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:18.600> he's<00:04:18.750> tilting

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200

because I can do that because I have
that<00:04:23.610> kind<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.880> power<00:04:26.120> why<00:04:27.120> just<00:04:27.180> randomly

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
that kind of power why just randomly

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.360 
that kind of power why just randomly
zooming<00:04:28.140> without<00:04:28.350> any<00:04:28.530> explanation<00:04:28.980> but

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
zooming without any explanation but

zooming without any explanation but
anyway<00:04:29.870> yeah<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.020> figure<00:04:31.380> uh<00:04:32.390> it's<00:04:33.390> a<00:04:33.510> lot

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
anyway yeah this figure uh it's a lot

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.350 
anyway yeah this figure uh it's a lot
better<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:34.080> robot<00:04:34.380> mode<00:04:34.520> but<00:04:35.520> as<00:04:35.730> I<00:04:35.940> sell<00:04:36.180> with

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
better in robot mode but as I sell with

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.690 
better in robot mode but as I sell with
the<00:04:36.390> silver<00:04:36.780> bolt<00:04:36.960> figure<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:38.550> know<00:04:40.700> it

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.120 
the silver bolt figure you know it
really<00:04:42.060> goes<00:04:42.450> down<00:04:42.480> into<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.290> combined<00:04:43.710> form

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
really goes down into the combined form

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.220 
really goes down into the combined form
you<00:04:44.370> know<00:04:44.460> constructicon<00:04:45.240> maximus<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:45.990> once

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
you know constructicon maximus so once

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.070 
you know constructicon maximus so once
again<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.620> would<00:04:46.710> be<00:04:46.740> called<00:04:46.920> Devastator

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
again it would be called Devastator

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.830 
again it would be called Devastator
anyway<00:04:49.080> um<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:51.750> yeah<00:04:51.900> just<00:04:52.290> like<00:04:52.850> if<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.510> want
