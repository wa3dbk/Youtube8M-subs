and<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> watch<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.239> ABC<00:01:00.239> TV

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and I was going to watch it on ABC TV

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.660 
and I was going to watch it on ABC TV
which<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.350> our<00:01:01.500> government<00:01:01.829> Channel<00:01:02.520> but

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
which is our government Channel but

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.630 
which is our government Channel but
that's<00:01:03.000> my<00:01:03.270> ABC<00:01:03.870> picture<00:01:04.290> very<00:01:04.530> snowy<00:01:04.979> because

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
that's my ABC picture very snowy because

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.260 
that's my ABC picture very snowy because
I've<00:01:05.790> got<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> log<00:01:06.900> periodic<00:01:07.590> digital<00:01:08.400> TV

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I've got a log periodic digital TV

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
I've got a log periodic digital TV
antenna<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.590> done<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> long

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
antenna up there I have done for a long

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.539 
antenna up there I have done for a long
time<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.000> doesn't<00:01:12.030> really<00:01:12.479> pick<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:13.010> in<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
time so it doesn't really pick up in the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.090 
time so it doesn't really pick up in the
ABC<00:01:15.150> signal<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.780> well<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.530> guess<00:01:16.710> we'll

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
ABC signal that well so I guess we'll

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.719 
ABC signal that well so I guess we'll
have<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.340> watch<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.170> crappy

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
have to watch it on one of the crappy

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
have to watch it on one of the crappy
commercial<00:01:20.729> channels<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.170> well

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
commercial channels like this and well

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
commercial channels like this and well
I'm<00:01:22.950> not<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> miss<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> picture<00:01:24.150> at<00:01:24.240> all
