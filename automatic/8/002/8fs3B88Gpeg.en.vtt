00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.660
 the first step was my husband 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.120
 made as he puts this 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.040
 system has developed that I think 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.320
 yes, it's really boring 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.720
 all day at the pc such drawings 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.490
 but maybe there is 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.740
 anyone who can only sit anyway 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.779
 and then we ask the employment office 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.310
 and then we can take it for that 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.230
 otherwise it would be a pity then a whole 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.859
 day at the pc would have to sit and that 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.170
 Employment Office actually had one 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.120
 Wheelchair users, however, one 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.129
 had commercial training and the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.230
 we just retrained and then 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.840
 that worked out wonderfully and we did it 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.850
 even today with us so we have 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.140
 very many employees we really 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.600
 been in operation here for a long time and that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.840
 works really well 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.210
 we integrate handicapped people 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.859
 Disabled employees who integrate 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.420
 Foreign employees who is in 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.839
 an agricultural area too 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.680
 do not have that easy and learn 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.479
 Even teenagers did not handicap anyone 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.420
 get a training course or ever 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.060
 have broken off a training place 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.920
 and it's our heart's sake 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.869
 All are taken and not only 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.440
 always the room above is skimmed off 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.090
 because we are not so profit-oriented 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.920
 or so we only have money now 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.680
 We want to earn money but we want fun 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.300
 to have at work 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.510
 We also have this plug system 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.760
 formerly made of game furniture 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.510
 for example, a small kitchen or a 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.160
 small post or dollhouses and that 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.780
 was always very well received and if 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.729
 For example, this would be us 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.110
 Now we make such children's book displays 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.850
 For example, one looks like 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.700
 a fire department or 1 that looks like 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.890
 a giraffe the kids mines the theme 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.960
 Immediately open and start with 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 so it really comes to play 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.930
 good at 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.140
 and finally, of course, I could 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.960
 always good for my own children 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.399
 Try it because I always have it 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.720
 gave something new then you take it 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.340
 Of course always first home 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.660
 and watch the killer with it for the first time 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.790
 and if that works 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.209
 or if you can improve something there 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.209
 could 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.060
 it's like that with me and when 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.549
 you actually too similar that we 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.510
 in our youth something political 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.329
 were shaped 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.930
 because here in the area so many 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:28.560
 nuclear power plants were built and too 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.810
 my youth so when I was 15 16 so 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.430
 there were the citizens' initiatives and there 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.840
 is one then went to see the demos 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.920
 to brokdorf and crown and was im 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.130
 choral life at the anti atom village 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.070
 I joined in and made such stories 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.080
 Now as an entrepreneur there is everyone 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.930
 the decision day what makes you 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.270
 again or do you want b now 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.000
 be sure to save money or if you have it 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.950
 have courage now and good in the future 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.680
 have and then the decision 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.480
 actually quite simply everyone can join 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.060
 Start yourself and see what he does 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:12.030
 everyone can and should do that 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.030
 make what's up to the future
