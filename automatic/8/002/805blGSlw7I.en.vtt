already kind of started deconstructing
it<00:00:28.609> it<00:00:29.609> was<00:00:29.789> one<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:29.970> those<00:00:30.119> cases<00:00:30.480> where<00:00:31.759> it

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
it it was one of those cases where it

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.700 
it it was one of those cases where it
got<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.000> little<00:00:33.210> snagged<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.440> hole

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
got a little snagged and the little hole

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
got a little snagged and the little hole
appeared<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.730> didn't<00:00:36.030> want<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.360> get

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
appeared and I didn't want to just get

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.260 
appeared and I didn't want to just get
rid<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.260> figured<00:00:37.920> why<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:38.820> just

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
rid of it so I figured why not just

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.080 
rid of it so I figured why not just
completely<00:00:40.020> destroy<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.160> deconstruct<00:00:41.940> it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
completely destroy it and deconstruct it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
completely destroy it and deconstruct it
and<00:00:42.390> make<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.110> look<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.920> done<00:00:44.070> on

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and make it look like it was all done on

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.880 
and make it look like it was all done on
purpose<00:00:44.430> since<00:00:45.200> deconstructed<00:00:46.200> sweaters<00:00:46.649> are

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
started from the bottom of the sweater

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.240 
started from the bottom of the sweater
right<00:02:35.080> at<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.290> edge<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.800> they<00:02:35.860> just<00:02:36.010> kept

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
right at the edge and they just kept

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.490 
right at the edge and they just kept
going<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.720> I'll<00:02:37.780> do<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.020> again<00:02:38.110> right<00:02:38.350> here

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
going up so I'll do it again right here

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.740 
going up so I'll do it again right here
I<00:02:38.560> made<00:02:38.740> a<00:02:38.770> slightly<00:02:39.310> bigger<00:02:39.730> hole<00:02:40.090> than<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.450> did

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
I made a slightly bigger hole than I did

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.420 
I made a slightly bigger hole than I did
at<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.380> first<00:02:41.620> time<00:02:43.770> I'm<00:02:44.770> getting<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.190> start

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
at the first time I'm getting to start

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:54.810 
at the first time I'm getting to start
pulling<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:48.520> different<00:02:48.910> threads<00:02:49.240> apart<00:02:53.820> and

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
pulling the different threads apart and

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.860 
pulling the different threads apart and
you<00:02:54.910> want<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.180> do<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.360> in<00:02:55.420> little<00:02:55.570> sections

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
you want to do it in little sections

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.190 
you want to do it in little sections
like<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.470> because<00:02:57.100> not<00:02:57.489> only<00:02:57.600> does<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:58.660> look

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
like this because not only does it look

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.479 
like this because not only does it look
more<00:02:59.560> naturally<00:03:00.520> affected<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:03.340> don't

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
more naturally affected but you don't

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.920 
more naturally affected but you don't
want<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.700> entire<00:03:03.940> thing<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.360> just<00:03:04.570> ramble

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
want the entire thing to just ramble

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.650 
want the entire thing to just ramble
apart<00:03:05.260> either<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:06.940> kind<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.300> keeps<00:03:07.510> it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
apart either so this kind of keeps it

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.490 
apart either so this kind of keeps it
under<00:03:07.840> control

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
under control

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.710 
under control
