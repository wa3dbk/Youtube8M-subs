we will three forget he or she whichever

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.950 
we will three forget he or she whichever
way<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:56.890> your<00:01:57.040> preference<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:58.330> next<00:01:58.600> part<00:01:58.810> is

way is your preference the next part is

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.109 
way is your preference the next part is
the<00:01:59.170> middle<00:01:59.470> section<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:00.159> that's<00:02:00.520> part<00:02:00.880> a

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
the middle section so that's part a

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.870 
the middle section so that's part a
twice<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.170> only<00:02:02.470> difference<00:02:02.830> between<00:02:02.950> the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
twice the only difference between the

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.090 
twice the only difference between the
two<00:02:04.119> different<00:02:04.540> parts<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.049> a<00:02:05.200> is<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.770> first

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
two different parts of a is the first

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.790 
two different parts of a is the first
part<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.869> finishes<00:02:07.869> on<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.050> third<00:02:08.470> of<00:02:08.679> the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
part a finishes on the third of the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.370 
part a finishes on the third of the
chord<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.910> second<00:02:10.270> part<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.660> finishes<00:02:11.230> on

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
chord and the second part a finishes on

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.670 
chord and the second part a finishes on
the<00:02:11.410> Tomic<00:02:12.000> whatever<00:02:13.000> key<00:02:13.239> you're<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
the Tomic whatever key you're in the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.970 
the Tomic whatever key you're in the
middle<00:02:14.980> now<00:02:15.130> I'll<00:02:15.400> send<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.450> thousand<00:02:16.930> flowers

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:31.320 

where<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.130> trade<00:02:24.400> winds<00:02:24.670> blow

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.730 

then<00:02:32.330> I'll<00:02:32.690> send<00:02:33.590> my<00:02:33.890> lonely<00:02:34.340> heart

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.950 

for<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.400> love<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:40.940> song

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:03:05.740 

so<00:02:47.960> that<00:02:48.230> little<00:02:48.530> again

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.990 

Oh

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.960 

and<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:13.270> it<00:03:13.390> repeats<00:03:13.570> part<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.380> but<00:03:15.190> it's<00:03:15.460> part

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
and then it repeats part a but it's part

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.510 
and then it repeats part a but it's part
a<00:03:16.240> to<00:03:16.660> that's<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.560> one<00:03:17.710> that<00:03:17.860> finishes<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.400> the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
a to that's the one that finishes on the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:42.230 
a to that's the one that finishes on the
tonic<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:40.480> that's<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.020> basics<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.800> tune

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
tonic so that's the basics of the tune

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.780 
tonic so that's the basics of the tune
remembering<00:03:43.240> that<00:03:43.570> part<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.710> has<00:03:45.460> two

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
remembering that part a has two

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.060 
remembering that part a has two
different<00:03:46.200> attempts<00:03:47.200> at<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.680> first<00:03:47.890> part

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
different attempts at it the first part

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.520 
different attempts at it the first part
of<00:03:48.550> Part<00:03:48.820> A<00:03:49.060> finishes<00:03:49.630> on<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.810> third<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.410> the

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
of Part A finishes on the third of the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.650 
of Part A finishes on the third of the
chord<00:03:50.800> which<00:03:51.520> in<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.880> key<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.060> F<00:03:52.210> would<00:03:52.420> be<00:03:52.480> an

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
chord which in the key of F would be an

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.340 
chord which in the key of F would be an
A<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.100> second<00:03:54.490> part<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.970> second<00:03:55.870> time<00:03:56.110> a

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
A and the second part the second time a

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.000 
A and the second part the second time a
is<00:03:56.560> repeated<00:03:57.130> Part<00:03:57.760> A<00:03:58.350> finishes<00:03:59.350> on<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.530> tonic

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
is repeated Part A finishes on the tonic

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.480 
is repeated Part A finishes on the tonic
which<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.520> F<00:04:00.640> note<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.890> composers
