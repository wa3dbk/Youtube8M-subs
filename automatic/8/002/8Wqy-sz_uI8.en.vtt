little bit heavier with my highlights at

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.099 
little bit heavier with my highlights at
this<00:00:18.740> point<00:00:19.039> I've<00:00:19.519> built<00:00:20.029> up<00:00:20.210> the<00:00:20.359> oil<00:00:20.570> pastels

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109

this point I've built up the oil pastels
to<00:00:21.289> a<00:00:21.320> point<00:00:21.740> where<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.730> material<00:00:23.210> is<00:00:23.240> real

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
to a point where the material is real

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.140 
to a point where the material is real
thick<00:00:23.779> on<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:23.990> surface<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:24.859> I<00:00:25.579> have<00:00:25.820> a<00:00:25.849> little

thick on the surface and I have a little

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.710 
thick on the surface and I have a little
bit<00:00:26.240> more<00:00:26.449> freedom<00:00:27.109> to<00:00:27.400> put<00:00:28.400> those<00:00:29.060> highlights

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
the white that's going to give us a

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.569 
the white that's going to give us a
little<00:00:42.230> bit<00:00:42.379> more<00:00:42.620> of<00:00:42.769> a<00:00:42.859> highlighted<00:00:43.370> side

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.400 
little bit more of a highlighted side
it's<00:00:43.940> going<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.120> make<00:00:44.300> our<00:00:44.329> mid-tones<00:00:44.930> feel<00:00:45.379> a

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
it's going to make our mid-tones feel a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.770 
it's going to make our mid-tones feel a
little<00:00:45.649> bit<00:00:45.769> more<00:00:45.949> natural<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.699> make<00:00:47.510> the

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
little bit more natural and make the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.869 
little bit more natural and make the
transition<00:00:48.530> from<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:48.829> highlights<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.760> the

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
transition from the highlights to the

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.849 
transition from the highlights to the
shadows<00:00:50.449> a<00:00:50.690> little<00:00:50.750> bit<00:00:51.079> more<00:00:51.260> natural<00:00:51.739> as

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
shadows a little bit more natural as

shadows a little bit more natural as
well

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
well

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.150 
well
some<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.870> those<00:00:54.989> highlights<00:00:55.620> need<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.040> be

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
some of those highlights need to be

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340 
some of those highlights need to be
completely<00:00:56.820> white<00:00:57.090> make<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.900> Apple<00:00:58.170> look

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
completely white make the Apple look

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.880 
completely white make the Apple look
shiny

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 

now<00:01:02.400> before<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.790> go<00:01:02.910> any<00:01:03.060> further<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.390> going

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
now before we go any further I'm going

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.020 
now before we go any further I'm going
to<00:01:03.570> add<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.870> Tim<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.770> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.160> that<00:01:05.430> by

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to add this Tim I'm going to do that by

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.900 
to add this Tim I'm going to do that by
taking<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> dark<00:01:07.140> brown<00:01:07.730> drawn<00:01:08.730> out<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
taking the dark brown drawn out the

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.450 
taking the dark brown drawn out the
shape<00:01:09.380> then<00:01:10.380> take<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.620> little<00:01:10.980> bit<00:01:11.160> of<00:01:11.280> blue

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
shape then take a little bit of blue

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.880 
shape then take a little bit of blue
remember<00:01:12.030> we're<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.210> using<00:01:12.480> black<00:01:12.890> using

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
remember we're not using black using

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.190 
remember we're not using black using
blue<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:14.550> brown<00:01:14.910> to<00:01:15.180> mix<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.600> black<00:01:15.870> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
blue and brown to mix that black and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.260 
blue and brown to mix that black and
then<00:01:16.860> I'll<00:01:16.980> also<00:01:17.220> probably<00:01:17.700> hit<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
then I'll also probably hit it with a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.500 
then I'll also probably hit it with a
little<00:01:18.479> bit<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> highlight

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.980 

on<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:23.200> opposite<00:01:23.680> side<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:24.780> I'm<00:01:25.780> going<00:01:25.930> to

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
on the opposite side and I'm going to

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.410 
on the opposite side and I'm going to
incorporate<00:01:26.230> this<00:01:26.680> same<00:01:26.980> yellow<00:01:27.250> this<00:01:28.060> bright

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.230 
incorporate this same yellow this bright
lemon<00:01:29.020> yellow<00:01:29.440> in<00:01:30.400> some<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:30.850> other<00:01:31.000> areas

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
lemon yellow in some of the other areas

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.610 
lemon yellow in some of the other areas
as<00:01:31.450> well<00:01:31.630> just<00:01:31.900> to<00:01:32.020> make<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.350> little<00:01:32.410> bit

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
as well just to make it a little bit

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.090 
as well just to make it a little bit
more<00:01:32.740> consistent<00:01:33.930> now<00:01:34.930> I'm<00:01:35.110> also<00:01:35.350> going<00:01:35.980> to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
more consistent now I'm also going to

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.300 
more consistent now I'm also going to
draw<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.480> surface<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.590> apple<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:38.980> on<00:01:39.130> at

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
draw the surface that the apple is on at

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.640 
draw the surface that the apple is on at
this<00:01:39.430> point<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.050> I'm<00:01:41.050> going<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.260> add<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.440> little

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
this point and I'm going to add a little

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.180 
this point and I'm going to add a little
bit<00:01:41.800> of<00:01:41.890> yellow<00:01:42.040> ochre<00:01:42.400> for<00:01:42.790> that<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:44.800> is<00:01:45.010> the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
bit of yellow ochre for that this is the

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.550 
bit of yellow ochre for that this is the
point<00:01:45.520> where<00:01:45.730> you<00:01:45.880> start<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:46.330> define<00:01:46.870> the

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
point where you start to define the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.190 
point where you start to define the
outline<00:01:48.040> of<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.400> apple<00:01:48.910> or<00:01:49.450> whatever<00:01:49.720> object

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
outline of the apple or whatever object

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.560

you're<00:01:50.320> drawing<00:01:50.970> before<00:01:51.970> wasn't<00:01:52.450> too

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
concerned about the edges getting them

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.100 
concerned about the edges getting them
perfect<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.180> can<00:01:55.330> see<00:01:55.480> up<00:01:55.600> there<00:01:55.630> at<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.870> top

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
perfect you can see up there at the top

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.830 
perfect you can see up there at the top
the<00:01:56.350> apple<00:01:56.770> it's<00:01:56.860> still<00:01:57.130> very<00:01:57.460> loose<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:58.810> I

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
the apple it's still very loose when I

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.830 
the apple it's still very loose when I
go<00:01:59.140> back<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.890> with<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.520> background<00:02:00.760> I'm<00:02:01.480> going

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
go back in with the background I'm going

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.250 
go back in with the background I'm going
to<00:02:01.900> let<00:02:02.310> these<00:02:03.310> edges<00:02:03.760> be<00:02:03.940> defined<00:02:04.330> by<00:02:05.200> the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
to let these edges be defined by the

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.530 
to let these edges be defined by the
color<00:02:05.620> that<00:02:05.830> I<00:02:05.860> put<00:02:05.920> around<00:02:06.460> so<00:02:06.970> right<00:02:07.390> now

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
color that I put around so right now

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.240 
color that I put around so right now
that<00:02:07.570> color<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.140> yellow<00:02:08.410> ocher<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:11.130> we<00:02:12.130> go

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
that color is a yellow ocher and we go

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.860 
that color is a yellow ocher and we go
all<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.550> way<00:02:12.580> up<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.910> edge<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.420> apple

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
let some of the colors mix a little bit

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.500 
let some of the colors mix a little bit
on<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.690> edge<00:02:17.340> because<00:02:18.340> when<00:02:18.820> we<00:02:18.940> see<00:02:19.210> things

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
on the edge because when we see things

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.300 
on the edge because when we see things
we<00:02:19.900> see<00:02:20.140> things<00:02:20.350> with<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.590> little<00:02:20.920> bit<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.070> blur

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
we see things with a little bit of blur

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.280 
we see things with a little bit of blur
around<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.820> edge<00:02:21.940> we're<00:02:22.390> see<00:02:22.570> with<00:02:22.810> two<00:02:23.080> eyes

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
around the edge we're see with two eyes

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.890 
around the edge we're see with two eyes
and<00:02:23.740> when<00:02:24.430> we<00:02:24.550> look<00:02:24.760> with<00:02:24.940> two<00:02:25.210> eyes<00:02:25.420> we're

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
and when we look with two eyes we're

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.180 
and when we look with two eyes we're
looking<00:02:26.140> from<00:02:26.290> actually<00:02:26.830> two<00:02:27.010> different

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
looking from actually two different

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.890 
looking from actually two different
angles<00:02:27.760> at<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:27.940> same<00:02:28.209> time<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.720> makes

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
angles at the same time that makes

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.410 
angles at the same time that makes
things<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.260> little<00:02:29.350> bit<00:02:29.560> blurry<00:02:29.800> on<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.040> edge

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
things a little bit blurry on the edge

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
things a little bit blurry on the edge
so<00:02:31.470> when<00:02:32.470> people<00:02:32.890> are<00:02:33.070> painting

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
so when people are painting

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.320 
so when people are painting
you<00:02:35.100> kind<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.550> avoid<00:02:35.670> having<00:02:36.150> real

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
you kind of want to avoid having real

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.630 
you kind of want to avoid having real
sharp<00:02:36.600> edges<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.740> this<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.250> case<00:02:38.460> here

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
sharp edges and this is the case here

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.130 
sharp edges and this is the case here
with<00:02:38.790> our<00:02:38.940> Apple<00:02:39.270> we<00:02:39.420> don't<00:02:39.630> want<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.990> have

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
with our Apple we don't want to have

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.320 
with our Apple we don't want to have
real<00:02:40.410> sharp<00:02:40.710> edges<00:02:40.950> instead<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.030> want<00:02:42.180> those

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
real sharp edges instead we want those

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.450 
real sharp edges instead we want those
edges<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:42.960> just<00:02:43.260> slightly<00:02:43.560> blurry

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
edges to be just slightly blurry

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.670 
edges to be just slightly blurry
that'll<00:02:45.330> make<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.630> appear<00:02:45.930> more<00:02:45.960> natural

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.319 

I'm<00:02:50.189> not<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.579> finish<00:02:50.819> out<00:02:51.150> my

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
I'm not going to finish out my

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.170 
I'm not going to finish out my
background<00:02:51.900> too<00:02:52.200> far<00:02:52.530> off<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.609> edge<00:02:53.879> just

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
background too far off to the edge just

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.640 
background too far off to the edge just
to<00:02:54.329> give<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.599> a<00:02:54.629> little<00:02:54.750> indication<00:02:55.500> of

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
to give you a little indication of

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.770 
to give you a little indication of
what's<00:02:55.859> below<00:02:56.219> the<00:02:56.370> Apple<00:02:56.730> now<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:57.540> put<00:02:57.750> a

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
what's below the Apple now we put a

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.149 
what's below the Apple now we put a
little<00:02:57.900> bit<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.109> shadow<00:02:58.290> underneath<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.859> Apple

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
little bit of shadow underneath a Apple

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.349 
little bit of shadow underneath a Apple
I'm<00:02:59.219> going<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.430> do<00:02:59.489> this<00:02:59.609> with<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.030> brown

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
I'm going to do this with the brown

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.280 
I'm going to do this with the brown
first<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:03.000> again<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.359> is<00:03:03.540> our<00:03:03.659> dark<00:03:03.989> brown

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
first so again this is our dark brown

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.050 
first so again this is our dark brown
light<00:03:04.680> sources<00:03:04.980> coming<00:03:05.250> from<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.609> left<00:03:05.909> side

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
light sources coming from the left side

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.390 
light sources coming from the left side
so<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.319> shadow<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.920> going<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.159> be<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
so the shadow is going to be on the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.920 
so the shadow is going to be on the
right<00:03:08.549> side

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.319 

it'll<00:03:14.620> fade<00:03:14.950> out<00:03:15.219> further<00:03:15.670> away<00:03:15.969> from<00:03:16.000> the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
it'll fade out further away from the

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.600 
it'll fade out further away from the
Apple<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:17.140> get

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.210 

and<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:20.330> will<00:03:20.420> be<00:03:20.510> more<00:03:20.720> intense<00:03:21.220> directly

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
and it will be more intense directly

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.120 
and it will be more intense directly
underneath<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.730> apple

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.770 

I'm<00:03:26.190> going<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.430> intensify<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.300> shadow<00:03:27.660> a

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
I'm going to intensify that shadow a

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.990 
I'm going to intensify that shadow a
little<00:03:28.080> bit<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.530> blue<00:03:28.820> remember<00:03:29.820> no

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
little bit with the blue remember no

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.380 
little bit with the blue remember no
black<00:03:30.380> blue<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.410> brown<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.270> remember<00:03:33.270> this

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
black blue and brown and remember this

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.320 
black blue and brown and remember this
is<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.630> cast<00:03:33.990> shadow<00:03:34.820> there<00:03:35.820> are<00:03:35.940> different

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
is a cast shadow there are different

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330 
is a cast shadow there are different
types<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.690> shadow<00:03:36.990> this<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.740> cast<00:03:38.070> shadow

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
types of shadow this is a cast shadow

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.240 
types of shadow this is a cast shadow
cast<00:03:39.000> shadows<00:03:39.450> are<00:03:39.630> created<00:03:40.140> when<00:03:40.710> an<00:03:40.830> object

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
cast shadows are created when an object

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.180 
cast shadows are created when an object
blocks<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.940> light<00:03:42.350> from<00:03:43.350> hitting<00:03:43.860> another

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
blocks the light from hitting another

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.730 
blocks the light from hitting another
surface<00:03:44.610> so<00:03:45.150> in<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.720> case<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.320> Apple<00:03:46.650> is

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
surface so in this case the Apple is

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
surface so in this case the Apple is
blocking<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> light<00:03:47.610> from<00:03:49.460> hitting<00:03:50.460> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
blocking the light from hitting the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.760 
blocking the light from hitting the
surface<00:03:51.240> of<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.480> table<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.440> I'm<00:03:52.590> going<00:03:52.680> to

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
surface of the table and I'm going to

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.440 
surface of the table and I'm going to
start<00:03:53.250> give<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.520> a<00:03:53.580> little<00:03:53.790> indication<00:03:54.180> of

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
start give you a little indication of

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.420 
start give you a little indication of
the<00:03:54.540> background<00:03:54.990> we're<00:03:55.950> going<00:03:56.070> to<00:03:56.130> use<00:03:56.250> this

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
the background we're going to use this

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.360 
the background we're going to use this
light<00:03:56.730> blue<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.410> these<00:03:58.410> colors<00:03:58.650> might<00:03:59.070> seem<00:03:59.340> a

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
light blue and these colors might seem a

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.210 
light blue and these colors might seem a
little<00:03:59.460> bit<00:03:59.640> random<00:03:59.910> but<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.830> chose<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.010> blue

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
little bit random but I chose the blue

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.860 
little bit random but I chose the blue
and<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.430> yellow<00:04:02.460> over<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.120> Apple<00:04:03.480> was<00:04:03.570> red

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
and the yellow over the Apple was red

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.320 
and the yellow over the Apple was red
red<00:04:04.740> yellow<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:05.010> blue<00:04:05.160> is<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.460> primary<00:04:06.120> color

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
red yellow and blue is a primary color

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.110 
red yellow and blue is a primary color
scheme<00:04:07.160> so<00:04:08.160> they're<00:04:08.340> not<00:04:08.490> completely<00:04:08.910> at

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
scheme so they're not completely at

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.940 
scheme so they're not completely at
random<00:04:09.270> I<00:04:09.600> did<00:04:09.870> think<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.170> little<00:04:10.320> bit<00:04:10.530> about<00:04:10.590> my

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
random I did think a little bit about my

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.500 
random I did think a little bit about my
color<00:04:11.190> theory

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.080 

and<00:04:16.600> again<00:04:17.500> just<00:04:17.950> like<00:04:18.070> we<00:04:18.220> did<00:04:18.370> on<00:04:18.490> the<00:04:18.520> table

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
and again just like we did on the table

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.020 
and again just like we did on the table
we're<00:04:19.270> defining<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.900> edge<00:04:20.200> of<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:21.520> Apple

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
we're defining the edge of that Apple

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.450 
we're defining the edge of that Apple
now<00:04:22.350> with<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.530> color<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:23.950> we're<00:04:24.100> put<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.310> the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
now with the color that we're put in the

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.600 
now with the color that we're put in the
background<00:04:25.650> now<00:04:26.650> this<00:04:26.920> is<00:04:27.070> one<00:04:27.310> major

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
background now this is one major

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.610

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
difference between oil pastels and chalk

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
pastels with chalk pastels you probably

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.010 
pastels with chalk pastels you probably
want<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.140> do<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:33.160> lot<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:34.000> background<00:04:34.540> first

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
want to do a lot of the background first

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.620 
want to do a lot of the background first
and<00:04:35.350> then<00:04:35.920> move<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.520> foreground<00:04:37.030> with<00:04:37.360> oil

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
and then move to the foreground with oil

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.900 
and then move to the foreground with oil
pastels<00:04:38.170> it's<00:04:38.440> a<00:04:38.560> little<00:04:38.830> bit<00:04:38.920> backwards<00:04:39.490> in

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
pastels it's a little bit backwards in

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.120 
pastels it's a little bit backwards in
my<00:04:40.120> opinion<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.780> think<00:04:41.680> you're<00:04:41.800> better<00:04:42.040> suited

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
my opinion I think you're better suited

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.740 
my opinion I think you're better suited
to<00:04:42.610> do<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.000> objects<00:04:43.390> that<00:04:43.480> are<00:04:43.600> in<00:04:43.630> the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
to do the objects that are in the

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.950 
to do the objects that are in the
foreground<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.680> work<00:04:45.340> your<00:04:45.550> way<00:04:45.700> back<00:04:46.030> that

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
foreground and work your way back that

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.930 
foreground and work your way back that
way<00:04:47.140> you<00:04:47.200> can<00:04:47.410> be<00:04:47.560> defining<00:04:47.980> those<00:04:48.280> lines<00:04:48.610> as

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
way you can be defining those lines as

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.730 
way you can be defining those lines as
you<00:04:48.970> go<00:04:49.090> back<00:04:49.480> just<00:04:50.110> like<00:04:50.290> we're<00:04:50.440> doing<00:04:50.620> here

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
you go back just like we're doing here

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.610 
you go back just like we're doing here
with<00:04:51.010> our<00:04:51.160> Apple

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.969 

all<00:04:57.070> right<00:04:57.310> now<00:04:57.490> we<00:04:57.550> don't<00:04:57.729> want<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.060> just<00:04:58.300> have

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
all right now we don't want to just have

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.560 
all right now we don't want to just have
solid<00:04:59.979> color<00:05:00.220> taken<00:05:00.699> right<00:05:00.910> out<00:05:01.120> of<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.389> tube

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
solid color taken right out of the tube

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.650 
solid color taken right out of the tube
so<00:05:01.930> to<00:05:01.990> speak<00:05:02.639> so<00:05:03.639> I'm<00:05:03.820> going<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.120> mix<00:05:04.449> these

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
so to speak so I'm going to mix these

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.450 
so to speak so I'm going to mix these
colors<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:05.110> little<00:05:05.350> bit<00:05:05.530> make<00:05:06.010> them<00:05:06.160> look<00:05:06.310> a

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
colors a little bit make them look a

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.070 
colors a little bit make them look a
little<00:05:06.639> bit<00:05:06.850> more<00:05:07.030> natural<00:05:08.729> that'll<00:05:09.729> also

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
little bit more natural that'll also

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.659 
little bit more natural that'll also
intensify<00:05:11.080> our<00:05:11.410> shadow<00:05:12.040> so<00:05:12.340> I'm<00:05:12.400> going<00:05:12.520> take<00:05:12.610> a

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
intensify our shadow so I'm going take a

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.520 
intensify our shadow so I'm going take a
little<00:05:12.940> bit<00:05:13.030> of<00:05:13.120> white<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.720> I'm<00:05:14.290> going<00:05:14.410> to<00:05:14.470> be

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
little bit of white and I'm going to be

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.439 
little bit of white and I'm going to be
very<00:05:14.860> loose<00:05:15.190> with<00:05:15.490> this<00:05:15.699> I<00:05:15.850> don't<00:05:15.910> want<00:05:16.300> to

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
very loose with this I don't want to

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.439 
very loose with this I don't want to
create<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.870> drawing<00:05:17.470> where<00:05:17.650> we<00:05:18.639> lose<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.180> fact

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
create a drawing where we lose the fact

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.030 
create a drawing where we lose the fact
that<00:05:19.570> this<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.050> drawing<00:05:20.410> so<00:05:20.740> I'm<00:05:20.860> going<00:05:21.010> to

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
that this is a drawing so I'm going to

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.450 
that this is a drawing so I'm going to
kind<00:05:21.639> of<00:05:21.699> keep<00:05:21.850> my<00:05:22.030> lines<00:05:23.310> going<00:05:24.310> in<00:05:24.400> a

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
kind of keep my lines going in a

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.520 
kind of keep my lines going in a
direction<00:05:24.630> go<00:05:25.630> in<00:05:25.750> different<00:05:25.870> directions<00:05:26.320> so

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
direction go in different directions so

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.800 
direction go in different directions so
that<00:05:26.800> we<00:05:27.250> can<00:05:27.430> still<00:05:27.669> see<00:05:27.910> those<00:05:28.120> lines<00:05:28.419> so<00:05:28.690> it

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
that we can still see those lines so it

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:38.260 
that we can still see those lines so it
has<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.770> painterly<00:05:30.520> quality<00:05:30.550> about<00:05:31.539> it

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.500 

keeping<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.110> real<00:05:39.320> loose<00:05:39.970> all<00:05:40.970> right<00:05:41.150> we'll<00:05:41.360> do

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
keeping it real loose all right we'll do

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.310 
keeping it real loose all right we'll do
the<00:05:41.690> same<00:05:41.930> thing<00:05:41.990> in<00:05:42.610> the<00:05:43.610> background<00:05:44.260> now<00:05:45.260> you

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
the same thing in the background now you

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.900 
the same thing in the background now you
see<00:05:45.590> I'm<00:05:45.710> getting<00:05:45.980> a<00:05:46.100> little<00:05:46.250> bit<00:05:46.520> of<00:05:46.670> color

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
see I'm getting a little bit of color

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.810 
see I'm getting a little bit of color
from<00:05:47.510> my<00:05:47.690> table<00:05:48.620> in<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.890> background<00:05:49.310> get<00:05:49.640> rid

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
from my table in the background get rid

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.400 
from my table in the background get rid
of<00:05:49.850> that<00:05:50.090> you<00:05:50.240> can<00:05:50.420> just<00:05:50.450> take<00:05:50.780> your<00:05:50.990> finger

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
of that you can just take your finger

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.800 
of that you can just take your finger
and<00:05:51.440> clean<00:05:52.340> off<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:52.700> oil<00:05:52.730> pastel<00:05:53.450> you<00:05:53.660> can

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810
