00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 at this place you see how some 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.290
 technology is enough for you 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.889
 crew and train that is they even in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.290
 this is all like a girl guys 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.480
 next day 7 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.960
 how to determine from the photo died 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.020
 man or is your task alive? 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.320
 first get to print a photo 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 alive and pictures of a dead person 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.750
 let's say this one is alive 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.030
 slides right you take the dead from the internet 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.710
 what obituaries of who 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.480
 guaranteed you know he can die like 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.280
 be some celebrity type 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.489
 yourself on 33 or just on the monitor 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.620
 You open two photos side by side with this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.539
 there are especially the following ones ie those in 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.730
 early coaching subjective skills 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.590
 once again I repeat it is subjective 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.140
 you know in advance that's alive somewhere 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.690
 norms proud and positive 3 decree for 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.489
 beginnings 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.550
 the task is to check the field from live and 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.010
 marked you hand in the whole world 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.450
 forty-fifty slowly lower but then 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.040
 what help we checked live 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.520
 man yes what you want 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 check 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.610
 down and feel the iphone go 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.460
 from his plus turn the next moment you 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.470
 you put it down, but his field 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.180
 which it radiates but resists 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.460
 you 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.080
 the opposite side david him 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.119
 the deceased person on board has a field 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.520
 structure but when you came out like this 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.979
 transfer and there is a field and there are bullets 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.290
 there is but when you slowly lower your hand 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.229
 such an effect that she falls there 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.850
 that is, does not resist if from the living 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.579
 do you have resistance this way 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.560
 knew how to do this, however, if not slowly, let him 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.600
 so here's a 2 bit hand tasting fruit 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.000
 although you know that this man has a field 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.490
 there is also 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.640
 if you are just one horizontal 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.820
 you will move your hands then this effect 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.399
 here moves pushes and this 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.060
 on the contrary, the effect is such that he is a bitch field 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.700
 there 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.610
 that he is taking away that's why 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.320
 here it falls so easily 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.780
 first you have to practice so that you 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.610
 clearly recognize where dead or alive 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.920
 man after that you need to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.270
 someone typed us arbitrarily 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.760
 photos but can even give you a whole 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.760
 website and obituaries of arbitrary people 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.940
 unknown to anyone as such let 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.860
 you produce print and you just 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.140
 here you pass by hand you define de dead 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.390
 and where is alive and it will be a good test 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.040
 objectivity testing started such 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.660
 so subjective to understand 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.560
 feel what's the difference what they are 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.260
 differ 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.650
 so that you and clear feelings to live 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.769
 and then you check accordingly 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.440
 objectivity here's a new technique for you 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:50.220
 you need to practice today 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.550
 crafts and tomorrow we move on to 8 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.550
 killed
