00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
blocks on an upstart so yeah I tried to

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.450 
blocks on an upstart so yeah I tried to
kind<00:01:32.050> of<00:01:32.200> keep<00:01:32.440> pretty<00:01:32.680> much<00:01:32.800> you<00:01:33.190> know<00:01:33.310> all

whole<00:01:39.400> vessel<00:01:39.580> other<00:01:40.210> side<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.660> right<00:01:40.750> the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
whole vessel other side the right the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.690 
whole vessel other side the right the

science you kind of teleport to whatever
so<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.460> tried<00:03:47.850> my<00:03:48.000> best<00:03:48.030> kind<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.540> keep<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:48.960> as

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
so I tried my best kind of keep it as

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.160 
so I tried my best kind of keep it as
simple<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.920> easy<00:03:50.460> as<00:03:50.790> possible<00:03:51.480> for<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:52.020> to

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
kind of move around the server safely

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.330 
kind of move around the server safely
and<00:03:54.450> easiest<00:03:55.110> by<00:03:55.350> certain<00:03:55.680> top<00:03:55.830> of<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.040> I've

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
and easiest by certain top of that I've

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.860 
and easiest by certain top of that I've
actually<00:03:56.520> given<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:56.910> menu<00:03:57.270> clock<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:57.750> can

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
actually given you a menu clock you can

actually given you a menu clock you can
actually<00:03:57.990> writing<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.620> many<00:03:58.860> clock<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.430> you

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
actually writing this many clock and you
