strong now a lot of you probably want to

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.450 
strong now a lot of you probably want to
know<00:01:32.330> what<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.440> information<00:01:33.620> on<00:01:34.070> in<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.340> as

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
know what the information on in it as

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.690 
know what the information on in it as
far<00:01:34.670> as<00:01:34.880> ingredients<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.780> calories<00:01:36.580> it<00:01:37.580> has

far as ingredients and calories it has
127<00:01:38.450> calories<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:39.200> if<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.380> compare<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.860> to

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
127 calories so if you compare that to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.790 
127 calories so if you compare that to
like<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.190> Bud<00:01:40.460> Light<00:01:40.490> or<00:01:41.530> one<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.680> other

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.380 
like a Bud Light or one of the other
ones<00:01:43.040> obviously<00:01:43.220> that's<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.790> lot<00:01:43.940> more<00:01:44.119> but

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
ones obviously that's a lot more but

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.940 
ones obviously that's a lot more but
again<00:01:44.660> you're<00:01:44.840> not<00:01:44.990> getting<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.320> gluten<00:01:45.710> and

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
again you're not getting the gluten and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.270 
again you're not getting the gluten and
you're<00:01:46.160> not<00:01:46.280> getting<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.610> week<00:01:46.820> in<00:01:47.390> your<00:01:47.600> diet
