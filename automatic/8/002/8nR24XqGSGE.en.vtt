top that little purple bolt of
electricity<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.239> very<00:02:08.600> powerful<00:02:09.320> I<00:02:11.980> guess

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
electricity is a very powerful I guess

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.199

you'd<00:02:13.130> say<00:02:13.160> cutting<00:02:14.320> utensil<00:02:15.320> with<00:02:15.950> paper<00:02:16.220> so

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
you'd say cutting utensil with paper so
