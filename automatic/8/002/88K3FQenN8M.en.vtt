it's<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.070> Walmart<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> guess<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:26.970> not

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it's at Walmart but I guess it's not

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.790 
it's at Walmart but I guess it's not
super<00:00:27.689> accessible<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.529> sold

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
super accessible as it's not sold

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.099 
super accessible as it's not sold
everywhere<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.939> L'Oreal<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.510> Magdalene<00:00:30.900> is

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
everywhere as L'Oreal or Magdalene is

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.870 
everywhere as L'Oreal or Magdalene is
but<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:31.859> look<00:00:32.070> quite<00:00:32.250> accessible<00:00:32.640> because

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
but it's look quite accessible because

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.520 
but it's look quite accessible because
they're<00:00:33.000> Walmart's<00:00:33.510> everywhere<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.410> it's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
they're Walmart's everywhere so it's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.319 
they're Walmart's everywhere so it's
much<00:00:34.649> easier<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.280> go<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.550> buy<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> store

is<00:01:37.770> actually<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.340> deep<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
is actually that deep so that is a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.480 
is actually that deep so that is a
downfall<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.159> deeper<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
downfall if you are deeper and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.760 
downfall if you are deeper and
complexion<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.420> let's<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.290> foundation

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
complexion so let's see this foundation

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.310 
complexion so let's see this foundation
wore<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.040> me<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.340> about<00:01:44.460> five<00:01:45.149> hours<00:01:45.869> before

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
wore on me for about five hours before

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.130 
wore on me for about five hours before
it<00:01:46.560> started<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.490> separate<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.030> my<00:01:48.299> nose<00:01:48.750> that's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it started to separate on my nose that's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.179 
it started to separate on my nose that's
the<00:01:49.200> only<00:01:49.350> place<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.649> ever<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:50.070> get

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
the only place that I ever really get

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.490 
the only place that I ever really get
separation<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.210> does<00:01:51.600> seem<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.079> settle<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
separation and it does seem to settle a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.340 
separation and it does seem to settle a
little<00:01:52.649> bit<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.100> my<00:01:53.250> lines<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.350> but

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
little bit in my lines right here but

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.289 
little bit in my lines right here but
that<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> decently<00:01:56.310> common<00:01:56.759> problem<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.270> I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that is a decently common problem that I

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.999 
that is a decently common problem that I
do<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.719> because<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.200> got<00:01:58.350> these<00:01:58.500> big<00:01:58.740> cheeks

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
do have because I got these big cheeks

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.999 
do have because I got these big cheeks
and<00:01:59.399> deep<00:02:00.060> lines<00:02:00.390> smile<00:02:01.140> lines<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.649> my<00:02:01.770> face

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and deep lines smile lines in my face

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.800 
and deep lines smile lines in my face
but<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.090> doesn't<00:02:03.390> happen<00:02:03.479> with<00:02:03.689> all

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
but it doesn't happen with all

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.749 
but it doesn't happen with all
foundation<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> downside<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
foundation so that is a downside of the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.789 
foundation so that is a downside of the
foundation<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.509> after<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.259> powdered<00:02:07.649> my<00:02:07.770> nose

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
foundation but after I powdered my nose

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.070 
foundation but after I powdered my nose
it<00:02:08.129> wasn't<00:02:08.429> too<00:02:08.610> bad<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:09.179> long<00:02:09.539> as<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:09.989> it

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
it wasn't too bad as long as you get it

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.420 
it wasn't too bad as long as you get it
in<00:02:10.200> time<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.619> doesn't<00:02:10.770> start<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.129> separate

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
in time and it doesn't start to separate

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.640 
in time and it doesn't start to separate
to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.830 
to
because<00:02:13.250> one<00:02:13.580> day<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.760> wore<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.450> got<00:02:14.720> it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
because one day I wore it and I got it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.150 
because one day I wore it and I got it
in<00:02:14.930> time<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.230> was<00:02:15.290> totally<00:02:15.590> fine<00:02:15.740> but<00:02:15.890> then<00:02:16.040> it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
in time it was totally fine but then it

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.580 
in time it was totally fine but then it
separated<00:02:16.580> they<00:02:17.420> let<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.810> go<00:02:17.960> too<00:02:18.020> long<00:02:18.320> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
separated they let it go too long the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.840 
separated they let it go too long the
next<00:02:18.860> day<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.040> when<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> powdered<00:02:19.730> it

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
next day so when I powdered it

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.930 
next day so when I powdered it
definitely<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.660> little<00:02:21.080> PC<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.100> it's<00:02:22.400> set<00:02:22.670> fine

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
definitely a little PC so it's set fine

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.820 
definitely a little PC so it's set fine
and<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:23.300> wasn't<00:02:23.450> horrible<00:02:23.750> by<00:02:24.320> any<00:02:24.470> means<00:02:24.710> but

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
and it wasn't horrible by any means but

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.120 
and it wasn't horrible by any means but
it<00:02:25.100> wasn't<00:02:25.430> fantastic<00:02:26.380> so<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.530> really<00:02:27.830> like<00:02:27.980> the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
it wasn't fantastic so I really like the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.730 
it wasn't fantastic so I really like the
finish<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:28.490> this<00:02:28.610> foundation<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.560> more<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.650> a

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
finish in this foundation it's more of a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.230 
finish in this foundation it's more of a
natural<00:02:30.920> foundation<00:02:31.250> as<00:02:31.670> what<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:31.820> can<00:02:32.060> tell<00:02:32.180> I

doesn't<00:02:32.510> seem<00:02:32.870> super<00:02:33.470> mad<00:02:33.620> on<00:02:33.740> me<00:02:33.860> at<00:02:33.950> all

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130

issue<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.370> my<00:03:22.490> nose<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.000> that's<00:03:23.510> not<00:03:23.690> with

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
issue is on my nose and that's not with

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.780 
issue is on my nose and that's not with
every<00:03:24.140> foundation<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:24.920> that<00:03:25.070> is<00:03:25.220> kind<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.700> a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
every foundation so that is kind of a

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.640 
every foundation so that is kind of a
downside<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.390> this<00:03:26.540> guy<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.990> don't<00:03:27.320> feel<00:03:27.500> like

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
downside of this guy I don't feel like

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.500 
downside of this guy I don't feel like
it's<00:03:27.800> a<00:03:28.010> hundred<00:03:28.310> percent<00:03:28.400> full<00:03:28.730> coverage<00:03:29.060> it

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
it's a hundred percent full coverage it

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.660 
it's a hundred percent full coverage it
seems<00:03:29.810> buildable<00:03:30.260> though<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.010> with<00:03:31.280> one<00:03:31.460> layer

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
seems buildable though so with one layer

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.740 
seems buildable though so with one layer
it's<00:03:32.030> pretty<00:03:32.480> I'd<00:03:32.750> say<00:03:32.900> it's<00:03:33.050> like<00:03:33.370> medium

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
it's pretty I'd say it's like medium

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.120 
it's pretty I'd say it's like medium
upper<00:03:35.750> medium<00:03:36.080> coverage<00:03:36.350> not<00:03:36.710> quite<00:03:36.950> full

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
upper medium coverage not quite full

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.610 
upper medium coverage not quite full
coverage<00:03:37.430> but<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.270> is<00:03:38.450> really<00:03:38.660> nice<00:03:38.870> but

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
coverage but it is really nice but

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.680 
coverage but it is really nice but
considering<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.850> price<00:03:41.150> in<00:03:41.480> the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
considering the price in the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.240 
considering the price in the
accessibility<00:03:42.350> it's<00:03:42.560> not<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:42.860> bad<00:03:43.040> foundation

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
accessibility it's not a bad foundation

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.970 
accessibility it's not a bad foundation
at<00:03:43.610> all<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:43.910> really<00:03:44.210> do<00:03:44.600> love<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.710> there<00:03:45.860> is<00:03:45.950> a
