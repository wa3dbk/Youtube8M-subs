and now you see that the masala is not
needed<00:03:28.640> if<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.150> set<00:03:29.360> your<00:03:29.510> slicer<00:03:29.810> settings

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
is very easy to separate both filaments

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.360 
is very easy to separate both filaments
afterwards<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.440> gap<00:03:36.620> also<00:03:36.890> needs<00:03:37.250> to
