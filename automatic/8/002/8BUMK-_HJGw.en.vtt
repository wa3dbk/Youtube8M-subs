 romagné a well filled weekend since 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.320
 the motorcycle club still wants to put in 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.180
 honor to the young people we will have some 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.000
 small on 50 cubic centimeters 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.650
 65 of the 85 but of course the most 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.790
 important this day is the 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.649

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.500

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.879
 renault pichon boisramé short is the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.149
 summary of this board in pictures while 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.149
 right now 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 in the first heat it's a pretty good start 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.809
 muscled on the part of matisse boisramé 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.239
 which cuts the antony trajectory for 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.159
 whose holeshot and signed and stone 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.760
 greens fillon in front of boisramé and maxim 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.290
 renaud the local of the stage takes the lead 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.180
 very quickly and loop the first 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.729
 turn in the lead with already a little advance 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 on a bottle close up by maxime 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.110
 renaud who ends up overtaking him in turn 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.610
 following 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.740
 a little indented at carrie fisher 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.509
 still learning in the junior category 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.729
 he leaves only 7th and after a fall 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.070
 he only points 18th in the fourth round 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.200
 the little pichon will go up 10th at the end of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.700
 round if the first two places do not 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.680
 will not move despite a fall from the leader 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.539
 at the end of the race for the 3rd position 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.000
 fought until the last lap 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.100
 between anthony bourdon and stephen rubini 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.680
 it was he who had the last word for 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.360
 third place in this heat 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.160
 won by matisse boisramé in front 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.600
 maxime renault 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.060
 I was a little too much on the front and had 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.860
 a pebble and that ejected me I could not 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.300
 to do but hey I really had 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.340
 lucky luckily that I had a 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.420
 little progress since I was able to leave and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.280
 it really came formats and 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.410
 years ago I took a little bit but 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.580
 good it's not very serious and I advise 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.580
 to do in the second run 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.140
 it is again a cat signed stone 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.970
 bottle brush in the second run of 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.970
 revenge that drone and pichon 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.739
 leader change in early turns 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.480
 pichon turns in the lead 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.790
 and then in turn woodramé drone is 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.470
 always in the game and it starts from 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.650
 worries for pichon that only makes 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:05.709
 move back to the standings then 3rd 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:11.579
 he passes by rubini then 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.579
 Pichon brush will finish 6th 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.629
 in the 8th round in battle for the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.849
 third place we find rubini and 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.040
 renault and it's the latter who 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.180
 will win the duel to make a 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.180
 small place on the podium 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.740
 here 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.510
 the round is again dominated by 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.510
 victorious woodramé in front of bumblebee 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.860
 you have to score big points and take 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.510
 started taking risks for 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.310
 go get the championship lead 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.990
 because otherwise it's going to get away 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.200
 but it's really really good that I 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.000
 wins today at amon moto club this 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.920
