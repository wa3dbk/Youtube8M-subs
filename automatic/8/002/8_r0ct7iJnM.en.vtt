00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.290
 notice how cool we are 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.330
 it turns out see we have 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.809
 electric petrol pump outlet 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.100
 here is such a yes and we have a tee 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.390
 who stayed with the same system here 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.500
 see the inside diameter here 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.210
 direct channel we have is 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.570
 less we have yes it 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.670
 natural jet if we connect 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 this tee follows this one 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.110
 end we will connect to the gas tank for 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.210
 plum yes this end we will connect to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.930
 carburetor then we get 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.250
 the natural lives inside the section here 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.260
 this channel is more than that 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.910
 accordingly we have 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.690
 genes close to the resistance of this one 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.680
 the battle will be much less than this 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.420
 accordingly, we have more pressure 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.460
 will be enough here in this part that is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.840
 more fuel will go away 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.250
 from the output of the electric fuel pump 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.409
 tank until a small part of the fuel will go by 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.070
 this channel to the carburetor and through 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.000
 carburetor drain line that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.130
 will go back tank so we have 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.329
 very cool even without 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.290
 installation of additional nozzles 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.759
 after installation we must measure 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.850
 resulting pressure in the supply system 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.909
 yes and according to received 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.420
 result we will make the decision quite 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.240
 it is possible that we will need 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.570
 install the jet directly to this 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.930
 to whom 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.420
 if we have hydraulic resistance 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.020
 Here in this channel will be so 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.299
 big that fuel all all fuel 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.500
 will leave therefore the channel is quite 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.340
 probably 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.850
 and this situation is therefore not going to be 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.110
 hurry 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.480
 Now let's connect this system 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.360
 hydraulic system as we conceived 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.570
 then we change the value and we will decide 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.570
 already obtained data
