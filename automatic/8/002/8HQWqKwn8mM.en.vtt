a series of uitableview tutorials in
this<00:00:06.299> tutorial<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:07.049> will<00:00:07.080> be<00:00:07.440> populating<00:00:08.250> a

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
this tutorial we will be populating a

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.970 
this tutorial we will be populating a
table<00:00:08.730> from<00:00:08.880> an<00:00:09.030> NS<00:00:09.389> array<00:00:09.570> now<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.800> tutorial

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
table from an NS array now this tutorial

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.430 
table from an NS array now this tutorial
will<00:00:11.370> be<00:00:11.610> simple<00:00:12.090> but<00:00:12.570> it's<00:00:12.809> very<00:00:13.080> effective

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
will be simple but it's very effective

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.740 
will be simple but it's very effective
in<00:00:13.920> getting<00:00:14.250> what<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.820> want<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.330> your<00:00:15.360> table

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
in getting what you want in your table

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:26.790 
in getting what you want in your table

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.140 

and<00:00:28.720> create<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.810> new<00:00:29.900> project<00:00:30.580> this<00:00:31.580> time<00:00:31.910> it'll

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
and create a new project this time it'll

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.840 
and create a new project this time it'll
be<00:00:32.330> a<00:00:32.360> navigation<00:00:33.230> based<00:00:33.530> project<00:00:34.220> and<00:00:34.490> hit

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
be a navigation based project and hit
