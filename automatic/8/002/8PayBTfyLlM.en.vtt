have commented that the game is hard to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.260

navigate with its many different screens

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.450 
navigate with its many different screens
but<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> map<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.890> actually<00:00:59.100> quite

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
but I think the map is actually quite

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.060 
but I think the map is actually quite
informative<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:01.260> shows<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.770> what

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
informative and actually shows you what

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.200 
informative and actually shows you what
you<00:01:02.219> still<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.670> collect<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
you still have to collect in the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.820 
you still have to collect in the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
different areas such as where there are

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
different areas such as where there are
cubes<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.460> where<00:01:05.580> there<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.790> secrets<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.299> be

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.060 
I really think that this fits with a lot
of<00:01:44.340> board<00:01:44.909> game<00:01:45.350> mentality<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
of board game mentality because it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.340 
of board game mentality because it

encourages you to explore and to solve

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.639 
encourages you to explore and to solve
puzzles<00:01:50.100> using<00:01:50.340> your<00:01:50.579> brain<00:01:50.790> rather<00:01:51.030> than

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
puzzles using your brain rather than
