00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.410 
three we've got a nice rolled edge that
allows<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.800> board<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.130> turn<00:01:47.399> over<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.940> when

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
allows the board to turn over and when

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.820 
allows the board to turn over and when
you<00:01:48.509> get<00:01:48.660> back<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> back<00:01:49.319> you<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> nice

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
you get back to the back you get a nice

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.380 
you get back to the back you get a nice
sharp<00:01:50.220> edge<00:01:50.399> which<00:01:50.700> gives<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.030> board<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
sharp edge which gives the board the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.479 
sharp edge which gives the board the
speed<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:51.899> stay<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.410> wave<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.920> that's<00:01:53.310> why

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:53.489 
speed to stay in the wave and that's why

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:55.089 
speed to stay in the wave and that's why
it<00:01:53.580> works<00:01:53.789> so<00:01:53.880> well<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.450> bigger<00:01:54.599> guys

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099 
it works so well for the bigger guys

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.919 
it works so well for the bigger guys

resign<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.629> super<00:02:16.049> super<00:02:16.349> fast

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
resign in super super fast

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.760 
resign in super super fast
right<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:17.520> which<00:02:17.790> very<00:02:18.210> easily<00:02:18.540> kick<00:02:19.440> tales

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
right it's which very easily kick tales

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.390 
right it's which very easily kick tales
are<00:02:20.070> built<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:21.050> you've<00:02:22.050> got<00:02:22.230> dual<00:02:22.650> fin<00:02:22.950> system

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
are built in you've got dual fin system

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.060 
are built in you've got dual fin system
back<00:02:23.580> there<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:24.480> loose<00:02:24.990> it's<00:02:25.380> fast<00:02:25.710> it

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
back there so it's loose it's fast it

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.130 
back there so it's loose it's fast it
drives<00:02:26.370> down<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.760> line<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.330> its<00:02:27.780> really

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
drives down the line and its really

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.500 
drives down the line and its really
really<00:02:28.500> lightweight<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.000> gets<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.300> lot<00:02:30.450> of

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
really lightweight so it gets a lot of

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.690 
really lightweight so it gets a lot of
air<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.140> can<00:02:31.260> get<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> ton<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.550> way<00:02:32.640> you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
air so you can get a ton of the way you

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.880 
air so you can get a ton of the way you
can<00:02:33.030> do<00:02:33.180> some<00:02:33.420> maneuvers<00:02:34.110> off<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> lips<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
can do some maneuvers off the lips and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.930 
can do some maneuvers off the lips and
shove<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:36.150> have<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> good<00:02:36.540> time<00:02:36.690> up
