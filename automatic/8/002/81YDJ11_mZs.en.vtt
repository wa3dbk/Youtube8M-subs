00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.450 
ninja Lloyd because I don't know I just
think<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.530> would<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.770> really<00:01:28.799> cool<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.310> mean

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
think that would be really cool I mean

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.859 
think that would be really cool I mean
having<00:01:29.729> multiple<00:01:30.240> versions<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.750> these

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
having multiple versions of these

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.630 
having multiple versions of these
characters<00:01:31.140> would<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.770> nice<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
characters would be really nice but of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399 
characters would be really nice but of
course<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.119> don't<00:01:33.329> want<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:34.229> they

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
course if they don't want to then they

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.859 
course if they don't want to then they
could<00:01:34.560> leave<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> Ninjago<00:01:35.820> Lego<00:01:36.600> game

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
that it's just really cool and of course

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.500 
that it's just really cool and of course
if<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.430> look<00:03:56.579> carefully<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.150> back<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.480> can

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
if you look carefully the back you can

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.960 
if you look carefully the back you can
even<00:03:57.720> see<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.199> tubes<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.340> know<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.699> his

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
even see the tubes that you know in his

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.490 
even see the tubes that you know in his
back<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.269> everything<00:04:00.720> which<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:00.930> also<00:04:01.349> nice

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
back and everything which is also nice

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.220 
back and everything which is also nice
now<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> think<00:04:02.699> Bane<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.480> going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.720> be<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> very

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
now I think Bane is going to be a very

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.140 
now I think Bane is going to be a very
unique<00:04:04.709> character<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.519> game<00:04:05.639> because<00:04:06.060> he

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
unique character in this game because he

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.300 
unique character in this game because he
can<00:04:06.299> transform<00:04:06.599> into<00:04:07.199> a<00:04:07.319> big<00:04:07.590> figure<00:04:07.919> version

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
can transform into a big figure version

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.490 
can transform into a big figure version
of<00:04:08.400> himself<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:09.150> we<00:04:09.359> haven't<00:04:09.629> seen<00:04:09.840> any<00:04:10.199> big

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
of himself and we haven't seen any big

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.750 
of himself and we haven't seen any big
figures<00:04:10.889> that<00:04:11.129> have<00:04:11.220> been<00:04:11.370> announced<00:04:11.730> for

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
figures that have been announced for

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.819 
figures that have been announced for
this<00:04:11.940> game<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.780> definitely<00:04:13.410> think<00:04:13.650> he's

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
this game so I definitely think he's

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.199 
this game so I definitely think he's
going<00:04:13.949> to<00:04:14.010> be<00:04:14.069> probably<00:04:14.760> one<00:04:14.879> of<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.090> most

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
going to be probably one of the most

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.060 
going to be probably one of the most
unique<00:04:15.599> playable<00:04:16.229> characters<00:04:16.709> in<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.039> game

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
unique playable characters in the game

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.550 
unique playable characters in the game
so<00:04:17.519> far<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.269> could<00:04:18.570> soon<00:04:18.599> change<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:19.380> mean

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
so far but that could soon change I mean

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.140 
so far but that could soon change I mean
there<00:04:19.769> could<00:04:19.919> be<00:04:19.949> more<00:04:20.609> big<00:04:20.820> figure

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
there could be more big figure

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.450 
there could be more big figure
characters<00:04:21.630> revealed<00:04:22.019> at<00:04:22.169> e3<00:04:22.289> we<00:04:22.919> will<00:04:23.070> just

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
characters revealed at e3 we will just

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.330 
characters revealed at e3 we will just
have<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.820> wait<00:04:23.849> and<00:04:24.000> see<00:04:24.680> alright<00:04:25.680> so<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.099> last

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
have to wait and see alright so the last

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.100 
have to wait and see alright so the last
thing<00:04:26.490> I'm<00:04:26.700> going<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.880> be

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
thing I'm going to be

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
is really cool i think my favorite of

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.429 
is really cool i think my favorite of
the<00:04:37.819> vehicles<00:04:38.270> have<00:04:38.479> has<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.990> be<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.199> quinn

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:39.439 
the vehicles have has to be the quinn

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.830 
the vehicles have has to be the quinn
mobile<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.069> you<00:04:40.729> know<00:04:40.819> you<00:04:41.300> have<00:04:41.479> to<00:04:41.509> say<00:04:41.719> the

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
mobile and you know you have to say the

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.629 
mobile and you know you have to say the
joke<00:04:42.050> I<00:04:42.169> mean<00:04:42.319> the<00:04:42.409> Joker<00:04:42.560> just<00:04:42.919> looks<00:04:43.099> so<00:04:43.340> cool

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
joke I mean the Joker just looks so cool

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.550 
joke I mean the Joker just looks so cool
here<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.150> think<00:04:44.569> the<00:04:44.659> little<00:04:44.810> flag<00:04:45.169> at<00:04:45.349> the<00:04:45.439> end

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
here I think the little flag at the end

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.360 
here I think the little flag at the end
of<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.740> gun<00:04:45.889> is<00:04:46.159> a<00:04:46.189> reference<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:48.800> comics

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
of the gun is a reference to the comics

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.189 
of the gun is a reference to the comics
and<00:04:49.639> and<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.180> guess<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.479> animated<00:04:50.840> series<00:04:50.870> is

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
and and I guess the animated series is

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.080 
and and I guess the animated series is
well<00:04:51.379> we're<00:04:51.590> like<00:04:51.710> he<00:04:51.889> shoots<00:04:52.189> and<00:04:52.460> then<00:04:52.939> it's

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
well we're like he shoots and then it's

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.429 
well we're like he shoots and then it's
like<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.240> joke<00:04:53.539> and<00:04:53.750> then<00:04:53.810> he<00:04:53.930> actually<00:04:54.050> shoots

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
like a joke and then he actually shoots

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.050 
like a joke and then he actually shoots
them<00:04:54.680> so<00:04:55.039> I<00:04:55.099> think<00:04:55.159> it's<00:04:55.400> a<00:04:55.460> reference<00:04:55.639> to<00:04:55.939> that

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
them so I think it's a reference to that

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.119 
them so I think it's a reference to that
which<00:04:56.210> is<00:04:56.330> pretty<00:04:56.479> cool<00:04:56.719> now<00:04:57.319> while<00:04:57.590> this<00:04:57.800> is

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
which is pretty cool now while this is

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.640 
which is pretty cool now while this is
the<00:04:58.580> last<00:04:58.849> you<00:04:59.569> know<00:04:59.629> thing<00:05:00.169> we'll<00:05:00.379> be<00:05:00.469> talking
