get<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.690> best<00:02:27.900> signal<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.950> have<00:02:29.070> this

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
get the best signal like we have this

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.980 
get the best signal like we have this
new<00:02:29.340> JC<00:02:29.670> Penney's<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.180> i<00:02:30.270> don't<00:02:30.450> get<00:02:30.570> absolute

any<00:02:31.260> signal<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:31.800> there<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.550> everyone<00:02:32.880> else

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
any signal in there but everyone else

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.370 
any signal in there but everyone else
does<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.390> i<00:02:33.510> think<00:02:33.630> it's<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:34.050> because<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
does so i think it's just because the

does so i think it's just because the
crappy<00:02:34.800> cell<00:02:35.520> phone<00:02:35.730> towers<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.300> all<00:02:36.360> that
