about right I am a panel beta and that's
what<00:00:26.430> I've<00:00:26.519> done<00:00:26.670> all<00:00:26.820> my<00:00:26.910> life<00:00:27.180> since<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.720> was

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
what I've done all my life since I was

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.479 
what I've done all my life since I was
about<00:00:27.900> 13<00:00:28.640> 14<00:00:30.560> when<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> started<00:00:31.679> my

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
about 13 14 when I started my

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.639 
about 13 14 when I started my
apprenticeship<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.750> painter<00:00:34.079> said<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> me<00:00:34.440> so

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
apprenticeship the painter said to me so

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.530 
apprenticeship the painter said to me so
on<00:00:34.710> instead<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.610> priming<00:00:36.149> cars<00:00:36.360> your

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
on instead of just priming cars your

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.530 
on instead of just priming cars your
models<00:00:36.899> learn<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> paint<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:37.680> well<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.540> we

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
models learn to paint them as well so we

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.350 
models learn to paint them as well so we
painted<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.989> car<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:41.190> interior<00:00:41.360> didn't

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
painted the car the interior didn't

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.470 
painted the car the interior didn't
match<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.200> outside<00:00:43.700> so<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.969> thought<00:00:45.180> well

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
match the outside so we thought well

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.750 
match the outside so we thought well
what<00:00:46.350> we're<00:00:46.559> going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
what we're going to do and one of the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760 
what we're going to do and one of the
painters<00:00:48.420> there<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> was<00:00:49.230> employed<00:00:49.620> at<00:00:49.739> the

painters there that was employed at the
post<00:00:50.039> said<00:00:50.390> it's<00:00:51.390> will<00:00:51.570> drain<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> dashboard

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
post said it's will drain the dashboard

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.130

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.990 
so we just say the custom look can we
put<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> bit<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> dashboard<00:00:56.610> then<00:00:56.789> that's

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
put a bit on the dashboard then that's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.569

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.200 

you're<00:02:09.470> going<00:02:09.620> to<00:02:09.710> mask<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.130> all<00:02:10.220> up<00:02:10.460> around

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
you're going to mask it all up around

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.970 
you're going to mask it all up around
this<00:02:11.390> edge<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.290> we'll<00:02:12.560> paint<00:02:12.800> this

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
this edge here and we'll paint this

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.960 
this edge here and we'll paint this
black<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:14.510> can<00:02:14.690> make<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.260> stand<00:02:15.530> out

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
black so we can make this stand out

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.100 
black so we can make this stand out
after<00:02:16.970> we've<00:02:17.120> done<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.450> we<00:02:17.600> can<00:02:17.780> put<00:02:17.990> the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
after we've done that we can put the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.080 
after we've done that we can put the
stain<00:02:18.380> color<00:02:18.680> on<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.190> get<00:02:19.520> our<00:02:19.640> color<00:02:19.850> that

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
stain color on it and get our color that

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.130 
stain color on it and get our color that
we<00:02:20.180> want<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.480> give<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.870> timber<00:02:21.500> effect

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.010 

so<00:02:28.010> now<00:02:28.190> we're<00:02:28.430> going<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.940> put<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.540> clear<00:02:29.810> on

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
so now we're going to put the clear on

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.460 
so now we're going to put the clear on
which<00:02:30.680> will<00:02:30.860> give<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.370> paint<00:02:32.270> job<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.780> shine

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
which will give the paint job a shine

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.900 
which will give the paint job a shine
and<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:34.580> protective<00:02:35.060> coating<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:36.910> hoping

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
and a protective coating and hoping

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.070 
and a protective coating and hoping
everything<00:02:38.210> comes<00:02:38.420> out<00:02:38.570> well<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.870> if<00:02:38.990> it

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
everything comes out well and if it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.170 
everything comes out well and if it
doesn't<00:02:39.260> come<00:02:39.500> out<00:02:39.530> well<00:02:39.820> we<00:02:40.820> were<00:02:40.910> looking

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
doesn't come out well we were looking
