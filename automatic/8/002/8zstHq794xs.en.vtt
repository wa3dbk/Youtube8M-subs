he's on he's on a race car so he's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.189 
he's on he's on a race car so he's
performing<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.940> lot<00:01:03.090> better<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.600> hard

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
performing a lot better on the hard

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.810 
performing a lot better on the hard
surfaces<00:01:04.800> like<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> concrete<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.610> wood

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
surfaces like the concrete in the wood

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.000 
surfaces like the concrete in the wood
and<00:01:06.090> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> slows<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> dirt<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and kind of slows down on the dirt and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370 
and kind of slows down on the dirt and
the<00:01:08.040> grass<00:01:08.330> for<00:01:09.330> Eggman<00:01:09.750> he's<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.050> monster

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the grass for Eggman he's in a monster

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.780 
the grass for Eggman he's in a monster
truck<00:01:10.410> so<00:01:10.740> he<00:01:10.770> actually<00:01:11.040> performs<00:01:11.430> better<00:01:11.580> on

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
truck so he actually performs better on

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.820 
truck so he actually performs better on
the<00:01:11.880> dirt<00:01:12.030> McGrath<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.840> slows<00:01:13.410> down<00:01:13.590> during

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the dirt McGrath and slows down during

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.760 
the dirt McGrath and slows down during
the<00:01:13.950> concrete<00:01:14.430> roots<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.690> little<00:01:15.750> homage<00:01:16.710> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
