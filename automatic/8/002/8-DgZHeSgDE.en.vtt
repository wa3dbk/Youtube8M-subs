 problem that appeared in the index 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.790
 now called to the death screen as well 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.650
 It's when you were being professional. 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.550
 in the notebook asus nÃ© 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.160
 and he gives this kind of error that it does not 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.699
 would normally only have to give you this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.099
 famous screen of death 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.260
 this stop error 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.759
 how is this researching several 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.760
 shapes 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.110
 Then I realized that this error and the way 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.510
 from boot 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.190

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.840
 mother account and neither cia e ltda this error that 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:52.699

00:00:45.840 --> 00:01:02.399
 guti that make a few months in the disease 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:08.689
 decreasing legal sakineh again and opening 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:15.810
 cm to edit next command here 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:21.170
 very select to enter your 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.170
 professional usually the index 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.430

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.340
 Asus notebook that I got all have 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.360
 this problem here then this is an error 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.759
