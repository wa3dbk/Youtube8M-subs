00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.009
 Edition is a mix of video game 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.870
 with now cancer there is only one story 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.650
 But minecraft is so 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.600
 no we do not talk about geograf for it 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.310
 Today it is about change as many know 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 the change or allusion alien one 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.760
 but that's not all 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 also provide secrets with the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.390
 Although most people know that they have water and are 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.410
 at home is the so-called apps and what 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.030
 then both values ​​spectator is that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.290
 Keyword before today's story 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.000
 is about a gamer whose name 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.050
 we do not call it a known one 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.610
 my name is jeff had like china 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.110
 but also a separate server together 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.370
 have their group with his friends 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.020
 already done a lot she has many 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.760
 houses built there was unlimited from now on 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 Diamond and the dragon became too 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.250
 defeated during the fight against the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.660
 Men broke up among others 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.399
 Water used to change when 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.320
 so he defeated and his 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.430
 Friends who wore dragons moved two weeks 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.050
 have passed since then and it has been 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.579
 somewhat boring on the server 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.500
 Chef also came up with the idea of ​​other players 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.390
 Dream Live We Fall Set up one 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.710
 Porter in Sands was home to it 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.820
 remember if he wanted one more 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.740
 step on and the end 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.299
 completely flood around other players in the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.979
 his trap to scare and frighten 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.049
 Of course, sometimes also ender pearls too 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.850
 Drive with the help of the fly command 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.229
 it started flooding the n 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.580
 he was the only one on the times 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.049
 the server and was looking forward to how 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.490
 the others can react to some 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.259
 element died directly and others 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.640
 telephones away on hopeless 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.530
 the later also in water 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.020
 converts were, there was no chance to 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.670
 escaped elevation lions tunnel everything 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.409
 was flooded with it all really dead 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.090
 are indeed engaged in the fun 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.100
 to leave some spots at the edge more free 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.000
 so that in the end too satisfied 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.320
 the moment of the stage 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320
 to be washed away that was one 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.670
 real killing somewhere sorry though 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.020
 on the other side was fun i am 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.909
 there are only a few moments he thought 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.690
 it is only one more death of 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.670
 change the last one 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.320
 was not a normal many slow motion around 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.240
 the todesco but much louder than usual 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.980
 all at once the animation repeats 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.080
 over and over again until the game 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.090
 may crash powerfully ran out of memory 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.010
 you know yes, most also do 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.150
 would instead of the minecraft again 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.590
 would probably just be a glitch of 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.090
 through the amount of water came about 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.490
 when, however, wanted to catch again came 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.990
 the error message world notw shit 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.430
 that he did it again became some 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.260
 if damaged, fortunately, 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.060
 still had a backup world of the kites 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.320
 but not yet defeated, he was peter 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.790
 everything is still running races decided 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.710
 to defeat before he goes to bed 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.790
 but when boss arrived merkel that 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.410
 something is wrong 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.970
 the tower christa was there but far 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.800
 and no dragon and the ender 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.000
 mend were also part of the mr because 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.950
 by cent so far at a time 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.480
 something was hit the crystals 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.160
 Reacted and chef realized that he did 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.630
 in reality invisible is evidently 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.830
 has not loaded the world properly and 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.750
 This time before and also have the 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.460
 calculator new high in athens came afterwards 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.930
 Although back, but the answer somehow 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.190
 still missing yes and one 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.780
 easier fight he thought himself and 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.580
 he defeated the dragon within 20 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.770
 minutes suddenly something crazy happened 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.300
 is the texture of the matter in the rodeo 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.040
 I teleported out of that 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.660
 Already there unicredit com was on 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.580
 Once the texture of water was there 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.320
 just normal water in well jobs 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.090
 jumped in but the game crash again 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.440
 Suddenly there was death again 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.820
 writes from the last traders from 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.110
 which was actually part of the old game part 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.120
 but it can not really be that 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.040
 strange is always repeated 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.330
 and again and again the truth is still 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.190
 to try and sat one last 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.540
 times the mining braced mainz advantage 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.560
 that I hijacked but that either 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.320
 not what it used to be 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.940
 instead at an endless room in 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.380
 an endless dark room 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.750
 He really wanted to find out what he wanted 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.370
 was and always ran straight ahead suddenly 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.110
 would be placed the bridge in direction 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.190
 but they were not talking about that 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.650
 death slipped with the end of may 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.780
 Of course, this time more often and loud 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.430
 once so loud that jeff seriously 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.690
 he did not want to be afraid 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.280
 Restart his rhythms to nothing 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.200
 So losing love it was one 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.580
 really gloomy atmosphere and slow 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.690
 feel the fear but can not 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.320
 understand it correctly because it really only 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.730
 a game 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.180
 now he wanted out but old 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.980
 Fourth also no longer function 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.959
 she pleads change if right in front of her 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.670
 the game looks him right in the 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.019
 Augen sees that a player looks like 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.129
 Serene sky is under water and 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.109
 can not move 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.370
 the message you're dead block 3 on the 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.959
 background of the traders with you always 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.730
 her eyes still look and not die 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.769
 although he underwater without warning 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.079
 crashed computer five seconds later 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.969
 and jobs are in the dark 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.139
 sweatbathed soul i fucking shield on 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.370
 next day he sends his friends 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.200
 also or they have nothing 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.209
 like the energystar the parents 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.920
 are there all normal and jeff was 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.340
 sure that was definitely not luck 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.329
 there has to be more to it now 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.459
 Rate I would be interested 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.500
 What you think of the story you think 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.820
 that ever writes you have with and with 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.849
 want to hear more of such stories 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.250
 then give the platform but right to stay 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:25.160
 bizarre products and here he calls 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.930
 made of cloth or you close the big one 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.289
 Names do not really forget anything 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.289
