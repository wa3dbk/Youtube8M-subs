00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
maps I was the most excited for this map

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.000 
maps I was the most excited for this map
once<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.390> played<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.810> after<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.200> week<00:02:29.379> I'm

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
once I played it after a week I'm

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.860 
once I played it after a week I'm
actually<00:02:30.250> kind<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.720> disappointed<00:02:31.720> at<00:02:31.840> all

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
actually kind of disappointed at all

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.380 
actually kind of disappointed at all
yeah<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:32.709> because<00:02:33.069> zip<00:02:33.610> lines<00:02:33.879> is<00:02:34.120> not<00:02:34.270> as

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
yeah just because zip lines is not as

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.270 
yeah just because zip lines is not as
long<00:02:34.540> as<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.780> thought<00:02:35.080> they<00:02:35.470> would<00:02:35.650> be<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.099> I

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
long as I thought they would be and I

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.300 
long as I thought they would be and I
find<00:02:36.549> that<00:02:36.670> there's<00:02:36.849> two

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
find that there's two

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.729 
find that there's two
rooms<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.180> two<00:02:38.420> plenty<00:02:38.630> places<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:39.050> hide<00:02:39.319> in

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
rooms and two plenty places to hide in

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.470 
rooms and two plenty places to hide in
this<00:02:39.860> map<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.430> feel<00:02:40.760> like<00:02:40.849> there's<00:02:41.030> not<00:02:41.180> enough

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
this map I feel like there's not enough

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.870 
this map I feel like there's not enough
action<00:02:41.690> especially<00:02:42.200> in<00:02:42.650> team<00:02:42.920> deathmatch<00:02:43.130> out

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
action especially in team deathmatch out

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.400 
action especially in team deathmatch out
of<00:02:44.000> all<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.209> maps<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.540> had<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.840> least<00:02:45.020> fun<00:02:45.290> of

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
of all the maps I had the least fun of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.229 
of all the maps I had the least fun of
this<00:02:45.590> man<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.040> hard<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.280> drive<00:02:46.520> your<00:02:46.670> RC<00:02:47.000> car

this man it's hard to drive your RC car
in<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.480> man<00:02:47.660> if<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.380> very<00:02:48.680> hard<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.950> go

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
in this man if it is very hard to go

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.680 
in this man if it is very hard to go
right<00:02:49.340> off<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.700> edge<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.910> yeah<00:02:50.090> there's<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
right off the edge of yeah there's the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.690 
right off the edge of yeah there's the
monkeys<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.290> cage<00:02:55.150> God<00:02:56.150> touch<00:02:56.450> my<00:02:56.750> hair

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.020 
hoping that they could go on the ice and
you<00:03:05.630> slide<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.709> can't<00:03:06.890> go<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.130> center<00:03:07.489> ice<00:03:07.580> but

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
you slide you can't go to center ice but

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.550 
you slide you can't go to center ice but
be<00:03:08.420> thinking<00:03:08.780> about<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:09.080> it's<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.290> good<00:03:09.440> thing

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.170 
be thinking about it it's a good thing
that<00:03:09.620> treyarch<00:03:10.069> is<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.489> right<00:03:10.730> because<00:03:11.060> you

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
that treyarch is that right because you

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.449 
that treyarch is that right because you
can't<00:03:11.390> put<00:03:11.600> like<00:03:11.780> flags<00:03:12.350> a<00:03:12.709> checkpoint<00:03:13.190> there

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
can't put like flags a checkpoint there

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
a disaster it's very tight map I feel

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.880 
a disaster it's very tight map I feel
like<00:03:23.450> it's<00:03:23.630> always<00:03:23.840> action<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.650> she<00:03:24.769> had

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
like it's always action so I she had

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.350 
like it's always action so I she had
team<00:03:25.099> deathmatch<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:25.790> ground<00:03:26.000> water<00:03:26.120> when<00:03:26.299> I

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
team deathmatch and ground water when I

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.660

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
saw the ice rink I really thought that I

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
that bad game movie sudden death I

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.559 
that bad game movie sudden death I
almost<00:03:34.099> greatly<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:34.880> think<00:03:35.239> there's<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.480> little

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
like what the hell is going on well you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.090 
like what the hell is going on well you
turn<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.420> lights<00:03:50.630> on<00:03:50.840> upstairs<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.680> then<00:03:51.950> it

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
turn the lights on upstairs and then it

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.039 
turn the lights on upstairs and then it
goes<00:03:52.250> back<00:03:52.310> into<00:03:52.760> color<00:03:53.060> mode<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.569> gravity

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
goes back into color mode the gravity

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.520 
goes back into color mode the gravity
simulator<00:03:54.530> cuz<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.310> can<00:03:55.489> duck<00:03:55.760> edge<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:57.290> then

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
simulator cuz you can duck edge and then

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.140

what's<00:04:00.859> new<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.250> this<00:04:01.370> map<00:04:01.670> is<00:04:01.910> that<00:04:02.329> there's

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
what's new to this map is that there's

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.240 
what's new to this map is that there's
space<00:04:02.780> monkeys<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.470> Russian<00:04:03.769> space<00:04:03.950> program

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
space monkeys the Russian space program

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.970 
space monkeys the Russian space program
train<00:04:05.180> these<00:04:05.359> monkeys<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:05.959> go<00:04:06.079> to<00:04:06.139> space<00:04:06.500> like

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
train these monkeys to go to space like

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.979 
train these monkeys to go to space like
everyone<00:04:07.459> does<00:04:07.670> right<00:04:08.030> okay<00:04:08.450> monkeys<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:08.930> do

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
everyone does right okay monkeys I do

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.569 
everyone does right okay monkeys I do
the<00:04:09.200> same<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.739> throw<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.040> grenades<00:04:10.310> at<00:04:10.489> the

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
the same you throw the grenades at the

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.190 
the same you throw the grenades at the
space<00:04:10.850> monkeys<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.450> they<00:04:11.569> throw<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.959> grenade

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
space monkeys and they throw the grenade

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.750 
space monkeys and they throw the grenade
right<00:04:12.230> back<00:04:12.709> at<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.160> they're<00:04:13.579> actually

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
right back at you and they're actually

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.759 
right back at you and they're actually
very<00:04:14.030> small<00:04:14.720> smaller<00:04:15.079> than<00:04:15.139> you<00:04:15.319> expect<00:04:15.650> them

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
very small smaller than you expect them

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:16.990 
very small smaller than you expect them
they're<00:04:15.889> really<00:04:16.100> hard<00:04:16.250> to<00:04:16.310> shoot<00:04:16.609> these<00:04:16.820> are

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
they're really hard to shoot these are

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.270 
they're really hard to shoot these are
