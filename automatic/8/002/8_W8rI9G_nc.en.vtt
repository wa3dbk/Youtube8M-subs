00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 all so today I'm going to you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.359
 present how to use a drill 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.660
 so for that we will need a 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.389
 drill the little tool that with a 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.839
 drill that will allow us to remove 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.570
 and put forest and forest ag 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.210
 of first thing according to what 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.920
 you're going to want to break it will take a 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.920
 strong and where the other so here we have a strong 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.369
 and barks why because he has a 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.149
 so this is a strong point and that is 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.950
 specially designed for drilling wood 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.280
 we have another type of forest that is a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.020
 strong and to drill metal we see the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.550
 tip is totally different 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.180
 so this for metal 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.469
 this for dubois so today I 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.629
 will show you how finally 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.270
 to pierce a wooden plate 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.840
 so to put your doing in the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.660
 drill 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.300
 we will have to open the opening to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.489
 the front to be able to insert it would do it 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.860
 so most of the time the openings 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.439
 are manual so just turn 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.560
 in the opposite direction of the hands of a 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.040
 watch to open so there we see I 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.830
 I'm opening once the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.200
 hole seems big enough to reinsert the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.630
 drill it puts you check it goes 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.880
 deep down and then we will redo my 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.259
 desires without this time in the sense 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.979
 clockwise 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:37.470
 until we feel a resistance 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:39.979
 so here I feel a resistance there 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.930
 when I turn it would spin it with 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.490
 it remains now to finish the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.820
 fixing us for that we will use 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.759
 the tool the principle is going to be we're going 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.270
 insert it in the title or and with the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.490
 teeth we will succeed in forcing that the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.909
 that would be perfectly 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.649
 well stuck so always we screw in 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.219
 the islands in the direction of the needles 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.890
 a watch 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:10.590
 So here I go and here are some idiots 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.130
 well and we do not force like 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.470
 a sick one but there 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.370
 forest now and well kept so 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.110
 it's perfect now to pierce 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.560
 so here we will drill with a board 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.490
 Of wood 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.520
 so I'm going to put everything up 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.620
 simply a support for not pierced 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.990
 the what's underneath once 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.490
 I will have father that's my plate for a 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.650
 once I'll be through it not 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.650
 pierced what is below that so I 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.040
 put a little trick to have a height 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.980
 gemma drill the board is good 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:52.520
 stabilized so I'm going to plug them in my 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:56.930
 drill here is my drill and well 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:00.500
 plugged in it is noticed to pierce on 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:05.030
 holds his support well with one hand 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.200
 put the drill with the other once 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.970
 that we are well stabilized 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.970
 we go slowly and we pierce 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.770
 so here I went through 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.860
 the board my hole is perfectly 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.920
 done here is how do we 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.660
 uses a drill to remove your 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.640
 strong and once you have breakthrough 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.640
 you do the opposite procedure 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.440
 you hand over the little tool is there at 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.810
 place said it's you lives so it's 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.959
 in the opposite direction of the hands of a 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.959
 watch 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.570
 here I have unscrewed we can finish at the 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.030
 hand remove the drill close its 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.910
 drill and after to drill a 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.170
 again another day goodbye and 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.170
 good luck to all
