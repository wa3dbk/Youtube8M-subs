toyota park against the fire and i'm

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.020

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
but i think it's an acceptable

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.530 
but i think it's an acceptable
punishment<00:01:41.189> frame<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.460> knew<00:01:41.700> something<00:01:42.150> had

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
to happen the league using buzzwords

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
to happen the league using buzzwords
like<00:01:44.479> confrontational<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.540> provocative

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
like confrontational and provocative

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.899 
like confrontational and provocative
behavior<00:01:46.200> which<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.189> everyone<00:01:47.520> who<00:01:47.670> saw

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
behavior which I think everyone who saw

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.760 
behavior which I think everyone who saw
the<00:01:47.970> incident<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:48.630> certainly<00:01:49.110> agree<00:01:49.320> with

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
mark on the league's public image so I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.850 
mark on the league's public image so I
think<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.689> general<00:01:54.869> message<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.439> David<00:01:55.710> we're

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
think the general message is David we're

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.109
