00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to actually tap it and that's just to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.510 
to actually tap it and that's just to
break<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> leaves<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.190> way<00:00:56.370> when

the water goes through it's actually
going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.079> make<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.770> flavor<00:00:59.100> more<00:00:59.340> potent

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
going to make the flavor more potent

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.850

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we put it into machine like that and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.030 
we put it into machine like that and
what's<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.810> important<00:01:13.290> also<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> we

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
