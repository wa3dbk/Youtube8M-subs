00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.820 

we'll<00:00:28.880> skip<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.450> commencement<00:00:29.840> however<00:00:30.680> you

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
we'll skip the commencement however you

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.550 
we'll skip the commencement however you
may<00:00:31.040> do<00:00:31.250> commencement

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.040 

here<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.820> will<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.690> finished

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
here and we will go as if we finished

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:50.140 
here and we will go as if we finished
commencement<00:00:38.300> into<00:00:39.300> single<00:00:39.630> car

00:00:50.150 --> 00:01:01.390 

breathe<00:00:50.780> syncing<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:51.920> body

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:24.000 

you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.500 

now<00:01:25.010> notice<00:01:25.250> we're<00:01:25.520> only<00:01:25.700> concerned<00:01:26.210> at<00:01:26.390> this

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
now notice we're only concerned at this

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.200 
now notice we're only concerned at this
point<00:01:26.630> with<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.050> ending<00:01:27.530> of<00:01:27.650> each<00:01:27.770> posture

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
point with the ending of each posture

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.010 
point with the ending of each posture
once<00:01:29.210> again<00:01:29.450> from<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:29.750> direction<00:01:30.850> this<00:01:31.850> time

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
once again from this direction this time

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.370 
once again from this direction this time
to<00:01:33.020> rest

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:48.310 

my<00:01:40.380> body<00:01:40.620> sinks<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.220> opens<00:01:41.520> up

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.399 

if<00:01:48.680> I'd<00:01:48.830> say<00:01:49.040> sinking<00:01:49.550> on<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.760> first<00:01:50.000> breath

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:26.020 

in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.829> center<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.340> second

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.480 

so<00:02:26.180> second<00:02:26.840> method<00:02:27.040> sinking<00:02:28.040> on<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.250> first

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
so second method sinking on the first

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.510 
so second method sinking on the first
breath<00:02:28.760> example<00:02:29.740> finish<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.860> posture<00:02:31.340> that's

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
breath example finish the posture that's

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.640 
breath example finish the posture that's
what<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.760> wanted<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.060> see<00:02:32.240> for<00:02:32.270> instance<00:02:32.540> we<00:02:33.290> see

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
what I wanted to see for instance we see

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.130 
what I wanted to see for instance we see
it<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.550> we<00:02:34.610> sink<00:02:34.880> again<00:02:37.660> okay<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.870> finally

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
it and we sink again okay and finally

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.680 
it and we sink again okay and finally
you<00:02:40.040> can<00:02:40.130> extend<00:02:40.460> it<00:02:40.580> up<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.760> as<00:02:41.330> many<00:02:41.480> places

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
you can extend it up to as many places

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.449 
you can extend it up to as many places
you<00:02:41.930> want<00:02:42.230> but<00:02:42.410> we're<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:42.620> case<00:02:43.010> we'll<00:02:43.280> just

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
each of the postures and after you've

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.840 
each of the postures and after you've
done<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.630> session<00:04:07.260> like<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.680> try<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.550> whole

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
done a session like that try the whole

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.240 
done a session like that try the whole
thing<00:04:09.710> with<00:04:10.710> a<00:04:10.740> flow<00:04:12.860> anticipating<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.040> end

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
thing with a flow anticipating the end

of<00:04:14.490> each<00:04:14.610> posture<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.270> telling<00:04:15.600> yourself<00:04:15.960> at

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
of each posture and telling yourself at

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.400 
of each posture and telling yourself at
that<00:04:16.110> point<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.739> sink<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.190> relax<00:04:17.489> extra

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
that point to sink and relax extra

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.080 
that point to sink and relax extra
without<00:04:19.410> stopping<00:04:19.830> we<00:04:20.730> finished

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
without stopping we finished

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:45.200 
without stopping we finished
commencement

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:55.090 

you<00:04:46.210> might<00:04:46.419> have<00:04:46.600> something<00:04:46.900> like<00:04:47.229> that

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.910 

this<00:04:55.790> part<00:04:56.090> here<00:04:56.330> would<00:04:56.960> simply<00:04:57.290> demonstrate

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
this part here would simply demonstrate

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.670 
this part here would simply demonstrate
the<00:04:58.190> ability<00:04:58.820> of<00:04:59.390> this<00:04:59.600> standing<00:05:00.500> in<00:05:00.590> the

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
the ability of this standing in the

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.890 
the ability of this standing in the
posture<00:05:01.040> is<00:05:01.160> sinking<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:02.030> increase<00:05:02.450> your<00:05:02.630> flow

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
posture is sinking to increase your flow

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.140 
posture is sinking to increase your flow
of<00:05:03.020> energy<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:03.830> we<00:05:04.070> would<00:05:04.220> be<00:05:04.370> doing<00:05:04.610> here<00:05:04.910> I

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
of energy so we would be doing here I

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.720 
of energy so we would be doing here I
would<00:05:05.690> be<00:05:05.720> finishing<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.350> movement<00:05:06.770> he'll

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
would be finishing the movement he'll

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:14.670 
would be finishing the movement he'll
come<00:05:07.940> apply<00:05:08.210> his<00:05:08.390> pressure<00:05:08.690> at<00:05:08.900> this<00:05:09.050> time

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.320 

okay<00:05:15.680> this<00:05:16.160> is<00:05:16.340> simple<00:05:16.670> like<00:05:16.820> that<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:17.150> more

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
okay this is simple like that the more

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:26.590 
okay this is simple like that the more
pressure<00:05:17.630> he<00:05:17.870> applies<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.590> more<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:25.420> can<00:05:26.420> see

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
pressure he applies the more you can see

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.300 
pressure he applies the more you can see
the<00:05:26.990> more<00:05:27.200> pressure<00:05:27.560> that<00:05:27.680> is<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.130> more

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
the more pressure that is the more

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
the more pressure that is the more
you're<00:05:28.430> going<00:05:28.550> to<00:05:28.610> fly<00:05:28.820> okay

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.029 

the<00:05:53.330> next<00:05:53.569> pivot<00:05:54.379> we'll<00:05:54.680> leave<00:05:54.830> that<00:05:54.979> alone

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
the next pivot we'll leave that alone

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:01.540 
the next pivot we'll leave that alone
for<00:05:55.310> now<00:05:55.550> and<00:05:56.419> stepping<00:05:57.259> into<00:06:00.039> I'm<00:06:01.039> gonna<00:06:01.340> turn

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
for now and stepping into I'm gonna turn

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:24.339 
for now and stepping into I'm gonna turn
this<00:06:20.169> wheel<00:06:21.169> back<00:06:21.409> energy<00:06:22.270> here<00:06:23.270> the<00:06:23.509> young

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
this wheel back energy here the young

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:43.850 
this wheel back energy here the young
hand

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.300 

rolling<00:06:44.860> back<00:06:45.100> and<00:06:46.620> in<00:06:47.620> this<00:06:47.740> case<00:06:47.950> we're<00:06:48.160> just
