00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
of what it does and a little bit

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.240 
of what it does and a little bit
and<00:02:04.940> click<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:05.690> what<00:02:06.080> this<00:02:06.229> does<00:02:06.290> is<00:02:06.710> set

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.749 
and click it and what this does is set
our<00:02:07.370> diagonal<00:02:07.700> as<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.149> can<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:09.580> refresh<00:02:10.580> our

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
our diagonal as you can see refresh our

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.850 
our diagonal as you can see refresh our
comport<00:02:11.209> list<00:02:11.480> now<00:02:11.900> we<00:02:11.959> have<00:02:12.170> columns<00:02:12.620> are<00:02:12.770> the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
comport list now we have columns are the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
comport list now we have columns are the
two<00:02:13.069> so<00:02:13.850> try<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.120> go<00:02:14.270> ahead<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.569> connect<00:02:17.350> and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
two so try to go ahead and connect and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.090 
two so try to go ahead and connect and
the<00:02:19.880> reason<00:02:20.240> why<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.420> needs<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.260> be<00:02:21.440> stay<00:02:21.860> awake

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
the reason why it needs to be stay awake

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.790 
the reason why it needs to be stay awake
is<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.140> device<00:02:24.140> can<00:02:24.410> actually

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
is so that the device can actually

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.190 
is so that the device can actually
interface<00:02:25.490> with<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:28.510> without<00:02:31.690> without<00:02:32.690> being

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
interface with it without without being

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.530 
interface with it without without being
stay<00:02:33.410> awake<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.800> if<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.980> device<00:02:34.489> sleeps<00:02:34.970> then

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
stay awake and if the device sleeps then

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.850 
stay awake and if the device sleeps then
it's<00:02:35.720> not<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.140> switch<00:02:36.319> to<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.620> current

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
it's not going to switch to the current

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.250 
it's not going to switch to the current
comport<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.700> then<00:02:38.480> you'll<00:02:38.810> just<00:02:38.930> end<00:02:39.140> up

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
this exploit you you will have to have

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.080 
this exploit you you will have to have
an<00:04:38.660> SD<00:04:38.840> card<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:40.400> will<00:04:40.669> have<00:04:40.699> to<00:04:41.060> be

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
an SD card and it will have to be

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.300 
an SD card and it will have to be
recognized<00:04:41.750> by<00:04:42.409> the<00:04:42.470> phone<00:04:42.770> in<00:04:42.800> order<00:04:43.099> to<00:04:43.400> do

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.390 

now<00:05:01.540> I<00:05:01.600> can<00:05:02.020> use<00:05:02.170> the<00:05:02.320> do<00:05:02.470> flashes<00:05:02.980> within

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
now I can use the do flashes within

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.280 
now I can use the do flashes within
about<00:05:03.580> three<00:05:03.910> minutes<00:05:06.060> if<00:05:07.060> not<00:05:07.600> faster<00:05:07.810> I'm

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
about three minutes if not faster I'm

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.360 
about three minutes if not faster I'm
just<00:05:08.830> obviously<00:05:09.130> going<00:05:09.610> through<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.060> demoing

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
just obviously going through and demoing

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.810 
just obviously going through and demoing
demoing<00:05:12.370> it<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:13.180> now<00:05:13.960> it's<00:05:14.700> basically<00:05:15.700> just

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
demoing it so now it's basically just

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.450 
demoing it so now it's basically just
looking<00:05:16.630> for<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.140> phone<00:05:17.350> again<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:17.890> going<00:05:18.220> to

the phone had to be rebooted in order to
verify<00:05:24.160> root<00:05:24.820> access<00:05:25.060> so<00:05:25.840> what's<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:26.380> phone
