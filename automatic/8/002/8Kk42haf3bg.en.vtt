00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.830
 dogs are cataloged by most 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.859

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.810
 man are faithful sociable animals and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.320
 very affectionate that adapt to any 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 environment as pets are very 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.260
 easy to train then three 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.619
 steps to train a dog step 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.510
 number 1 use games is a good 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.700
 way to train your dog and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.190
 exercise it at the same time studies have 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.739
 demonstrated that dogs learn more 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.020
 fast and respond better when 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.930
 training sessions have some 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.570
 game when you play with him in areas with 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.760
 more people and animals get the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.860
 extra benefit teach him how 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.829
 interact with other people and with 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.590
 other animals step number 2 before 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.600
 that you give him an order to give him a deal 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.210
 make sure your dog shows 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.480
 attention and then show him that they have 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.330
 more to incentivize it use your hands to 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.000
 for example a caress since by 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.820
 nature the dogs are very visual 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.090
 they will know that your hands will give you the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.360
 I try step number 3 at the moment of giving 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.550
 an order tries to use commands 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.440
 specific with your hands accompanied by 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.630
 oral expressions to help your 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.730
 dog to understand 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.800
 later you must show him 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.230
 physically what you should do if 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.930
 has executed the task correctly 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.630
 congratulate not overly give him his 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.180
 reward and wait an hour to return 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.480
 to teach him what he has to do in 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.270
 Otherwise, do not hit just tell him 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.210
 in a firm voice, not if the information 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.220
