00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
this was the c-pillar

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.260 
this was the c-pillar
the<00:01:47.590> next<00:01:47.830> step<00:01:47.950> after<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.310> have<00:01:48.459> a<00:01:48.490> cut<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:49.060> I'm

the next step after I have a cut is I'm
going<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.479> be<00:01:49.569> grinding<00:01:49.929> on<00:01:50.049> each<00:01:50.170> side<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.409> the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
going to be grinding on each side of the

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.109 
going to be grinding on each side of the
cut<00:01:50.709> and<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.250> reason<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.549> want<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.759> grind<00:01:51.970> down

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
cut and the reason I want to grind down

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.850 
cut and the reason I want to grind down
I<00:01:52.179> want<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.450> grind<00:01:52.569> out<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.929> bare<00:01:53.110> metal<00:01:53.319> MIG

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
I want to grind out to bare metal MIG

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.080 
I want to grind out to bare metal MIG
welder<00:01:54.100> doesn't<00:01:54.399> take<00:01:54.520> too<00:01:54.700> well<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:54.880> rest

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.880 

so<00:02:01.090> I've<00:02:01.209> tacked<00:02:01.479> both<00:02:01.689> sides<00:02:01.959> of<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.259> car<00:02:02.439> on

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
so I've tacked both sides of the car on

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.669 
so I've tacked both sides of the car on
the<00:02:03.539> driver's<00:02:04.539> side<00:02:04.569> of<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.810> car<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.229> started

stitching the panel together I noticed

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.150 
stitching the panel together I noticed
it<00:02:07.630> was<00:02:07.720> too<00:02:07.840> much<00:02:07.959> dressed<00:02:08.289> in<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.470> panel<00:02:08.830> and

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
it was too much dressed in the panel and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.949 
it was too much dressed in the panel and
the<00:02:09.399> stitching<00:02:09.880> is<00:02:10.000> started<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.299> bow<00:02:10.450> out

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
the stitching is started to bow out

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.630 
the stitching is started to bow out
currently<00:02:11.290> bowing<00:02:12.040> out<00:02:12.160> like<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.400> end<00:02:12.489> of<00:02:12.519> a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
currently bowing out like the end of a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640 
currently bowing out like the end of a
boat<00:02:12.819> I'm<00:02:13.480> going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.780> be<00:02:13.900> recutting<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.500> and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
boat I'm going to be recutting it and
