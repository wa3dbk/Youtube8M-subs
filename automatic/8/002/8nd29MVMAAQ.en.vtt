 praised each other all empty sachet 3 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:03.329
 I like to say so to say so to say 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.729
 I read like they do not like much praise 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.320
 they say that the lights of the ether but better so 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.450
 choose that package is not needed 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.119
 reasons so now our so weighty 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.560
 boll logic xiaomi logo 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.380
 here that we have specifications 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.650
 some very so pale gray 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.049
 color but so everything is tight here 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.659
 inscription nakleechka 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.659
 paid chik-chik 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.680
 this way u open like 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:47.060
 previous version before we look at 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.600
 box so that we have written what is here 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.250
 we show here show and 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.010
 be side 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.240
 is a cross or kodak like everything 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:04.360
 the rest so now another sachet 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:08.360
 2 com not so packed our headphones 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.880
 here one more characteristic is still those 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.800
 same over there they were there not through 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.620
 The camera is hard to see plastic 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.120
 transparent box like other sandy 2 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.430
 nakleechki here 1 and here 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:29.570
 turning the materials nice this 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 plastic which is black on touchpad court 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.820
 a little bit so done very nice on 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.980
 touch 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.950
 open plastic this trick is not 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.920
 damaged completely excellent completely 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.910
 the whole is completely excellent and mean to 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.800
 Larice all my 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.660
 again a sleigh bath that's a lot 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.120
 comparisons have been described secondly there 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.550
 somehow with what font usa hope that 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.630
 it is still too early to forge them yet 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.650
 calculate recently came out so how would 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.530
 it's too early to do 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.810
 give them'll get inside this drink 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.320
 way violinist seems to be how to fit 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.269
 the violinist's class here is no cap here 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.650
 these are our replaceable ones 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.090
 piece silicone or what they well 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.410
 qualitatively heather so well felt 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.660
 and on 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.340
 I hope that this is no fake so 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.050
 Now the headphones themselves, so here they are 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.000
 inside 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.680
 more precisely this is the front side of the shackles 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.750
 Internally, this is such a soft one 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.580
 package box, let's go 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:48.260
 We 'll get it as well they are beautifully packaged 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.630
 that even not enough to unpack such 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.730
 beauty does not feel that materials 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.190
 really good even in me even before 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.410
 the headphones themselves do not crawl but 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.850
 packing materials this is now a thing 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.160
 such a theory 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.720
 do you look people to not the hardest 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:09.100
 so now the headphones themselves 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.220
 black is interesting that year before 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.430
 disconnection 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.239
 here we have a braided cord 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:23.410
 I know if I can handle Jack, I'll show you 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:25.150
 then it's a shame and after that already comes 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.800
 the usual one 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.670
 wires up to present the remote 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.690
 control louder quieter and probably raise 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.160
 metal bell here is such a connector 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.490
 for microphone 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.220
 microphone from athens and here but 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.640
 headphones look like this 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.280
 I don't know, yes, this metal feels like 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.900
 this metal cools the hand we will know me 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.960
 it seems and really will stop two years old 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:59.419
 for more fashionable something these some little 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:04.550
 simple logo all here it is 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:06.590
 see here he is here he is true I am here 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.230
 already accustomed to such headphones that are 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.960
 such curves 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:16.690
 and itâ€™s written that first 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.120
 impressions made good length to 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.990
 apparently I don't like so long either 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.270
 love to 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.920
 football here is the same headphones do not like 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.760
 when there is a monastery nikkey short 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.600
 it is not my will that also went to the phone 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.010
 comparing means friends 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.260
 I listened to these headphones immediately say 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.560
 that by the way they somehow look cumbersome 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.970
 by themselves some such they 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.410
 Rzhevsky such hangs and of course because 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.650
 that metal but in themselves such 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:50.560
 big also jack is also metal itself 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:52.420
 jack youth is all metal metal i 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.310
 tested compared with my not 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.870
 come to his senses on unpacking us were from he 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:01.500
 class and to my surprise 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:06.390
 headphones from classes he rules more 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.130
 First of the piston 3 is quieter than headphones 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.760
 then nasa parade the maximum volume 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:15.430
 because I could not listen almost very much 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.770
 comfortable listening also i don't know but i 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.890
 Of course I doubt that I already have it 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:24.190
 some kind of sympathy for the average he 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:27.160
 bed and things like that but low here 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:30.070
 high frequencies are better heard and 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:34.480
 how they sound nicer to me than 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:37.270
 3 scans so all my friends again this 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.560
 purely my opinion is not what if I 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:44.620
 choosing between true third and 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.250
 headphones he cool I would choose won 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.100
 the class 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.650
 but what about the sand in the second I heard them 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.370
 long time ago and i liked them so here 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.449
 I do n't know either 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.010
 but they probably already if people write in 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.260
 Internet that caps yes better than 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.350
 variegations are probably mine again 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.990
 saying my tastes is not exactly a plan either 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.880
 And so I do not know what he advise 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.850
 if you play something between here 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:14.000
 these two then he plan to collect 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.919
 but they do not know is not worth is equal to 20 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.930
 dollars already kind of small 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:21.740
 discounts on different sites so look
