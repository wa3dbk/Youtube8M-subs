00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
think is crystal focus 5 in it so this

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.079 
think is crystal focus 5 in it so this
can<00:01:02.050> blow<00:01:02.289> it<00:01:02.440> out<00:01:02.589> of<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.829> water<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:03.820> has

can blow it out of the water this has

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.260 
can blow it out of the water this has

so this saber is certified for for
medium<00:02:31.430> dueling<00:02:31.819> but<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.000> would<00:02:32.269> highly

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
medium dueling but I would highly

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.630 
medium dueling but I would highly
recommend<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.349> are<00:02:33.620> careful<00:02:34.400> these

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.410 
claws are sharp enough to tear skin and
clothing<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.430> don't<00:02:37.700> recommend<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.180> saber

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
clothing so I don't recommend the saber

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.080

you can use you want to press this down

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.780 
you can use you want to press this down
with<00:04:33.800> your<00:04:33.920> thumb<00:04:34.100> because<00:04:34.250> it's<00:04:34.550> kind<00:04:34.760> of

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
with your thumb because it's kind of

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.990 
with your thumb because it's kind of
like<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.940> spring<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.630> bone<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:37.400> can<00:04:37.430> use<00:04:37.820> that

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
like a spring the bone you can use that

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.550 
like a spring the bone you can use that
so<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.480> you<00:04:38.540> have<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.690> thumb<00:04:38.960> screw<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.260> change

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
so that you have a thumb screw to change

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.780 
so that you have a thumb screw to change
the<00:04:39.650> look<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.070> saber<00:04:40.280> but<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.580> would<00:04:40.700> allow

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
the look of the saber but it would allow

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.610 
the look of the saber but it would allow
you<00:04:40.970> to<00:04:41.210> be<00:04:41.450> able<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.630> use<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.990> saber<00:04:42.230> but<00:04:42.500> also

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
you to be able to use the saber but also

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.400 
you to be able to use the saber but also
to<00:04:42.860> be<00:04:42.980> able<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.190> quickly<00:04:43.570> remove<00:04:44.570> these
