Cal<00:01:20.390> don't<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.720> hate<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.900> when<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.170> talk

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
Cal don't you just hate it when you talk

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.710 
Cal don't you just hate it when you talk
to<00:01:22.560> yourself<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.250> how<00:01:23.369> does<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.610> guy<00:01:23.700> own<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
to yourself so how does a guy own the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.020 
to yourself so how does a guy own the
land<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> moon<00:01:25.909> exactly

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
land on the moon exactly

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.630 
land on the moon exactly
so<00:01:27.150> apparently<00:01:27.450> Dennis<00:01:28.229> found<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.740> loophole<00:01:29.400> in

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
so apparently Dennis found a loophole in

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.749 
so apparently Dennis found a loophole in
the<00:01:29.930> 1967<00:01:30.930> Outer<00:01:31.439> Space<00:01:31.829> Treaty<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.240 
the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and
basically<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.990> allows<00:01:34.380> him<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.829> own

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
basically it's what allows him to own

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.730 
basically it's what allows him to own
the<00:01:35.640> moon<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.240> since<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:36.810> he's<00:01:37.049> divided<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the moon and since then he's divided the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.640 
the moon and since then he's divided the
moon<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.070> into<00:01:38.310> multiple<00:01:39.030> plots<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.200> which<00:01:40.470> she

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
moon up into multiple plots in which she

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.789 
moon up into multiple plots in which she
sells<00:01:41.070> land<00:01:41.579> by<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.850> acres<00:01:42.450> approximately<00:01:42.869> 20

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
sells land by the acres approximately 20

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.670
