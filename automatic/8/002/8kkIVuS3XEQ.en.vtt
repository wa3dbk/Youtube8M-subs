here's<00:00:02.130> our<00:00:02.400> challenge

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.720 

alright<00:00:57.449> somebody<00:00:57.989> want<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.430> describe<00:00:59.430> what's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
alright somebody want to describe what's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.510 
alright somebody want to describe what's
going<00:00:59.789> on<00:01:04.460> all<00:01:05.460> right<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:07.520> mechanical

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
going on all right this is a mechanical

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.570 
going on all right this is a mechanical
aerospace<00:01:08.759> department<00:01:10.280> jet<00:01:11.280> engine

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
aerospace department jet engine

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820 
aerospace department jet engine
manufacturing<00:01:12.360> class<00:01:12.690> we<00:01:12.990> built<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.590> engine

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
manufacturing class we built this engine

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.680 
manufacturing class we built this engine
with<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> 3d<00:01:15.000> printer<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.440> bit<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
with a 3d printer and a little bit of

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.749 
with a 3d printer and a little bit of
copper<00:01:18.690> tubing<00:01:19.040> we're<00:01:20.040> simulating<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.729> real

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
copper tubing we're simulating a real

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.460 
copper tubing we're simulating a real
compressor<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> way<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.659> works<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.140> real

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
compressor the way it works a real

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.249 
compressor the way it works a real
engine<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> way<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.040> works<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.580> we're<00:01:24.259> using

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
engine the way it works but we're using

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.710 
engine the way it works but we're using
compressed<00:01:25.770> air<00:01:26.119> instead<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.270> having<00:01:27.539> an

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
compressed air instead of having an

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.180 
compressed air instead of having an
actual<00:01:27.960> flame<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.380> there<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> would<00:01:28.860> burn<00:01:29.100> up

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
actual flame in there that would burn up

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.260 
actual flame in there that would burn up
our<00:01:29.369> parts<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:30.360> they<00:01:30.509> were<00:01:30.710> lit<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.740> fire<00:01:32.270> so

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
our parts if they were lit on fire so

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.090 
our parts if they were lit on fire so
we're<00:01:33.780> gonna<00:01:33.869> power<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:35.070> our

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
we're gonna power this up with our

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.310 
we're gonna power this up with our
compressed<00:01:35.759> air<00:01:35.909> source<00:01:36.179> and<00:01:36.810> we've<00:01:37.110> got<00:01:37.289> a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
compressed air source and we've got a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.249 
compressed air source and we've got a
dual<00:01:37.679> concentric<00:01:38.310> turbofan<00:01:39.140> which<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
dual concentric turbofan which a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.980 
dual concentric turbofan which a
high-pressure<00:01:41.069> compressor<00:01:41.840> depending<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.929> my

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
high-pressure compressor depending on my

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.010 
high-pressure compressor depending on my
friend<00:01:43.319> spun<00:01:43.740> by<00:01:43.920> high-pressure<00:01:44.850> turbine<00:01:45.300> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
friend spun by high-pressure turbine and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.690 
friend spun by high-pressure turbine and
a<00:01:46.170> low-pressure<00:01:46.560> turbine<00:01:47.069> in<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.460> that's

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
a low-pressure turbine in here that's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:02:34.160 
a low-pressure turbine in here that's
spinning<00:01:47.940> our<00:01:48.149> fan

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:44.340 

okay<00:02:35.170> get<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> blade<00:02:36.220> slowing<00:02:36.790> down<00:02:43.350> all

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
okay get the blade slowing down all

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.530 
okay get the blade slowing down all
right
