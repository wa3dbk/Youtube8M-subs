one two three from our garden we can put

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.290 
one two three from our garden we can put
just<00:01:28.800> about<00:01:28.979> anything<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.670> comes<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
just about anything that comes from the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.980 
just about anything that comes from the
gardening<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:30.990> weeds<00:01:32.479> cuttings<00:01:33.479> anything

gardening here weeds cuttings anything

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.630 
gardening here weeds cuttings anything
like<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.590> anything<00:01:34.830> is<00:01:35.040> too<00:01:35.190> big<00:01:35.430> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
like that if anything is too big you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.160 
like that if anything is too big you
want<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.180> there<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.600> chop<00:01:36.870> it<00:01:37.050> up

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
want to get in there and chop it up

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
want to get in there and chop it up
otherwise<00:01:37.920> it'll<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.400> compost<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.090> by

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
otherwise it'll just compost just by

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.240 
otherwise it'll just compost just by
itself<00:01:39.690> so<00:01:40.020> remember<00:01:40.470> everything<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:40.950> goes

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
itself so remember everything that goes

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.850 
itself so remember everything that goes
into<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.820> compost<00:01:42.000> bin<00:01:42.360> does<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
into the compost bin does not go to the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.240 
into the compost bin does not go to the
landfill<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.880> we're<00:01:45.030> saving<00:01:45.240> fossil<00:01:45.960> fuels

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
landfill so we're saving fossil fuels

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.070 
landfill so we're saving fossil fuels
carbon<00:01:47.250> emissions<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.910> human<00:01:48.750> power

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
carbon emissions and human power

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.620 
carbon emissions and human power
so<00:01:49.979> these<00:01:50.130> bins<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.610> been<00:01:50.759> active<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.210> about

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
so these bins have been active for about

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.719 
so these bins have been active for about
ten<00:01:51.960> months<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.500> filled<00:01:52.830> them<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:53.369> they've

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
ten months I filled them up and they've

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.490 
ten months I filled them up and they've
decomposed<00:01:54.180> about<00:01:54.780> seven<00:01:55.229> or<00:01:55.380> eight

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
decomposed about seven or eight

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.310 
decomposed about seven or eight
different<00:01:55.710> times<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.660> lot<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> good

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
different times so we have a lot of good

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.230 
different times so we have a lot of good
compost<00:01:58.890> down<00:01:59.100> at<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> bottom<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.820> these<00:01:59.940> bins

gonna make my cuts right in the middle
that'll<00:03:03.180> give<00:03:03.330> me<00:03:03.360> something<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.960> fold<00:03:04.320> over

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
that'll give me something to fold over

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.300 
that'll give me something to fold over
which<00:03:05.250> will<00:03:05.400> help<00:03:05.610> hold<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.970> together<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:08.160> now

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
I've cut the wire mesh and all that

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.280 
I've cut the wire mesh and all that
needs<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.730> done<00:03:11.940> now<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.150> form<00:03:12.690> our<00:03:12.840> circle

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
needs to be done now is form our circle

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.530 
needs to be done now is form our circle
and<00:03:13.440> when<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.800> form<00:03:14.070> our<00:03:14.250> circle<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:15.270> want<00:03:15.450> to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
and when we form our circle we want to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.010 
and when we form our circle we want to
overlap<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.320> mesh<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:17.040> bit<00:03:17.750> okay<00:03:18.750> now

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
overlap the mesh just a bit okay now

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.470 
overlap the mesh just a bit okay now
these<00:03:19.200> little<00:03:19.790> remember<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.820> cut<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.240> in<00:03:21.360> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
these little remember I cut it in the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.210 
these little remember I cut it in the
middle<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.200> now<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.800> these<00:03:22.980> little

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
middle and now I have these little

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.130 
middle and now I have these little
things<00:03:23.460> that<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.700> can<00:03:23.940> put<00:03:24.180> here<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.660> bend<00:03:24.960> them

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
things that I can put here and bend them

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.290 
things that I can put here and bend them
over<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.190> that's<00:03:26.880> going<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> help

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
over like this and that's going to help

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.160 
over like this and that's going to help
hold<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.870> place

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
hold it in place

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.140 
hold it in place
so<00:03:28.500> I've<00:03:28.590> bent<00:03:28.830> over<00:03:29.010> one<00:03:29.370> side<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.940> mesh

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
so I've bent over one side of the mesh

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.120 
so I've bent over one side of the mesh
now<00:03:30.390> I'm<00:03:30.480> gonna<00:03:30.570> do<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.930> other<00:03:31.080> side<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:31.950> is

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
now I'm gonna do the other side this is

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.640 
now I'm gonna do the other side this is
going<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.430> nice<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.060> strong<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.410> won't

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
going to be nice and strong so it won't

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.290 
going to be nice and strong so it won't
fall<00:03:34.860> apart<00:03:35.220> when<00:03:35.400> we're<00:03:35.580> throwing<00:03:35.820> things<00:03:36.120> in

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
fall apart when we're throwing things in

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.350 
fall apart when we're throwing things in
there<00:03:36.620> now<00:03:37.620> before<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.130> fill<00:03:38.370> with<00:03:38.400> compost<00:03:39.060> we

there now before we fill with compost we
just<00:03:39.570> need<00:03:39.720> some<00:03:39.930> zip<00:03:40.140> ties<00:03:40.380> for<00:03:40.740> some<00:03:41.550> added

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
just need some zip ties for some added

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.080 
just need some zip ties for some added
strength<00:03:42.180> I'm<00:03:42.870> gonna<00:03:43.080> take<00:03:43.320> those<00:03:43.880> just<00:03:44.880> put
