00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.660
 sterile as its definition we had in 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.570
 the introduction of hands in 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.430
 gloves as an external technique 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.470
 as objectives we have in Caracas 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.079
 transmit the microorganisms of a 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.989
 patient to another as well as identify 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.240
 by observing the steps of the 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.750
 placing of the gloves you 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.030
 as a first step we have to gather the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.880
 necessary materials are like gloves 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.120
 we have to verify that our 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.090
 our our table is clean flat and 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.400
 moisture-free we place ourselves at a 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.950
 10-centimeter position in one 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.000
 upright position 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.380
 to the treated gloves as well as in the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 Date of Expiry 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.899
 to take into account that our gloves 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.850
 they are new and they do not have any 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.900
 kind of adventure 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.740
 we proceed to open our gloves 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.740
 in this way 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.329
 in our field to you 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.290
 we proceed to open and verify that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.220
 be in the direction of our hands 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.220
 we open 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.110
 we proceed in this way to place 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.500
 our hand 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.500
 the most skillful hand 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.500

 as far as the bank then we made the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.209
 same procedure with the other hand 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.910
 and in this way we proceed 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.890
 accommodate our gloves 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.460
 once we put our gloves 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.560

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.490
 of sterile material or also some 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.120
 surgical intervention 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.780
 we have visualized the procedures and 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:52.580
 we make the acceptance of our 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.580
 external gloves in this way 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.159
