forward<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.680> course<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.610> take<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> look

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
forward of course going to take a look

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.319 
forward of course going to take a look
at<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.750> acceleration<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.620> top<00:00:40.890> speed<00:00:41.329> it

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
at the acceleration and the top speed it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.260 
at the acceleration and the top speed it
goes<00:00:42.930> from<00:00:43.110> 0<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.649> 100<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.370> only<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
goes from 0 to 100 and only one and a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.850 
goes from 0 to 100 and only one and a
half<00:00:45.300> seconds<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.289> that's<00:00:46.530> insanely<00:00:47.460> fast<00:00:48.860> 0

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
half seconds so that's insanely fast 0

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.500 
half seconds so that's insanely fast 0
to<00:00:50.010> 200<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.940> only<00:00:51.149> six<00:00:51.629> point<00:00:51.930> 13<00:00:52.440> seconds<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
to 200 in only six point 13 seconds and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.290 
to 200 in only six point 13 seconds and
0<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> 300<00:00:55.500> kilometers<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.280> only<00:00:56.610> thirteen

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
0 to 300 kilometers in only thirteen

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
0 to 300 kilometers in only thirteen
point<00:00:57.660> 60<00:00:58.350> seconds<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.770> pretty<00:01:01.770> damn

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
point 60 seconds so that's pretty damn

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.560 
point 60 seconds so that's pretty damn
fast<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.830> one<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.189> fastest<00:01:05.760> accelerating

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
fast and one of the fastest accelerating

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.109 
fast and one of the fastest accelerating
cars<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> game<00:01:07.560> alright<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.790> streets

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
cars in the game alright the streets

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.750 
cars in the game alright the streets
like<00:01:09.390> every<00:01:09.780> guard<00:01:10.070> 350<00:01:11.070> kilometers<00:01:11.580> without

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
like every guard 350 kilometers without

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.100 
like every guard 350 kilometers without
knowledge<00:01:12.210> without

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
knowledge without

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
knowledge without
nitro<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.850> nitrate<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.740> 380<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.220> that's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
nitro and with nitrate is 380 so that's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.930 
nitro and with nitrate is 380 so that's
not<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.750> special<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.340> nitrous<00:01:20.820> on

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
not really special and the nitrous on

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.360 
not really special and the nitrous on
this<00:01:21.060> car<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.200> acceleration<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.980> already

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
this car and acceleration is already

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.660 
this car and acceleration is already
really<00:01:23.670> fast<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.680> nitros<00:01:25.680> aren't<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.400> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
really fast so nitros aren't really that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.170 
really fast so nitros aren't really that
effective<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.570> won't<00:01:28.280> boosted<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.610> much<00:01:29.880> but

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
effective it won't boosted that much but

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.469 
effective it won't boosted that much but
it<00:01:30.690> will<00:01:30.960> give<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> little<00:01:31.710> bit<00:01:31.830> of<00:01:32.240> just<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
it will give you a little bit of just a

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.380 
it will give you a little bit of just a
little<00:01:34.020> bit<00:01:34.110> extra<00:01:34.260> boost<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.330> when<00:01:36.330> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
little bit extra boost but when you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
little bit extra boost but when you
crash<00:01:36.690> into<00:01:36.900> something<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:38.400> don't

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
crash into something you don't

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.380 
crash into something you don't
necessarily<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.080> use<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.680> boost<00:01:41.390> all

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
necessarily have to use the boost all

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
necessarily have to use the boost all
right<00:01:42.690> now<00:01:43.020> we're<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.500> talk<00:01:43.710> about<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
right now we're going to talk about the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.770 
right now we're going to talk about the
handling<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.790> will<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.150> short<00:01:45.390> about<00:01:45.630> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
handling I will be short about this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.190 
handling I will be short about this
because<00:01:46.550> just<00:01:47.550> one<00:01:47.970> thing<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.360> isn't<00:01:48.570> good<00:01:48.900> but

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
because just one thing it isn't good but

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.370 
because just one thing it isn't good but
it<00:01:49.320> isn't<00:01:49.619> bad<00:01:49.800> too<00:01:50.040> um<00:01:50.540> it's<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.840> easy<00:01:52.050> and

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
it isn't bad too um it's just easy and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.240 
it isn't bad too um it's just easy and
the<00:01:53.280> car<00:01:53.550> is<00:01:54.090> very<00:01:54.720> creepy<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.710> it's

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the car is very creepy and it's

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.430 
the car is very creepy and it's
absolutely<00:01:56.550> not<00:01:57.300> slippery<00:01:57.720> it<00:01:57.990> has<00:01:58.170> no

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
absolutely not slippery it has no

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.090 
absolutely not slippery it has no
understeer<00:01:59.090> it's<00:02:00.090> very<00:02:00.570> very<00:02:01.020> easy<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.649> handle

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
understeer it's very very easy to handle

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.950 
understeer it's very very easy to handle
and<00:02:03.080> for<00:02:04.080> beginners<00:02:04.470> it's<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.740> great<00:02:05.009> car<00:02:05.310> but

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
and for beginners it's a great car but

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.440 
and for beginners it's a great car but
the<00:02:06.960> handling<00:02:07.320> itself<00:02:07.680> isn't<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.130> good<00:02:08.450> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the handling itself isn't that good you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.660 
the handling itself isn't that good you
it's<00:02:09.750> very<00:02:09.899> hard<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> take<00:02:10.860> corner<00:02:11.220> sometimes

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
it's very hard to take corner sometimes

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
it's very hard to take corner sometimes
you<00:02:11.820> will<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.270> break<00:02:12.510> an<00:02:12.660> African<00:02:13.050> corner

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
you will have to break an African corner

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.710 
you will have to break an African corner
but<00:02:14.370> because<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.390> car<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.810> very<00:02:16.680> grippy<00:02:17.720> you

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
but because the car is very grippy you

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.350 
but because the car is very grippy you
won't<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.709> know<00:02:19.890> trips<00:02:20.549> away<00:02:20.730> or<00:02:21.000> something

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
won't you know trips away or something

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.500 
won't you know trips away or something
like<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.570> so<00:02:21.920> that's<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.070> reason<00:02:23.100> why

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
like that so that's the reason why

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.600 
like that so that's the reason why
dandling<00:02:24.510> isn't<00:02:24.810> my<00:02:24.959> opinion<00:02:25.380> good<00:02:25.769> but<00:02:26.310> it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
dandling isn't my opinion good but it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.300 
dandling isn't my opinion good but it
really<00:02:27.330> isn't<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.959> best<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> game<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.980> have

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
really isn't the best in the game I have

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.640 
really isn't the best in the game I have
seen<00:02:29.580> much<00:02:30.030> better<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:31.200> because<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
seen much better but because the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.310 
seen much better but because the
acceleration<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.670> fast<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.660> know<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.140> car

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
acceleration is so fast you know the car

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.050 
acceleration is so fast you know the car
is<00:02:34.350> now<00:02:34.620> balanced<00:02:35.100> otherwise<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.820> would<00:02:36.030> just

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
is now balanced otherwise it would just

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.740 
is now balanced otherwise it would just
be<00:02:36.630> too<00:02:36.870> overpowered<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:39.000> my<00:02:39.180> opinion<00:02:39.299> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
be too overpowered so in my opinion the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.100 
be too overpowered so in my opinion the
handling<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.260> really<00:02:40.739> good<00:02:40.980> enough

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
handling is really good enough

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.230 
handling is really good enough
alright<00:02:43.040> now<00:02:43.250> we're<00:02:43.430> going<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.700> talk<00:02:43.970> about

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
alright now we're going to talk about

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.030 
alright now we're going to talk about
the<00:02:44.420> most<00:02:44.870> important<00:02:45.500> thing<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:45.830> my<00:02:46.010> opinion

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the most important thing in my opinion

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.450 
the most important thing in my opinion
the<00:02:46.730> race<00:02:47.120> performance<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.770> she<00:02:48.830> could<00:02:49.010> see<00:02:49.250> in

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
the race performance so she could see in

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.640 
the race performance so she could see in
the<00:02:49.580> video<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:50.210> was<00:02:50.750> struggling<00:02:51.080> here<00:02:51.470> to

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
the video I was struggling here to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.240 
the video I was struggling here to
overtake<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.370> first<00:02:52.610> people<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:54.410> if<00:02:55.190> you

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
overtake the first people but if you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.370 
overtake the first people but if you
don't<00:02:55.700> struggle<00:02:56.000> then<00:02:56.420> it's<00:02:56.690> very<00:02:56.810> easy<00:02:57.200> to

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
don't struggle then it's very easy to

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.670 
don't struggle then it's very easy to
overtake<00:02:58.010> them<00:02:58.310> because<00:02:59.560> acceleration<00:03:00.560> is

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
overtake them because acceleration is

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.400 
overtake them because acceleration is
pretty<00:03:01.040> damn<00:03:01.460> fast<00:03:01.850> like<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.300> said<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.870> one<00:03:03.320> of

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
pretty damn fast like I said it's one of

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.640 
pretty damn fast like I said it's one of
the<00:03:03.530> fastest<00:03:04.010> i've<00:03:04.190> seen<00:03:04.430> in<00:03:04.550> each<00:03:04.700> big<00:03:05.030> world

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
the fastest i've seen in each big world

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.180 
the fastest i've seen in each big world
and<00:03:07.300> it's<00:03:08.300> very<00:03:08.630> easy<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.990> overtake<00:03:09.560> everyone

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
and it's very easy to overtake everyone

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.190 
and it's very easy to overtake everyone
in<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.490> begin<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:11.000> race<00:03:11.209> it's<00:03:11.690> also<00:03:11.930> very

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
in the begin of a race it's also very

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.230 
in the begin of a race it's also very
difficult<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.800> get<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.100> car<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.910> won't

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
difficult to get this car so you won't

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.980 
difficult to get this car so you won't
see<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.750> scar<00:03:14.990> many<00:03:15.200> times<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:16.840> answers<00:03:17.840> to

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
see the scar many times and answers to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.800 
see the scar many times and answers to
see<00:03:18.140> in<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.290> left<00:03:18.530> times<00:03:18.890> right<00:03:19.310> now<00:03:19.810> the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
see in the left times right now the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.330 
see in the left times right now the
handling<00:03:21.230> isn't<00:03:21.410> maybe<00:03:21.680> like<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:21.950> said<00:03:22.220> the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
handling isn't maybe like I said the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.860 
handling isn't maybe like I said the
best<00:03:22.580> one<00:03:22.820> in<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:22.940> game<00:03:23.150> with<00:03:23.330> two<00:03:23.420> cars<00:03:23.630> very

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
best one in the game with two cars very

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.280 
best one in the game with two cars very
grippy<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:27.700> time<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:28.910> still<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.690> first<00:03:29.900> place

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
grippy so time is still the first place

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.160 
grippy so time is still the first place
and<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:31.070> was<00:03:31.550> really<00:03:31.970> impressed<00:03:32.120> by<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:32.690> I

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
and I was really impressed by that I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.280 
and I was really impressed by that I
thought<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:34.489> would<00:03:34.640> get<00:03:34.880> like<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.600> don't<00:03:36.050> know<00:03:36.230> a

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
thought it would get like I don't know a

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.780 
thought it would get like I don't know a
third<00:03:36.620> place<00:03:36.950> or<00:03:37.100> something<00:03:37.430> like<00:03:37.520> that<00:03:37.580> like

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
third place or something like that like

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.900 
third place or something like that like
95<00:03:38.540> seconds<00:03:39.310> but<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:41.480> actually<00:03:41.750> got<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.260> time<00:03:42.650> of

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
95 seconds but it actually got a time of

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.090 
95 seconds but it actually got a time of
75<00:03:43.910> points81<00:03:44.810> seconds<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:45.739> that's<00:03:45.950> the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
75 points81 seconds so that's the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.920 
75 points81 seconds so that's the
fastest<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:48.190> are<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:49.549> have<00:03:49.880> Trevor<00:03:50.239> now<00:03:50.480> in<00:03:50.690> a

fastest you are I have Trevor now in a

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.130 
fastest you are I have Trevor now in a

two it's only updated weekly
front<00:04:04.010> of<00:04:04.099> all<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.400> handling<00:04:04.760> isn't<00:04:04.939> like<00:04:05.269> I

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
front of all the handling isn't like I

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.300 
front of all the handling isn't like I
said<00:04:05.569> maybe<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.959> best<00:04:06.140> but<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.439> car<00:04:06.650> has<00:04:06.920> a

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
said maybe the best but the car has a

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.170 
said maybe the best but the car has a
great<00:04:07.879> acceleration<00:04:08.269> so<00:04:09.730> that's<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.849> reason

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
great acceleration so that's the reason

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.110 
great acceleration so that's the reason
why<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.329> car<00:04:11.599> is<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.750> really<00:04:12.230> good<00:04:12.939> and<00:04:13.939> also

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
why the car is a really good and also

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.000 
why the car is a really good and also
one<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.629> best<00:04:14.840> cars<00:04:15.110> you<00:04:15.230> can<00:04:15.379> get<00:04:15.620> in<00:04:15.799> need

handling of the car the handling is in

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.710 
handling of the car the handling is in
my<00:04:30.680> opinion<00:04:30.800> good<00:04:31.610> but<00:04:32.000> not<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.300> best<00:04:32.510> like<00:04:32.690> I

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.320 
my opinion good but not the best like I
said<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.590> car<00:04:33.800> is<00:04:33.830> very<00:04:34.100> grippy<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:35.150> is

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
said the car is very grippy it is

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.240 
said the car is very grippy it is
absolutely<00:04:35.570> not<00:04:36.229> slippery<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.770> it's<00:04:36.979> very

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
absolutely not slippery and it's very

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.129 
absolutely not slippery and it's very
easy<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.639> handle<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.419> only<00:04:38.690> thing<00:04:38.870> you<00:04:38.990> need

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
easy to handle the only thing you need

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.439 
easy to handle the only thing you need
to<00:04:39.199> do<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.680> break<00:04:40.310> into<00:04:40.610> corners<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:42.100> yes

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
to do is break into corners and yes

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.400 
to do is break into corners and yes
that's<00:04:44.449> the<00:04:44.539> reason<00:04:44.840> why<00:04:44.930> i<00:04:44.960> give<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.199> a<00:04:45.380> seven

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
that's the reason why i give it a seven

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.379 
that's the reason why i give it a seven
and<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.889> half<00:04:45.919> out<00:04:46.310> of<00:04:46.340> 10<00:04:46.669> because<00:04:46.820> it's<00:04:47.150> good

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
and a half out of 10 because it's good

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.310 
and a half out of 10 because it's good
but<00:04:47.630> it's<00:04:47.690> not<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:47.990> best<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:50.660> acceleration

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
but it's not the best the acceleration

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.860 
but it's not the best the acceleration
is<00:04:51.410> just<00:04:52.090> insanely<00:04:53.090> fast<00:04:53.770> so<00:04:55.449> i'm<00:04:56.449> going<00:04:56.690> to

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
is just insanely fast so i'm going to

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.540 
is just insanely fast so i'm going to
give<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.050> a<00:04:57.289> 10<00:04:57.590> out<00:04:57.710> of<00:04:57.740> 10<00:04:57.860> because<00:04:58.160> it's

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
give that a 10 out of 10 because it's

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.689 
give that a 10 out of 10 because it's
just<00:04:58.960> Gracie<00:05:00.760> all<00:05:01.760> right<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:03.699> race

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
just Gracie all right and the race

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.939 
just Gracie all right and the race
performance<00:05:05.240> is<00:05:05.360> just<00:05:05.570> great<00:05:05.870> it's<00:05:06.470> very<00:05:06.650> easy

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
performance is just great it's very easy

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:08.770 
performance is just great it's very easy
to<00:05:07.100> overtake<00:05:07.699> everyone<00:05:08.210> at<00:05:08.389> the<00:05:08.449> beginning<00:05:08.750> of

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
to overtake everyone at the beginning of

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.140 
to overtake everyone at the beginning of
rays<00:05:09.110> if<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.250> handling<00:05:10.580> would<00:05:10.760> be<00:05:10.910> a<00:05:10.940> bit

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
rays if the handling would be a bit

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.640 
rays if the handling would be a bit
better<00:05:11.389> than<00:05:11.599> it<00:05:11.750> would<00:05:11.870> give<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:12.199> a<00:05:12.260> 10<00:05:12.470> out<00:05:12.620> of

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
better than it would give it a 10 out of

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.610 
better than it would give it a 10 out of
10<00:05:12.830> but<00:05:13.460> because<00:05:14.389> it<00:05:15.139> isn't<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.440> best

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
10 but because it isn't the best

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.360 
10 but because it isn't the best
handling<00:05:16.010> in<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.220> game<00:05:16.370> I<00:05:16.520> give<00:05:17.139> 900<00:05:18.139> so<00:05:18.889> you

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
handling in the game I give 900 so you

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.520 
handling in the game I give 900 so you
get<00:05:19.490> a<00:05:19.550> total<00:05:20.060> of<00:05:20.150> twenty<00:05:20.449> six<00:05:20.690> point<00:05:21.229> five

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
get a total of twenty six point five

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.260 
get a total of twenty six point five
points

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
points

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.710 
points
so<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:24.470> would<00:05:24.650> give<00:05:24.920> it<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.430> great<00:05:25.760> that<00:05:26.540> is

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
so that would give it a great that is

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.980 
so that would give it a great that is
eight<00:05:27.050> point<00:05:27.650> eight<00:05:27.950> out<00:05:28.790> of<00:05:28.850> ten<00:05:29.450> so<00:05:29.750> that's

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
eight point eight out of ten so that's

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.130 
eight point eight out of ten so that's
the<00:05:30.530> highest<00:05:30.770> that<00:05:31.460> we<00:05:31.730> got<00:05:31.970> but<00:05:32.630> it's<00:05:32.840> also

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
the highest that we got but it's also

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.220 
the highest that we got but it's also
very<00:05:33.440> difficult<00:05:33.920> to<00:05:34.010> get<00:05:34.160> this<00:05:34.280> car<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:35.080> if<00:05:36.080> you

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
very difficult to get this car so if you

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.920 
very difficult to get this car so if you
want<00:05:36.410> to<00:05:36.440> get<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:36.680> like<00:05:36.950> I<00:05:37.010> said<00:05:37.570> kind<00:05:38.570> of<00:05:38.690> drive
