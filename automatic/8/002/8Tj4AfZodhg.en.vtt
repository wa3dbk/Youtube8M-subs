my<00:02:26.010> ruling<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.700> which<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.880> course<00:02:27.060> will

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
my ruling on it which of course will

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.840 
my ruling on it which of course will
override<00:02:27.900> whatever<00:02:28.440> legal<00:02:29.250> system<00:02:29.820> that
