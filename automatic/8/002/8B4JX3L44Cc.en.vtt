00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
some do it better I have a lot of people

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.840 
some do it better I have a lot of people
telling<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.220> biggest<00:01:35.520> screens

really well and that's just something
I've<00:01:41.340> experienced<00:01:42.180> personally<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.810> it

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
I've experienced personally and I see it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.410 
I've experienced personally and I see it
quite<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.110> bit<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:44.000> once<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> be

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
quite a bit but I once it's going to be

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.940 
quite a bit but I once it's going to be
night<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.689> day<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.960> smaller<00:01:46.290> screens<00:01:46.350> you'll

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
night and day on smaller screens you'll

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.350 
night and day on smaller screens you'll
be<00:01:47.070> pressed<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> difference<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.000> any<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
be pressed to see a difference on any of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.719 
be pressed to see a difference on any of
these<00:01:48.450> players<00:01:48.720> although<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> will<00:01:49.950> say<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.579> a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
these players although I will say if a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.850 
these players although I will say if a
player<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.149> touting<00:01:51.659> its<00:01:51.720> color<00:01:52.020> capabilities

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
player is touting its color capabilities

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.889 
player is touting its color capabilities
that<00:01:53.759> might<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.060> an<00:01:54.119> important<00:01:54.509> feature<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that might be an important feature it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.060 
that might be an important feature it
like<00:01:55.140> i<00:01:55.229> said<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.409> becomes<00:01:55.619> more<00:01:55.770> important

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
like i said it becomes more important

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.459 
like i said it becomes more important
with<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.250> larger<00:01:56.520> screen<00:01:56.790> sizes<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:57.990> i

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
with the larger screen sizes so if i

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.340 
with the larger screen sizes so if i
choose<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.250> there's<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.570> hdmi<00:02:00.930> encoding

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
choose to do there's the hdmi encoding

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.840 
choose to do there's the hdmi encoding
can<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.530> done<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.979> hdmi<00:02:02.310> video<00:02:02.430> decoding

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
can be done or the hdmi video decoding

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
can be done or the hdmi video decoding
to<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.090> done<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> blu-ray<00:02:03.930> player<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.469> my

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to be done and the blu-ray player in my

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
television or some device in between

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
like the Anchor Bay products the DVD

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.050 
like the Anchor Bay products the DVD
edge<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.179> showed<00:02:09.360> up

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
edge we showed up

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.150 
edge we showed up
it's<00:02:10.539> getting<00:02:10.989> processed<00:02:11.230> by<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.590> player<00:02:11.890> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
it's getting processed by the player and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.559 
it's getting processed by the player and
then<00:02:12.310> it's<00:02:12.459> coming<00:02:12.700> out<00:02:12.790> through<00:02:13.000> HDMI<00:02:13.510> it

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
then it's coming out through HDMI it

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.240 
then it's coming out through HDMI it
could<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.290> one<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.530> two<00:02:14.709> form<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.040> could<00:02:15.160> be

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
could be in one of two form it could be

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.760 
could be in one of two form it could be
an<00:02:15.340> RGB<00:02:15.640> format<00:02:15.760> or<00:02:16.480> component<00:02:17.110> video<00:02:17.200> format

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
an RGB format or component video format

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.930 
an RGB format or component video format
coming<00:02:18.069> out<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.340> player<00:02:18.489> that's<00:02:18.670> usually

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
coming out of the player that's usually

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.479 
coming out of the player that's usually
selectable<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.630> most<00:02:20.530> cases<00:02:20.739> it's<00:02:21.010> probably

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
selectable in most cases it's probably

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.160 
selectable in most cases it's probably
component<00:02:21.970> video<00:02:22.030> that's<00:02:22.360> coming<00:02:22.420> out<00:02:22.690> which

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
component video that's coming out which

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.390 
component video that's coming out which
is<00:02:23.290> still<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.470> compressed<00:02:23.800> format<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.370> then

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
is still a compressed format and then

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.430 
is still a compressed format and then
that<00:02:25.239> signal<00:02:25.750> would<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.930> transmitted

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
that signal would be transmitted

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.020 
that signal would be transmitted
digitally<00:02:26.739> over<00:02:26.980> HDMI<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.430> then<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.700> TV

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
digitally over HDMI and then the TV

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.670 
digitally over HDMI and then the TV
would<00:02:28.180> be<00:02:28.269> doing<00:02:28.510> decoding<00:02:28.900> there<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.410> could

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
would be doing decoding there it could

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.370 
would be doing decoding there it could
be<00:02:29.860> happening<00:02:30.040> but<00:02:30.970> I'm<00:02:31.660> going<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:31.959> say<00:02:32.140> in

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
be happening but I'm going to say in

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.800 
be happening but I'm going to say in
most<00:02:32.650> cases<00:02:32.769> it's<00:02:33.430> happening<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.630> player

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
most cases it's happening on the player

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.500 
most cases it's happening on the player
itself<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:36.099> is<00:02:36.310> there<00:02:36.910> are<00:02:37.060> differences

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
itself and it is there are differences

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.330 
itself and it is there are differences
but<00:02:37.690> I'd<00:02:38.170> say<00:02:38.349> they're<00:02:38.500> just<00:02:38.530> minor<00:02:38.860> are<00:02:39.160> not

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
but I'd say they're just minor are not

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.770 
but I'd say they're just minor are not
minor<00:02:39.550> but<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.150> basically<00:02:40.300> if<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.599> don't

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
minor but it's basically if you don't

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.490 
minor but it's basically if you don't
have<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.959> seven<00:02:41.380> or<00:02:41.470> eight<00:02:41.620> foot<00:02:41.980> screen<00:02:43.500> you

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
have a seven or eight foot screen you

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.020 
have a seven or eight foot screen you
can<00:02:44.650> pretty<00:02:44.830> much<00:02:44.920> go<00:02:45.130> with<00:02:45.280> anything<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.730> I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
can pretty much go with anything I I

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.610 
can pretty much go with anything I I
would<00:02:46.269> say<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.540> I'd<00:02:46.959> say<00:02:47.110> you've<00:02:47.230> been<00:02:47.350> pretty

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
would say so I'd say you've been pretty

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.199 
would say so I'd say you've been pretty
satisfied<00:02:48.190> with<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.430> but<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:48.940> you're<00:02:49.090> if

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
satisfied with it but if you're if

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.759 
satisfied with it but if you're if
you're<00:02:49.299> looking<00:02:49.540> for<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:49.690> high-end<00:02:49.870> look

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
you're looking for the high-end look

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:51.900 
you're looking for the high-end look
around<00:02:51.010> for<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.190> players<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.430> tout<00:02:51.730> their

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
around for the players that tout their

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.729 
around for the players that tout their
ability<00:02:52.299> for<00:02:52.480> color<00:02:52.690> reprocessing<00:02:53.410> and

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
ability for color reprocessing and

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.229 
ability for color reprocessing and
getting<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.340> line<00:02:54.549> it's<00:02:54.849> also<00:02:55.060> worth

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
getting that in line it's also worth

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.210 
getting that in line it's also worth
pointing<00:02:55.330> out<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.989> more<00:02:56.410> expensive<00:02:56.739> I

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
pointing out that a more expensive I

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.339 
pointing out that a more expensive I
could<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.760> could<00:02:58.299> be<00:02:58.599> proved<00:02:58.840> horribly<00:02:59.170> wrong

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
could I could be proved horribly wrong

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.839 
could I could be proved horribly wrong
with<00:02:59.500> this<00:02:59.560> but<00:02:59.739> generally<00:03:00.010> speaking<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.459> more

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
with this but generally speaking a more
