some direction as to where to
specifically<00:02:10.460> steer<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.030> course<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.600> mean

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
specifically steer the course I mean

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.170 
specifically steer the course I mean
let's<00:02:11.930> face<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.140> it's<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.220> number<00:02:13.550> one<00:02:13.730> target

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
let's face it it's the number one target

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.840 
let's face it it's the number one target
would<00:02:14.330> be<00:02:14.390> sending<00:02:14.870> people<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.410> Boeing<00:02:15.850> back

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
would be sending people to Boeing back

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.700 
would be sending people to Boeing back
at<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.060> school<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.570> class<00:02:17.690> rolls<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.380> small

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
at the school the class rolls a small

barely<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.940> scratch<00:02:23.150> there's<00:02:23.900> very<00:02:24.140> little

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
barely a scratch there's very little

garvin<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.140> students<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.709> hope<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.130> this

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
garvin and the students the hope is this

garvin and the students the hope is this
course<00:02:29.090> lays<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.330> foundation<00:02:29.570> for<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.230> future

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
course lays a foundation for a future

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.650 
course lays a foundation for a future
that's<00:02:30.890> as<00:02:31.160> strong<00:02:31.550> as<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.060> composites

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
that's as strong as the composites

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.260 
that's as strong as the composites
themselves<00:02:33.260> there's<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.739> lot<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.270> opportunity

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
themselves there's a lot of opportunity

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.500 
themselves there's a lot of opportunity
and<00:02:35.570> that's<00:02:36.380> exactly<00:02:36.820> what<00:02:37.820> I'm<00:02:37.940> hoping<00:02:38.180> to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
and that's exactly what I'm hoping to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.949 
and that's exactly what I'm hoping to
accomplish<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.209> me<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.720> most

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
accomplish this to me is the most

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.960 
accomplish this to me is the most
cutting-edge<00:02:42.440> technology<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.550> know<00:02:43.730> we're

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
cutting-edge technology so I know we're

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.240 
cutting-edge technology so I know we're
all<00:02:44.060> putting<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.390> lot<00:02:44.510> into<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:45.739> all<00:02:45.950> know<00:02:45.980> a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
all putting a lot into it we all know a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.280 
all putting a lot into it we all know a
lot<00:02:46.550> more<00:02:46.760> today<00:02:47.150> than<00:02:47.360> we<00:02:47.450> did<00:02:47.660> only<00:02:47.810> started

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
lot more today than we did only started

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.950 
lot more today than we did only started
a<00:02:48.350> few<00:02:48.380> months<00:02:48.620> ago
