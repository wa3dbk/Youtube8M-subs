00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.500
 Dr 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.500
 more 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.900
 September the artists and 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.520
 at the same time also concertante 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.240
 this will be Porsche 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.420
 I have a way of course which, of course, both the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.890
 made in front of sketches 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.480
 for the European Championship 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.510
 where the leader will be used in the game 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.960
 but also at the same time this model 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 in my word and also discussed 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.140
 not started so I am fascinated and I am 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.290
 a few meters here for Mac 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.810
 and my job is just that 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.570
 breathe life into those figures 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.380
 So moving the figures to move the creatures moves it 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.790
 So goes Wortmann Fink drive and pulled dragons because of driving 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.290
 help as prescribed 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.460
 So without rules, that's one 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.850
 a kind of Miettinen 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 or meeting with that had knight orders 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.009
 placed with the 3ds and 2 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.109
 and there when ideas are worked out 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.209
 found coca-cola 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.309
 or simply 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.549
 clarified what the characters should happen in the game and 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.529
 that should look like and then 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.529
 what function do the figures have that very important 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.899
 then the corporation did not exist in the case at all 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.429
 it works simply no 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.429
 whole wealth of new characters from the field 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.229
 the Munsterische shoots 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.229
 on the internet in books 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.539
 and then with shape 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.639
 Somehow find something interesting and then what the function 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.889
 Fulfills 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.579
 that is Alba went with it based on that 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:53.719
 on the dining table 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.099
 what would have come from the motto life 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.659
 those are the bones with joints that build around the musculoskeletal system 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.089
 can be moved 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.989
 it's percent compared to a puppeteer 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.469
 to show the magazine calculator 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:12.329
 the animals say something like a fasting these little ones 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.499
 this blue this Houghton 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.339
 anfasser 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:18.549
 So the handles 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.389
 In the case of the sample, animal movements may be touched on the samples 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.779
 "I never can 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.789
 and because the programs this year 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.179
 move 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.269
 to the poor 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.879
 Feet to the head 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.939
 the character 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.939
 and this is how an animation begins to play 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.709
 we have human beings next to the reggae 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.879
 and around wrapped 3d CEST 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.340
 and then we had an area of â€‹â€‹defense in 2d 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.439
 Programs like Photoshop were meant and that's called texturing we give 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.439
 the figure a driver and percent a surface seal 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.430
 Percent do not shine so shine 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.269
 material properties 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.709
 and around 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.119
 Sun was not about the globe at Dirkules round 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:12.140
 yes our characters are much more complex 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.140
 but the queried are indeed the Erdkrater 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:19.109
 one can not imagine that one sneeze the pattern week sum 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.209
 have to think about it 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.270
 where will covert cut 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.620
 they brought 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.290
 and percent off so that the two-dimensional smooth surface 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.819
 to have 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.569
 this one could then paint 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:34.119
 So, in essence, Lions concerts are finished concept from 804 Tour 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:36.900
 unfinished 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.650
 well recognize where the focus is the parents on which on Hornberg Sund the host 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.389
 have the appropriate functions 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.009
 somehow the prey to tents 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.009
 first or forever 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:52.550
 yes, yes 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.550
 our 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.889
 accordingly, then arises 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.770
 the model Sandweg 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.879
 that's on the skeleton 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.039
 then look like this 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.499
 Witten animates ours 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:17.499
 How is she going to look like this? 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.439
 That's how the Taliban moves 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:56.419
 eat
