00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.630
 creed as you know on Tuesday Yubisoft 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.640

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.890
 video drinking on us new part 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.779
 stories about the league assassins next 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.390
 head of the long-running assassin series creed 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.230
 will become a syndicate previously known as 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.019
 victor 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.019
 the game will release in the fall on playstation 4 and 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.660
 xbox one and pc and unfortunately on the console in 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.030
 past generation she won't appear it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.430
 quite expected bcr gene index 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.860
 comes leaps and bounds big 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.690
 number of games coming out this year already 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.660
 appears only on consoles new 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.460
 generations I studied a ton of information about 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.680
 the game so I have what you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.870
 tell and share and so 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.510
 note the key points and talk about 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.460
 they are more detailed the first talk remained in 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.190
 assassin creed syndicate rear invent with 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.809
 zero well as part of a series course in the past 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.879
 in the series we have already seen a variety 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.409
 minor adjustments to the stealth system but in 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.689
 this time the mechanic has undergone 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.430
 significant changes earlier to us 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.530
 it was suggested rather to use shelters 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.990
 hide behind courtesans 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.750
 cut in a haystack that is essentially 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.790
 use the environment right now to us 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.640
 have to press a button to enter 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.710
 and get out of stealth mode by the way and we 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.360
 we will be able to use environmental objects 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.700
 example lighting lights 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.930
 cut with a knife hanging in the air mesh 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.630
 with barrels and boxes 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.950
 and so on now we can whistle 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.470
 as an example in sex 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.049
 to lure the enemies to your system 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.970
 The fight says a little though it is promised 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.009
 make it more responsive alive and 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.530
 dynamic in the second assassin creed 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.659
 add elements gta about what am i da oh 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.149
 that if you notice we can now 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.549
 ride carts and sleds true 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.890
 I'm afraid to break the glass and release the line 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.460
 of ultrasound can not be but I think what we 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.740
 survive 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.020
 naturally appear and accompanying 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.329
 carriage missions and themes such as 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.329
 avoiding chase and chase cool 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.759
 Further part 3 move if you played 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.469
 worms there is a cool thing rope 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.890
 which allows us to quickly 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.380
 move clinging to anything 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.150
 if you have not played you are not afraid 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.550
 they gave us a cool device using 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.100
 which process of moving will become 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.680
 more interesting by the way in a similar thing 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.230
 guns and batman in the game this thing will 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.600
 called shanbiao and with her we 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.209
 we can climb buildings and buildings 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.400
 moment part 4 about the setting of the game 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.820
 I donâ€™t know all the details but action 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.220
 happens in london in 1868 our 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.840
 Brother's sister sales who are planning 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.670
 organize crime syndicate 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.190
 hence the name assassin creed 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.500
 syndicate main characters name is jacob and 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.450
 ivy frei trailer is a bit like 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.250
 famous gang movie of new york 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.530
 because we have to fight with 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.780
 existing orders of the city winning 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.440
 as ordinary members of groups such 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.350
 the leaders 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.180
 sounds good rey part 5 multiplayer 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.850
 quite unexpected was the fact that 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.530
 multiplayer will not be developers want 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.160
 concentrate as much as possible on 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.290
 gameplay 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.090
 considering the mistakes of the previous series and not 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.340
 sprayed on several game modes 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.620
 it is not clear what did not suit the past models 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.140
 multiplayer since in many ways he already 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.850
 was pretty good well let's see what of 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.700
 this will come but the sixth part 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.860
 about the release date of the game confirmed the exact 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.980
 date for playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.380
 October 15, while the release of the ipc 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.170
 promise closer to the holidays that in general 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.670
 he says november but for pre-order us 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.010
