 then you have soul and body and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.850
 so you go in the conversion 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.250
 engine modifications were the driving force 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.809
 elite iv okay that's the transmission 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.110
 you leave home powered 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.110

 do you want and diligent like them 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:11.240
 tires here at bottom width but also 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.240
 thoroughly it makes a small stylish look opus 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.230
 you prepare your transmission thoroughly 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.610
 clutch at two speeds or a 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:24.180
 transmission and differential then 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.270
 you go the adhesion platform the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.530
 will thoroughly and thoroughly pull out the anti 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.570
 roll forward and backward on the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.050
 reinforced frame not up to the hoop 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.690
 cage that until now and the lightening well 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.040
 obviously thoroughly you go into the 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:48.270
 engine to prepare the engine up 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.740
 until then voices there until the valves 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.460
 here is preparing your height until 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.150
 valves at full tune the volumetry 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:02.130
 leave the piston or 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:04.740
 put the original turbo the exchanger 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.770
 the origin of cooling milk 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.810
 of origin is the lightened flywheel 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.520
 if you what should give you your 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.240
 car roughly in s 902 s 2 912 so 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.400
 then a 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.920
 then place at the settings instead of 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.900
 settings that's it for the tires 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.900
 that's it for reports 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.490
 that's it for the alignment 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.380
 that's the roll bars 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.990
 for the springs 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.189
 for shock absorbers 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.430
 aerodynamics did not want to touch it 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.430
 normally that's the brakes 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.980
 repository you leave it like that a 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.930
 times you put this is going to be a 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.610
 small watercolor congratulations car that 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.260
 will pass well you can simply 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.940
 mark my gamertag and download 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.780
 the one I did the one that is safe 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.220
 the barthe and we will test them for you 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.489

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.700
 how do we go for to lift the 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.920
 car there is a little technique to 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.370
 to do then you take no head 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.239
