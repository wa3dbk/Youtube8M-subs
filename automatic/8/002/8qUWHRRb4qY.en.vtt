 thank you come for 10 interview so I 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.590
 asked him a first question 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.199
 how does he see himself define himself 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:27.680
 event the stage on which he plays and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.680
 finally the public forgiveness sauce like awa 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:55.110
 compete ok so he said that's the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.410
 first time they played in a 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.690
 in a cinema that was it's 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 pretty well pretty well laid out and at 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.019
 level 2 of the audience he said it was 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.060
 not as good as the French you 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.380
 can be proud of you but hey there is 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.510
 also the fact that they make food and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.510
 so it's inevitably that's a lot 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.560
 less heavy we'll say the second 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.380
 question we're going to ask him is to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.470
 about their state of trust 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.060
 current they just won the sw 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.380

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.549
 are first in their group at this stage 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:02:00.509
 of the competition how are they 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:02:02.310
 agree so he said the team 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.740
 epsilon in fact it's a limited team 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.290
 gave a friend and if so with a lon 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.989

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.970
 cetto remy and on the other side heal 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.040

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.480
 they are happy to have beaten 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.400
 feel confident enough for the next 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.020

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.740
 for them it's going to end 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.650
 correctly 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.320
