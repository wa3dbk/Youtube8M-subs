00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
 high waist or seizures and collects 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.470
 today we will test a helmet of the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.600
 logical mark 3 but if I tell you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.069
 rather than it's a ferrari helmet I 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.730
 think you're going to be a little bit more 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.800
 interested any case what has been 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.060
 provided by my partner m life and we 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.949
 let's go unpacking right away 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.600
 to see what we have with the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.039
 box on the front of the box on there 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.810
 found the helmet of profiles showing 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.580
 that this is your ferrari helmet as well 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.439
 that logical mark 3 and logo 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.000
 ferrari on the back we find the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.949
 different characteristics of the helmet 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.360
 and its accessories the opening of the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.370
 box made backstage we find a 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.410
 ferrari red card is then accessed 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.270
 on the helmet's protective box in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.640
 carbon zipper with logo 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.530
 do and of course and then the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.579
 ducasse on our manual 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.110
 then the beautiful cover of 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.300
 protection and we arrive directly on 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.670
 the folded helmet in its compartment and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 from the side that of the 3 cable accessories 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.969
 jack one provides with the first a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.530
 health jack comments them the second with 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.600
 remote control and microphone without control 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.879
 volume and the last one with control of the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.079
 volume 2 adapters are provided slow 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.640
 for the plane and the second for the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.769
 amps for example who is in the process 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.110
 exactly the same as the one sold with 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.700
 the marshall wants a long time to the helmet that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 unfolds its atria contain the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.470
 Ferrari logo with a pretty close design 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 of the parrot zik the headset gets in 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.549
 a special meaning on the head with 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.229
 hoops of course claims this headset 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.759
 to finish pretty flexible little point 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.710
 weak the tips are different and 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.540
 so reserved for helmets and secondly 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.549
 the remote is in plastic and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.290
 seems not very rigid comparing the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.610
 now at marshall in terms of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.619
 size it's exactly the same 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.689
 even if the auricles marchal are a 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.430
 a little flatter the two helmets do not get 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.829
 do not fold the same way and I prefer 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.659
 the ferrari the ferrari pillow made of 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.509
 leather and aluminum show a plus 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.710
 great fluidity against marshall 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.360
 inside the atria are more 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.130
 comfortable with the ferrari that with the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.960
 marshall to finish 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.189
 the arch of the cervix are much more 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 solid than the market 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.270
 so here we go now to the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.439
 audio part since this headset down that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.939
 allows you to listen to music while 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.799
 stupid firstly it's a helmet 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.000
 supra auricular since supra 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.920
 auricular I remind him his sticks 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.619
 on the ear like he has a lot of 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.729
 foam and a little helmet what ben if you 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.920
 sues provoked even if we have a 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.270
 quality of listening frankly super good 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.380
 vouziers of the musics that they are in 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.390
 the space that 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.460
 in the treble in the medium that this 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.080
 the rock hard rock electronic 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.730
 classic French variety 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.240
 like him christophe mae or what you 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.680
 want the sound is really super good 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.080
 but heard I started to test this 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.780
 headphones with hard rock music 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.120
 So the AC / DC and to my amazement 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.640
 I find that this headset so the headphones 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.920
 ferrari by logic 3 to a better sound 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.780
 that what could give losique with it 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.580
 the same piece in back in black and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.890
 frankly this is a strong point given the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.270
 price of this case what will I talk about at the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.560
 fine little negative point that I can 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.260
 ona this headset is that if you 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.850
 would like to experience you with 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.230
 sound insulation on this headset 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.210
 that is, you have to put the sound in 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.050
 its maximum if you dictated the iphone of 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.000
 turn up the sound thoroughly 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.770
 the person who was next to you well 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.570
 will hear the sound as if at the entrance of a 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.960
 iphone for example have come out of 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.730
 speakers 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.620
 it's a small point that I can 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.910
 give but otherwise if you adjust 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.100
 normally ben the person next door 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.080
 will not hear you hear we are very 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.100
 very well you'll hear a little bit of 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.930
 what's going on outside since 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.340
 there is no sound insulation and pilar 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.410
 but given the size of the helmet 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.420
 luckily it has to be largely 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.680
 better another little negative point there is 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.730
 no fresh water there is no wifi there 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.830
 there is no snow that's it I'm 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.250
 compare his music but now it's done 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.860
 part of the middle helmets in the middle of the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.350
 market I did it was complicated you 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.760
 have the cases what could you have 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.350
 the helmets is starting to be good as 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.960
 eg marshall have you 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.460
 good helmets like this one is true you 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.240
 what is very good your very 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:42.030
 expensive like for example the zik or 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.250
 bofs other things like that and this guy 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.510
 what this fabric is in the middle with 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.400
 ansxander the best of both 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.760
 worlds berne having a little less than 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.280
 things that the zik so upscale and 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.990
 a few more things than marshall 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.640
 for example first thing he's in 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.250
 more than marshall is that the cable 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.480
 the jack sow removes sow removes 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.760
 sow takes off and that's frankly 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.830
 well that is to say that you put your 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.690
 life your helmet in his pocket you 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.490
 remove them do you but beside and the 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.750
 ie do not go there do not get involved and 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.640
 everything is fine 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.280
 another plus point is that the headphones 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.840
 folds so it saves space 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.790
 the hoops are as you show them 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.109
 just now adjustable so if you 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.989
 have a big is his mark a little 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.580
 head it works too and everything works 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.470
 wonderfully that's what we could read 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.330
 on this little helmet for not doing too much 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.370
 long because too long but it's 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.259
 not interesting is the helmet 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.190
 Interviewed by m life partners 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:37.410
 of the site and this helmet so your 279 euros 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.069
 that's the price range I would have put 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.180
 game remy 249 euros to say that 250 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:45.330
 euros this headset but they preferred 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.970
 put 280 euros is ferrari so 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.069
 it's not the patro hast thou seen the 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.680
 beige leather and where aluminum is super 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.940
 super super pretty compared to others 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.780
 fresh products that exists in the market 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.550
 as iphone of Ferrari 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.039
 horrible ferrari beats helmets in yellow 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.270
 and orange short am here frankly it's 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.949
 a success at the level 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.780
 aesthetic at the sound quality level 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.539
 I strongly recommend it if you 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.330
 look for a frame that is close by 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.800
 example music in terms of design 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.169
 close to a small helmet and that the 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.210
 makes small foldable that works at 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.750
 cable and no more so no batteries 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.460
 no homeland is who and who gives the 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.000
 fishing that makes you want to listen to the 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.310
 music 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.229
 here I advise you strongly here 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.699
 thank you all for watching this video 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.070
