 good long and good saturation 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.530
 it's hard on him catching on to 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.710
 good saturates 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.509

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.010
 qualitatively 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.500
 somewhere in this way good it will be 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.790
 she what he consists of what

 than to this you to liquid thing well 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:31.560
 for example, compare kebabs 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:35.220
 bringing the appointment longer for no reason I 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.500
 society saturated and another principle 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.810
 which look very good 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.810
 high-quality saturate it four universities 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.989
 if we remember the traditional dinner 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.880
 any people of the world there usually 1 then

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.120
 not on 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.790
 since you just stretches me up 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.220
 status and anyone would take that much 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.860
 because their one piece 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:35.530
 that is, at least one 3 such you are 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.340
 gives all four it allows well 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.340
