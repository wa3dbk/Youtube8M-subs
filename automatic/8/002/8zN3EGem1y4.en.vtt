loopy design on cabin boy Ken it worked
really<00:00:16.289> well

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
really well

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.540 
really well
we<00:00:17.820> called<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.720> loopy<00:00:19.230> bandolier<00:00:19.980> design

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
we called it the loopy bandolier design

we called it the loopy bandolier design
this<00:00:21.300> has<00:00:21.449> been<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> great<00:00:21.990> stem<00:00:22.529> project<00:00:23.130> we

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
this has been a great stem project we

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.640 
this has been a great stem project we

studied<00:00:28.650> various<00:00:29.039> national<00:00:29.760> standards<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
studied various national standards and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.030 
studied various national standards and
ended<00:00:30.900> up<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.130> loopy<00:00:32.640> bandolier<00:00:34.040> but
