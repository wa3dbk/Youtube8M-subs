why<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.150> figured<00:00:09.389> I'd<00:00:09.570> make<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.780> quick<00:00:10.050> video

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
why I figured I'd make a quick video

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.870 
why I figured I'd make a quick video
about<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.860> if<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.219> could<00:00:11.309> help<00:00:11.490> somebody<00:00:11.670> out
