shown in the demo but is something that

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.380 
shown in the demo but is something that
you<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:17.070> some<00:02:17.370> people<00:02:17.460> are<00:02:17.610> probably<00:02:17.910> gonna

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
you know some people are probably gonna

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.540 
you know some people are probably gonna
ask<00:02:18.480> about<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.680> game<00:02:19.920> will<00:02:20.190> allow<00:02:20.370> you

to<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.930> real-time<00:02:22.620> transformations<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:25.020> you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
to do real-time transformations so you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.800 
to do real-time transformations so you
can't<00:02:25.380> actually<00:02:25.620> invoke<00:02:26.550> like<00:02:27.210> Super<00:02:27.510> Saiyan

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810

mode<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.230> things<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:31.250> nice

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.120 

and<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.720> know<00:02:45.870> obviously<00:02:46.500> Dragon<00:02:46.890> Ball<00:02:47.010> has

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
and you know obviously Dragon Ball has

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.880 
and you know obviously Dragon Ball has
always<00:02:47.310> been<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.640> very<00:02:47.760> fast-paced<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:49.800> know

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
always been a very fast-paced you know

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.740 
always been a very fast-paced you know
fighting<00:02:50.130> experience<00:02:50.790> but<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.120> game

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
fighting experience but this game

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.770 
fighting experience but this game
I<00:02:51.860> think<00:02:52.860> Dimps<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.250> really<00:02:53.550> really<00:02:54.540> kind<00:02:54.690> of

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
I think Dimps is really really kind of

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.200 
I think Dimps is really really kind of
improved<00:02:55.530> even<00:02:55.950> than<00:02:56.070> making<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.400> even<00:02:56.790> faster

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
improved even than making it even faster

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.890 
improved even than making it even faster
and<00:02:57.810> more<00:02:58.020> more<00:02:58.920> quick<00:02:59.600> getting<00:03:00.600> into<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
and more more quick getting into the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.250 
and more more quick getting into the
battles<00:03:01.290> much<00:03:01.800> more<00:03:02.040> intense<00:03:03.050> so<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.080> think

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
battles much more intense so I think

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.250 
battles much more intense so I think
it's<00:03:04.560> going<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.710> be<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:05.690> really<00:03:06.690> fun

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
it's going to be a really fun

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.970 
it's going to be a really fun
yeah<00:03:07.710> they<00:03:08.370> got<00:03:08.580> fan
