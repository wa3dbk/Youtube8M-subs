so<00:01:43.340> much<00:01:43.490> going<00:01:43.549> on<00:01:44.000> I<00:01:44.149> think<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.390> only<00:01:44.450> reason

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
so much going on I think the only reason

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.539 
so much going on I think the only reason
why<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.020> didn't<00:01:45.409> think<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.710> was<00:01:45.770> as<00:01:46.009> good<00:01:46.280> as<00:01:46.429> the

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
why I didn't think it was as good as the

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.450 
why I didn't think it was as good as the
first<00:01:46.789> book<00:01:47.030> was<00:01:47.299> just<00:01:47.630> because<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.590> maybe<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
first book was just because of maybe the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.520 
first book was just because of maybe the
pacing<00:01:49.939> spoiler<00:01:50.570> alert<00:01:50.600> people<00:01:51.109> who<00:01:51.320> haven't

pacing spoiler alert people who haven't

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.160

the<00:01:54.289> arena<00:01:54.649> Katniss<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:55.929> think<00:01:56.929> it<00:01:57.049> needed<00:01:57.320> that

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
the arena Katniss I think it needed that

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.069 
the arena Katniss I think it needed that
time<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.950> kind<00:01:58.759> of<00:01:58.820> build<00:01:59.060> up<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.719> needed

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
time to kind of build up and it needed

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.660 
time to kind of build up and it needed
that<00:02:00.229> kind<00:02:00.409> of<00:02:00.499> slower<00:02:00.799> pace<00:02:01.100> in<00:02:01.399> order<00:02:01.579> to

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
that kind of slower pace in order to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.170 
that kind of slower pace in order to
kind<00:02:01.759> of

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
kind of

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.050 
kind of
to<00:02:02.480> that<00:02:03.230> big<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.220> know<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.520> big<00:02:04.670> twist

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
to that big you know that big twist

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.020 
to that big you know that big twist
however<00:02:05.840> once<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:06.650> gets<00:02:06.830> into<00:02:06.980> the<00:02:07.100> arena<00:02:07.400> it<00:02:07.730> I

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
however once it gets into the arena it I

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.580 
however once it gets into the arena it I
think<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.300> should<00:02:08.509> have<00:02:08.600> been<00:02:08.720> just<00:02:08.960> constant

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
think it should have been just constant

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.260 
think it should have been just constant
action<00:02:09.770> still<00:02:10.250> gonna<00:02:10.490> have<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.850> character

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
action still gonna have that character

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.790 
action still gonna have that character
development<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.840> there<00:02:12.020> here<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.350> there<00:02:12.500> but

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
development and there here and there but

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.770 
development and there here and there but
I<00:02:13.220> thought<00:02:13.490> there<00:02:13.670> were<00:02:13.760> some<00:02:14.030> moments<00:02:14.210> when

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
I thought there were some moments when

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.590 
I thought there were some moments when
it<00:02:15.560> spent<00:02:16.280> maybe<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.640> bit<00:02:16.850> too<00:02:16.880> much<00:02:17.120> time<00:02:17.570> in

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
it spent maybe a bit too much time in

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.240 
it spent maybe a bit too much time in
cabinets<00:02:18.110> his<00:02:18.260> head<00:02:18.440> hope<00:02:18.920> I'm<00:02:19.040> not<00:02:19.190> making

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
cabinets his head hope I'm not making

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.190 
cabinets his head hope I'm not making
anybody<00:02:19.670> mad<00:02:20.030> by<00:02:20.209> saying<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.600> but<00:02:20.750> trust<00:02:21.110> me

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
anybody mad by saying that but trust me

I<00:02:21.260> loved<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.730> book<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.090> death<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.480> that's

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
I loved this book to death and that's

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.110 
I loved this book to death and that's
very<00:02:23.930> very<00:02:24.200> minor<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.250> just<00:02:25.520> kind<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.850> I

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
very very minor but I just kind of I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.170 
very very minor but I just kind of I
kind<00:02:26.990> of<00:02:27.140> knew<00:02:27.830> what<00:02:28.070> Katniss<00:02:28.490> was<00:02:28.700> thinking<00:02:29.090> I

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
kind of knew what Katniss was thinking I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.390 
kind of knew what Katniss was thinking I
had<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.570> really<00:02:29.930> good<00:02:30.200> idea<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.770> what<00:02:31.040> she<00:02:31.220> was

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
had a really good idea of what she was

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.620 
had a really good idea of what she was
thinking<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:32.000> was<00:02:32.120> going<00:02:32.300> through<00:02:32.510> her<00:02:32.570> head

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
thinking it was going through her head

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.860 
thinking it was going through her head
and<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:33.530> feel<00:02:33.770> like<00:02:33.950> some<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:35.120> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
and I feel like some of that in the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.300 
and I feel like some of that in the
arena<00:02:36.170> part<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.620> book<00:02:36.770> could<00:02:37.040> have<00:02:37.190> been

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
arena part of the book could have been

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.490 
arena part of the book could have been
cut<00:02:37.520> down<00:02:37.550> just<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.060> little<00:02:38.270> bit<00:02:38.390> just<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.470> kind

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
cut down just a little bit just to kind

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.430 
cut down just a little bit just to kind
of<00:02:39.830> amp<00:02:40.790> up<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.180> pace<00:02:41.390> just<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.840> bit<00:02:41.989> more<00:02:42.170> at

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
of amp up the pace just a bit more at

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.010 
of amp up the pace just a bit more at
times<00:02:42.709> that's<00:02:43.070> not<00:02:43.280> saying<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.480> was<00:02:44.720> not

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
times that's not saying that it was not

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.229 
times that's not saying that it was not
fast<00:02:45.530> pace<00:02:45.860> because<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.280> really<00:02:46.520> was<00:02:46.820> but

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
fast pace because it really was but

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.760 
fast pace because it really was but
there<00:02:47.450> were<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.660> moments<00:02:47.900> when<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.290> felt<00:02:48.560> like

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
there were just moments when I felt like

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.790 
there were just moments when I felt like
it<00:02:49.430> was<00:02:49.640> starting<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.180> get<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:51.260> know<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.410> little

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
it was starting to get you know a little

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.949 
it was starting to get you know a little
too<00:02:52.040> much<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.700> her<00:02:53.090> head<00:02:53.120> as<00:02:53.660> she<00:02:53.720> kept

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
too much in her head as she kept

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.750 
too much in her head as she kept
mentioning<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.650> gotta<00:02:54.980> keep<00:02:55.130> Peeta<00:02:55.430> alive<00:02:55.550> I

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
mentioning I gotta keep Peeta alive I

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.850 
mentioning I gotta keep Peeta alive I
gotta<00:02:56.030> keep<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.360> alive<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.930> then<00:02:57.530> after<00:02:57.830> a

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
gotta keep you alive and then after a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.890 
gotta keep you alive and then after a
while<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:58.430> kind<00:02:58.790> of<00:02:58.880> felt<00:02:59.270> like<00:02:59.300> that<00:02:59.510> was<00:02:59.720> kind

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
while I kind of felt like that was kind

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.540 
while I kind of felt like that was kind
of<00:02:59.959> repeating<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.650> feel<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:01.190> some<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.459> those

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
of repeating I feel like some of those

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.710 
of repeating I feel like some of those
could<00:03:01.760> have<00:03:01.850> been<00:03:01.940> cut<00:03:02.090> down<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:02.510> kind<00:03:02.690> of

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
could have been cut down just kind of

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.440 
could have been cut down just kind of
things<00:03:02.959> like<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.320> where<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:04.489> just<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:05.060> felt

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
things like that where it just I felt

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.330 
things like that where it just I felt
like<00:03:05.570> there<00:03:05.959> should<00:03:06.140> have<00:03:06.200> been<00:03:06.320> even<00:03:07.070> more

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
like there should have been even more

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.699 
like there should have been even more
action<00:03:08.090> going<00:03:08.360> on<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.630> that<00:03:08.750> scene<00:03:09.019> I<00:03:09.260> said

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
action going on in that scene I said

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.479 
action going on in that scene I said
that<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.100> not<00:03:10.850> saying<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.480> did<00:03:11.690> not

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
that is not saying that I did not

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.910 
that is not saying that I did not
absolutely<00:03:13.540> love<00:03:14.540> every<00:03:15.019> bit<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.410> this<00:03:15.650> book

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
was fantastic I felt it really lived up
