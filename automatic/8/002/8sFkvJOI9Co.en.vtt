00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
difficult task to say the least but the

these top five videos we're selling this
for<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:43.810> whether<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.830> can<00:02:44.950> see<00:02:45.420> 154<00:02:46.420> pounds

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
for just whether you can see 154 pounds

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.890 
for just whether you can see 154 pounds
that's<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.190> weight<00:02:48.370> instantly<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.210> pan<00:02:49.450> 11

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
that's the weight instantly to pan 11

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.620 
that's the weight instantly to pan 11
and<00:02:50.520> doesn't<00:02:51.520> look<00:02:51.640> like<00:02:51.790> anything<00:02:52.240> does<00:02:52.420> it

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
and doesn't look like anything does it

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.050 
and doesn't look like anything does it
but<00:02:52.900> again<00:02:53.530> proving<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.460> I'm<00:02:54.580> judging<00:02:54.760> on

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
but again proving that I'm judging on

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.210 
but again proving that I'm judging on
performance<00:02:55.630> this<00:02:56.020> bat<00:02:56.350> off<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.740> mallet<00:02:57.070> is

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
performance this bat off the mallet is

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.480 
performance this bat off the mallet is
absent<00:02:58.000> absolutely<00:02:58.600> gum<00:02:59.220> it's<00:03:00.220> like<00:03:00.460> a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
absent absolutely gum it's like a

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.820 
absent absolutely gum it's like a
trampoline<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.510> for<00:03:01.960> that<00:03:02.020> reason<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.800> think

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
trampoline and for that reason I think

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.970 
trampoline and for that reason I think
it<00:03:03.190> was<00:03:03.310> worthy<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:03.700> number<00:03:04.120> three

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
it was worthy of number three

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.220 
it was worthy of number three
finally<00:03:05.980> we're<00:03:06.400> not<00:03:06.550> finally<00:03:06.940> sorry

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
finally we're not finally sorry

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.070 
finally we're not finally sorry
penultimately<00:03:08.250> number<00:03:09.250> two<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:10.660> another

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
penultimately number two is another

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.480 
penultimately number two is another
miniature<00:03:11.440> pinhole<00:03:11.950> but<00:03:12.160> like<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.340> said

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
miniature pinhole but like I said

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.210 
miniature pinhole but like I said
there's<00:03:12.790> two<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.410> one<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.100> original

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
there's two and this one is the original

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.530 
there's two and this one is the original
low<00:03:16.200> which<00:03:17.370> incredibly<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.610> actually<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
low which incredibly is actually the

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.050 
low which incredibly is actually the
joint<00:03:19.900> least<00:03:20.380> expensive<00:03:21.190> miniature<00:03:21.700> pan<00:03:21.910> hall

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
joint least expensive miniature pan hall

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.190 
joint least expensive miniature pan hall
bath<00:03:22.300> we<00:03:22.570> have<00:03:22.900> in<00:03:23.050> our<00:03:23.200> store<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:24.930> yet<00:03:25.930> I

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
bath we have in our store and yet I

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.190 
bath we have in our store and yet I
think<00:03:26.260> it's<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.770> best<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.310> lot<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:28.630> again

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
think it's the best of the lot and again

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.690 
think it's the best of the lot and again
the<00:03:29.410> looks<00:03:29.650> are<00:03:29.860> very<00:03:30.040> good<00:03:30.220> for<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.460> grade<00:03:30.670> I

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
the looks are very good for the grade I

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.130 
the looks are very good for the grade I
think<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.210> do<00:03:31.330> have<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.540> bit<00:03:31.690> of<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.780> blemish

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
think you do have a bit of a blemish

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.360 
think you do have a bit of a blemish
there<00:03:32.410> but<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.800> doesn't<00:03:33.070> affect

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
there but that doesn't affect

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.330 
there but that doesn't affect
performance<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:34.300> actually<00:03:34.840> helps<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.620> because

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
performance it actually helps it because

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.550 
performance it actually helps it because
when<00:03:36.520> you<00:03:36.640> tap<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.240> it<00:03:37.540> just<00:03:37.930> Rockets<00:03:38.350> off

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
when you tap that it just Rockets off

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.550 
when you tap that it just Rockets off
and<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.340> it's<00:03:39.820> lovely<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.360> soft<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.320> just

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
and and it's lovely and soft and it just

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.520 
and and it's lovely and soft and it just
absolutely<00:03:42.060> booms<00:03:43.060> off<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.870> mallet<00:03:44.200> for<00:03:44.470> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
absolutely booms off the mallet for the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.340 
absolutely booms off the mallet for the
price<00:03:44.890> I'm<00:03:45.490> very<00:03:46.180> impressed<00:03:46.480> it's<00:03:46.870> nice<00:03:47.050> light

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350
