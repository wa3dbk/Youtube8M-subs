fish<00:02:38.950> or<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.849> protein<00:02:40.689> shake<00:02:40.900> again<00:02:43.530> three

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
fish or a protein shake again three

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.119 
fish or a protein shake again three
hours<00:02:44.650> later<00:02:44.920> I'll<00:02:45.790> have<00:02:46.530> basically<00:02:47.530> almost

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
hours later I'll have basically almost

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.460 
hours later I'll have basically almost
basically<00:02:48.849> what<00:02:48.939> i<00:02:49.030> had<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.239> pre<00:02:49.870> record<00:02:50.200> again

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
basically what i had a pre record again

fruit<00:03:02.470> all<00:03:02.739> in<00:03:03.750> there<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:05.169> as<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.439> I'm<00:03:05.620> trying

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
fruit all in there just as I I'm trying

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.619 
fruit all in there just as I I'm trying
to<00:03:05.919> not<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.189> have<00:03:06.310> as<00:03:06.400> much<00:03:06.579> quick<00:03:07.120> digesting

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
to not to have as much quick digesting

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.610 
to not to have as much quick digesting
carbs<00:03:08.019> um<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:09.489> then<00:03:09.909> basically<00:03:10.689> after<00:03:11.139> that

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
carbs um and then basically after that

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.309 
carbs um and then basically after that
depending<00:03:11.829> on<00:03:12.040> how<00:03:12.250> late<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.489> stay<00:03:12.909> out<00:03:13.319> usually

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
depending on how late I stay out usually

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.619 
depending on how late I stay out usually
from<00:03:14.680> there<00:03:14.859> on<00:03:14.980> it's<00:03:15.459> just<00:03:15.519> protein<00:03:16.209> sources

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
from there on it's just protein sources

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.849 
from there on it's just protein sources
of<00:03:17.019> every<00:03:17.620> three<00:03:17.859> hours<00:03:17.889> and<00:03:19.470> usually<00:03:20.470> before

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
of every three hours and usually before

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.219 
of every three hours and usually before
bed<00:03:21.069> i'll<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:22.030> mild<00:03:22.389> fusion<00:03:22.840> protein

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.229 
bed i'll have the mild fusion protein

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:27.000 
bed i'll have the mild fusion protein
shake<00:03:24.479> sorry<00:03:25.479> guys<00:03:25.720> camera<00:03:26.470> ran<00:03:26.590> out<00:03:26.739> of<00:03:26.769> space

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
shake sorry guys camera ran out of space

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.949 
shake sorry guys camera ran out of space
there<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:27.819> I'll<00:03:27.909> just<00:03:27.970> continue<00:03:28.359> basically

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
there so I'll just continue basically

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.740 
there so I'll just continue basically
from<00:03:29.199> where<00:03:29.379> I<00:03:29.409> was<00:03:29.590> at<00:03:30.120> for<00:03:31.120> bed<00:03:31.299> a<00:03:31.329> lot<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.659> my

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
from where I was at for bed a lot of my

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.830 
from where I was at for bed a lot of my
fusion<00:03:32.139> protein<00:03:32.530> shake<00:03:32.979> get<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.790> good<00:03:34.599> source

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
fusion protein shake get a good source

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.339 
fusion protein shake get a good source
of<00:03:35.109> protein<00:03:36.269> it'll<00:03:37.269> last<00:03:37.449> me<00:03:37.690> throughout<00:03:38.139> the

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
of protein it'll last me throughout the

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.339 
of protein it'll last me throughout the
night<00:03:38.560> um<00:03:39.000> some<00:03:40.000> good<00:03:40.150> casein<00:03:40.659> protein<00:03:41.139> in

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
night um some good casein protein in

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.509 
night um some good casein protein in
there<00:03:41.590> slow<00:03:42.459> digesting<00:03:43.239> pulled<00:03:44.139> me<00:03:44.319> off<00:03:44.349> um<00:03:44.829> as

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
there slow digesting pulled me off um as

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.409 
there slow digesting pulled me off um as
far<00:03:46.329> as<00:03:46.510> my<00:03:46.810> my<00:03:47.500> thoughts<00:03:47.889> and<00:03:48.280> my<00:03:48.419> vitamins

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
far as my my thoughts and my vitamins

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.629 
far as my my thoughts and my vitamins
minerals<00:03:49.870> go<00:03:50.169> on<00:03:51.479> natural<00:03:52.479> peanut<00:03:52.989> butter

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
minerals go on natural peanut butter

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.759 
minerals go on natural peanut butter
should<00:03:54.639> be<00:03:54.790> having<00:03:55.000> um<00:03:55.479> but<00:03:56.409> I<00:03:56.470> usually<00:03:56.590> just

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
should be having um but I usually just

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.420 
should be having um but I usually just
have<00:03:57.069> your<00:03:57.609> regular<00:03:58.000> Skippy<00:03:59.099> crunchy<00:04:00.099> peanut

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
little bit of my bigger meals and maybe

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800 
little bit of my bigger meals and maybe
add<00:04:57.979> another<00:04:58.250> meal<00:04:58.580> while<00:04:59.509> I'm<00:04:59.599> just

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
add another meal while I'm just

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.490 
add another meal while I'm just
ingesting<00:05:00.349> protein<00:05:00.860> um<00:05:02.169> maybe<00:05:03.169> one<00:05:03.379> of<00:05:03.409> the

ingesting protein um maybe one of the

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.290 
ingesting protein um maybe one of the
ones<00:05:03.680> later<00:05:04.009> in<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.280> day<00:05:04.430> but<00:05:04.490> not<00:05:04.819> my<00:05:05.000> one<00:05:05.120> is
