apart<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.480> my<00:00:09.719> last<00:00:09.929> tutorial<00:00:10.110> which<00:00:10.679> was

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
apart to my last tutorial which was

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.200 
apart to my last tutorial which was
learning<00:00:11.130> how<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.219> slow<00:00:11.460> down<00:00:11.610> waving<00:00:11.820> terrain

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
learning how to slow down waving terrain

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.820 
learning how to slow down waving terrain
so<00:00:12.599> if<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.750> haven't<00:00:12.900> seen<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.200> already<00:00:13.380> then

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
now a little heads-up before we start

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.430 
now a little heads-up before we start
changing<00:00:40.120> things<00:00:40.239> around<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:41.050> method<00:00:41.350> I'm

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
changing things around the method I'm

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.170 
changing things around the method I'm
about<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:41.800> teach<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.010> is<00:00:42.280> by<00:00:42.430> no<00:00:42.489> means<00:00:42.760> the

about to teach you is by no means the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.819 
about to teach you is by no means the
same<00:00:43.390> as<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.659> method<00:00:43.960> of<00:00:44.019> slowing<00:00:44.379> down<00:00:44.409> water

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
same as the method of slowing down water

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.009 
same as the method of slowing down water

this random jumping speed that wind

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.710 
this random jumping speed that wind
creates<00:01:09.340> we're<00:01:09.580> gonna<00:01:09.670> change<00:01:10.060> zero<00:01:10.390> point

eight five to zero point zero which

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.240 
eight five to zero point zero which
effectively<00:01:13.600> disables<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.140> wind<00:01:14.350> as<00:01:14.560> you<00:01:14.979> can

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
effectively disables the wind as you can

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.460 
effectively disables the wind as you can
see<00:01:15.399> in<00:01:15.520> game<00:01:15.759> there<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.240> no<00:01:16.509> longer<00:01:16.810> any<00:01:17.110> wind

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
see in game there is no longer any wind

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.600 
see in game there is no longer any wind
messing<00:01:17.860> with<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.070> shadows

messing with the shadows

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.240 
messing with the shadows
so<00:01:18.880> now<00:01:19.060> let's<00:01:19.539> slow<00:01:19.720> down<00:01:19.929> the<00:01:20.020> speed<00:01:20.259> okay

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
so now let's slow down the speed okay

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
so now let's slow down the speed okay
lines<00:01:21.729> 234<00:01:22.720> to<00:01:23.200> 244<00:01:24.099> all<00:01:24.459> these<00:01:24.759> values<00:01:25.119> here

we'll<00:01:28.390> get<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:28.660> work<00:01:28.840> change<00:01:29.709> all<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.160> values

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.930 
we'll get to work change all the values
to<00:01:30.690> 0.0<00:01:31.690> F<00:01:31.929> but<00:01:32.679> this<00:01:32.830> will<00:01:32.979> effectively<00:01:33.310> do<00:01:33.670> is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
to 0.0 F but this will effectively do is

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.850 
to 0.0 F but this will effectively do is
stabilize<00:01:34.239> the<00:01:34.690> shadow<00:01:34.899> movements<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.590> in<00:01:35.770> a
