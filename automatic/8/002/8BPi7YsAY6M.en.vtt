00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
really tight and then pretty much go all

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.889 
really tight and then pretty much go all
the<00:00:51.780> way<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.140> end<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:53.570> see<00:00:54.570> how<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> kind

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the way to the end and see how it kind

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.069 
the way to the end and see how it kind
of<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:56.149> flops<00:00:57.149> over<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
of just flops over there like that

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.229 
of just flops over there like that
that's<00:00:59.010> okay<00:00:59.309> we're<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> fix<00:01:00.090> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
able to do that otherwise if you do the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:40.320 
able to do that otherwise if you do the
top<00:01:28.950> it'll<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.460> stay<00:01:29.670> frizzy<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.360> that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.060

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
you're just going to smooth it over if

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
you make it to smooth like you flatten

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.070 
you make it to smooth like you flatten
it<00:01:48.910> again<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.240> can<00:01:49.360> just<00:01:49.510> go<00:01:49.600> back<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:49.900> tease
