00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello between fields my name is yes 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.270
 the industry i am table tennis coach 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.940
 from bonn and in this video we will 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.450
 Practice and use parallel lifts 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.020
 a very good obstacle for that 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.180
 table tennis the parallel serves 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.670
 are very effective before all things though 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.619
 they are carried out surprisingly and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.800
 that I have a bit of practice here 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.230
 Just what is that a sleeping pad 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.700
 taken because the very good of one 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.050
 then it is easy here as a measure 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.079
 taken the net post and one 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.440
 pulled parallel parallel line and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.570
 I'll always try on the wall now 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.520
 pass by and then here on the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.200
 line 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.760
 that is very good because if there is nothing 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.289
 then the two can stand parallel 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.300
 then play but then come 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.760
 Maybe we want you here 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.309
 if possible have it here and we want it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.800
 really have a bow here too 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.539
 that they turn right in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.969
 end of course it would be even hornier, of course 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.450
 if you could do it if 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.960
 the thing here is exactly on the line 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.900
 would 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.000
 So yes, that's in the first level 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.720
 that's why I always take too difficult 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.939
 the measure of the net because that's good 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.479
 what would I say of the six 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.740
 I want to estimate centimeters so me 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.580
 I'll try that now 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.960
 I have some nice Bavarian 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.960
 cut together for you 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:54.400
 [Applause] 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.140
 the landmark variant in the samples 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.320
 I will even go now and now 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.670
 try to hit the ball head-on 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.670
 play and just located 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.999
 [Applause] 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.870
 So try it out of the me that 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.180
 In any case, I very much prefer more 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.920
 this variant of it more 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.900
 You've seen that, too 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.910
 I once had 34 worlds each other 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.070
 created 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.900
 but this whole straighte variant where 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.000
 we hit the ball centrally and even 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.340
 to hit with passing is natural 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.500
 very surprisingly very fast on and 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.660
 you just can not see it because of it 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.570
 it is immaculate when it runs perfectly 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.620
 helps me stretch that very far 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.980
 heard a lot 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.630
 it makes a sound interest and 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.770
 wisdom really if it's a right one 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.850
 good service was 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.740
 because if I do that they are good 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.810
 good serve but the opponent comes 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.760
 because it scares again in the middle 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.810
 comes and we want quality in the 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.200
 surcharges 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.460
 so let's also hard to cover 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.060
 occupy because then we also great 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.920
 to reach 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.390
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.430
 if so, there is a thumb up there 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.790
 above but your our garden home away 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.790
