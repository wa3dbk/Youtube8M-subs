okay<00:00:01.390> so<00:00:01.450> I'm<00:00:01.660> here<00:00:01.720> in<00:00:02.020> the<00:00:02.139> UDK<00:00:02.440> editor<00:00:02.830> and

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.280 
okay so I'm here in the UDK editor and

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.740 
okay so I'm here in the UDK editor and
the<00:00:03.340> first<00:00:03.580> thing<00:00:03.820> that<00:00:03.850> I<00:00:03.970> want<00:00:04.210> to<00:00:04.300> do<00:00:04.420> to<00:00:04.600> get

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:04.750 
the first thing that I want to do to get

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.259 
the first thing that I want to do to get
up<00:00:04.990> and<00:00:05.200> running<00:00:05.439> with<00:00:05.710> our<00:00:05.830> animation<00:00:06.460> is<00:00:06.970> to

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:07.269 
up and running with our animation is to

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:09.690 
up and running with our animation is to
create<00:00:07.630> an<00:00:07.809> elevator<00:00:08.290> platform<00:00:08.620> that<00:00:09.129> rises

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
create an elevator platform that rises

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.369 
create an elevator platform that rises
out<00:00:09.849> of<00:00:09.969> the<00:00:10.179> green<00:00:10.480> ooze<00:00:10.750> and<00:00:11.080> this<00:00:11.200> will

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379 
out of the green ooze and this will

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.430 
out of the green ooze and this will
appear<00:00:11.709> when<00:00:11.889> the<00:00:12.009> level<00:00:12.280> is<00:00:12.370> completed<00:00:13.089> so<00:00:13.990> to

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
appear when the level is completed so to

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.230 
appear when the level is completed so to
get<00:00:14.589> started<00:00:14.740> at<00:00:15.129> this<00:00:15.219> I'm<00:00:15.400> going<00:00:15.610> to<00:00:15.730> show

does that when the level is loaded and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.120 
does that when the level is loaded and
if<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:03.910> just<00:03:03.940> bring<00:03:04.270> back<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.900> kismet<00:03:05.680> sequence

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
if I just bring back the kismet sequence

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.530 
if I just bring back the kismet sequence
here<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.430> does<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:06.790> when<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.120> level<00:03:07.390> is
