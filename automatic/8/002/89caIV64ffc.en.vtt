 The Lord God appeared again Abraham. 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.699
 next to the sacred tree of way 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.860
 was sitting at the entrance of the camp 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:34.200
 in the hottest time of day 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.450
 looking up abraham saw three 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.300
 men standing in front of you 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.840
 As soon as he saw them, he ran to meet them. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.020
 them and knelt down with his head 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.500
 in floor 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.500
 abraham told 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.890
 My lord, the case deserves your friendship. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.670
 I ask you not to travel before 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.530
 stop in my humble house 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.230
 I'll send water to wash your 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.990
 feet and feet of your friends 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.820
 then I can rest under the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:24.490
 before the food I'm going to serve. 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:27.860
 he said yes we accept 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.640
 I asked Abraham to enter the camp and 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.360
 said the woman sara tags quickly some 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.960
 ten pounds of flour to make bread in 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.620
 then Abraão went to the herd 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.540
 chose a beautiful calf and delivered 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.740
 for the servant to quickly 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.220
 seasoning and roast Abraham picked up milk 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.640
 curdled the roasted calf and 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:01.250
 men with him visitors 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:05.450
 They asked where your wife is. 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.780
 in the camp answered Abraham then 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.990
 visitor spoke 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:16.600
 back next year and with sara 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.600
 woman will have fathered a son 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.080
 sarah secretly listening to what the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.769
 The visitor said he started to laugh inside. 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.330
 precisely because she and her husband were already 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:37.680
 old people very old enough to 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.700
 they had spent time having children 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.340
 sarah then thought the same symbol did not 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.340
 make khao sex beach 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.140
 we are old 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.140
 the Lord God asked 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:07.050
 abrace because sarah laughed because he said 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.580
 interior that is very old and 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.709
 outside the regular period of women 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:19.410
 Is it possible that for God something can be 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:23.430
 Impossible I already said and I will repeat 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:33.390
 next year will be here again and I will 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:36.870
 find the son of sarah the woman of 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.410
 Abraham denied that he had found 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.260
 that's funny but the man is said 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.230
 who was sure to have seen Sara laughing 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.900
 in your indy 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.900
 some time later the Lord called him 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:06.640
 abraham and he replied I'm here sir 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:12.420

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.420

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:24.720

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.980
 the next day 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.990
 abrao woke up early, cut the line 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.780
 put the harness on the donkey and left 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.310

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:48.140
 I get two servants and the son Isaac 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:53.730
 on the third day abraham raised his eyes 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:56.420
 and spotted the place from afar then said 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.420
 to the servants 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.650
 We can wait here while the 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.690
 Boy and I are going to go there. 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.660
 after worship we will return abraham 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.410
 took it is for the sacrifice and the 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.870
 put on the back of his son Isaac 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:26.460
 while leading the fire and failure 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:30.300
 the two continued to walk together 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:34.860
 isaac very innocently asked dad 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:38.130

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.830
 but where is the lamb for the 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:45.270
 sacrifice 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:47.039
 abraham replied the Lord our God is going 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.280
 to provide the lamb for the 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:54.449
 sacrifice and my son and both 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.750
 continued to walk together when 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:02.699
 arrived at the place indicated by God 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:05.190
 Abraham raised an altar and put the 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:10.110
 tied the son on the line of the 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:15.199
 Then he raised his hand, holding the 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.199
 Make a real mark for the end 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:26.960
 but the angel of God cried at that moment 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:31.550

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:35.539

 this caught by its horns in hawthorn 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:05.960

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:15.039
