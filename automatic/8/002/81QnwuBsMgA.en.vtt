think the thing that makes them

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.020 
think the thing that makes them
particular<00:01:02.300> is<00:01:03.300> these<00:01:04.160> these<00:01:05.160> pork<00:01:05.550> sliders

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
particular is these these pork sliders

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.270 
particular is these these pork sliders
here<00:01:06.330> these<00:01:07.229> got<00:01:07.440> four<00:01:07.649> different<00:01:07.920> positions

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
here these got four different positions

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.160 
here these got four different positions
that<00:01:08.460> are<00:01:08.520> later<00:01:08.700> tune<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:09.690> sound<00:01:09.929> and<00:01:10.110> how

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that are later tune the sound and how

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.570 
that are later tune the sound and how
you<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.440> it<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.009> have<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> nice
