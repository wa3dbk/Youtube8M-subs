is in caring to and from the truck and

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.899 
is in caring to and from the truck and
finally<00:01:06.720> another<00:01:07.140> big<00:01:07.439> saver<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.250> fourth<00:01:08.520> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
finally another big saver the fourth is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.719 
finally another big saver the fourth is
