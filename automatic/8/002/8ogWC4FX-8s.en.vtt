00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 so what can I tell you about the seat 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.460
 unscrewed unscrewing 4 bolts 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.830
 is here here here and here 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.330
 twisted shot took off you pretty 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.960
 so everything is easy without any there when 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.279
 modders zamorochek shot central 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.630
 console too . four bolts here 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:33.870
 here here here they are they screwed back 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.129
 now you can remove this option but me 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.300
 need yours it doesnâ€™t matter she needs 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:44.100
 take off now this seat 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.239
 someone unscrew about 3 bolts 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.809
 need to hinge and unscrew them all later 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.910
 you will need to unscrew these bolts and remove 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.980
 if the console so that we have full access 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.949
 the engine is almost full or 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.079
 partial because you are from this side 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.559
 It will be a little awkward but I think that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.080
 we still handle it later 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.770
 you will need to turn the knobs all off 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.770
 straight this 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.200
 Well, I unscrew as they arrive there 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.150
 some questions I will shoot 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.900
 would show it to prense so far everything is easy 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.160
 smoothly then to collect it all 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.160
 says eyes are afraid hands do 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.580
 I decided to do it myself because I do not trust 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.770
 nicknames minder because they pound 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.860
 there may be as I thought the pump and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.230
 they will say that the liners jammed the tower 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.369
 jammed there through canceled and in the end 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.500
 will rip off in engines and if 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.400
 it costs to buy a contract somewhere from 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.229
 60,000 with all the wallpaper hung but I have 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.010
 that kind of money I do not have even the citizens it 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:03.300
 so rented near the house as if all this 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:06.740
 deal saying that all his forces will 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.169
 do everything see you 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.169
