you were to purchase one this one as you
can<00:00:31.789> see<00:00:31.970> from<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.510> bottom<00:00:32.690> is<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.110> little<00:00:33.680> bit

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
can see from the bottom is a little bit

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.770 
can see from the bottom is a little bit
of<00:00:33.949> pot<00:00:34.370> bound<00:00:34.580> the<00:00:34.970> roots<00:00:35.210> are<00:00:35.360> just<00:00:35.390> starting

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
of pot bound the roots are just starting

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.040 
of pot bound the roots are just starting
to<00:00:35.989> come<00:00:36.110> out<00:00:36.350> of<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.680> back<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:37.610> it's<00:00:38.449> one<00:00:38.809> that

to come out of the back so it's one that

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.660 
to come out of the back so it's one that

the water sits on the bottom on those
roots<00:00:44.360> that<00:00:44.570> our<00:00:44.660> root<00:00:44.780> bound<00:00:44.989> but<00:00:45.530> after<00:00:45.800> we

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
roots that our root bound but after we

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.590 
roots that our root bound but after we
transplant<00:00:46.460> we'll<00:00:46.640> cut<00:00:46.820> those<00:00:47.030> puppies<00:00:47.420> off

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
transplant we'll cut those puppies off

and<00:00:47.839> this<00:00:48.470> one<00:00:48.680> will<00:00:48.769> do<00:00:48.920> quite<00:00:49.489> nicely<00:00:49.519> in<00:00:50.000> the

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
and this one will do quite nicely in the

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.810 
and this one will do quite nicely in the
container<00:00:50.479> I<00:00:50.720> also<00:00:51.620> have<00:00:52.040> some<00:00:52.250> plants<00:00:52.610> here<00:00:52.790> I

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
black-eyed Susans that we started from

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.759 
black-eyed Susans that we started from
seeds<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.239> I<00:00:56.300> know<00:00:56.600> if<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.140> watched<00:00:57.350> earlier

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
seeds and I know if you watched earlier

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.619 
seeds and I know if you watched earlier
you<00:00:57.890> saw<00:00:58.100> that<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:58.760> can<00:00:58.909> use<00:00:59.089> a<00:00:59.120> wonderful

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
you saw that you can use a wonderful

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.750 
you saw that you can use a wonderful
little<00:00:59.839> tomato<00:01:00.440> container<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.159> grow<00:01:01.309> those<00:01:01.489> in

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
little tomato container to grow those in

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.180 
little tomato container to grow those in
these<00:01:02.420> two<00:01:02.809> are<00:01:03.170> starting<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:03.769> get<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:03.949> little

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
these two are starting to get a little

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.670 
these two are starting to get a little
roots<00:01:04.580> on<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.879> bottom<00:01:05.239> but<00:01:05.659> not<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.260> bad

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
roots on the bottom but not so bad

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.920 
roots on the bottom but not so bad
so<00:01:06.860> they<00:01:06.979> should<00:01:07.159> plant<00:01:07.430> well<00:01:07.610> one<00:01:08.270> tip<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.780> I

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
so they should plant well one tip is I

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.330 
so they should plant well one tip is I
didn't<00:01:09.229> water<00:01:09.380> them<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:09.740> morning<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.220> it's

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
didn't water them this morning so it's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.980 
didn't water them this morning so it's
nice<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.520> dry<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.210> definitely<00:01:11.810> will<00:01:11.960> come

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
nice and dry and definitely will come

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.930 
nice and dry and definitely will come
out<00:01:12.229> of<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.440> container<00:01:12.830> easier<00:01:13.220> if<00:01:13.400> it's

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
out of the container easier if it's

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.550 
out of the container easier if it's
really<00:01:14.210> wet<00:01:14.420> then<00:01:14.720> you'll<00:01:14.869> get<00:01:15.020> roots<00:01:15.290> and

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
really wet then you'll get roots and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.530 
really wet then you'll get roots and
it'll<00:01:15.740> get<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.920> little<00:01:16.100> more<00:01:16.400> shocked<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:17.330> this

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
it'll get a little more shocked so this

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.210 
it'll get a little more shocked so this
way<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:17.780> will<00:01:18.200> water<00:01:18.500> them<00:01:18.680> once<00:01:18.800> they<00:01:18.980> get<00:01:19.130> in

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
way you will water them once they get in

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.940 
way you will water them once they get in
the<00:01:19.310> container<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:19.850> it'll<00:01:20.660> be<00:01:20.840> Munda<00:01:21.710> and

regular potting soil I'm going to add a
little<00:01:34.610> bit<00:01:34.730> of<00:01:35.200> compost<00:01:36.200> going<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.250> add<00:01:37.370> a

so on containers you want to look for

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.340 
so on containers you want to look for
things<00:01:44.120> that<00:01:44.210> hold<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.600> soil<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:45.050> as<00:01:45.170> much<00:01:45.290> as

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
things that hold the soil in as much as

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.730 
things that hold the soil in as much as
you<00:01:45.500> can<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.160> that<00:01:46.900> should<00:01:47.900> be<00:01:48.020> good<00:01:48.260> and<00:01:48.560> I

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
you can so that should be good and I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.350 
you can so that should be good and I
decided<00:01:49.190> I'm<00:01:49.580> going<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.730> put<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.000> on<00:01:50.180> my

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
decided I'm going to put this on my

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.030 
decided I'm going to put this on my
patio<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.230> you<00:01:51.290> got<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.560> decide<00:01:51.800> where<00:01:51.950> you're

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
patio so you got to decide where you're

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.580 
patio so you got to decide where you're
going<00:01:52.160> to<00:01:52.220> put<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.120> black-eyed<00:01:53.990> Susan<00:01:54.410> and

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
going to put it so black-eyed Susan and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.260 
going to put it so black-eyed Susan and
the<00:01:54.650> morning<00:01:54.950> glories<00:01:55.280> will<00:01:55.460> grow<00:01:55.670> up<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.210> I

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
the morning glories will grow up and I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.450 
the morning glories will grow up and I
have<00:01:56.480> a<00:01:56.510> nice<00:01:56.800> spot<00:01:57.800> for<00:01:57.830> them<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.250> grow<00:01:58.430> up

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
have a nice spot for them to grow up

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.870 
have a nice spot for them to grow up
when<00:01:58.790> I<00:01:58.820> move<00:01:59.090> this<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.570> this<00:02:00.080> will<00:02:00.320> grow<00:02:00.880> kind

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
when I move this and this will grow kind

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.060 
when I move this and this will grow kind
of<00:02:01.970> big<00:02:02.180> it'll<00:02:02.600> get<00:02:02.750> fairly<00:02:03.320> good-sized<00:02:03.770> so

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
of big it'll get fairly good-sized so

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.590 
of big it'll get fairly good-sized so
kind<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.370> think<00:02:04.520> about<00:02:04.610> what<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.360> plant<00:02:05.570> is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
kind of think about what the plant is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.450 
kind of think about what the plant is
going<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.780> look<00:02:05.900> like<00:02:06.050> at<00:02:06.230> its<00:02:06.380> adult<00:02:06.680> even

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
going to look like at its adult even

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.820 
going to look like at its adult even
though<00:02:07.550> I'm<00:02:07.700> planning<00:02:08.090> all<00:02:08.209> annuals<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.590> can

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
though I'm planning all annuals so I can

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.559 
though I'm planning all annuals so I can
put<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.039> little<00:02:10.250> more<00:02:10.489> in<00:02:10.700> actually<00:02:11.209> because

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
put a little more in actually because

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.030 
put a little more in actually because
they<00:02:11.750> are<00:02:11.870> annuals<00:02:12.349> if<00:02:12.530> they<00:02:12.620> get<00:02:12.769> a<00:02:12.800> little

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
they are annuals if they get a little

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.490 
they are annuals if they get a little
root<00:02:13.190> bound<00:02:13.400> at<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.550> bottom<00:02:14.140> they're<00:02:15.140> done<00:02:15.349> at

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
root bound at the bottom they're done at

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.930 
root bound at the bottom they're done at
the<00:02:15.590> end<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.860> season<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:16.400> we're<00:02:16.700> good<00:02:16.849> to

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
the end of the season so we're good to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.360 
the end of the season so we're good to
go<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:17.900> I'm<00:02:18.260> going<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.709> show<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:18.980> here<00:02:19.340> this

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
go but I'm going to show you here this

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.119 
go but I'm going to show you here this
one<00:02:19.760> since<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:20.480> one's<00:02:20.829> going<00:02:21.829> to<00:02:21.920> be<00:02:22.010> the

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
one since this one's going to be the

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.039 
one since this one's going to be the
most<00:02:22.340> important<00:02:22.939> guy<00:02:23.269> I'm<00:02:23.659> going<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.870> dig<00:02:24.019> a

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
most important guy I'm going to dig a

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.890 
most important guy I'm going to dig a
nice<00:02:24.290> little<00:02:24.560> hole

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
nice little hole

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
nice little hole
gloves<00:02:26.530> are<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.709> wonderful<00:02:27.010> thing<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:29.080> we<00:02:29.680> will

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
gloves are a wonderful thing and we will

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.820 
gloves are a wonderful thing and we will
gently<00:02:30.280> grab<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.330> stem<00:02:31.660> or<00:02:31.930> put<00:02:32.110> your<00:02:32.260> thumb<00:02:32.560> I

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
gently grab the stem or put your thumb I

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.140 
gently grab the stem or put your thumb I
don't<00:02:32.980> know<00:02:33.069> if<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.400> see<00:02:33.610> right<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.970> there

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
don't know if you can see right in there

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.660 
don't know if you can see right in there
just<00:02:34.330> gently<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.260> when<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.530> turn<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.370> upside

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
just gently so when you turn it upside

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.059 
just gently so when you turn it upside
down<00:02:36.910> you've<00:02:37.510> got<00:02:37.780> your<00:02:37.930> hands<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.860> pot

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
down you've got your hands on the pot

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.070 
down you've got your hands on the pot
and<00:02:39.400> actually<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.150> isn't<00:02:40.360> as<00:02:40.540> rootbound<00:02:40.840> as

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
and actually this isn't as rootbound as

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.690 
and actually this isn't as rootbound as
I<00:02:41.170> thought<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.830> looks<00:02:42.010> really<00:02:42.220> good<00:02:42.489> we're

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
I thought so it looks really good we're

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.070 
I thought so it looks really good we're
going<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.880> going<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.360> take<00:02:43.540> my<00:02:43.690> finger<00:02:44.050> and

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
going to going to take my finger and

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.140 
going to going to take my finger and
loosen<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.590> up<00:02:44.730> basically<00:02:45.730> what<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:45.970> want

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
loosen that up basically what you want

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.120 
loosen that up basically what you want
to<00:02:46.300> do<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.720> roots<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.200> go<00:02:47.410> out<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.950> about

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
to do is the roots to go out and about

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.190 
to do is the roots to go out and about
once<00:02:48.430> they<00:02:48.580> get<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.880> soil<00:02:49.120> if<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.450> plant

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
once they get in the soil if you plant

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.240 
once they get in the soil if you plant
something<00:02:50.470> that's<00:02:50.709> root<00:02:50.920> bound<00:02:51.069> you

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
something that's root bound you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.470 
something that's root bound you
definitely<00:02:51.670> want<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.910> loosen<00:02:52.180> up<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.450> roots

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
definitely want to loosen up the roots

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.270 
definitely want to loosen up the roots
otherwise<00:02:53.170> they<00:02:53.380> start<00:02:53.560> growing<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.190> they

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
otherwise they start growing and they

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.280 
otherwise they start growing and they
sometimes<00:02:54.550> will<00:02:54.880> choke<00:02:55.120> themselves<00:02:55.390> so

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
sometimes will choke themselves so

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.830 
sometimes will choke themselves so
loosen<00:02:56.980> them<00:02:57.099> up<00:02:57.180> get<00:02:58.180> them<00:02:58.299> ready<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.540> go<00:02:58.690> on

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
loosen them up get them ready to go on

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.809 
loosen them up get them ready to go on
the<00:02:58.930> pot<00:02:59.140> you'll<00:02:59.739> set<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.250> baby<00:03:00.549> in<00:03:00.790> there

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
the pot you'll set that baby in there

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.699 
the pot you'll set that baby in there
and<00:03:01.769> we'll<00:03:02.769> put<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.130> dirt<00:03:03.280> all<00:03:03.519> around<00:03:04.709> push

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
and we'll put the dirt all around push

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.920 
and we'll put the dirt all around push
it<00:03:05.860> down<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.430> little<00:03:06.459> bit<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.360> like<00:03:07.780> I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
it down just a little bit and like I

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.900 
it down just a little bit and like I
mentioned<00:03:08.350> before<00:03:08.470> I'm<00:03:09.430> going<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.730> go<00:03:09.790> ahead

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
mentioned before I'm going to go ahead

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.759 
mentioned before I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:10.150> cut<00:03:10.330> these<00:03:10.510> yellow<00:03:10.810> leaves<00:03:11.110> off<00:03:11.410> because

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
and cut these yellow leaves off because

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.180 
and cut these yellow leaves off because
there's<00:03:11.950> not<00:03:12.160> going<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.400> do<00:03:12.580> me<00:03:12.670> any<00:03:12.700> good<00:03:13.209> for

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
there's not going to do me any good for

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.500 
there's not going to do me any good for
photosynthesis<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.370> do<00:03:15.670> treat<00:03:15.970> development

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
photosynthesis and do treat development

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.449 
photosynthesis and do treat development
so<00:03:16.810> we'll<00:03:16.959> get<00:03:17.110> rid<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.319> those<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.830> in<00:03:18.250> case

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
so we'll get rid of those and in case

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.820 
so we'll get rid of those and in case
they<00:03:18.670> are<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.910> fungi<00:03:19.480> or<00:03:19.630> anything<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:20.260> will

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
they are a fungi or anything I will

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.460 
they are a fungi or anything I will
probably<00:03:21.209> clean<00:03:22.209> my<00:03:22.390> scissors<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.260> will

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
probably clean my scissors and I will

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.199 
probably clean my scissors and I will
throw<00:03:23.769> those<00:03:23.950> away<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.489> don't<00:03:24.640> spread<00:03:25.150> that

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
throw those away so I don't spread that

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.160 
throw those away so I don't spread that
anymore

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
anymore

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.320

put this whole thing in it's made out of

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.569 
put this whole thing in it's made out of
cardboard<00:03:30.519> so<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.209> will<00:03:31.420> just<00:03:32.130> compost<00:03:33.130> itself

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
cardboard so it will just compost itself

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.330 
cardboard so it will just compost itself
right<00:03:33.790> into<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.269> container<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.130> then<00:03:36.130> this

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
there and you can see the roots but it's

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.630 
there and you can see the roots but it's
dry<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:43.780> they'll<00:03:43.959> stay<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.350> place<00:03:44.609> dig<00:03:45.609> a

because<00:04:20.190> occasionally<00:04:21.190> it<00:04:21.789> will

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
because occasionally it will

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.700 
because occasionally it will
occasionally<00:04:23.440> every<00:04:23.620> time<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.669> soil<00:04:25.710> will

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
occasionally every time the soil will

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.219 
occasionally every time the soil will
condense<00:04:27.130> quite<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> bit<00:04:27.760> so<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.960> want<00:04:28.990> to

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
condense quite a bit so you want to

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.909 
condense quite a bit so you want to
water<00:04:29.380> quite<00:04:30.310> thoroughly<00:04:30.789> make<00:04:31.120> sure<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.919> get

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
water quite thoroughly make sure you get

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.780 
water quite thoroughly make sure you get
more<00:04:33.130> soil<00:04:33.400> in<00:04:33.669> there<00:04:33.849> if<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.060> need<00:04:34.240> it

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
more soil in there if you need it

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.300 
more soil in there if you need it
then<00:04:37.910> there<00:04:38.910> we<00:04:39.090> go<00:04:39.270> whoo<00:04:39.780> there<00:04:40.410> we<00:04:40.500> go<00:04:40.650> and

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
then there we go whoo there we go and

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.310 
then there we go whoo there we go and
then<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:41.880> will<00:04:42.300> add<00:04:42.450> actually<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.050> little<00:04:43.230> more

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
then I will add actually a little more

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.320 
then I will add actually a little more
compost<00:04:43.890> on<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.100> top<00:04:44.370> because<00:04:44.700> it's<00:04:44.850> just<00:04:45.120> so

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
compost on the top because it's just so

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.730 
compost on the top because it's just so
much<00:04:45.830> nutrients<00:04:46.880> for<00:04:47.880> my<00:04:48.030> plants<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.810> then

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
much nutrients for my plants and then

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.860 
much nutrients for my plants and then
the<00:04:49.770> next<00:04:50.220> step<00:04:50.430> would<00:04:50.610> be<00:04:50.670> to<00:04:51.030> grab<00:04:51.390> some

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
the next step would be to grab some

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.900 
the next step would be to grab some
mulch<00:04:52.740> which<00:04:53.070> we'll<00:04:53.280> talk<00:04:53.400> about<00:04:53.580> in<00:04:53.850> another

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
mulch which we'll talk about in another

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
container plants it holds the moisture

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.140 
container plants it holds the moisture
