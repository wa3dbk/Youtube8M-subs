00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello to all of you here I am going 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.730
 do you introduce the samsung 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.519
 galaxy note 10 points model 4g the 4g 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.700
 which is supposed to come out at the end of January to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.179
 the United States and early February in 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.369
 Europe 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.840
 maybe a little bit before then there the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.900
 model put forward to agree 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.939
 so I'll see you a little bit 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.289
 so the race and here it's the same 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.449
 do it huh it's the same as the galaxy 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.390
 note 3g alone that indeed it is the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.189
 4g model that is not out yet 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.910
 so we can see that this is the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.710
 model ltee that's good actually the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 downflow we know it's more than 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.790
 artistic artistic I'm showing you a 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.649
 little bit of the box 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.110
 especially for that so inside I 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.250
 already opened the box 1 it was really 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.010
 voice for the lodges we actually 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.610
 feel and hasten the thing so there you have 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.610
 the tablet 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.809
 the table is so galaxy note 4g lte 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.210
 is in no way the acronym is the classified gift 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.619
 like it's like the tablet years and the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.619
 note and style equivalent with 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.010
 behind is not much is right 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.020
 wrote samsung when we do not see very 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.390
 well 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.430
 maybe just on the euro or 4 g 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.540
 here and it's far from it cjga that one 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.460
 the insertion of the sim card is done at 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.000
 on it but there is a small logo on it 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.700
 directly that it shows it is done that has 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.900
 the taste here we do it is paid here 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 I wished by then so well 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.660
 that in the box containing what is this 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.170
 we have small accessories 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.610
 we have the cable allows usb host 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 that is, if we want to connect 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.619
 a mouse keyboard goes not far away caps a 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.630
 fixed connector to connect case the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.690
 mouse at the table so we plug it 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.740
 on one side and on the other side we have the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.100
 USB port 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.410
 simon the good but we have the USB port of 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.380
 your side here is so it's enough provided 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.170
 basic 1 it was great 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.769
 then we were here we are at the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.750
 load the charger go through a bit of 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.760
 loader what the other boils and there that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.959
 it's for the European take for the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.000
 united states it will be another take 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.380
 simply 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.170
 what are we going to see the notice a 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.180
 grip tool nothing 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.780
 specific anyway ah what is this 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.170
 we have others 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.910
 so we have small piles that's what we 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.260
 puts in the atria in fact otherwise 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.600
 often do we follow the ear 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.610
 that we did we adapt more or less 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.739
 the listener and we have the workers who go 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.930
 with 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:51.360
 park the normal charging cable through 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.210
 besides two special and 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.500

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.690

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.870
 what is it but it is provided 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.490

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.340
