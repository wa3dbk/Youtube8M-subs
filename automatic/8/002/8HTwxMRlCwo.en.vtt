00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.549
 prepare the map 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.409
 I already have this plan for you this weekend 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.299
 you know what to do with our mac osx this 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.270
 recipe if children can do it 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.860
 because there are no dangers of average them 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.390
 they can make the mixture for not doing everything 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.329
 well let's start with mixing 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.060
 the low to base the paper that mixture to 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:32.119
 I love it serves for many types of 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.250
 There are cakes for a lemon country that 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.819
 then we will do one but well we have 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.229
 here the unmade crumbled cookies 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.500
 this can be done inside a 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.340
 bag and with the hand to shred the moons 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.289
 to this we take this guy a cookie 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.239
 dude, now, if you want it 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.880
 would accept more nutritious can they look 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:55.429
 type ccoo cookies with oatmeal or with 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.679
 saved add a little linseed the 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.810
 line is actually the mix with the 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.899
 cookie and what helps is to accelerate your 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.579
 digestion to improve your digestion and is 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.319
 a teaspoon and it will not change in 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.899
 nothing the flavor or they can put amaranth 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.789
 then to this you can add 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.930
 a fiber 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.060
 that does not change the flavor of the base but 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.549
 give him some germanotta point for 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.569
 dating you can put a good rich 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.489
 let's add the melted butter 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.439
 remember that if they have cholesterol 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.109
 elevated can always count on the 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:33.849
 margarines that do not abuse either because 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:37.569
 It is also hydrolyzed fat and 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.269
 is Russia are this as fats 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.879
 trans already become fats it becomes 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.859
 natural always be careful with 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.290
 the animal products not these are like 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:52.430
 treacherous means for cholesterol 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.170
 let's make the mix here already with 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.940
 butter let's add sugar 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.920
 masked 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.770
 it is super- mashed has more 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.960
 fiber than refined sugar then yes 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.380
 it's worth it now if you have 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.060
 sugar problems hypoglycemia 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.670
 hyperglycemia diabetes all these 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.630
 The most convenient thing would be 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.660
 add stevia stevia is a 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.380
 a plant that is born in peru person 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.260
 extremely sweet plant and what they do is 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.540
 they do it already dust 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.390
 and this powder you take it and actually 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.310
 what are you eating what do you think is 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.909
 pure fiber does not even have anything of 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.040
 sugar come on let's put this mixture 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.500
 in a mold 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.160
 that to save us a little fat what 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.510
 we cover with aluminum foil 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.840
 to not have 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.849
 they own nose now so we oil another 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.340
 time on the fat of what you already have 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.939
 grace then that we want it we are going to 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.700
 paste our cookies well at 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.230
 mold walls today I'm not going to 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.260
 say one thing that taught me a 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.790
 friend him when he worked over there 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.189
 the fragrances 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.830
 if you are you have to learn to 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:13.380
 work with your hands 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.720
 so this is what they have to do 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.180
 the kids put them to make it magical 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.370
 serves for motor skills for latina 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.980
 because for fine motor skills they have 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.480
 I use your fingers now I'm 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.790
 talking about children under 5 years 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.720
 obviously it 's true because if your children 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.730
 they already have 15 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.730
 believe me they do not care so much 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:38.630
 javier chamaco motor of 15 years no 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:41.950
 there are molding for motor skills not 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.950
 they are going to send the couple 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.570
 well this is our mass is beyond 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.190
 I recommend that the goal in the 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.740
 fridge 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.139
 this so that the butter then 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:57.620
 take again that solid consistency 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:00.770
 and our our base do not fall apart ok 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.169
 Now let's liquefy and as I would say 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.629
 My garden is the easiest 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.539
 open liquid and open again 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:10.949
 we are going to use here and blender 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.639
 new that I'm very happy for me from 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.980
 quads now 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:20.300
 thanks to the production 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:23.270
 thanks to leigh and we appreciate the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.000
 blender is very nice let's put 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.430
 cream cheese 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.480
 let's add 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.480
 condensed milk 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.120
 that here they do not need sugar anymore 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.120
 because this milk is sweet 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.830
 and apart from that it is a good source of 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.910
 proteins 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.920
 do not believe that I believe that much 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.980
 Much fattening is the way 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.960
 that we see it, we only label if yes 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.270
 we think that a food we 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.950
 it fattens us to get fat if we 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.290
 we think that a food is going to be 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.410
 charities is beneficial to our 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:08.970
 our body will benefit us as 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:11.820
 what to see must see the food 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.660
 with perspective not as the one of 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.940
 ratatouille 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.040
 a little bit of perspective let's add 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.670
 Grenetin previously hydrated to 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.969
 water bath 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.509
 and this we are going to 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.509
 liquefy 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.230
 two 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.080
 and here we are as I was painting 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.870
 It's fine what I'm going to do 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.639
 let's leave it well that it becomes 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.620
 one more strawberry 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.370
 let's see if you can see more thrashed 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.630
 the 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.120
 an experiment comes out 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.630
 to see if you can see marbling here in 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.630
 this 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.909
 and jose is great 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.969
 we'll see 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.899
 or 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:14.209
 I do not know marmóleo but it was delicious and 

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:16.659
 with this let's go to the next 

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:16.659
 information
