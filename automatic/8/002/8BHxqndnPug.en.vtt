that gets me mm-hmm
just<00:02:30.459> thinking<00:02:30.730> about<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:31.080> okay<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.470> back<00:02:32.799> to

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
just thinking about it okay so back to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.250 
just thinking about it okay so back to
our<00:02:33.130> topic<00:02:33.340> bronchitis<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.299> can<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.660> acute<00:02:35.049> and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
our topic bronchitis it can be acute and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.960 
our topic bronchitis it can be acute and
it<00:02:35.380> can<00:02:35.560> be<00:02:35.650> chronic<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.220> let's<00:02:36.430> talk<00:02:36.670> about

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
it can be chronic so let's talk about

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.210 
it can be chronic so let's talk about
the<00:02:37.120> differences<00:02:37.630> acute<00:02:38.440> bronchitis<00:02:38.650> is

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
the differences acute bronchitis is

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.670 
the differences acute bronchitis is
often<00:02:39.730> caused<00:02:40.000> by<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.330> same<00:02:40.840> viruses<00:02:41.530> that

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
often caused by the same viruses that

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.860 
often caused by the same viruses that
cause<00:02:41.860> colds<00:02:42.280> remember<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.209> said<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:43.599> just<00:02:43.660> a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
cause colds remember I said it's just a

cause colds remember I said it's just a
chest<00:02:44.140> cold<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:45.010> usually<00:02:45.430> starts<00:02:45.670> as<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.910> sore

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
chest cold it usually starts as a sore

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.610 
chest cold it usually starts as a sore
throat<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.750> runny<00:02:47.050> nose

even<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:47.890> sinus<00:02:48.250> infection<00:02:48.400> but<00:02:49.269> then<00:02:49.480> it

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
even a sinus infection but then it

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.140 
even a sinus infection but then it
spreads<00:02:50.049> down<00:02:50.319> into<00:02:50.620> your<00:02:50.709> Airways<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.879> can

usually goes away on its own because

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.470 
usually goes away on its own because
it's<00:02:57.040> caused<00:02:57.280> by<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.489> virus<00:02:58.030> all<00:02:58.209> that's

obstructive pulmonary disease now you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.520 
obstructive pulmonary disease now you
may<00:03:46.299> be<00:03:46.329> more<00:03:46.750> familiar<00:03:46.959> with<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.409> other

other is emphysema emphysema is a more
familiar<00:04:02.290> word<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.799> think<00:04:02.829> to<00:04:03.160> most<00:04:03.310> most

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760

people in chronic bronchitis the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.080 
people in chronic bronchitis the
