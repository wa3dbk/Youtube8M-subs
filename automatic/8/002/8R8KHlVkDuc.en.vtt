 the class should always be more clear is 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.790
 as in his 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.790

 As I was saying, I will not be executed 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.780
 program in this should be installed in 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:25.030
 two different computers one online 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.800
 in a single computer should be the 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.449
 teacher who will be the one who will manage 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.449
 to the students 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.339
 we have the student's 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.440
 tools 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:50.280
 but what manages them is the teacher 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.280
 the window they saw a while ago 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.420
 where you are going to be able to manipulate it 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.990
 Well that would be all 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.289
 I hope and they can install their is 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.699
