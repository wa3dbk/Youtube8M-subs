curl my eyelashes and i know it sounds
odd<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.080> that's<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.950> use<00:01:08.600> it's<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
odd but that's what I use it's just a

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.230 
odd but that's what I use it's just a
regular<00:01:10.079> spoon<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:11.159> only<00:01:11.369> difference<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:12.000> up

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
regular spoon the only difference is up

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.850 
regular spoon the only difference is up
I<00:01:12.509> don't<00:01:12.930> know<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.259> really<00:01:13.439> see<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
I don't know if you can really see it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.050 
I don't know if you can really see it
but<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.539> top<00:01:15.539> of<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.079> thin<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:17.060> regular

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
but the top of it is thin it's regular

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.179 
but the top of it is thin it's regular
spoons<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.200> know<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
spoons it's you know they have like a

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.749 
spoons it's you know they have like a
thick<00:01:21.200> point<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.469> this<00:01:22.799> one's<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.189> thin

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
thick point to it this one's really thin

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.580 
thick point to it this one's really thin
so<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> only<00:01:24.810> difference<00:01:25.079> with<00:01:25.439> this

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
so that's the only difference with this

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.319 
so that's the only difference with this
spoon<00:01:25.859> and<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.640> can't<00:01:26.820> find<00:01:26.969> one<00:01:27.210> like

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
spoon and if you can't find one like

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.719 
spoon and if you can't find one like
that<00:01:27.539> like<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.859> be<00:01:28.890> really<00:01:29.490> good

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that like this one would be really good

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.730 
that like this one would be really good

their<00:03:18.690> girls<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.200> this<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> one<00:03:19.709> that

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.559 
their girls and this is a one that
already<00:03:19.950> good<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.209> um<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:23.100> can<00:03:23.280> try<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.970> spoon

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
already good so um you can try a spoon

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.600 
already good so um you can try a spoon
maybe<00:03:24.930> works<00:03:25.230> for<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.590> maybe<00:03:25.770> you<00:03:25.980> like<00:03:26.160> the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
maybe works for you maybe you like the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.309 
maybe works for you maybe you like the
way<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.910> looks<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.630> really<00:03:28.380> do<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:30.080> that's<00:03:31.080> a

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
way it looks and I really do so that's a

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.130 
way it looks and I really do so that's a
turn<00:03:31.940> see<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.090> major<00:03:33.300> difference<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.050> I

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
turn see the major difference and I

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.660 
turn see the major difference and I
think<00:03:34.410> eyelashes<00:03:34.950> are<00:03:35.069> really<00:03:35.310> important

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
think eyelashes are really important

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.250 
think eyelashes are really important
sometimes<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.300> don't<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.660> makeup<00:03:36.870> and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
sometimes you just don't have makeup and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.350 
sometimes you just don't have makeup and
you<00:03:37.770> have<00:03:37.920> your<00:03:38.100> eyelashes<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.000> think<00:03:39.239> it

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
you have your eyelashes and I think it

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.030 
you have your eyelashes and I think it
really<00:03:39.390> really<00:03:39.750> makes<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.230> difference<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.980> I

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
really really makes a difference and I

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.729 
really really makes a difference and I
like<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.220> way<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.489> looks<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:42.260> like<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.530> I

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
like the way it looks so like that I

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.170 
like the way it looks so like that I
just<00:03:44.010> want<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.190> share<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.430> little<00:03:44.610> tip<00:03:44.880> with<00:03:45.030> you

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
just want to share a little tip with you

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.560 
just want to share a little tip with you
