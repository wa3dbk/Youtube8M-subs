00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 8th 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.810
 that's how we get too far 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.020
 on the back you have to 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.020
 St

 India is kissing 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:19.790
 had felt here 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.690
 are 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.369
 to see the media again 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:24.959
 and then just 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.959
 remove the foil 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.309
 instead of 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.229
 because they are Turkish 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:40.959
 wonderful 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.449
 Super nice success 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.449
 camp here 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.739
 Memorial Turia 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.429
 Headphone jack 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:00.069
 Dock connection around 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.360
 focused on us 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.309
 7 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:09.079
 with her lovingly you will find here I unfortunately had a battery selection 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.959
 because of that holiday 4 other wear stopped 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:15.340
 So I would contribute 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.839
 every speaker 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:19.679
 Left side at 4 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.039
 there is something to do 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.809
 Samples from Dr 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:25.529
 but wait 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:26.679
 back 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:28.809
 Bulow 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.559
 Tyrol's percent 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.269
 Camera and p 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.359
 microphone 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.359
 from Hama in Homs 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.849
 Dollar was weak 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.449
 Meanwhile, time is already passed 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.869
 I could too 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.949
 use the most successful thriller series 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.469
 UBS Rock do 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.290
 and yes you can already see it on Christa Mayer 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.119
 Camera Eichhorn 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:04.119
 we would be zealous 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:08.849
 I did not have a chance yet 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.259
 Try field home 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.189
 but if here 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.189
 want to try 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.039
 Here you can see my crew participate 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:30.860
 Dr 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.509
 The iPod has the same retina display 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.539
 Water the iPhone 4 has 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.689
 except 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.689
 that there is no own display EspelÃ¶er Red 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.879
 and that the back 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.879
 now come the more pixels should be 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.139
 Deal is not the question of how much Christian here 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.710
 the buttons have also gotten better 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.199
 As you can see here the German danced separated 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.319
 definitely wanted better 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.189
 Order works as well 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.339
 further to the rear 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.569
 and can hold my hand for my son 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.409
 a fact really started 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.770
 gets easier 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.770
 in full swing 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.289
 the display is really super too I never know rejected 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.289
 I can see 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.919
 daily spraying 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.919
 to draw five comparisons 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.789
 Riad 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.789
 significant difference wild spots 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.619
 but that should not be a comparison to others 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:03.749
 just after 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:05.830
 Orion 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.589
 Comparative video will be 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:10.589
 probably in the next few weeks without 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:16.689
 I am glad that he watched until the next year apn
