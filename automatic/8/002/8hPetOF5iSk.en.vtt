00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
worked very good they're just like

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.210 
worked very good they're just like
totally<00:04:55.970> laggy<00:04:56.270> but<00:04:56.990> YouTube<00:04:57.710> seems<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.070> work

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
totally laggy but YouTube seems to work

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.340 
totally laggy but YouTube seems to work
well<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:58.700> had<00:04:58.970> tried<00:04:59.540> a<00:04:59.570> couple<00:04:59.840> other<00:04:59.930> lower

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
well I had tried a couple other lower

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.410 
well I had tried a couple other lower
quality<00:05:00.770> videos<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.220> they<00:05:01.280> worked<00:05:01.520> well<00:05:01.730> let

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
quality videos and they worked well let

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:09.040 
quality videos and they worked well let
me<00:05:02.480> show<00:05:02.660> you<00:05:02.750> how<00:05:02.840> YouTube<00:05:03.050> lays<00:05:03.380> out<00:05:03.560> here

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.780 

again<00:05:09.650> you<00:05:09.740> probably<00:05:09.830> gonna<00:05:10.100> watch<00:05:10.310> these<00:05:10.520> in

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
again you probably gonna watch these in

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.869 
again you probably gonna watch these in
portrait<00:05:11.450> mode<00:05:11.480> or<00:05:11.780> landscape<00:05:12.170> mode

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.609 

so<00:05:19.449> it's<00:05:19.659> kind<00:05:19.839> of<00:05:19.869> tricky<00:05:20.110> sometimes<00:05:20.259> to<00:05:20.529> go

00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:20.619 
so it's kind of tricky sometimes to go

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:23.309 
so it's kind of tricky sometimes to go
fullscreen<00:05:20.969> usually<00:05:21.969> get<00:05:22.119> your<00:05:22.270> button<00:05:23.169> right

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
fullscreen usually get your button right

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.320 
fullscreen usually get your button right
here<00:05:23.589> some<00:05:24.279> flash<00:05:24.429> videos<00:05:24.789> you<00:05:24.879> have<00:05:24.969> to<00:05:25.059> hold

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
here some flash videos you have to hold

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.359 
here some flash videos you have to hold
long<00:05:25.719> press<00:05:25.959> on<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.199> video<00:05:26.559> and<00:05:26.740> it'll<00:05:26.830> put<00:05:27.339> a

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:27.369 
long press on the video and it'll put a

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.499 
long press on the video and it'll put a
little<00:05:27.520> box<00:05:27.789> up<00:05:27.999> there

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
little box up there

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.179 
little box up there
so<00:05:28.929> yeah<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.169> YouTube<00:05:29.409> videos<00:05:29.860> work<00:05:30.039> pretty

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:30.189 
so yeah the YouTube videos work pretty

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:37.490 
so yeah the YouTube videos work pretty
well

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
browser mode or desktop mouse broad a

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.340 
browser mode or desktop mouse broad a
couple<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.390> things<00:06:12.480> I<00:06:12.660> didn't<00:06:12.810> know<00:06:12.870> sometimes

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
couple of things I didn't know sometimes

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.750 
couple of things I didn't know sometimes
I<00:06:13.530> still<00:06:13.800> load<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.160> mobile<00:06:14.400> site<00:06:14.550> when<00:06:14.700> you

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
I still load the mobile site when you

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.490 
I still load the mobile site when you
have<00:06:14.850> it<00:06:14.970> in<00:06:15.030> browser<00:06:15.210> mode<00:06:15.450> but<00:06:15.630> it<00:06:16.140> does<00:06:16.320> need

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
have it in browser mode but it does need

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.840 
have it in browser mode but it does need
to<00:06:16.530> do<00:06:16.650> a<00:06:16.680> better<00:06:16.800> job<00:06:16.860> of<00:06:17.070> loading<00:06:17.460> the<00:06:17.580> full

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
to do a better job of loading the full

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.990 
to do a better job of loading the full
site<00:06:18.060> instead<00:06:18.270> of<00:06:18.390> the<00:06:18.570> mobile<00:06:19.320> site<00:06:20.000> so

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
site instead of the mobile site so

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.070 
site instead of the mobile site so
that's<00:06:21.060> a<00:06:21.150> couple<00:06:21.270> different<00:06:21.630> things<00:06:21.810> with

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
that's a couple different things with

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.550 
that's a couple different things with
the<00:06:22.560> new<00:06:23.370> web<00:06:23.580> browser<00:06:24.110> for<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.200> most<00:06:25.350> part

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
the new web browser for the most part

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.900 
the new web browser for the most part
the<00:06:25.650> reading<00:06:25.890> experience<00:06:26.100> has<00:06:26.460> been<00:06:26.610> left<00:06:26.760> the

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
the reading experience has been left the

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.870 
the reading experience has been left the
same<00:06:27.290> the<00:06:28.290> there<00:06:29.160> were<00:06:29.250> some<00:06:29.430> reports<00:06:29.550> that

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
same the there were some reports that

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.400 
same the there were some reports that
goes<00:06:30.120> in<00:06:30.270> landscape<00:06:30.900> mode<00:06:30.930> but<00:06:31.260> that's

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
goes in landscape mode but that's

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.220 
goes in landscape mode but that's
actually<00:06:31.740> not<00:06:31.830> true<00:06:32.100> I<00:06:32.430> wish<00:06:32.580> they<00:06:32.730> would<00:06:33.230> add

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230

actually not true I wish they would add
landscape<00:06:34.830> mode<00:06:34.980> because<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:35.280> prefer<00:06:35.700> to<00:06:35.790> read

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
landscape mode because I prefer to read

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.790 
landscape mode because I prefer to read
in<00:06:36.000> landscape<00:06:36.330> mode<00:06:36.360> but<00:06:37.080> they<00:06:37.440> still<00:06:37.680> have

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800

you<00:06:45.210> turn<00:06:45.360> the<00:06:45.540> page<00:06:45.750> so<00:06:46.320> everything<00:06:46.620> else<00:06:46.710> is

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
you turn the page so everything else is

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.780

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
pretty much the same you know you've got

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.600 
pretty much the same you know you've got
the<00:06:47.910> same<00:06:48.200> on-screen<00:06:49.200> functions<00:06:50.810> got<00:06:51.810> the

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
the same on-screen functions got the

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.490 
the same on-screen functions got the
dictionary<00:06:53.610> lookup<00:06:54.150> notes<00:06:54.750> highlights<00:06:55.080> you

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
dictionary lookup notes highlights you

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.750 
dictionary lookup notes highlights you
got<00:06:55.650> all<00:06:55.740> the<00:06:55.800> different<00:06:56.130> text<00:06:56.340> sizes<00:06:56.460> and
