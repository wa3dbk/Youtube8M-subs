it also could potentially tie in with

me with something they are never going

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.470 
me with something they are never going
to<00:00:39.280> admit<00:00:39.370> that<00:00:39.699> they<00:00:39.789> got<00:00:39.940> it<00:00:40.059> from<00:00:40.149> somewhere

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
to admit that they got it from somewhere

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.880 
to admit that they got it from somewhere
else<00:00:40.719> because<00:00:40.930> they<00:00:41.170> want<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.410> seem<00:00:41.590> cool<00:00:41.859> too

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
else because they want to seem cool too

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.619 
else because they want to seem cool too
that<00:00:42.129> youtuber<00:00:42.670> so<00:00:42.820> they<00:00:42.910> act<00:00:43.090> like<00:00:43.210> they<00:00:43.449> came

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
that youtuber so they act like they came

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.360 
that youtuber so they act like they came
up<00:00:43.780> with<00:00:43.929> the<00:00:44.019> idea<00:00:44.050> and<00:00:44.590> they<00:00:44.710> won't<00:00:44.920> tell<00:00:45.219> the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
up with the idea and they won't tell the

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.709 
up with the idea and they won't tell the
youtuber<00:00:45.850> where<00:00:46.000> they<00:00:46.090> really<00:00:46.300> got<00:00:46.449> it<00:00:46.570> from

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
youtuber where they really got it from

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.630 
youtuber where they really got it from
so<00:00:46.989> I<00:00:47.199> think<00:00:47.620> that<00:00:47.829> kind<00:00:48.160> of<00:00:48.280> might<00:00:48.429> be<00:00:48.550> the

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
so I think that kind of might be the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.950 
so I think that kind of might be the
case<00:00:48.789> for<00:00:48.850> some<00:00:49.210> of<00:00:49.300> these<00:00:49.359> people<00:00:49.750> but

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
case for some of these people but

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.720 
case for some of these people but
honestly<00:00:50.559> I<00:00:51.010> don't<00:00:51.100> know<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.250> seen<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.489> lot<00:00:51.699> of

honestly I don't know I seen a lot of

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.979 
honestly I don't know I seen a lot of
people<00:00:52.000> take<00:00:52.149> home<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.420> it<00:00:52.480> was<00:00:52.570> this<00:00:52.660> getting

they never debut games at e3 so basing

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.319 
they never debut games at e3 so basing

it off the track record and also that

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.330 
it off the track record and also that
the<00:02:32.480> fact<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.900> they're<00:02:33.170> not<00:02:33.739> going<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.189> be

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
the fact that they're not going to be

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.009 
the fact that they're not going to be
there<00:02:34.609> they're<00:02:35.180> gonna<00:02:35.269> have<00:02:35.450> somebody<00:02:35.719> make

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
there they're gonna have somebody make

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.869 
there they're gonna have somebody make
the<00:02:36.200> announcement<00:02:36.469> on<00:02:36.920> their<00:02:37.129> behalf<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.700> it's

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
the announcement on their behalf so it's

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.330 
the announcement on their behalf so it's
big<00:02:38.180> news<00:02:38.209> but<00:02:38.870> it's<00:02:38.959> big<00:02:39.200> enough<00:02:39.230> news<00:02:39.650> that

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
big news but it's big enough news that

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.709 
big news but it's big enough news that
they<00:02:40.459> don't<00:02:40.609> really<00:02:40.700> need<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.150> be<00:02:41.329> there<00:02:41.540> it

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:41.719 
they don't really need to be there it

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.209 
they don't really need to be there it
leads<00:02:41.959> me<00:02:42.049> to<00:02:42.200> believe<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.469> it's<00:02:42.739> probably

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
leads me to believe that it's probably

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.030 
leads me to believe that it's probably
going<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.549> be<00:02:43.669> grand<00:02:44.629> theft<00:02:44.750> auto<00:02:45.019> 5<00:02:45.409> on<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
that's the only thing that really makes

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.409 
that's the only thing that really makes
sense<00:02:50.810> now<00:02:51.310> what<00:02:52.310> if<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.609> was<00:02:52.849> an<00:02:53.209> announcement

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
if you think about it that is something

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.629 
if you think about it that is something

that's really big for rock star you
gotta<00:03:01.790> think<00:03:01.939> about<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.389> whole<00:03:02.599> communities

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
gotta think about the whole communities

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.500 
gotta think about the whole communities
like<00:03:03.469> when<00:03:03.769> is<00:03:03.859> this<00:03:03.980> coming<00:03:04.250> out<00:03:04.519> everybody's

like when is this coming out everybody's
been<00:03:05.540> waiting<00:03:05.810> for<00:03:06.199> months<00:03:06.469> I<00:03:06.829> mean<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.609> is

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
been waiting for months I mean this is

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.759 
been waiting for months I mean this is
kind<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.449> big<00:03:08.629> thing<00:03:08.659> so<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.379> don't<00:03:09.650> know

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
kind of a big thing so you don't know

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.559 
kind of a big thing so you don't know
what<00:03:10.010> if<00:03:10.069> they<00:03:10.189> released<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.760> high<00:03:10.939> state<00:03:11.269> on

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
what if they released the high state on

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.809 
what if they released the high state on
that<00:03:12.409> day<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.949> would<00:03:13.040> be<00:03:13.159> kind<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.430> funny<00:03:13.699> i

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
that day that would be kind of funny i

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.979 
that day that would be kind of funny i
think<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.120> lot<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:14.269> people<00:03:14.359> would<00:03:14.659> be<00:03:14.750> mad

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
think a lot of people would be mad

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.000 
think a lot of people would be mad
because<00:03:15.169> they're<00:03:15.349> expecting<00:03:15.829> something

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
because they're expecting something

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.929 
because they're expecting something
different<00:03:16.280> or<00:03:16.909> it<00:03:17.540> could<00:03:17.780> be<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:18.319> know

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
different or it could be you know

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.990 
different or it could be you know
next-gen<00:03:19.939> versions<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.199> game<00:03:21.229> npc<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.489> a

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
next-gen versions of the game npc and a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.479 
next-gen versions of the game npc and a
high<00:03:23.449> state<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:24.079> don't<00:03:24.409> know<00:03:24.530> honestly<00:03:24.949> I<00:03:25.370> don't

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
high state I don't know honestly I don't

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.849 
high state I don't know honestly I don't
know<00:03:25.579> but<00:03:25.939> it<00:03:26.540> makes<00:03:26.840> more<00:03:27.139> sense<00:03:27.199> for<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.829> to

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
know but it makes more sense for it to

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.490 
know but it makes more sense for it to
be<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:29.060> game<00:03:29.269> coming<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:29.659> next-gen<00:03:29.810> consoles

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
be the game coming to next-gen consoles

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.839 
be the game coming to next-gen consoles
if<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.709> look<00:03:30.859> at<00:03:30.949> the<00:03:31.040> track<00:03:31.280> record<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:31.819> know

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
if you look at the track record you know

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.789 
if you look at the track record you know
if<00:03:32.269> it<00:03:32.569> was<00:03:32.689> another<00:03:32.900> game<00:03:33.229> why<00:03:33.439> wouldn't<00:03:33.709> they

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
if it was another game why wouldn't they

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.809 
if it was another game why wouldn't they
show<00:03:34.009> up<00:03:34.189> that's<00:03:34.430> something<00:03:34.729> that's

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
show up that's something that's

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.399 
show up that's something that's
important<00:03:35.329> that<00:03:35.449> they<00:03:35.569> need<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.810> be<00:03:35.959> there<00:03:36.229> and

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
important that they need to be there and

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.979 
important that they need to be there and
I<00:03:36.769> don't<00:03:36.949> normally<00:03:37.430> debut<00:03:37.939> games<00:03:38.239> at<00:03:38.449> e3<00:03:38.689> I

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
I don't normally debut games at e3 I

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.179 
I don't normally debut games at e3 I
don't<00:03:39.319> think<00:03:39.470> they<00:03:39.560> did<00:03:39.620> for<00:03:39.919> grand<00:03:40.129> theft

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
don't think they did for grand theft

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.699 
don't think they did for grand theft
auto<00:03:40.430> 5<00:03:40.780> they<00:03:41.780> might<00:03:42.079> have<00:03:42.199> shown<00:03:42.439> like<00:03:42.680> a

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
auto 5 they might have shown like a

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.530 
auto 5 they might have shown like a
trailer<00:03:43.280> I'm<00:03:43.579> trying<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.909> remember<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.269> don't

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
trailer I'm trying to remember I don't

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.899 
trailer I'm trying to remember I don't
think<00:03:44.689> they<00:03:44.810> don't<00:03:44.900> do<00:03:45.049> much<00:03:45.319> at<00:03:45.500> e3<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.370> it

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
think they don't do much at e3 so it

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.460 
think they don't do much at e3 so it
doesn't<00:03:47.269> really<00:03:47.329> make<00:03:47.540> sense<00:03:47.599> for<00:03:48.079> it<00:03:48.199> to<00:03:48.259> be<00:03:48.439> a

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
doesn't really make sense for it to be a

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.289 
doesn't really make sense for it to be a
new<00:03:48.709> game<00:03:48.979> but<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:49.639> just<00:03:49.970> want<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.180> talk<00:03:50.269> about

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
new game but I just want to talk about

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.520 
new game but I just want to talk about
that<00:03:50.479> so<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:50.930> thought<00:03:51.169> that<00:03:51.229> was<00:03:51.409> interesting

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
that so I thought that was interesting

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.969 
that so I thought that was interesting
also<00:03:52.099> like<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.209> said<00:03:53.449> that<00:03:53.780> III<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.439> gonna<00:03:54.560> be<00:03:54.739> on

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:54.979 
also like I said that III is gonna be on

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:58.179 
also like I said that III is gonna be on
jun<00:03:55.280> 10<00:03:55.639> to<00:03:56.239> jun<00:03:56.449> 12<00:03:56.780> jun<00:03:57.079> 10th<00:03:57.409> is<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.769> tuesday

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
jun 10 to jun 12 jun 10th is a tuesday

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.390 
jun 10 to jun 12 jun 10th is a tuesday
so<00:03:59.439> potentially<00:04:00.439> they<00:04:00.650> decided<00:04:01.189> that<00:04:01.219> they

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
so potentially they decided that they

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.339 
so potentially they decided that they
have<00:04:01.729> to<00:04:01.909> get<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.150> heist<00:04:02.359> out<00:04:02.599> before<00:04:02.959> spring

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
have to get the heist out before spring

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.809 
have to get the heist out before spring
ends<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:03.739> they<00:04:03.799> decide<00:04:04.159> that<00:04:04.189> they<00:04:04.489> couldn't

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
ends and they decide that they couldn't

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.530 
ends and they decide that they couldn't
go<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.810> e3<00:04:06.079> which<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:07.849> don't<00:04:08.150> really<00:04:08.359> know

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
go to e3 which I don't really know

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.819 
go to e3 which I don't really know
because<00:04:08.659> i<00:04:08.780> don't<00:04:08.959> think<00:04:09.169> i<00:04:09.409> don't<00:04:09.709> know<00:04:09.799> i

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
because i don't think i don't know i

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.229 
because i don't think i don't know i
don't<00:04:09.979> know<00:04:10.159> how<00:04:10.219> III<00:04:10.609> works<00:04:10.819> but<00:04:11.030> i<00:04:11.060> don't

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
don't know how III works but i don't

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.209 
don't know how III works but i don't
think<00:04:11.299> everybody<00:04:11.900> at<00:04:12.379> rockstar<00:04:12.919> would<00:04:13.069> be

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.219 
think everybody at rockstar would be

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.490 
think everybody at rockstar would be
going<00:04:13.639> so<00:04:13.849> I<00:04:13.879> don't<00:04:13.969> see<00:04:14.329> why<00:04:14.509> they<00:04:15.169> would<00:04:15.199> have

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
going so I don't see why they would have

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.580 
going so I don't see why they would have
to<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:16.130> know<00:04:16.630> stop<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.930> like<00:04:18.169> those<00:04:18.380> people

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
to you know stop it like those people
