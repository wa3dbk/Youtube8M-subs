00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
starting from my fellowship I learned

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.749 
starting from my fellowship I learned
how<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.470> effective<00:01:35.070> communication<00:01:35.640> of

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
how the effective communication of

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.730 
how the effective communication of
science<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.420> very<00:01:36.630> important<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.259> order<00:01:37.410> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
science is so very important in order to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.469 
science is so very important in order to
achieve<00:01:37.860> any<00:01:38.369> sort<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.700> conservation<00:01:39.330> goals

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
achieve any sort of conservation goals

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.570

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.730 
sharing what Oceana does with the world
really<00:01:42.330> helps<00:01:42.660> me<00:01:42.780> achieve<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.380> I've<00:01:43.500> always

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
