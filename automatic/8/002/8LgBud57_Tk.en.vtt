00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.960
 mathis bagdad walsh and 10 km 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.690
 hello everyone is marc leroy on 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.790

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.810
 new video on destiny then 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.720
 today a little new video 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:43.120
 for for wear for my tips from 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.800
 odd coin expenditure figure and so 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.100
 we will start immediately so swore 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.380
 straight in the middle just down 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.780
 of the stairs and so here we go 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.930
 start right away chic swears then 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.850
 today he sells us a torso 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.850
 organist boots for hunters 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.930
 torso for titan the finistÃ¨re ase and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.020
 exotic shine and in exotic g so 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.600
 the chest and alpha crest he's worse for 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.250
 the titans so then these 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.890
 radiant mountebanks for hunters 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.369
 and finally plastron of the canÃ©da bissol 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.850
 for organists then so we have the 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.220
 finisterrae the exotic shine and g 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.590
 exotic then so we start with the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.539
 quai the crest of the fa him and therefore in 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.560
 done it's a game will say a pretty good 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.819
 torso with them and they give 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.770
 the intelligence of managing basic is so 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.600
 a torso that gives intelligence I 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.830
 traits is very interesting 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.840
 since beautiful smart is what 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.920
 allows you to have your super plus 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.209
 quickly 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.119
 after what is there that this one has 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:45.250
 not much extraordinary thing I 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.300
 would say extremely useful so I 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.910
 I would advise you 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.310
 to buy that wrong so low you if you 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.840
 need an exotic torso in the end 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.970
 if you have any other equipment 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.170
 legendary and low that you do not have any 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.840
 torsos teach me blinds that it is not 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.119
 not too bad but it's not at the bottom 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.959
 then the radiant acrobats 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.220
 basle at once for hunters 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.420
 his pasta and rice because of one that 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.190
 gives strength and for the info the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.390
 hunters are not at all in need of 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.580
 force because their knife is not 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.140
 well at all then it increases the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.910
 heavy ammunition capabilities it's not 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.650
 too bad and you can move 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.750
 more quickly when you aim with 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.670
 your weapon is a lot of girlfriends hals 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.040
 and boots that are pretty 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.790
 interesting for the pvp but that's 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.549
 all 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.819
 finally place 32 the abyssal canine it's 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.739
 a plastron so that gives strength 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.450
 for an organist it's not too bad 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.980
 because the opm a melee that is 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.510
 pretty good 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.219
 then it gives an improved version 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.510
 of the action dump and you 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.549
 reappear with energy from 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.049
 pomegranate really happened really 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.299
 well then increased abilities in 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.680
 munitions revolvers and increases the 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.189
 weapons ammunition capabilities 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.370
 Special 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:51.159
 so here it is still a torso I 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.359
 would say quite frankly for those 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.760
 who like to play with the breeder is 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.489
 total it's pretty good then the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.400
 finisterrae then frankly it's 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.819
 a sniper that I advise you 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.560
 well if you make it bought the 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.970
 just if you want to do the collection 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.909
 what because in the end it's really 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.950
 not at all a sniper size weight for 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.810
 the pvl is really not good and the pvp 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.049
 it can do some pretty good 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.849
 feed video and so on but otherwise it's 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.769
 really not a terrible snake at all 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.959
 what is it just for the 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.120
 collection and then it's all after 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.510
 exotic glow and exotic g's of 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.609
 torso and finally as you can see 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.139
 right now the cartridges of 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.930
 heavy ones finally came back 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.720
 so there for all those who have a lot 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.639
 of strange pieces to use and baky to 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.010
 level of making fangs size et cetera 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.889
 so there to spend there spend 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.359
 buy your strange coins to spend 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.409
 vautier is so strange to buy your 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.209
 heavy weapon cartridges 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.269
 personally I saw that I have 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.090
 bought 400 directly I had 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.159
 even over 400 seems to me so no but 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.419
 this is frankly my full box and 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.729
 I put on a few people 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.840
 frankly at it depends on it to buy 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.799
 but because we do not know when is it 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.419
 that they will come back they put 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.560
 almost a month to come back from 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.769
 last time the player sold it 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.849
 so do not hesitate purchased throwing 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.379
 even if you do not have much but 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.019
 it's strange expenses and I have no 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.879
 three strange pieces from time to time 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.590
 it's really really interesting 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.639
 and so that's all for me I 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.639
 you say more everyone 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.020
 this rate
