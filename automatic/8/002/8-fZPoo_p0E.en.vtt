preventing<00:01:37.110> these<00:01:37.470> injuries<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.490> you're

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
preventing these injuries so if you're

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.090 
preventing these injuries so if you're
not<00:01:38.850> focused<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.450> technique<00:01:39.869> you're<00:01:40.829> not

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
not focused on technique you're not

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.380 
not focused on technique you're not
gonna<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.520> what<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.700> need<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.299> of

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
gonna get what you need to get out of

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.700 
gonna get what you need to get out of
this<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.659> make<00:01:42.869> sure<00:01:43.110> you're<00:01:43.229> thinking<00:01:43.259> about

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
this so make sure you're thinking about

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.160 
this so make sure you're thinking about
technique<00:01:44.460> okay<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> first<00:01:45.540> exercise<00:01:46.140> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
technique okay the first exercise is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.050 
technique okay the first exercise is
probably<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> most<00:01:46.920> complex<00:01:47.430> we're<00:01:47.670> gonna<00:01:47.759> do

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
probably the most complex we're gonna do

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.179 
probably the most complex we're gonna do
but<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.869> takes<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.229> lot<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.409> technique<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.040> we've

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
but it takes a lot of technique so we've

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.510 
but it takes a lot of technique so we've
got<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> green<00:01:50.670> band<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:52.100> find<00:01:53.100> somewhere<00:01:53.399> in

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
got the green band and find somewhere in

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.710 
got the green band and find somewhere in
there<00:01:53.610> Jim<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:53.939> stable<00:01:54.299> enough<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.600> do

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
there Jim that's stable enough to do

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
there Jim that's stable enough to do
this<00:01:54.869> you're<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.079> gonna<00:01:55.259> break<00:01:55.470> anything<00:01:56.090> put

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
this you're not gonna break anything put

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.870 
this you're not gonna break anything put
the<00:01:57.180> band<00:01:57.360> about<00:01:57.540> chest<00:01:57.899> level<00:01:58.020> okay<00:01:59.040> holding

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
the band about chest level okay holding

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
the band about chest level okay holding
on<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.210> both<00:02:00.420> fat<00:02:00.719> sides<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.229> band<00:02:01.439> with

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
on to both fat sides of the band with

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.639 
on to both fat sides of the band with
one<00:02:01.829> arm<00:02:02.780> stepping<00:02:03.780> away<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.320> point<00:02:04.469> where

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
one arm stepping away to the point where

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.670 
one arm stepping away to the point where
your<00:02:04.770> arms<00:02:05.040> extended<00:02:05.840> okay<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:07.560> we're

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
your arms extended okay now what we're

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.960 
your arms extended okay now what we're
gonna<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.039> we're<00:02:08.129> gonna<00:02:08.190> take<00:02:08.399> opposite

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
gonna do is we're gonna take opposite

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.449 
gonna do is we're gonna take opposite
leg<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.599> gonna<00:02:10.020> break<00:02:10.560> down<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:10.979> not<00:02:11.129> want

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
leg I'm gonna break down I do not want

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.650 
leg I'm gonna break down I do not want
to<00:02:11.520> stand<00:02:11.670> straight<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.060> because<00:02:12.510> I'm

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
to stand straight up because I'm

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.730 
to stand straight up because I'm
standing<00:02:12.840> straight<00:02:13.170> up<00:02:13.200> I'm<00:02:13.410> not

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
standing straight up I'm not

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.590 
standing straight up I'm not
forcing<00:02:13.980> anything<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.370> stabilize<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.510> I'm

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
forcing anything to stabilize so I'm

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.330 
forcing anything to stabilize so I'm
gonna<00:02:15.810> bend<00:02:16.050> at<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.230> knee<00:02:16.470> drop<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:17.010> hip<00:02:17.160> so

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
gonna bend at the knee drop the hip so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.640 
gonna bend at the knee drop the hip so
I'm<00:02:17.460> stabilizing<00:02:18.360> my<00:02:18.480> body<00:02:18.720> again<00:02:19.470> that's

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
I'm stabilizing my body again that's

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.630 
I'm stabilizing my body again that's
what<00:02:19.770> we're<00:02:19.860> trying<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.100> strengthen<00:02:20.340> Zee

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
what we're trying to strengthen Zee

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.940 
what we're trying to strengthen Zee
stabilize<00:02:21.120> muscles<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.140> take<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.680> foot

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
stabilize muscles so I take this foot

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.520 
stabilize muscles so I take this foot
here<00:02:23.250> as<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.970> go<00:02:24.150> forward<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.840> pull<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> foot

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
here as I go forward I pull the foot

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.060 
here as I go forward I pull the foot
back<00:02:25.710> as<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.670> come<00:02:26.940> up<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.570> Drive<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.710> knee<00:02:28.860> up

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
back as I come up I Drive the knee up

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.820 
back as I come up I Drive the knee up
and<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.430> drive<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.850> elbow<00:02:30.210> in<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.660> slowly<00:02:31.440> come

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
and I drive the elbow in I slowly come

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.250 
and I drive the elbow in I slowly come
back<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.460> not<00:02:32.490> about<00:02:32.880> speed<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.080> not

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
back this is not about speed this is not

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.770 
back this is not about speed this is not
about<00:02:34.410> power<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.160> explosion<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.360> about

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
about power and explosion this is about

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.350 
about power and explosion this is about
strength<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.440> motion<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.100> stability<00:02:38.460> then

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
strength in motion and stability then

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.780 
strength in motion and stability then
I'm<00:02:39.480> coming<00:02:39.810> here<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.410> would<00:02:41.010> do<00:02:41.160> 10<00:02:41.430> right<00:02:41.670> now

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
I'm coming here I would do 10 right now

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.740 
I'm coming here I would do 10 right now
I'm<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:42.000> gonna<00:02:42.090> do<00:02:42.210> a<00:02:42.240> couple<00:02:42.480> for
