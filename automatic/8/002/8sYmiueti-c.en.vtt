00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.580

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.470

 client version as in server version 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.890
 so that those who want to play with their 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.150

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.019
 select the type of installation that 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.909
 you want to see so that way 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.500
 I explained the instructions that should 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.540
 to follow and also find the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.270
 download links of the files that 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.550
 they need in the first button is for 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.800
 single player on single player goes to 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.449
 be the download of both the launcher that 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.250
 basically it is the folder of the 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.949
 client that everyone will need to 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.769
 being able to play on the second button is 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.530
 multiplayer this is optional and is 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.539
 basically the server that can 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.519
 you configure with all these mods 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.000
 in case they want to play it with 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.160
 his friends 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.019
 the third button is for users not 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.700
 premium and here I will try some 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.800
 issues and problems that have had 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.470
 lately people who do not have 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.450
 a premium minecraft account and that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.780
 have had problems with both the sound 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.150
 the mods do not appear when starting the game 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.070
 and things like this so in this 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.190
 non-premium section I will try to 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.170
 explain those problems finally 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.360
 we have the option of the users that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.880
 they use another operating system like 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.220
 mac so you are also going to be able to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.320
 install this package of mods even though that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.320
 yes its installation is a bit different 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.780
 but they will also be able to use it like this 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.190
 just click on the option that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.649
 you want to see so they are 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.420
 directed to that part of the video and there 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.220
 find also the links of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.950
 download those files that are going to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.110
 need for installation remember 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.940
 that if they have any problem any doubt 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.190
 or also suggestions about this 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.020
 package of mods can tell me so much 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.390
 in my facebook account or if not for 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.729
 twitter so I can help them from 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.530
 a quicker way I hope that you 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.520
 have liked this package of mods and we 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.520

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.090
