00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
be here all went along and it should

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.489 
be here all went along and it should
just<00:01:43.499> get<00:01:43.709> more<00:01:44.700> intense<00:01:45.419> with<00:01:45.719> the<00:01:45.840> fish<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
just get more intense with the fish the

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:47.949 
just get more intense with the fish the
numbers<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.979> fish<00:01:47.099> you<00:01:47.279> catch<00:01:47.490> them<00:01:47.609> because

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
numbers of fish you catch them because

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.399 
numbers of fish you catch them because
I'd<00:01:48.959> say<00:01:49.200> 85%<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.539> shrimp<00:01:51.840> went<00:01:52.049> out<00:01:52.200> so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I'd say 85% of the shrimp went out so

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.989 
I'd say 85% of the shrimp went out so
now<00:01:52.529> you<00:01:52.679> still<00:01:52.950> got<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> little<00:01:53.340> bitty<00:01:53.669> shrimp
