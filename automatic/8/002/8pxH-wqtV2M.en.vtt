Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.729
Do you remember that Italian researcher I
met in an airplane a couple of months ago?

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:11.089
Well, I had to learn more and so we're gonna
meet tomorrow here in Rome, Italy.

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.569
In the meantime, here's some cool things on
the internet that are awesome like you.

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:20.480
Let's begin simply.
Andrew recommended Dodge the Dot, where you

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.530
dodge dots.
Step it up a notch with LINK0702 in "Klikwerk,"

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.430
a game you win by mousing over and clicking
on stuff.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.120
It's like the website version of Bop It.
If you'd rather just loose and avoid all the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.660
gameplay, try Trollface The Game, let me know
how far you get.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.420
Mightyfigter mentioned Enough plumbers, a
creative game where collecting coins clones

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.790
you.
Your clones move like you and can be sacrificed

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.570
or positioned in strategic ways.
TheMatia84 sent me Zombotron, which looks

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.620
really pretty, but it lacks something important
- cute bunnies and puppies.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.540
Luckily, Ferryhalim has such things.
Mabimanta introduced me to this guy's great

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.450
collection of simple little games.
In this one you have to get video footage

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.409
of UFOs to sell.
4rvinder reminded me of the useful YouTube

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.189
channel "All Time 10s."
These guys release simple videos containing

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.029
facts about pretty much anything, organized
into top 10 lists.

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:29.500
Now, speaking of YouTube, let's stick around
and try out YouTube.com/disco.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.680
I briefly mentioned this before.
Just type in a band name and let YouTube do

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.060
the work making you a playlist.
Then, beef up your knowledge with YouTube.com/EDU,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.980
a place where educational videos are arranged
by topic, but the coolest thing is the search

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.960
bar.
Whatever you search here will only return

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.690
related approved educational stuff, so if
I search "Italian," I don't find The Jersey

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.940
Shore, I find how to speak Italian.
Get even smarter with Newton, a fun site I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.210
found filled with scientific questions answered
by volunteer scientists.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.350
It's so full of info it can be tough to navigate,
but you'll be surprised what you learn; questions

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.760
you never knew you wanted the answers to so
badly.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.790
Now back on YouTube, if you're not sure what
topic to search, YouTube.com/topics covers

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.579
the hottest topics of the moment and videos
in that topic.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.200
You can also search, for instance, "what sounds
animals make?"

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.880
Now, if you wanna see the hottest individual
videos, YouTube.com/trends is an awesome place.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.000
Using fancy robotic calculations, Trends surfaces
what's rising in popularity often before it

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.299
gets too popular.
On Twitter yesterday I shouted out photo2text.com,

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.730
which Adam e-mailed to me.
You can upload any picture you want and get

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.090
back a bunch of characters that look like
the picture.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.180
Too many DONGs for one lifetime?
Well, get a second with Alterego, a text-based

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.189
game where you make decisions that affect
your personality and relationships starting

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.909
all the way back to your birth.
Too heavy?

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:10.720
Well alvin37337 recommends Nyan Cat Snake.
Collect the cherries, avoid your own tail.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.770
And as always,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.370
thanks for watching.
