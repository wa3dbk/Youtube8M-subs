00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the screws wouldn't go far enough into

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.310 
the screws wouldn't go far enough into
the<00:00:49.200> cube<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.149> springs<00:00:51.570> are<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the cube it's the the springs are the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.840 
the cube it's the the springs are the
ones<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.899> fat<00:00:54.899> end<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.500> one<00:00:56.190> side<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
ones with the fat end on one side and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360 
ones with the fat end on one side and
then<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.250> other

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
then like the it's just on the other

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.810 
then like the it's just on the other
side<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.219> I'll<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.370> show<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> the

side so here I'll just show you the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.859 
side so here I'll just show you the
pieces

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 

there's<00:01:07.500> no<00:01:07.830> modifications<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.820> these

there's no modifications to these

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.590 
there's no modifications to these
internal<00:01:09.450> pieces<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:11.119> that<00:01:12.119> aren't

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
internal pieces that don't that aren't

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.120 
internal pieces that don't that aren't
shown<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> outside<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> cube<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
shown on the outside of the cube so you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.010 
shown on the outside of the cube so you
don't<00:01:14.400> need<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.640> worry<00:01:14.820> about<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.689> do

okay so first modification is on this
outer<00:01:31.680> edge<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> piece<00:01:33.600> goes<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.020> this

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
outer edge so the piece goes like this

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.960 
outer edge so the piece goes like this
and<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.329> mod<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.560> part<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.220> this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and you just mod this part it's this

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
shell powderpuff where you just you just

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.100 
shell powderpuff where you just you just
sand<00:01:46.259> down<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.710> part<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.149> sand<00:01:48.600> down<00:01:48.810> this

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
sand down this part so sand down this

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.620 
sand down this part so sand down this
part<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
part a little bit and then this on the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.660 
part a little bit and then this on the
opposite<00:01:51.990> side<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.740> part<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> little<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.399> and

then that'll reduce a little bit of the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.240 
then that'll reduce a little bit of the
lockups<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:57.450> part<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.680> center

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.460 
the way down this stock it reduces on
lock<00:02:27.910> ups<00:02:28.180> with<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.720> corners<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.620> then<00:02:31.470> here

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
lock ups with the corners and then here

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.720 
lock ups with the corners and then here
is<00:02:32.739> another<00:02:33.280> modification<00:02:33.970> or<00:02:34.660> here's<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.110> mod

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
is another modification or here's a mod

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.420 
is another modification or here's a mod
right<00:02:36.730> here<00:02:37.200> well<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.530> have<00:02:38.680> two<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.190> you

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
right here well you have two of the you

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.340 
right here well you have two of the you
have<00:02:39.580> two<00:02:39.819> different<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.300> these<00:02:40.840> pieces<00:02:41.170> you

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
have two different of these pieces you

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.620 
have two different of these pieces you
have<00:02:41.620> one<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:42.550> looks<00:02:42.730> like<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.390> one

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
have one that looks like this and one

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.540 
have one that looks like this and one
that<00:02:43.750> looks<00:02:43.900> like<00:02:43.989> this<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.980> here<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.489> just

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
that looks like this so here you just

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.640 
that looks like this so here you just
sand<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.239> because<00:02:46.660> there's<00:02:46.900> interaction<00:02:47.500> with

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
sand it because there's interaction with

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.130 
sand it because there's interaction with
the<00:02:47.769> corner<00:02:48.100> piece<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:49.239> will<00:02:49.420> decrease

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
the corner piece and that will decrease

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.509 
the corner piece and that will decrease
the<00:02:50.380> amount<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.620> lock<00:02:50.830> ups<00:02:51.069> you'll<00:02:51.190> get<00:02:51.340> with

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
the amount of lock ups you'll get with

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.390 
the amount of lock ups you'll get with
this<00:02:51.640> piece<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:53.800> just<00:02:53.830> mirror<00:02:54.310> it

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
this piece and you just mirror it

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.990 
this piece and you just mirror it
because<00:02:55.019> they're<00:02:56.019> just<00:02:56.170> mirrored<00:02:56.500> pieces

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
because they're just mirrored pieces

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.580 
because they're just mirrored pieces
okay<00:02:58.000> um<00:02:58.239> I'm<00:02:58.750> not<00:02:58.930> gonna<00:02:59.019> get<00:02:59.170> this<00:02:59.290> corner

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
okay um I'm not gonna get this corner

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.350 
okay um I'm not gonna get this corner
piece<00:02:59.799> out<00:03:00.010> but<00:03:00.730> I'll<00:03:00.819> just<00:03:00.850> tell<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.239> what

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.660 
piece out but I'll just tell you what
you<00:03:01.480> need<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.630> do<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:03.040> don't<00:03:03.100> need<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.459> do<00:03:03.549> the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
you need to do you don't need to do the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.949 
you need to do you don't need to do the
v5<00:03:04.090> mod<00:03:04.989> but<00:03:05.980> what<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.760> do<00:03:06.940> need<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.299> do<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.660> on

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
v5 mod but what you do need to do is on

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.380 
v5 mod but what you do need to do is on
take<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.620> scrape<00:03:08.980> or<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.850> blade<00:03:11.579> box<00:03:12.579> cutters

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
take the scrape or the blade box cutters

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.310 
take the scrape or the blade box cutters
and<00:03:14.280> as<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:15.549> see<00:03:15.700> here<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.090> stock<00:03:16.390> needs

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
and as you can see here the stock needs

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.610 
and as you can see here the stock needs
to<00:03:17.530> be<00:03:17.650> on<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:19.120> needs<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.480> be<00:03:19.570> thinned<00:03:20.440> out<00:03:20.590> a

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
to be on just needs to be thinned out a

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.780 
to be on just needs to be thinned out a
little<00:03:20.769> bit<00:03:20.920> because<00:03:21.040> there<00:03:21.370> will<00:03:21.459> be<00:03:21.489> lock

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
little bit because there will be lock

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.910 
little bit because there will be lock
ups<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.209> occur<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:23.590> don't

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
ups that occur on that so just don't

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.009 
ups that occur on that so just don't
take<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.400> there<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:24.850> then<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.390> uh<00:03:25.769> like<00:03:26.769> I

see really but you can't really see it
on<00:03:46.930> this<00:03:47.049> camera<00:03:47.260> because<00:03:47.500> it's<00:03:47.620> table<00:03:47.829> um<00:03:48.549> and

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
on this camera because it's table um and

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.500 
on this camera because it's table um and
yeah<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:50.650> need<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:51.010> do<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:51.310> then<00:03:51.700> as<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.390> can

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
yeah you need to do that then as you can

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.670 
yeah you need to do that then as you can
see<00:03:52.660> here<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:54.390> turn<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.600> corner<00:03:55.959> into<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.290> little

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
see here I turn the corner into a little

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.890 
see here I turn the corner into a little
like<00:03:57.329> Diane<00:03:58.329> q<00:03:58.810> or<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.799> Diane<00:04:00.250> corner<00:04:00.670> where<00:04:01.060> the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
like Diane q or a Diane corner where the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.330 
like Diane q or a Diane corner where the
lockups<00:04:02.200> will<00:04:02.410> be<00:04:02.530> reduced<00:04:02.859> because<00:04:03.100> of<00:04:03.250> that

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
lockups will be reduced because of that

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.390 
lockups will be reduced because of that
because<00:04:03.720> um<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:05.200> plastic<00:04:05.739> there's<00:04:06.250> no

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
because um the plastic there's no

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.860 
because um the plastic there's no
plastic<00:04:06.640> right<00:04:06.940> there<00:04:07.500> so

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
plastic right there so

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.830 
plastic right there so
here's<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.960> show<00:04:11.350> from<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.680> different<00:04:11.860> angle

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
here's a show from a different angle

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.780 
here's a show from a different angle
yeah<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:13.900> can<00:04:14.170> see<00:04:14.380> that<00:04:14.740> it's<00:04:15.280> definitely

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
yeah you can see that it's definitely

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.180 
yeah you can see that it's definitely
taken<00:04:16.150> some<00:04:17.280> plastic<00:04:18.280> out<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.820> then<00:04:19.180> on<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
taken some plastic out and then on the

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.890 
taken some plastic out and then on the
last<00:04:21.370> modification<00:04:22.000> that<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.210> need<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.480> do<00:04:22.630> is

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
last modification that you need to do is

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.150 
last modification that you need to do is
in<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:25.060> for<00:04:25.420> the<00:04:25.510> spray<00:04:25.900> or<00:04:26.140> is<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.770> screw

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
in is for the spray or is the screw

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.390 
in is for the spray or is the screw
modifier<00:04:27.460> spring<00:04:28.030> modification<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:29.400> that

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
modifier spring modification and that

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.690 
modifier spring modification and that
what<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.480> do<00:04:31.630> is<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.590> take<00:04:32.920> you<00:04:33.490> just

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
what you do is you take you just

what you do is you take you just
completely<00:04:34.000> just<00:04:34.090> assemble<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.690> cube<00:04:34.900> and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
completely just assemble the cube and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.500 
completely just assemble the cube and
then<00:04:36.300> you<00:04:37.380> just<00:04:38.580> take<00:04:39.580> out<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.910> spring<00:04:40.240> and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
then you just take out the spring and

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.320 
then you just take out the spring and
then<00:04:41.230> you<00:04:41.560> swap<00:04:41.890> it<00:04:42.160> with<00:04:42.340> on<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.970> cue<00:04:43.090> for<00:04:43.270> you

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
then you swap it with on the cue for you

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.280 
then you swap it with on the cue for you
once<00:04:43.570> now<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.380> fat<00:04:44.920> end<00:04:45.160> of<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.340> spring<00:04:46.290> can

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
once now the fat end of the spring can

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.020 
once now the fat end of the spring can
go<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.710> screw<00:04:48.010> goes<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> screw<00:04:48.850> head

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
go to the screw goes to the screw head

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.180 
go to the screw goes to the screw head
because<00:04:49.510> um<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.290> can't<00:04:50.560> go<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.920> other<00:04:51.040> way

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
because um it can't go the other way

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.350 
because um it can't go the other way
because<00:04:51.910> then<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:53.080> whole<00:04:53.260> inside<00:04:53.740> of<00:04:53.770> the

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
because then the whole inside of the

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.270 
because then the whole inside of the
centerpiece<00:04:55.360> just<00:04:55.750> isn't<00:04:56.350> big<00:04:56.530> enough<00:04:56.620> you

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
centerpiece just isn't big enough you

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.550 
centerpiece just isn't big enough you
know<00:04:57.400> if<00:04:57.610> um<00:04:57.880> if<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.600> don't<00:04:58.960> have<00:04:59.140> any<00:04:59.290> cue<00:04:59.440> for

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
know if um if you don't have any cue for

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.380 
know if um if you don't have any cue for
your<00:04:59.650> Springs<00:04:59.920> you<00:05:00.220> can<00:05:00.250> get<00:05:00.850> by<00:05:00.970> with<00:05:01.000> like

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
your Springs you can get by with like

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.080 
your Springs you can get by with like
using<00:05:01.600> Diane<00:05:02.080> Springs<00:05:02.800> or<00:05:03.010> whatever<00:05:03.220> but<00:05:03.730> um

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
using Diane Springs or whatever but um

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.070 
using Diane Springs or whatever but um
just<00:05:04.780> for<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:04.990> purpose<00:05:05.230> of<00:05:06.510> turning<00:05:07.510> quality

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
just for the purpose of turning quality

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.330 
just for the purpose of turning quality
I'm<00:05:08.200> going<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.380> recommend<00:05:08.530> cube<00:05:09.010> for<00:05:09.280> you

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
I'm going to recommend cube for you

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.000 
I'm going to recommend cube for you
Springs<00:05:09.640> because<00:05:09.970> they<00:05:10.500> make<00:05:11.500> this<00:05:11.620> cube<00:05:11.920> a

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
Springs because they make this cube a

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.610 
Springs because they make this cube a
lot<00:05:12.160> faster<00:05:12.580> so<00:05:13.480> here<00:05:14.290> I'm<00:05:14.350> just<00:05:14.470> gonna

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
lot faster so here I'm just gonna

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.350 
lot faster so here I'm just gonna
reassemble<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.610> cube<00:05:15.820> and<00:05:15.940> show<00:05:16.090> you<00:05:16.150> its

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
reassemble the cube and show you its

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.200 
reassemble the cube and show you its
performance<00:05:19.470> and<00:05:20.470> I<00:05:21.310> don't<00:05:21.910> think<00:05:22.090> there<00:05:22.180> are

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
performance and I don't think there are

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.910 
performance and I don't think there are
any<00:05:22.420> tutorials<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:23.320> actually<00:05:23.740> how<00:05:23.860> to

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
any tutorials and actually how to

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.640 
any tutorials and actually how to
assemble<00:05:24.430> this<00:05:24.640> cube<00:05:24.940> but<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:26.290> only<00:05:26.410> problem

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
assemble this cube but the only problem

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.510 
assemble this cube but the only problem
you<00:05:26.920> should<00:05:27.100> actually<00:05:27.250> have<00:05:27.670> with<00:05:27.910> it<00:05:28.090> is<00:05:28.300> just

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
you should actually have with it is just

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.180 
you should actually have with it is just
getting<00:05:30.520> all<00:05:31.180> of<00:05:31.540> the<00:05:31.840> center<00:05:32.380> pins<00:05:32.650> to<00:05:32.920> align

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
getting all of the center pins to align

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.320 
getting all of the center pins to align
and<00:05:34.470> yeah<00:05:35.470> so<00:05:36.250> as<00:05:36.490> you<00:05:36.610> can<00:05:36.700> see<00:05:37.230> it's<00:05:38.230> just

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
and yeah so as you can see it's just

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.230 
and yeah so as you can see it's just
crazy<00:05:40.330> fast<00:05:44.130> and<00:05:45.130> I<00:05:45.250> tensioned<00:05:45.760> it<00:05:45.910> so<00:05:46.090> that

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
crazy fast and I tensioned it so that

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.820 
crazy fast and I tensioned it so that
way<00:05:46.360> it<00:05:46.480> doesn't<00:05:46.660> get<00:05:46.900> any<00:05:47.050> pops<00:05:47.380> or<00:05:47.650> anything

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
way it doesn't get any pops or anything

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.390 
way it doesn't get any pops or anything
so<00:05:48.780> yeah<00:05:49.780> and<00:05:50.080> it<00:05:50.230> kind<00:05:50.440> of<00:05:50.500> has<00:05:50.650> like<00:05:50.680> on<00:05:51.130> the

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
so yeah and it kind of has like on the

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.010 
so yeah and it kind of has like on the
thing<00:05:51.610> with<00:05:51.790> the<00:05:52.020> Hugo's<00:05:53.050> it's<00:05:54.540> this<00:05:55.540> layer<00:05:55.750> is

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
thing with the Hugo's it's this layer is

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.860 
thing with the Hugo's it's this layer is
just<00:05:56.230> so<00:05:56.440> smooth<00:05:56.880> that<00:05:57.880> it<00:05:58.090> just<00:05:58.300> doesn't<00:05:58.630> have

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
just so smooth that it just doesn't have

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.580 
just so smooth that it just doesn't have
any<00:05:58.900> friction<00:05:59.470> with<00:06:00.040> um<00:06:00.630> this<00:06:01.630> these<00:06:02.350> layers

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
any friction with um this these layers

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.110 
any friction with um this these layers
anymore<00:06:03.010> because<00:06:03.430> it's<00:06:04.210> just<00:06:04.450> that<00:06:04.750> fast<00:06:05.380> in

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
anymore because it's just that fast in

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.300 
anymore because it's just that fast in
yeah<00:06:07.120> it<00:06:07.570> almost<00:06:07.750> feels<00:06:08.110> better<00:06:08.320> than<00:06:08.470> my<00:06:08.620> 4x4

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
yeah it almost feels better than my 4x4

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.440 
yeah it almost feels better than my 4x4
and<00:06:09.580> just<00:06:09.700> tell<00:06:09.880> you

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.370 

like<00:06:13.450> I<00:06:13.750> just<00:06:14.320> like<00:06:14.710> it<00:06:14.890> a<00:06:14.950> lot<00:06:15.780> lockup<00:06:16.780> anymore

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
like I just like it a lot lockup anymore

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.030 
like I just like it a lot lockup anymore
and<00:06:17.700> it's<00:06:18.700> basically<00:06:19.330> a<00:06:19.720> perfect<00:06:20.020> 6x6<00:06:20.710> in<00:06:20.800> my

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
and it's basically a perfect 6x6 in my

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.070 
and it's basically a perfect 6x6 in my
eyes<00:06:21.510> so<00:06:23.460> yeah<00:06:24.460> if<00:06:24.940> you<00:06:25.090> do<00:06:25.210> this<00:06:25.330> mod<00:06:25.600> it's

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
eyes so yeah if you do this mod it's

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.850 
eyes so yeah if you do this mod it's
kind<00:06:26.350> of<00:06:26.440> extensive<00:06:27.450> but<00:06:28.450> you<00:06:29.110> definitely<00:06:29.380> get

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
kind of extensive but you definitely get

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.770 
kind of extensive but you definitely get
the<00:06:30.730> best<00:06:30.970> 6x6<00:06:31.680> that<00:06:32.680> is<00:06:32.860> out<00:06:33.100> there<00:06:33.570> in<00:06:34.570> my

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
the best 6x6 that is out there in my

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.670 
the best 6x6 that is out there in my
eyes<00:06:34.960> because<00:06:35.290> it's<00:06:35.940> turns<00:06:36.940> just<00:06:37.480> way<00:06:37.930> fast<00:06:38.260> no

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
eyes because it's turns just way fast no

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.630 
eyes because it's turns just way fast no
lock<00:06:39.010> ups<00:06:39.370> no<00:06:39.550> pops<00:06:39.880> no<00:06:40.510> no<00:06:41.410> bad<00:06:41.800> feeling<00:06:42.490> or

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
lock ups no pops no no bad feeling or

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.050 
lock ups no pops no no bad feeling or
whatever<00:06:42.880> it's<00:06:43.540> just<00:06:43.630> really<00:06:44.470> fast<00:06:44.830> and<00:06:45.280> yeah

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
whatever it's just really fast and yeah

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.610 
whatever it's just really fast and yeah
definitely<00:06:46.270> do<00:06:46.630> this<00:06:46.810> to<00:06:46.960> your<00:06:47.080> cube<00:06:47.290> because

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
definitely do this to your cube because

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.940 
definitely do this to your cube because
you'll<00:06:48.090> like<00:06:49.090> totally<00:06:49.510> love<00:06:49.690> it<00:06:49.720> you'll<00:06:50.140> like

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
it more than your V Cube if you do this

00:06:52.780 --> 00:07:00.630 
it more than your V Cube if you do this
so<00:06:54.900> yeah<00:06:55.900> guys<00:06:57.000> thanks<00:06:58.000> bye
