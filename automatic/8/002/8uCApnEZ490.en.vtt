 Welcome to our fourth 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.800
 and last part of the video guide series 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.869
 for data access strategic 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.869
 roleplaying black cards the universe 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.310
 the black eye is settled after 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.960
 you should follow the first three 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.739
 meanwhile true masters of the fight 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.540
 have become 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.460
 that's why we'll be in this last one 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.140
 Part of a completely different topic 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.820
 dedicate as you do through yours 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.620
 Decisions the development of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.350
 influenced history and with which 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.350
 So you have to expect decisions 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.150
 well we free you a kind 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.400
 Making decisions about the story 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.050
 Meet you find in the dialogues it 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.730
 does not mean that the spring is free 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.470
 more powerful than that and so can 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.390
 I sometimes seem harmless 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.460
 have far-reaching consequences 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.519
 especially if you just burst into rage 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.630
 not restrained which disposal 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.299
 the palace 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:14.329
 why so curious little girl she 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.189
 Do not carry a weapon with which we already 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.479
 in the subject while because within the 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.860
 not only can your dialogues be yours 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.570
 main characters talk 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.820
 the group members also get in touch 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.740
 only too happy to say what you do about it 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.470
 recognizes that before a dialog line the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.870
 name in brackets appears a simple one 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.610
 Example early in the game in the city where 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.020
 Brand meets your group 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.659
 beggars who give you a few coins 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.119
 asks you have a mild reproducing a 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.920
 now you can either flee 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.819
 the miser or the Samaritan 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.069
 let hang out 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.229
 however, both will have consequences 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.210
 if you are generous the battle will be yours 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.770
 to entrust a secret on one 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.109
 near scene of a recent 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.090
 Battle can be made booty 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.099
 Do not give him any money or burden in the corridor 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.130
 with his boots Nachtreten then 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.289
 Of course it will save your purse 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.450
 harms to the nameless that is out 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.250
 this world just driven by that 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.259
 Battlefield offers but you never 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.459
 learn and your group will be yours 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.290
 need to look elsewhere the equipment 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.450
 basic value charisma no talks 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.610
 Incidentally, only influence if one 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.379
 character worth a certain charisma 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.690
 can exceed additional 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.250
 dialog lines appear if you have one 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.379
 such an option is worth the charisma 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.870
 Thank you recognize that on the 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.090
 Add charisma to the dialog option 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.680

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.540
 quantity pictures arrived you meet 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.519
 first on a dear girl that of 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.440
 is harassed to other robbers 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.180
 according to the charisma value opened 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.440
 also elia the possibility with one 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.370
 to write trick 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.709

 wise you can completely with the girl 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.109
 escape without a fight, otherwise it remains 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.079
 to leave the word 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:57.069
 superfluous to mention that ends 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.069
 I'm not scared about 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.209
 fur 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:14.340
 and also in fighting it always comes 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.050
 again, that's not just the goal 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.790
 is the opponent in the knee too 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.920
 force but also additional 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.750
 Achieving goals is what you do 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.310
 often your reward for the fight 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.180
 higher or the story takes one 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.340
 new turn 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.140
 example for that is just mentioned 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.390
 battlefield on which the group for 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.340

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.080

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.730

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.010
 You should always one or better both 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.840
 One should also throw eyes at the train 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.820
 a short leash otherwise 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.410

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.960
 that's not his fire magic 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.700
 meant especially women melt in 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.960

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.360

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.010
 you , on the other hand, you will become one 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.230

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.950
 Not interested in paying 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.479

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.160
 there is scope for decisions and such 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.440
 often not just one for them 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.030
 solution on the side of the road meets your group 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.030
 on a tramp called so close 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.460
 that you are camped in the wilderness 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.220
 On her way to Caliber maybe 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.169

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.770
 pronounced and replaced and 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.350
 He wants him to do this 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.760
 once you but now notruf in sari 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.770
 rather the opposite 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.690
 his brother was just jealous of everything 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.880
 what he has worked out and hears 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.860
 turn to him as a contract killer 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.210
 I saw your letters 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.060
 take care of my brother and I say 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.889
 Nobody that you have been here 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.509
 that who lies, who says the truth 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.210
 and worse, who is actually 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.919
 who now it is free to you directly 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.660
 to eliminate one of the two brothers 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.000
 or dig deeper 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.000
 according to your discretion and certain 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.360
 at another occasion should yours 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.740
 Group a powerful magic wand 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.439
 for a dealer to get back 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.120
 are you an honest skin then you can 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:05.219
 you just deliver the bar and the 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.249
 collecting rewards is yours 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:11.340
 Fratzen died so wonderfully wonderful 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:13.560
 finally you save a certain amount 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.150
 could provided unscrupulous 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.810
 but their sleep to yourself 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.300
 reap 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.310
 to the bright enthusiasm to burn her 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.080
 can of course also name suggestion 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.210
 just give in to the bar 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.930
 but would like to see it burned 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.659
 really do that 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.409
 the strong coastal city never 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:31.319
 to get 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:33.360
 I totally agree with that 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.219
 we burn the whole state 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.560
 I disagree as 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:39.900
 have you solved the quests? 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.240
