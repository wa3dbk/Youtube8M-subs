00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
very very outrageous I mean he used the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.970 
very very outrageous I mean he used the
triangle<00:02:10.280> in<00:02:10.399> one<00:02:10.640> that's<00:02:11.150> already<00:02:11.420> much<00:02:12.099> and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
but so showing that goes much further so

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.670 
but so showing that goes much further so
I<00:02:20.180> should<00:02:20.510> say<00:02:20.690> or<00:02:20.900> always<00:02:21.349> it's<00:02:21.530> an

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
I should say or always it's an

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.740 
I should say or always it's an
