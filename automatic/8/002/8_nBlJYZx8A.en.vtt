00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that this is a kind of a tough version

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.160 
that this is a kind of a tough version
of<00:01:18.990> pac-man<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:20.119> it's<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:21.509> hard<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
of pac-man because it's a little hard to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.679 
of pac-man because it's a little hard to
you<00:01:22.890> know<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.159> joystick<00:01:23.369> obviously<00:01:24.150> but

you know have a joystick obviously but

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.649 
you know have a joystick obviously but
it's<00:01:25.320> pretty<00:01:25.680> tough<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.009> move<00:01:26.880> around<00:01:27.210> here

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
it's pretty tough to move around here

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.640 
it's pretty tough to move around here
and<00:01:28.549> get<00:01:29.549> these<00:01:29.670> guys<00:01:29.970> some<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> these<00:01:30.590> some<00:01:31.590> of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and get these guys some of these some of

and get these guys some of these some of
these<00:01:31.850> corners<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.090> particular<00:01:33.720> tough<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.500> go

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
these corners in particular tough to go

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.249 
these corners in particular tough to go
around<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> working<00:01:36.869> version<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
around but it is a working version of

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.880 
around but it is a working version of
pac-man<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.829> Minecraft<00:01:38.490> oh<00:01:38.700> god<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.740> can't<00:01:40.740> use

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
pac-man in Minecraft oh god I can't use

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.100 
pac-man in Minecraft oh god I can't use
the<00:01:41.070> little<00:01:41.280> trick<00:01:41.520> where<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.729> hide<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.329> there

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the little trick where you hide in there

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.860 
the little trick where you hide in there
we<00:01:43.170> go

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
we go

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.990 
we go
this<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.710> some<00:01:45.010> of<00:01:45.070> this<00:01:45.160> tight<00:01:45.460> corners<00:01:45.880> are

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
this is some of this tight corners are

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.370 
this is some of this tight corners are
very<00:01:46.150> hard<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.420> get<00:01:46.570> yeah<00:01:47.050> it's<00:01:47.260> basically

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
very hard to get yeah it's basically

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.050 
very hard to get yeah it's basically
pac-man<00:01:47.980> in<00:01:48.100> Minecraft<00:01:48.430> it's<00:01:48.610> pretty<00:01:48.820> cool

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
pac-man in Minecraft it's pretty cool

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.720 
pac-man in Minecraft it's pretty cool
but<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.470> would<00:01:50.620> be<00:01:50.650> awesome<00:01:51.070> if<00:01:51.190> they<00:01:51.310> added

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
but this would be awesome if they added

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.090 
but this would be awesome if they added
more<00:01:52.030> archaic<00:01:52.870> and<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.320> mean<00:01:53.500> like<00:01:53.650> this<00:01:53.890> they

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
more archaic and I mean like this they

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.740 
more archaic and I mean like this they
got<00:01:54.280> pac-man<00:01:54.670> working<00:01:55.030> which<00:01:55.180> is<00:01:55.330> really<00:01:55.540> cool

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
got pac-man working which is really cool

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.850 
got pac-man working which is really cool
but<00:01:55.870> I'd<00:01:55.990> love<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.350> see<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.560> full<00:01:57.120> arcade<00:01:58.120> in

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
but I'd love to see a full arcade in

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.110 
but I'd love to see a full arcade in
Minecraft<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.190> could<00:02:00.370> just<00:02:00.520> go<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.760> and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
Minecraft that you could just go to and

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.370 
Minecraft that you could just go to and
hang<00:02:01.300> out<00:02:01.420> with<00:02:01.480> your<00:02:01.690> friends<00:02:02.050> because<00:02:02.170> this

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
hang out with your friends because this

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.620 
hang out with your friends because this

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
does work on multiplayer I'm not sure

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.050 
does work on multiplayer I'm not sure
how<00:02:04.920> much<00:02:05.920> better<00:02:06.160> than<00:02:06.370> single-player<00:02:06.820> but

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
how much better than single-player but

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.969 
how much better than single-player but
anyways<00:02:07.960> whoa<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.200> just<00:02:08.560> glitched<00:02:08.770> through

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
anyways whoa I just glitched through

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.250 
anyways whoa I just glitched through
those<00:02:09.130> ghosts<00:02:09.399> but<00:02:10.360> yeah<00:02:10.510> this<00:02:10.690> is<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:11.140> is
