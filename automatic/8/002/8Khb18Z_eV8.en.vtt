shiny pokemon are featured enough in the
anime<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.990> personally<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.680> so

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
anime I personally do not think so

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.760

considering<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.420> fanbase<00:01:24.900> shiny<00:01:25.259> pokemon

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
considering the fanbase shiny pokemon

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.219 
considering the fanbase shiny pokemon
have<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:27.869> they<00:01:27.960> should<00:01:28.140> be

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
have I really think they should be

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
have I really think they should be
featured<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.740> heck<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.189> lot<00:01:29.340> more<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790

episode<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.509> has<00:01:33.659> featured<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.500> shiny
