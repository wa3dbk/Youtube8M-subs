bit a little bit of finesse and it makes

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.969 
bit a little bit of finesse and it makes
the<00:00:41.970> boat<00:00:42.089> real<00:00:42.300> easy<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.629> drive<00:00:42.839> I<00:00:43.140> can't<00:00:43.680> wait

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 
the boat real easy to drive I can't wait

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:45.950 
the boat real easy to drive I can't wait
to<00:00:44.190> check<00:00:44.220> this<00:00:44.580> out<00:00:44.790> now<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.210> see<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to check this out now I see that the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
to check this out now I see that the
engines<00:00:46.320> right<00:00:46.500> now<00:00:46.680> we're<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.159> like

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
engines right now we're kind of like

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.430 
engines right now we're kind of like
cantilever<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.299> a<00:00:48.390> way<00:00:48.540> yeah<00:00:49.049> that<00:00:49.110> shows

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
cantilever it in a way yeah that shows

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.229 
cantilever it in a way yeah that shows
that<00:00:49.589> it's<00:00:49.799> in<00:00:49.949> position<00:00:50.519> you<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.790> for<00:00:50.940> using

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that it's in position you just for using

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.710 
that it's in position you just for using
it<00:00:51.360> yep<00:00:51.750> each<00:00:51.989> engine<00:00:52.229> steers<00:00:52.680> independently

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
it yep each engine steers independently

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.149 
it yep each engine steers independently
don't<00:00:54.720> have<00:00:54.869> a<00:00:54.900> don't<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> hard<00:00:55.739> time<00:00:55.920> bar

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
don't have a don't have a hard time bar

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.530 
don't have a don't have a hard time bar
between<00:00:56.309> them<00:00:56.580> like<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.820> normally<00:00:57.150> have<00:00:57.299> on

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
between them like you normally have on

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.619 
between them like you normally have on
our<00:00:57.659> duals<00:00:57.900> and<00:00:58.110> triples<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:58.619> quads<00:00:59.629> that's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
our duals and triples and quads that's

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.299 
our duals and triples and quads that's
another<00:01:00.839> thing<00:01:01.049> you<00:01:01.110> can<00:01:01.260> get<00:01:01.409> it<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.650> duals

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
another thing you can get it for duals

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.660 
another thing you can get it for duals
triples<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:02.790> quad<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> pretty<00:01:05.070> much<00:01:05.189> any<00:01:05.369> any

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.399 
boat that's out there today you can put
a<00:01:07.890> joystick<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.460> perfect<00:01:09.360> well<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.320> don't

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
a joystick on perfect well if you don't

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.200 
a joystick on perfect well if you don't
mind<00:01:10.650> I'd<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.130> try<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> myself

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
mind I'd like to try them out to myself

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
mind I'd like to try them out to myself
and<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.900> could<00:01:13.049> figure<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.530> all

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and see if I could figure it out all

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.390 
and see if I could figure it out all
right<00:01:13.860> let's<00:01:14.159> go

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
it the adult joystick thing

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
it the adult joystick thing
okay<00:01:18.990> let's<00:01:19.500> say<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> joystick

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
okay let's say you have the joystick

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.950 
okay let's say you have the joystick
right<00:01:20.610> there<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.360> got<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> joystick<00:01:21.750> right

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
right there we got the joystick right

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.370 
right there we got the joystick right
here<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.659> just<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> real<00:01:24.930> light<00:01:25.110> touch

look<00:03:17.269> at<00:03:17.390> my<00:03:17.510> Raymarine<00:03:18.019> unit<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.500> see<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.890> I

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
look at my Raymarine unit to see that I

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.399 
look at my Raymarine unit to see that I
got<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.519> wreck<00:03:19.700> below<00:03:20.030> me<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:21.019> is<00:03:21.170> going<00:03:21.349> to

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
got the wreck below me this is going to

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.440 
got the wreck below me this is going to
keep<00:03:21.590> me<00:03:21.739> on<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.129> okay<00:03:22.760> now<00:03:22.909> I<00:03:22.940> think<00:03:23.090> would<00:03:23.330> be

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
keep me on it okay now I think would be

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.180 
keep me on it okay now I think would be
really<00:03:23.659> neat<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.260> try<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.530> figure<00:03:24.799> out<00:03:25.010> how

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
really neat is to try to figure out how

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.220 
really neat is to try to figure out how
I<00:03:25.220> can<00:03:25.400> kind<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.940> maneuver<00:03:26.540> this<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:26.900> Reverse

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
I can kind of maneuver this in Reverse

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.250 
I can kind of maneuver this in Reverse
so<00:03:28.129> how<00:03:28.310> would<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.519> do<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:28.730> just<00:03:29.049> same<00:03:30.049> way<00:03:30.200> you

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
so how would I do that just same way you

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.809 
so how would I do that just same way you
do<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.650> with<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.829> levers<00:03:31.159> I<00:03:31.400> started<00:03:31.730> running

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
little getting used to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.500 
little getting used to
once<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.639> get<00:04:31.789> used<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.240> and<00:04:32.419> you

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
understand what what each of the

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.460 
understand what what each of the
movements<00:04:34.729> does<00:04:34.970> then<00:04:35.720> it<00:04:35.840> becomes<00:04:36.139> very<00:04:36.349> easy

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
movements does then it becomes very easy

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.909 
movements does then it becomes very easy
to<00:04:36.830> draw<00:04:37.039> it's<00:04:37.340> very<00:04:37.550> intuitive<00:04:37.910> mm-hmm<00:04:38.919> so

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
to draw it's very intuitive mm-hmm so

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.050 
to draw it's very intuitive mm-hmm so
what<00:04:40.070> are<00:04:40.130> we<00:04:40.220> gonna<00:04:40.340> do<00:04:40.580> now<00:04:40.729> we're<00:04:40.789> going<00:04:40.940> to
