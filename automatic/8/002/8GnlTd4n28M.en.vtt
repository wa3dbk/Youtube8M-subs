00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
at starting off looks like all the other

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.809 
at starting off looks like all the other
aerobatic<00:02:39.000> aircraft<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:40.400> from<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.550> point

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
aerobatic aircraft and from that point

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.270 
aerobatic aircraft and from that point
we<00:02:42.030> iterated<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.110> think<00:02:43.290> got<00:02:43.379> up<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.620> about<00:02:43.650> 14

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
we iterated I think got up to about 14

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.790 
we iterated I think got up to about 14
iterations<00:02:44.970> just<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.660> finalize<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.530> sketch

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
iterations just to finalize the sketch

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.190 
iterations just to finalize the sketch
or<00:02:47.040> what<00:02:47.129> they've<00:02:47.280> got<00:02:47.489> looked<00:02:47.700> like<00:02:47.879> and<00:02:48.200> at

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
or what they've got looked like and at

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.110 
or what they've got looked like and at
that<00:02:49.349> point<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.769> can<00:02:49.890> come<00:02:50.069> up<00:02:50.099> with<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.610> weight

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
that point you can come up with a weight

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.610 
that point you can come up with a weight
and<00:02:51.300> balance<00:02:51.510> estimate<00:02:52.080> for<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.290> aircraft

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
and balance estimate for the aircraft

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.230 
and balance estimate for the aircraft
see<00:02:52.830> if<00:02:52.890> it'll<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.160> stable

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
see if it'll be stable

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.350 
see if it'll be stable
and<00:02:54.360> then<00:02:55.160> start<00:02:56.160> some<00:02:56.400> aerodynamic<00:02:57.060> design

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
and then start some aerodynamic design

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.450 
and then start some aerodynamic design
and<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.110> edge<00:02:58.230> an<00:02:58.350> aerodynamic<00:02:59.010> design<00:02:59.280> we

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
and on the edge an aerodynamic design we

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.050 
and on the edge an aerodynamic design we
followed<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.790> 523<00:03:00.600> regulations<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:01.710> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
followed the 523 regulations for the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.930 
followed the 523 regulations for the
aircraft<00:03:03.060> loading<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.680> allowed<00:03:05.580> us<00:03:05.760> in

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
aircraft loading and that allowed us in

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.730 
aircraft loading and that allowed us in
to<00:03:06.360> determine<00:03:07.080> what<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> loads<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.710> the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
to determine what the loads on the

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.500 
to determine what the loads on the
aircraft<00:03:08.130> would<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:08.700> from<00:03:09.120> there<00:03:09.330> loads

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
aircraft would be and from there loads

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.460 
aircraft would be and from there loads
you<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.720> work<00:03:09.960> out<00:03:10.110> what<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.350> actual

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
you can work out what the actual

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.860 
you can work out what the actual
structural<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.430> as<00:03:11.670> size<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.570> various

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
structural is as size of the various

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.510 
structural is as size of the various
materials<00:03:13.260> has<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.500> be<00:03:13.620> like<00:03:14.310> most

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
materials has to be like most

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.250 
materials has to be like most
high-performance<00:03:14.880> equipment<00:03:15.840> these<00:03:15.960> days

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
high-performance equipment these days

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.070 
high-performance equipment these days
the<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.860> export<00:03:17.490> is<00:03:17.640> made<00:03:17.910> almost<00:03:18.210> entirely<00:03:18.870> of

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
the a export is made almost entirely of

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.410 
the a export is made almost entirely of
carbon<00:03:19.470> fibre<00:03:19.940> reducing<00:03:20.940> weight<00:03:21.150> and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
carbon fibre reducing weight and

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.690 
carbon fibre reducing weight and
increasing<00:03:22.290> performance<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.040> export<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.670> a

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
increasing performance the export is a

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.850 
increasing performance the export is a
little<00:03:23.970> carbon<00:03:24.390> aircraft<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.740> a

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
little carbon aircraft so it's a

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.040 
little carbon aircraft so it's a
basically<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.520> sandwich<00:03:26.910> called<00:03:27.180> carbon<00:03:27.720> you

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
basically a sandwich called carbon you

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.950 
basically a sandwich called carbon you
take<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.320> look<00:03:28.500> what<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.040> carbon<00:03:29.810> carbons<00:03:30.810> and

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
take a look what is carbon carbons and

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.560 
take a look what is carbon carbons and
awesome<00:03:31.620> fiber<00:03:31.890> it's<00:03:32.220> stronger<00:03:32.610> stiffer<00:03:33.150> and

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
awesome fiber it's stronger stiffer and

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.540 
awesome fiber it's stronger stiffer and
lighter<00:03:33.600> than<00:03:34.320> glass<00:03:34.590> fiber<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.250> looks<00:03:35.400> like<00:03:35.520> a

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
lighter than glass fiber it looks like a

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.630 
lighter than glass fiber it looks like a
mesh<00:03:36.020> yes<00:03:37.020> it's<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.350> woven<00:03:37.680> fabric<00:03:37.740> so<00:03:38.310> by

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
mesh yes it's a woven fabric so by

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.470 
mesh yes it's a woven fabric so by
itself<00:03:38.940> carbon<00:03:39.570> is<00:03:39.890> very<00:03:40.890> fluffy<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.880> but<00:03:42.300> in

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
itself carbon is very fluffy and but in

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.570 
itself carbon is very fluffy and but in
terms<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.320> an<00:03:43.410> aircraft<00:03:43.620> structure<00:03:44.280> you're

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
terms of an aircraft structure you're

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.540 
terms of an aircraft structure you're
basically<00:03:44.820> bonded<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.870> nice<00:03:46.140> foam<00:03:46.440> core<00:03:46.830> so

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
basically bonded to a nice foam core so

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.040 
basically bonded to a nice foam core so
you'd<00:03:47.700> end<00:03:47.730> up<00:03:47.970> with<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.180> carbon<00:03:48.750> layer<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:48.990> each

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
you'd end up with a carbon layer on each

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.660 
you'd end up with a carbon layer on each
side<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.470> phone<00:03:49.650> call<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.310> foam<00:03:50.490> core

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
side of a phone call and the foam core

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.090 
side of a phone call and the foam core
itself<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.210> it's<00:03:51.720> quite<00:03:51.840> brittle<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:52.950> can

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
itself is it's quite brittle so you can

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.060 
itself is it's quite brittle so you can
break<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.460> but<00:03:54.300> sandwich<00:03:55.140> together<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.860> you

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
break it but sandwich together and you

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.530 
break it but sandwich together and you
end<00:03:56.250> up<00:03:56.340> with<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.550> sandwich<00:03:56.910> panel<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.450> that's

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
end up with a sandwich panel and that's

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.510 
end up with a sandwich panel and that's
that's<00:03:57.960> again<00:03:58.260> baby<00:03:58.590> basically<00:03:58.920> one<00:03:59.190> layer<00:03:59.400> of

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
that's again baby basically one layer of

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.830 
that's again baby basically one layer of
carbon<00:03:59.910> with<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.090> little<00:04:00.240> bit<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.420> foam<00:04:00.570> in<00:04:00.720> it

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
carbon with a little bit of foam in it

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.660 
carbon with a little bit of foam in it
yeah<00:04:01.260> end<00:04:01.590> up<00:04:01.650> with<00:04:01.740> a<00:04:01.770> very<00:04:02.070> lightweight<00:04:02.310> very

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
yeah end up with a very lightweight very

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.870 
yeah end up with a very lightweight very
brief<00:04:02.970> stuff<00:04:03.180> structure<00:04:03.600> break<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.880> Donald

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
brief stuff structure break this Donald

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.090 
brief stuff structure break this Donald
hangers<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.540> flies<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.230> export<00:04:07.860> at

just<00:04:11.340> outside<00:04:11.790> Cape<00:04:12.150> Town<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.720> noticed<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.470> at

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
just outside Cape Town I noticed that at

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.409 
just outside Cape Town I noticed that at
the<00:04:13.740> front

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.319

of today I started come up with glass

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.580 
of today I started come up with glass
cockpits<00:04:23.490> very<00:04:23.879> light<00:04:24.150> lots<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.199> different
