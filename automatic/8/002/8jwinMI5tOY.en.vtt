00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.600
 it's something like when you pull the chain and it starts to go all over the 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.960
 toilet the water the poop the foam of but in plan beast in a big way 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.800
 it is believed that they can have the mass of four pizzas and a length of 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.880
 at least four meters long enough to swallow a person 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.019
 over it is black with what is very fucked to see when they come and at night 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.460
 moreover, the investigations are progressing slowly since who is sent to 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.280
 investigate a black hole does not usually return 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.530
 and if it does it usually takes too long to remember when 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.170
 came in instead of remembering the decline tend to remember only what 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.920
 much they drank and how much they linked what they enjoyed landscapes 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.370
 summers and other things typical of the nature of the Olympian gods 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.120
 the origin of these energúmenos is yet to be discovered 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.310
 some authors say that black holes were formed thousands and thousands of 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.440
 years when the primitive beings iván eating flying spaghetti and 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.030
 they threw all the crap in places that were then compacted by the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.590
 pressure of other things and ended up becoming holes 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.560
 the other theory is that god passed with the adore needle when he hung the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.740
 portraits of her multiple brides that's why there are so few black holes in the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.970
 that's why there are so few black holes in the unknown universe 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.890
 Interestingly the discovery of black holes coincide with the date 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.740
 of the creation of the spoons of dessert or coffee as mysterious and 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.880
 inexorably in each household the ratio of covered is always 6 to 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.160
 1 regarding the ratio of soup spoon / fork / knife to spoon 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.690
 for dessert or coffee 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.000
 nobody explains the strange taste of the holes to swallow these little ones 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.330
 concerts there is a small minority group that discusses this claim 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.260
 and insists that the birth of these treats affected the creation 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.460
 of the socks this theory suffers from some contradiction of being true 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.709
 always both socks would disappear and not just one as commonly known 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.209
 Maybe the bushes are black or they do not like to repeat or just like to swallow 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.219
 an odd number of socks 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.510
 other studies claim that the disappearance of socks or 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.730
 teaspoons is directly related to the appearance of 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.639
 pens lighters calendars and beach balls of my idea 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.670
 we would find ourselves before a case of real transformation of matter and not 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.799
 before an inordinate appetite for black holes 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.989
 Recent research links the fact that the paper always runs out 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.829
 hygienic at the most inopportune moment with the voracious appetite of these holes
