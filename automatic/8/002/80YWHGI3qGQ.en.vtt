 child that there are boring things houses I go 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.040
 take a break and maybe I'll go to sleep 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.260
 when it dawned on something cool 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.350
 So that we can do it, I'll be right back. 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.060
 Good morning, dawns and I'm here. 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.530
 here on the outside I did some 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.840
 things I actually did some 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.880
 equipment I check our make there 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.130
 then the show how it got here is 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.979
 very useful to be one if it were a 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.470

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.760

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.910
 the tree that I got a business 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.870
 red and there already have other types of 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.550
 wood an accident a cave but I 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.889
 I think I do not know what miner he is. 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.220
 From there I could not break it. 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.320
 on here 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.990
 I think it has no iron around and 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.050
 that there is good to touch what there is to 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.480
 choco domestic cap and make a cake 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.970

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.310
 I think you have this pec mold and that's what 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.650
 It's going to be very good, we'll get it. 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.000
 people try to tame them and I think 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.040
 You have to make a cake with it here or 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.070

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:14.780

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.260
 and I banished 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.140
 I did not understand what was ok, I think I 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:34.490
 I think it would be really cool to take the 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.560
 Talk to the house and the road taking the damage. 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.570
 I do not know what's good, let's take pop 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.669
 because the people are going to be 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.740
 Our little friend for now has a good 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.290
 But I think the charge will be 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.240
 come here with the pop in our house I 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:51.410
 I had to open you 're going to die. 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:55.060
 then I do not stay 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:59.390

 He left to take advantage of this one good we 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:09.229

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:13.280
 these things is the oxen is the hook 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:16.310
 besides that, it changes here and the bope has 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.370
 inside the coal I found here too 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.130
 I need carrots for him I do not know if 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.190
 he like anything or if he like 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.590
 final carrot was a rabbit so I saw 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.690
 some balloons up there and I think 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.370
 I'll try to get there, will not you? 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.380
 this first episode here will only be 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.880
 even presenting is good for you and 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:40.580
 ask and the balloons were there 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.190
 where I was I should have checked more 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.870
 I'm just a gal, I did, just continue 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.360
 to try and find I could not find 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.139
 but I found this here like some 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.400
 Islands 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.949
 I do not know how we will 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.130
 can make it if the block to give 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:58.039
 arrive and take reasonably good height 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.990
 and there is a portal to another 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.000
 dimension if I'm not mistaken of rain 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.280
 I'm going to jump in here and I think 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.610
 blocks we can get there in 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.530
 No, I'm not going to need to have many. 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.110
 blocks look only old bridge 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.750
 Look, this is coming. I think it's there. 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.639
 Up a village I do not know that you see a 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.800
 horrible snow our team has 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:23.360
 another dimension 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.340
 oh no, it does not have the hint of anything but anyway 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.940
 People, I think it's going to be a year. 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.650
 here is nothing to show if 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.120
 Talk how it works 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.000
 I'm thinking of calling this series 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.800
 because it has several molds 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.550
 super cool then I think it's going to be 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.919
 super series and how I said the opposite of it 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.500
 every once in a while you're not going to enroll 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:47.510
 My god one month I did not like it but maybe one 

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.520
 episode per week anyway i hope 

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.270
 let's be the person if you liked it 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.470

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.890
