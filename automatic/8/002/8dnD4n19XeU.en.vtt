00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.629
 here is our planet from the outside 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.620
 here is what we could observe if we 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.120
 had the opportunity to cut a 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.769
 neighborhood to our planet 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.570
 then we can observe inside 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.539
 that there are three main sections 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.850
 one day we have the orange core we 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.789
 have the coat and finally the part 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.890
 external which is the crust if they have 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.340
 studied a little deeper each 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.340
 of these parts 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:34.350
 the core is the central part of the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.500
 taz and their total rays of about 3500 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.079
 kilometers the most central part and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.020
 the inner core which is solid and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.360
 around we have the outer core which 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.090
 is liquid in the nucleus occupies about 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.680
 17% of the volume of the tax the party the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.379
 warmer is the denser it is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.059
 mainly composed of doing and that's 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.260
 besides this doing that generates the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.940
 magnetic field around the earth the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.660
 coat is the part that end up 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.040
 between the nucleus and the earth's crust 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.500
 divide in two first of all we have 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.890
 the lower mantle that is near 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.630
 of the nucleus this part is solid 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 then we have the upper coat 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.210
 who is near the crau land this 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.960
 artist will be solid when she is near 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.450
 crust 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.170
 while a little further down the mantle 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.290
 inferior 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.900
 it will be semi semi solid liquids 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.590
 a bit like the loach in fact it's the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.840
 magma 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.200
 that is, molten rock if that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.540
 magma that will create volcano lava 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.979
 the mantle occupies 80% this volume the earth 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.170
 finally the earth's crust is the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.810
 third part of the case the part 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.240
 external and solid consisting of rocks 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.479
 it occupies only 2% of the volume 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.890
 total of the earth its thickness varies from 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.840
 5 to 75 65 forgiveness km one distinguishes it 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.670
 depending on where she is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.070
 then those that form the continents 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.020
 is called the continental crust then 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.399
 that those under the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.830
 oceans is called oceanic crust on 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.390
 this beautiful drawing 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.790
 at all on the scale we can quickly 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.440
 see the difference in thickness at the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.220
 continental crust and crust 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.400
 oceanic 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.710
 actually the earth's crust will have 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.790
 a different thickness depending on 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.500
 we are she 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.050
 when it comes to a crust 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.060
 continental she will be much more 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.480
 thick then rang pinsard will vary 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.210
 between 30 and 65 km what we mean by 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.360
 there is that the distance between the beginning 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:42.530
 of the crust and the beginning of the coat will be 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.990
 from 30 to 65 km while 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.330
 is the oceanic crust then the 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.190
 ocean floor 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.890
 until the beginning of the mantle the distance 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.650
 but rather varied in 5 and 15 kilos but 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.570
 so the oceanic crust is a lot 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.570
 less thick than continental crust
