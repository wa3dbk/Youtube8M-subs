00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
what I always thought the Patriot Act

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.770 
what I always thought the Patriot Act
meant<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.120> were<00:00:33.180> doing<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.570> all<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
meant that they were doing this all the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.209 
meant that they were doing this all the
time<00:00:34.050> anyway<00:00:34.320> which<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.800> don't<00:00:34.860> understand

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
time anyway which I don't understand

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.380 
time anyway which I don't understand
what<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> big<00:00:35.579> deal<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> didn't<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.210> think

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
what the big deal is didn't you think

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.860 
what the big deal is didn't you think
that<00:00:36.480> yes<00:00:36.899> actually<00:00:37.290> when<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.010> yeah<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.270> they

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that yes actually when you yeah and they

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.330 
that yes actually when you yeah and they
were<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.350> pay<00:00:40.469> that's<00:00:40.680> why<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:40.950> signed<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
were the pay that's why they signed the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
were the pay that's why they signed the
Patriot<00:00:41.790> Act<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.090> could<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.540> shit

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
