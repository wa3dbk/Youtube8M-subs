but here we go first SUV at we wins
expansion<00:03:05.520> right<00:03:05.670> now<00:03:05.959> we<00:03:06.959> have<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.140> couple

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
expansion right now we have a couple

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.690 
expansion right now we have a couple
marine<00:03:07.560> sitting<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.040> middle<00:03:08.130> now<00:03:08.400> and

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
marine sitting in the middle now and

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.240 
marine sitting in the middle now and
yeah<00:03:09.690> here<00:03:09.900> comes<00:03:09.930> another<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.709> racks<00:03:10.980> being

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
yeah here comes another of racks being

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.710 
yeah here comes another of racks being
placed<00:03:11.430> down<00:03:11.580> who<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.910> bringing<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.450> lk

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
placed down who is bringing that to lk

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.870 
placed down who is bringing that to lk
lift<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.110> off<00:03:13.230> here<00:03:13.739> by<00:03:14.100> we<00:03:14.340> win<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.670> going<00:03:14.820> to

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
lift it off here by we win and going to

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.490 
lift it off here by we win and going to
be<00:03:14.940> sent<00:03:15.420> on<00:03:15.570> over<00:03:15.840> but<00:03:16.020> this<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.350> little

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
be sent on over but this is a little

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.350 
be sent on over but this is a little
problematic<00:03:16.890> because<00:03:17.340> again<00:03:17.940> six<00:03:18.180> tracks

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
problematic because again six tracks

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.850 
problematic because again six tracks
majors<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.870> camped<00:03:19.170> right<00:03:19.230> outside<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.739> this

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
majors just camped right outside of this

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.400 
majors just camped right outside of this
position<00:03:20.280> still<00:03:20.519> not<00:03:21.360> aware<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:22.170> though

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
position still not aware of that though

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.500 
position still not aware of that though
so<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.040> again<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.640> little<00:03:24.030> bit<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.269> issue<00:03:24.360> a

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
so this is again a little bit of issue a

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.699 
so this is again a little bit of issue a
couple<00:03:24.750> stalkers<00:03:25.080> moved<00:03:25.260> across<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.590> map

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
let's see take a look at how precisely

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.210 
let's see take a look at how precisely
this<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.049> going<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.260> work<00:03:28.410> now<00:03:28.769> these<00:03:28.890> marines
