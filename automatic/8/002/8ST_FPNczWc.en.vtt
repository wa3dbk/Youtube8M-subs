maybe<00:00:36.660> more<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:38.040> don't<00:00:38.309> think<00:00:38.460> anybody<00:00:38.610> has

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
maybe more and I don't think anybody has

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.080 
maybe more and I don't think anybody has
been<00:00:38.910> awarded<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:40.399> exclusive<00:00:41.399> price<00:00:41.760> thing
