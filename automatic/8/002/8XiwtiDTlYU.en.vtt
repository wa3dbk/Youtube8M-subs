00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.000 

I<00:00:04.599> think<00:00:05.599> there's<00:00:05.750> a<00:00:05.809> number<00:00:06.019> of<00:00:06.200> key<00:00:06.529> elements

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
I think there's a number of key elements

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.799 
I think there's a number of key elements
to<00:00:07.220> good<00:00:07.519> running<00:00:07.729> form<00:00:07.849> and<00:00:08.240> the<00:00:08.300> first<00:00:08.570> is

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
to good running form and the first is

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.009 
to good running form and the first is
not<00:00:09.169> to<00:00:09.230> overstride<00:00:10.809> oversize<00:00:11.809> when<00:00:11.959> you

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
not to overstride oversize when you

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.869 
not to overstride oversize when you
stick<00:00:12.200> your<00:00:12.320> leg<00:00:12.469> out<00:00:12.589> in<00:00:12.740> front<00:00:12.919> of<00:00:13.039> you<00:00:13.129> you

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
stick your leg out in front of you you

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.180 
stick your leg out in front of you you
land<00:00:14.120> with<00:00:14.389> your<00:00:14.599> your<00:00:15.139> foot<00:00:15.469> in<00:00:15.799> front<00:00:16.129> of

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
land with your your foot in front of

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.430 
land with your your foot in front of
your<00:00:16.309> knee<00:00:16.610> and<00:00:16.910> really<00:00:17.690> way<00:00:17.990> in<00:00:18.170> front<00:00:18.350> of

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
your knee and really way in front of

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.990 
your knee and really way in front of
your<00:00:18.590> hip<00:00:18.770> a<00:00:19.100> lot<00:00:19.370> of<00:00:19.460> people<00:00:19.640> think<00:00:19.850> that

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
your hip a lot of people think that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.340 
your hip a lot of people think that
they're<00:00:20.120> running<00:00:20.390> hard<00:00:20.780> when<00:00:20.990> they<00:00:21.080> do<00:00:21.140> that

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
they're running hard when they do that

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.200 
they're running hard when they do that
you<00:00:21.860> know<00:00:21.890> why<00:00:22.160> because<00:00:22.550> they<00:00:22.700> are<00:00:22.850> running

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
you know why because they are running

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.580 
you know why because they are running
hard<00:00:23.450> because<00:00:23.780> when<00:00:23.930> you<00:00:24.020> stick<00:00:24.200> your<00:00:24.320> leg<00:00:24.470> out

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
hard because when you stick your leg out

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.860 
hard because when you stick your leg out
in<00:00:24.650> front<00:00:24.890> of<00:00:25.010> you<00:00:25.130> you<00:00:25.820> actually<00:00:26.030> decelerate

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:26.870 
in front of you you actually decelerate

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.390 
in front of you you actually decelerate
from<00:00:27.110> the<00:00:27.440> time<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:27.800> takes<00:00:27.890> for<00:00:28.040> your<00:00:28.160> center

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
from the time it takes for your center

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.500 
from the time it takes for your center
of<00:00:28.430> mass<00:00:28.520> of<00:00:28.790> your<00:00:28.880> body<00:00:29.060> to<00:00:29.210> get<00:00:29.330> over<00:00:29.450> your

of mass of your body to get over your

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.150 
of mass of your body to get over your
foot<00:00:29.720> you're<00:00:29.900> actually<00:00:30.140> losing<00:00:30.350> energy<00:00:30.650> the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
foot you're actually losing energy the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.200 
foot you're actually losing energy the
other<00:00:31.220> thing<00:00:31.430> that<00:00:31.460> happens<00:00:31.790> when<00:00:31.910> you<00:00:31.940> over

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
other thing that happens when you over

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.790 
other thing that happens when you over
stride<00:00:32.480> is<00:00:32.629> that<00:00:32.780> when<00:00:32.899> you<00:00:32.989> stick<00:00:33.379> your<00:00:33.469> your

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
stride is that when you stick your your

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.900 
stride is that when you stick your your
foot<00:00:33.980> out<00:00:34.070> in<00:00:34.100> front<00:00:34.219> of<00:00:34.399> you<00:00:34.489> it'll<00:00:34.640> make<00:00:34.760> your

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
foot out in front of you it'll make your

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.000 
foot out in front of you it'll make your
legs<00:00:35.059> differ<00:00:35.359> and<00:00:36.199> you<00:00:36.350> have<00:00:36.499> what's<00:00:36.920> called

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
legs differ and you have what's called

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.380 
legs differ and you have what's called
an<00:00:37.129> impact<00:00:37.489> peak<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:37.969> shock<00:00:38.359> wave

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
an impact peak and the shock wave

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.930 
an impact peak and the shock wave
travels<00:00:38.809> up<00:00:39.140> your<00:00:39.260> body<00:00:39.440> but<00:00:40.339> when<00:00:40.489> you<00:00:40.579> land

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
travels up your body but when you land

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.000 
travels up your body but when you land
without<00:00:41.089> Andover's<00:00:41.690> drawing<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.649> don't<00:00:42.829> have

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
without Andover's drawing you don't have

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.639 
without Andover's drawing you don't have
that<00:00:43.159> jolt<00:00:43.969> of<00:00:44.179> force<00:00:44.449> and<00:00:45.109> you're<00:00:45.350> much<00:00:45.499> less

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
that jolt of force and you're much less

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.950 
that jolt of force and you're much less
likely<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:46.039> get<00:00:46.129> injured<00:00:46.539> it's<00:00:47.539> just<00:00:47.719> a<00:00:47.780> better

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
likely to get injured it's just a better

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.489 
likely to get injured it's just a better
way<00:00:48.109> to<00:00:48.170> run<00:00:49.809> another<00:00:50.809> key<00:00:51.050> element<00:00:51.379> to

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
way to run another key element to

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.500 
way to run another key element to
running<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.460> run<00:00:52.609> with<00:00:52.789> a<00:00:52.819> man<00:00:53.329> with<00:00:53.449> a

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
running is to run with a man with a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.660 
running is to run with a man with a
pretty<00:00:53.659> flat<00:00:53.989> foot<00:00:54.319> I<00:00:54.559> think<00:00:55.219> most<00:00:55.460> good

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
pretty flat foot I think most good

are landing really hard if you're
something<00:01:22.670> as<00:01:22.790> we<00:01:22.910> call<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.180> my<00:01:23.330> lab<00:01:23.540> that

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
something as we call it my lab that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.080 
something as we call it my lab that
you're<00:01:24.560> running<00:01:24.710> poorly<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:25.430> thumb<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:26.060> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
you're running poorly that thumb is the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.970 
you're running poorly that thumb is the
sound<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.720> collision<00:01:27.230> of<00:01:27.350> your<00:01:27.470> body<00:01:27.710> when

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
sound of the collision of your body when

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.710 
sound of the collision of your body when
the<00:01:28.070> ground<00:01:28.310> running<00:01:28.880> should<00:01:29.000> be<00:01:29.150> light<00:01:29.450> and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
the ground running should be light and

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.050 
the ground running should be light and
gentle<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.260> collision<00:01:30.800> free<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.820> if<00:01:31.940> you're

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
gentle and collision free so if you're

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.850 
gentle and collision free so if you're
making<00:01:32.150> a<00:01:32.360> lot<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.510> noise<00:01:32.780> you're<00:01:33.590> running

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
making a lot of noise you're running

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.200 
making a lot of noise you're running
poorly<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:35.680> then<00:01:36.680> finally<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:38.000> most

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
poorly and then finally the most
