thing that we've got that I've built

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.690 
thing that we've got that I've built
with<00:03:33.540> with<00:03:33.870> Robert<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:34.859> when<00:03:35.010> Arduino<00:03:35.400> really

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
with with Robert so when Arduino really

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.930 
with with Robert so when Arduino really
is<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:36.180> little<00:03:37.140> mini<00:03:37.440> computer<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.790> can

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
is a little mini computer that you can

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.900 
is a little mini computer that you can
program<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.660> not<00:03:39.870> very<00:03:40.799> powerful<00:03:41.370> but<00:03:41.880> it

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
program it's not very powerful but it

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.210 
program it's not very powerful but it
could<00:03:42.090> do<00:03:42.180> all<00:03:42.299> sorts<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.569> fun<00:03:42.900> things<00:03:43.220> Robert

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
could do all sorts of fun things Robert

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.099 
could do all sorts of fun things Robert
I<00:03:44.310> were<00:03:44.400> talking<00:03:44.579> he's<00:03:45.450> always<00:03:45.720> he's<00:03:45.840> really

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
I were talking he's always he's really

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.420 
I were talking he's always he's really
proud<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.319> his<00:03:46.500> kid<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.739> he<00:03:47.190> was<00:03:47.310> playing

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
proud of his kid and he was playing

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.240

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
soccer at the time and it's wheelchair

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.460 
soccer at the time and it's wheelchair
soccer<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.819> I<00:03:51.120> think<00:03:51.359> we

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
soccer and I think we

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.160 
soccer and I think we
we<00:03:53.310> had<00:03:53.460> a<00:03:53.490> few<00:03:53.670> discussions<00:03:53.940> about<00:03:54.240> making

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
we had a few discussions about making

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.670 
we had a few discussions about making
cooler<00:03:56.030> fancier<00:03:57.030> wheelchair<00:03:57.840> motor<00:03:57.870> things

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
cooler fancier wheelchair motor things

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.330 
cooler fancier wheelchair motor things
and<00:03:59.750> out<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.960> that<00:04:00.990> I<00:04:01.380> am<00:04:01.950> starting<00:04:02.280> to

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
and out of that I am starting to

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.800 
and out of that I am starting to
understand<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.820> Jerry<00:04:03.030> had<00:04:03.150> quite<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.510> severe

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
understand that Jerry had quite a severe

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.830 
understand that Jerry had quite a severe
disability<00:04:04.460> so<00:04:05.460> I<00:04:05.520> explained<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.090> him<00:04:06.240> Jerry

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
disability so I explained to him Jerry

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.560 
disability so I explained to him Jerry
in<00:04:07.050> his<00:04:07.200> arms<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.430> lack<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.670> movement<00:04:09.030> and

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
in his arms and the lack of movement and

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.560 
in his arms and the lack of movement and
I<00:04:09.840> needed<00:04:10.080> an<00:04:10.290> interface<00:04:10.830> point<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.580> take<00:04:11.820> over

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
I needed an interface point to take over

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.640 
I needed an interface point to take over
the<00:04:13.530> keyboard<00:04:14.960> but<00:04:15.960> it<00:04:16.079> had<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.350> be<00:04:16.380> on<00:04:16.620> a

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
the keyboard but it had to be on a

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.420 
the keyboard but it had to be on a
joystick<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.910> at<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.630> same<00:04:18.840> time<00:04:19.430> arduino

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
joystick and at the same time arduino

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.610 
joystick and at the same time arduino
came<00:04:20.670> out<00:04:20.820> with<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> leonardo<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:22.200> had<00:04:22.470> the

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
came out with a leonardo it had the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.290 
came out with a leonardo it had the
ability<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:23.160> talk<00:04:23.370> as<00:04:23.640> a<00:04:23.670> keyboard<00:04:24.090> or<00:04:24.150> as<00:04:24.270> a

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
ability to talk as a keyboard or as a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.340 
ability to talk as a keyboard or as a
mouse<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:25.550> after<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.580> couple<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.660> discussions<00:04:28.140> I

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
mouse so after a couple of discussions I

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.560 
mouse so after a couple of discussions I
guess<00:04:28.530> we<00:04:28.710> figured<00:04:29.280> out<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.460> hey<00:04:30.090> maybe<00:04:30.540> I

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
guess we figured out that hey maybe I

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.540 
guess we figured out that hey maybe I
should<00:04:31.080> program<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.650> board<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.070> act<00:04:32.340> as<00:04:32.520> a

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
should program a board to act as a

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.450 
should program a board to act as a
keyboard<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.770> with<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.950> limited<00:04:35.280> movement

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
keyboard and with the limited movement

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.850 
keyboard and with the limited movement
in<00:04:35.820> jerry's<00:04:36.150> left<00:04:36.210> hand<00:04:36.750> we<00:04:37.470> could<00:04:37.650> perhaps

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
in jerry's left hand we could perhaps

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.950 
in jerry's left hand we could perhaps
get<00:04:38.310> him<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.700> enter<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.120> few<00:04:39.450> keystrokes<00:04:39.690> a

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
get him to enter a few keystrokes a

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.659 
get him to enter a few keystrokes a
couple<00:04:42.960> days<00:04:43.110> later<00:04:43.140> i<00:04:43.800> said<00:04:44.190> i<00:04:44.220> think<00:04:44.370> i<00:04:44.550> got

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
couple days later i said i think i got

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:45.980 
couple days later i said i think i got
something<00:04:44.970> working<00:04:45.150> what<00:04:45.600> do<00:04:45.660> you<00:04:45.690> want<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.900> do

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
something working what do you want to do

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.860 
something working what do you want to do
next<00:04:46.140> there's<00:04:46.919> four<00:04:47.250> essential<00:04:47.910> pieces<00:04:48.180> the

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
next there's four essential pieces the

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.400 
next there's four essential pieces the
joystick<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:51.090> shield<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.600> connects<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.990> the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
joystick the shield that connects to the

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.320 
joystick the shield that connects to the
Leonardo<00:04:53.010> so<00:04:53.280> there's<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.580> Leonardo<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.270> the

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
Leonardo so there's the Leonardo and the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.350 
Leonardo so there's the Leonardo and the
shield<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:56.190> LCD<00:04:56.580> display<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.210> it's

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
shield and the LCD display and it's

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.570 
shield and the LCD display and it's
little<00:04:57.660> bits<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.500> I<00:04:58.860> guess<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.130> computer<00:04:59.520> is

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
little bits and I guess the computer is

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.880 
little bits and I guess the computer is
important<00:04:59.940> as<00:05:00.030> well<00:05:00.140> so<00:05:01.140> in<00:05:01.320> our<00:05:01.440> game<00:05:01.680> we

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
important as well so in our game we

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.430 
important as well so in our game we
would<00:05:02.040> map<00:05:02.280> are<00:05:02.640> to<00:05:03.120> move<00:05:03.240> left<00:05:03.540> movement<00:05:04.020> to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
would map are to move left movement to

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.340 
would map are to move left movement to
the<00:05:04.800> e<00:05:05.070> key<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:06.120> we<00:05:06.150> got<00:05:06.419> left<00:05:06.690> right<00:05:07.050> forward

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
the e key so we got left right forward

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.950 
the e key so we got left right forward
and<00:05:07.650> backwards<00:05:08.130> and<00:05:08.630> because<00:05:09.630> we<00:05:09.720> have<00:05:09.840> those

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
and backwards and because we have those

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.800 
and backwards and because we have those
four<00:05:10.200> parameters<00:05:10.440> now<00:05:10.860> we<00:05:10.919> are<00:05:11.160> allowing<00:05:11.810> the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
four parameters now we are allowing the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.960 
four parameters now we are allowing the
joystick<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.560> push<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:14.400> key<00:05:14.610> of<00:05:14.910> the

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
joystick to push the the key of the

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.570 
joystick to push the the key of the
keyboard<00:05:15.330> rather<00:05:15.900> than<00:05:16.260> your<00:05:16.979> physical<00:05:17.160> hand

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
keyboard rather than your physical hand

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.580 
keyboard rather than your physical hand
reaching<00:05:17.880> over<00:05:18.150> impressing<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:19.380> allows

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
reaching over impressing it it allows

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.219 
reaching over impressing it it allows
Jerry<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:20.250> interact<00:05:20.640> moving<00:05:21.540> himself<00:05:21.720> left

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
Jerry to interact moving himself left

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.800 
Jerry to interact moving himself left
right<00:05:22.530> forward<00:05:22.919> or<00:05:23.250> backwards<00:05:23.669> so<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.330> day<00:05:24.510> I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
right forward or backwards so the day I

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.780 
right forward or backwards so the day I
took<00:05:25.260> the<00:05:25.919> device<00:05:26.250> over<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:27.180> Jerry<00:05:27.479> it

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
took the device over to Jerry it

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.340 
took the device over to Jerry it
it<00:05:29.240> wasn't<00:05:29.630> quite<00:05:29.720> ready<00:05:29.930> because<00:05:30.140> you<00:05:30.260> have

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
it wasn't quite ready because you have

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.080 
it wasn't quite ready because you have
to<00:05:30.440> kind<00:05:30.530> of<00:05:30.620> fit<00:05:30.890> it<00:05:31.040> to<00:05:31.190> his<00:05:31.310> hand<00:05:31.610> to<00:05:31.820> make<00:05:31.940> it

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
to kind of fit it to his hand to make it

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.350 
to kind of fit it to his hand to make it
work<00:05:32.650> he<00:05:33.650> can<00:05:33.860> only<00:05:34.040> move<00:05:34.400> maybe<00:05:34.700> a<00:05:34.820> couple

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
work he can only move maybe a couple

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.020 
work he can only move maybe a couple
millimeters<00:05:35.870> up<00:05:36.410> down<00:05:36.800> left<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.310> right<00:05:37.430> with

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
millimeters up down left and right with

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.030 
millimeters up down left and right with
his<00:05:38.270> left<00:05:38.450> arm<00:05:38.720> if<00:05:39.290> you<00:05:39.410> have<00:05:39.500> a<00:05:39.560> wrong<00:05:39.740> he's

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
his left arm if you have a wrong he's

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.250 
his left arm if you have a wrong he's
just<00:05:40.250> going<00:05:40.340> to<00:05:40.430> be<00:05:40.550> holding<00:05:40.790> a<00:05:41.000> like<00:05:41.300> slurring

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
just going to be holding a like slurring

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.810 
just going to be holding a like slurring
one<00:05:42.560> key<00:05:42.800> all<00:05:42.950> the<00:05:43.070> time<00:05:43.250> because<00:05:43.400> he<00:05:43.550> can't

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
one key all the time because he can't

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.040 
one key all the time because he can't
move<00:05:43.880> he<00:05:44.270> doesn't<00:05:44.480> have<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.630> range<00:05:44.840> of<00:05:44.990> motion

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
move he doesn't have the range of motion

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.990 
move he doesn't have the range of motion
to<00:05:45.650> get<00:05:45.770> all<00:05:45.950> the<00:05:46.190> way<00:05:46.310> back<00:05:46.490> so<00:05:46.700> you<00:05:46.760> have<00:05:46.880> to

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
to get all the way back so you have to

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.360 
to get all the way back so you have to
make<00:05:47.090> sure<00:05:47.150> this<00:05:47.420> is<00:05:47.600> centered<00:05:48.020> on<00:05:48.110> his<00:05:48.890> center

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
make sure this is centered on his center

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.180 
make sure this is centered on his center
of<00:05:49.400> motion<00:05:50.530> Jerry<00:05:51.530> is<00:05:51.620> very<00:05:51.980> depressed<00:05:53.680> all<00:05:54.680> of

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
of motion Jerry is very depressed all of

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.580 
of motion Jerry is very depressed all of
a<00:05:55.220> sudden<00:05:55.520> you<00:05:55.940> just<00:05:56.150> got<00:05:56.330> happy<00:05:56.630> Jerry<00:05:57.440> can

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
a sudden you just got happy Jerry can

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.830 
a sudden you just got happy Jerry can
interact<00:05:57.920> with<00:05:58.040> his<00:05:58.190> friends<00:05:58.730> he<00:05:59.570> plays

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840
