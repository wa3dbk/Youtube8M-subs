 marvel shhhhh and xq yes because yes and number 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.840
 2 some of the programs that already 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.560
 they arrive in the shadow of stupidity 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.990
 flipped number 1 la france is a 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.490
 program where a scientific dad creates a 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.340
 some teenagers who have 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.320
 superpowers and they are strong but always 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.200
 they do something wrong and then they walk 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.180
 Running around Adam is a very funny series 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.070
 but at the same time stupid 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.430
 rating 7.5 number 2 is the terra is 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.829
 a series where they make fights 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.739
 where they fight for slugs and if one loses 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:21.109
 he stays with his slug but sometimes he 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.930
 turns the slugs into gigantic 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:27.590
 things is something passable but the bad is 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.000
 that this very simple rating 7.8 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.790
 number 3 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.590
 the warriors wasabi is a program 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.810
 where a couple of friends who train 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.930
 karate have fun doing nonsense and 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.670
 mean if I can not tell you more since 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.609
 throughout the program they spend it doing 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.810
 that the sad thing is that they humiliate karate 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.489
 as a form of fun rating 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.620
 6.9 number 4 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.720
 phineas and ferb seems to be the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.950
 caricature that comes closest to the greatest 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.049
 audience 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.310
 but something bad is that you can already know 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.769
 what will happen 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.750
 the boys invent something candÃ¡s calls him 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.760
 to mom so that she comes to see see iii the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.769
 doctor doom first meet they fight and 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.750
 collide against him and invented nador and 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.060
 they shoot a ray that goes to the house 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.459
 from phineas and ferb mom gets to see the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.700
 invention disappears with lightning mom not 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.520
 see nothing and it's over is passable 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.060
 8.8 rating 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.880
 5 sad but it's true the 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.250
 magical godparents this series premiered 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.350
 first in fox kicks but as the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.200
 series was made available to disney in 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.210
 2004 began to repeat chapters all 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.520
 the day but then it was sold to 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.980
 nickelodeon the godfathers series 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.960
 magic ceased to be good because the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.390
 chapters will be increasingly boring 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.370
 it was the same theme 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.650
 timmy turner want a wish wish 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.320
 worsens and the magical godparents what 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.710
 they repair is very predictable 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.500
 rating 7 good disney xxvi is a 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.320
 channel and you have to give opportunities but 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.750
 We are already 5 years old on the air and never 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.790
 nothing good happens I remember some 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.370
 stupid words that circulated in 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.430
 youtube on May 1 and return jetix 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.680
 well we already know that it was a lie but 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.440
 least I learned not to believe again 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.780
 rumors like that good that's all 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.790
 friends thank you for watching the video and for 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.360
 please give me I like that that satisfies me 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.360
 goodbye
