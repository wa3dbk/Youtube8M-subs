creating a sound class or a game to keep

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.470 
creating a sound class or a game to keep
the<00:00:11.670> audio<00:00:12.509> clips<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:13.049> our<00:00:13.320> game<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:14.099> create<00:00:14.429> a

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
the audio clips of our game we create a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.260 
the audio clips of our game we create a
sound<00:00:15.480> class<00:00:16.049> which<00:00:16.980> will<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.820> constant

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
sound class which will have a constant

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.450 
sound class which will have a constant
with<00:00:18.630> venerable<00:00:19.320> clip<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.980> each<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
with venerable clip for each of the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.599 
with venerable clip for each of the
sounds<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:20.880> use<00:00:21.270> these<00:00:22.140> constants<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.130> public

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
sounds we use these constants are public

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.000 
sounds we use these constants are public
so<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:23.910> any<00:00:24.210> object<00:00:24.420> which<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.380> access<00:00:25.800> to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
so that any object which have access to

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.730 
so that any object which have access to
them<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.550> play<00:00:26.820> them<00:00:27.060> for<00:00:27.869> example<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.590> the

them can play them for example in the
old<00:00:29.010> truss<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.970> play<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.449> sound<00:00:30.750> or<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
old truss we can play the sound or the

these<00:01:31.380> two<00:01:31.710> tutorials<00:01:32.040> were<00:01:32.579> only<00:01:32.790> one

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
these two tutorials were only one

these two tutorials were only one
unelected<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.700> not<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.909> change<00:01:36.509> all

the code they object how their clips

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.149 
the code they object how their clips
will<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:41.780> created<00:01:42.780> when<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.049> sound<00:01:43.770> class

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
will be created when the sound class

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.539 
will be created when the sound class
loads<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.270> first<00:01:45.540> time<00:01:45.840> someone<00:01:46.290> uses<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
loads the first time someone uses the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.960 
loads the first time someone uses the
sound<00:01:47.820> class<00:01:48.570> when<00:01:49.140> are<00:01:49.350> these<00:01:49.619> objects<00:01:50.610> going

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
sound class when are these objects going

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.780 
sound class when are these objects going
to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.479> created<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:52.950> very<00:01:53.220> important

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
to be created it is not very important

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.120 
to be created it is not very important
because<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.320> class<00:01:55.799> so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
because they are in the this class so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.950 
because they are in the this class so
they're<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.640> created<00:01:57.240> quickly<00:01:57.450> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
they're going to be created quickly and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.770 
they're going to be created quickly and
the<00:01:58.590> first<00:01:58.799> time<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> Java<00:01:59.549> load<00:01:59.909> sound<00:02:00.479> in

the first time the Java load sound in

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780 
the first time the Java load sound in

memory which is the first time someone
calls<00:02:03.409> sound<00:02:04.729> automatically<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:05.850> the

calls sound automatically all the
constants<00:02:06.659> are<00:02:06.810> create<00:02:07.170> these<00:02:07.829> constants<00:02:08.550> are

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
constants are create these constants are

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.520 
constants are create these constants are
the<00:02:08.819> same<00:02:09.090> as<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> ones<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.170> seen<00:02:10.410> before

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the same as the ones we have seen before

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.490 
the same as the ones we have seen before
but<00:02:11.009> these<00:02:11.459> are<00:02:11.900> public

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
but these are public

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.130 
but these are public
as<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.130> can<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.580> instead<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.240> private<00:02:15.900> so

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
as you can see instead of private so

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.200 
as you can see instead of private so
they<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.470> be<00:02:16.590> used<00:02:16.890> from<00:02:17.250> outside<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.030> many

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
they can be used from outside so many

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.500 
they can be used from outside so many
other<00:02:18.810> class<00:02:19.230> they<00:02:20.190> can<00:02:20.220> be<00:02:20.520> used<00:02:20.820> once<00:02:21.210> and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
other class they can be used once and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.380 
other class they can be used once and
again<00:02:21.630> as<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.620> told<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.310> when<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:23.730> object<00:02:24.000> is

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
again as I told you when this object is

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.130 
again as I told you when this object is

created it is loaded in memory and it's

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.640 
created it is loaded in memory and it's
time<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:28.860> do<00:02:29.010> play<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.970> reused<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.960> example

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
time we do play it is reused for example

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.420 
time we do play it is reused for example
this<00:02:32.340> click<00:02:32.880> ball<00:02:33.690> will<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.650> use<00:02:34.860> each<00:02:35.100> time<00:02:35.400> a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
this click ball will be use each time a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.340 
this click ball will be use each time a
ball<00:02:35.820> bounces<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:37.050> seem<00:02:37.350> play<00:02:37.860> play<00:02:38.640> play<00:02:39.350> we

ball bounces you seem play play play we

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.690 
ball bounces you seem play play play we
don't<00:02:40.590> need<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:41.040> reload<00:02:41.460> it<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.790> memory<00:02:42.210> time

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
don't need to reload it in memory time

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.270 
don't need to reload it in memory time
let's<00:02:44.700> copy<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.480> class<00:02:47.750> again

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:02.690 

you

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:21.350 

let's<00:03:03.330> copy<00:03:03.660> also<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.500> class<00:03:04.860> for

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.570 

you

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.900 

we<00:03:24.570> also<00:03:24.750> need<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.170> cast<00:03:25.590> racquets<00:03:26.460> as

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
we also need the cast racquets as

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.440 
we also need the cast racquets as
nothing<00:03:27.390> has<00:03:27.600> changed<00:03:28.470> as<00:03:28.650> copied<00:03:29.160> from<00:03:29.580> this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
nothing has changed as copied from this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:39.949 
nothing has changed as copied from this
other<00:03:30.750> package

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.640 

okay<00:03:40.890> now<00:03:41.069> let's<00:03:41.640> see<00:03:41.909> the<00:03:42.319> modifications<00:03:43.319> you

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
okay now let's see the modifications you

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.580 
okay now let's see the modifications you
gain<00:03:44.129> what<00:03:44.670> we<00:03:44.909> first<00:03:45.299> execute<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.170> this

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
gain what we first execute is this

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.440 
gain what we first execute is this
installation<00:03:47.359> sound<00:03:48.359> got<00:03:48.840> back<00:03:49.260> talk<00:03:49.909> you<00:03:50.909> in

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
installation sound got back talk you in

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.170 
installation sound got back talk you in
the<00:03:51.780> construction<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.859> game<00:03:53.219> when<00:03:53.730> we<00:03:53.879> first

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
the construction of game when we first

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.589 
the construction of game when we first
run<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.750> game<00:03:54.989> we<00:03:55.349> do<00:03:55.560> sound<00:03:55.920> dot<00:03:56.189> battle<00:03:56.909> loop

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
run the game we do sound dot battle loop

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.479 
run the game we do sound dot battle loop
this<00:03:58.049> means<00:03:58.349> that<00:03:58.590> we're<00:03:58.739> going<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.159> do<00:03:59.310> an

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
this means that we're going to do an

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.809 
this means that we're going to do an
infinite<00:03:59.969> loop<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.629> clip<00:04:01.049> back<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:02.609> is

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
infinite loop to the clip back this is

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.500 
infinite loop to the clip back this is
the<00:04:02.939> first<00:04:03.209> time<00:04:03.599> we<00:04:03.780> talk<00:04:04.049> about<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.859> class

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
the first time we talk about the class

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.839 
the first time we talk about the class
sound<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:07.439> it<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.709> when<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.040> class<00:04:08.280> sound<00:04:08.639> is

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
sound so it is when the class sound is

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.869 
sound so it is when the class sound is
loaded<00:04:09.389> this<00:04:10.079> instruction<00:04:10.920> could<00:04:11.159> take<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.519> bit

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
loaded this instruction could take a bit

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.360 
loaded this instruction could take a bit
because<00:04:12.269> it's<00:04:12.629> going<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:13.019> load<00:04:13.230> all<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.680> audio

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
because it's going to load all the audio

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.879 
because it's going to load all the audio
clips<00:04:14.430> but<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.540> good<00:04:15.750> place<00:04:16.079> because<00:04:16.530> the

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
clips but it's a good place because the

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.659 
clips but it's a good place because the
game<00:04:17.099> isn't<00:04:18.030> playing<00:04:18.329> yet<00:04:18.680> in<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.829> real<00:04:20.039> game<00:04:20.370> we

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
game isn't playing yet in a real game we

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.850 
game isn't playing yet in a real game we
could<00:04:20.880> put<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> pop-up<00:04:21.449> while<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.259> game<00:04:22.500> is

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
could put a pop-up while the game is

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.580 
could put a pop-up while the game is
being<00:04:23.099> loaded<00:04:24.050> when<00:04:25.050> this<00:04:25.289> finishes

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
being loaded when this finishes

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.980 
being loaded when this finishes
everything<00:04:26.550> has<00:04:26.729> been<00:04:26.970> loaded<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:27.780> we

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
everything has been loaded so we

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.140 
everything has been loaded so we
wouldn't<00:04:28.440> have<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.710> delay<00:04:29.099> when<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.400> for

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
wouldn't have a delay when the for

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.719 
wouldn't have a delay when the for
example<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.720> ball<00:04:30.960> bounces<00:04:31.710> because<00:04:32.550> of

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
example the ball bounces because of

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.659 
example the ball bounces because of
sound<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.539> ball<00:04:33.919> was<00:04:34.919> being<00:04:35.250> told<00:04:35.520> that

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
sound of the ball was being told that

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.570 
sound of the ball was being told that
this<00:04:35.880> isn't<00:04:36.630> going<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.020> happen

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
this isn't going to happen

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.580 
this isn't going to happen
sound<00:04:39.259> back<00:04:40.460> loop<00:04:41.460> starts<00:04:42.389> with<00:04:42.720> an<00:04:42.960> la

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
sound back loop starts with an la

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.250 
sound back loop starts with an la
nanananana<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:45.270> here<00:04:46.260> being<00:04:46.979> game<00:04:47.310> over

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
nanananana and here being game over

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.589 
nanananana and here being game over
which<00:04:49.260> is<00:04:49.470> when<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.830> game<00:04:50.099> finishes<00:04:50.789> the

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
which is when the game finishes the

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.219 
which is when the game finishes the
first<00:04:51.870> instruction<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:53.099> sound<00:04:53.460> back<00:04:53.940> stop<00:04:54.690> so

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
first instruction is sound back stop so

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.360 
first instruction is sound back stop so
that<00:04:55.560> lalala<00:04:56.340> lalala<00:04:57.180> stops<00:04:58.039> here<00:04:59.039> you<00:04:59.190> can

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
that lalala lalala stops here you can

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.610 
that lalala lalala stops here you can
see<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.789> the<00:04:59.940> second<00:05:00.300> instruction<00:05:00.750> is<00:05:01.289> going

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
see that the second instruction is going

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.909 
see that the second instruction is going
to<00:05:01.830> be<00:05:02.010> sound<00:05:02.460> game<00:05:03.120> over<00:05:03.510> dot<00:05:03.720> clay<00:05:04.229> which

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
to be sound game over dot clay which

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.980 
to be sound game over dot clay which
plays<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:06.740> game<00:05:07.740> over<00:05:08.130> buddy

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
plays the game over buddy

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.120 
plays the game over buddy
after<00:05:09.990> this<00:05:10.169> we<00:05:10.590> write<00:05:11.810> Papa<00:05:12.810> these<00:05:13.770> are<00:05:13.979> all

after this we write Papa these are all
the<00:05:14.280> modification<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.330> glass<00:05:15.630> game<00:05:16.560> let's

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
the modification of the glass game let's

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.920 
the modification of the glass game let's
take<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.370> look<00:05:17.699> at<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.419> glass<00:05:18.770> whoa<00:05:20.720> in<00:05:21.720> the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.249 
method move we have to set a sound board
or<00:05:27.539> play<00:05:27.900> but<00:05:28.380> only<00:05:28.650> when<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.280> ball<00:05:29.940> bounces

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
or play but only when the ball bounces

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.210 
or play but only when the ball bounces
when<00:05:31.259> this<00:05:31.889> happens<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.940> this<00:05:33.900> happens<00:05:34.220> and

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.430 
this happens we have to make the sound
I<00:05:38.130> could<00:05:38.699> write<00:05:39.270> sound<00:05:40.229> dot<00:05:40.590> ball<00:05:41.039> play<00:05:42.110> this<00:05:43.110> I

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
I could write sound dot ball play this I

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.370 
I could write sound dot ball play this I
could<00:05:44.130> write<00:05:44.159> it<00:05:44.520> here<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.590> here<00:05:46.590> and<00:05:46.800> here

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
could write it here and here and here

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.050 
could write it here and here and here
instead<00:05:49.380> of<00:05:49.590> instead<00:05:50.010> of<00:05:50.190> doing<00:05:50.490> this<00:05:50.700> I've

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
instead of instead of doing this I've

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.899 
instead of instead of doing this I've
created<00:05:51.630> a<00:05:52.370> boolean

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
created a boolean

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.980 
created a boolean
name<00:05:54.809> change<00:05:55.349> direction<00:05:56.069> which<00:05:56.939> I<00:05:57.089> said<00:05:57.389> to<00:05:57.689> -

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
name change direction which I said to -

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.739 
name change direction which I said to -
this<00:05:58.979> means<00:05:59.309> that<00:05:59.459> it<00:05:59.639> always<00:05:59.849> is<00:06:00.240> going<00:06:00.449> to

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:00.749 
this means that it always is going to

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:04.329 
this means that it always is going to
change<00:06:01.229> direction<00:06:01.499> if<00:06:02.099> it<00:06:02.819> bounces

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:04.339 
change direction if it bounces

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:09.919 
change direction if it bounces
this<00:06:05.339> is<00:06:05.580> executed<00:06:06.539> if<00:06:07.469> not<00:06:08.159> this<00:06:08.789> is<00:06:08.929> executed

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:09.929 
this is executed if not this is executed

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:15.109 
this is executed if not this is executed
and<00:06:10.520> so<00:06:11.520> on<00:06:11.729> the<00:06:12.330> last<00:06:12.779> else<00:06:13.639> means<00:06:14.639> that<00:06:14.939> it

00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:15.119 
and so on the last else means that it

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:17.779 
and so on the last else means that it
didn't<00:06:15.449> bounce<00:06:15.629> in<00:06:16.020> any<00:06:16.289> place<00:06:16.589> I<00:06:16.949> can<00:06:17.369> say

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789 
didn't bounce in any place I can say

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.779 
didn't bounce in any place I can say
that<00:06:18.119> it<00:06:18.719> didn't<00:06:19.199> change<00:06:19.259> direction<00:06:20.009> so<00:06:20.550> I

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
that it didn't change direction so I

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.139 
that it didn't change direction so I
think<00:06:21.270> I<00:06:21.869> said<00:06:22.349> ten<00:06:22.679> generation<00:06:23.459> to<00:06:23.879> false

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:24.149 
think I said ten generation to false

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:28.339 
think I said ten generation to false
here<00:06:25.020> I<00:06:25.289> do<00:06:25.379> an<00:06:25.919> if<00:06:26.159> if<00:06:26.849> I<00:06:27.149> change<00:06:27.479> direction<00:06:27.719> I

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
here I do an if if I change direction I

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.299 
here I do an if if I change direction I
execute<00:06:29.279> the<00:06:29.580> sound<00:06:29.939> I<00:06:30.740> did<00:06:31.740> this<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:32.129> make<00:06:32.249> it

00:06:32.299 --> 00:06:32.309 
execute the sound I did this to make it

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:35.029 
execute the sound I did this to make it
a<00:06:32.550> bit<00:06:32.729> more<00:06:32.939> complicated<00:06:33.409> because<00:06:34.409> I<00:06:34.769> could

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
a bit more complicated because I could

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.079 
a bit more complicated because I could
have<00:06:35.249> written<00:06:35.459> each<00:06:36.059> time<00:06:36.599> here<00:06:37.439> so<00:06:38.069> sound<00:06:38.819> of

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.089 
have written each time here so sound of

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:43.219 
have written each time here so sound of
ball<00:06:39.629> dog<00:06:40.019> play<00:06:40.439> here<00:06:40.919> here<00:06:41.879> I<00:06:42.240> didn't<00:06:42.990> change

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
ball dog play here here I didn't change

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:52.159 
ball dog play here here I didn't change
anything<00:06:43.559> in<00:06:43.889> racket<00:06:44.309> okay<00:06:44.969> let's<00:06:45.240> try<00:06:45.479> it<00:06:51.169> see

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
anything in racket okay let's try it see

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:55.429 
anything in racket okay let's try it see
is<00:06:52.409> family<00:06:52.889> bounces<00:06:53.459> it<00:06:53.669> makes<00:06:53.939> her<00:06:54.149> sound<00:06:54.439> now

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:55.439 
is family bounces it makes her sound now

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:58.549 
is family bounces it makes her sound now
we're<00:06:55.649> going<00:06:55.800> to<00:06:55.949> make<00:06:56.159> it<00:06:56.339> go<00:06:57.019> the<00:06:58.019> background

00:06:58.549 --> 00:06:58.559 
we're going to make it go the background

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:01.069 
we're going to make it go the background
music<00:06:58.800> stops<00:06:59.369> and<00:06:59.699> we<00:06:59.819> hear<00:07:00.059> the<00:07:00.269> game<00:07:00.659> over

music stops and we hear the game over

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:04.100 
music stops and we hear the game over
buddy<00:07:01.339> we<00:07:02.339> click<00:07:02.899> acept
