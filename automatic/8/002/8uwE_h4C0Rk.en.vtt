operating systems local network setup is
the<00:00:11.840> first<00:00:12.050> step<00:00:12.290> in<00:00:12.500> setting<00:00:12.650> up<00:00:12.889> any<00:00:13.130> IP

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
the first step in setting up any IP

the first step in setting up any IP
camera<00:00:13.849> for<00:00:14.059> use<00:00:14.240> let's<00:00:15.200> get<00:00:15.410> started<00:00:18.400> step

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
camera for use let's get started step

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.159 
camera for use let's get started step
one<00:00:19.640> is<00:00:19.759> to<00:00:19.909> physically<00:00:20.329> connect<00:00:20.749> your<00:00:20.929> camera

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
one is to physically connect your camera

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.380 
one is to physically connect your camera
to<00:00:21.380> your<00:00:21.589> network<00:00:21.919> if<00:00:22.189> you're<00:00:22.579> using<00:00:22.759> a<00:00:23.089> Power

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
to your network if you're using a Power

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.210 
to your network if you're using a Power
over<00:00:23.509> Ethernet<00:00:23.720> compatible<00:00:24.560> camera<00:00:24.919> like

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
over Ethernet compatible camera like

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.579 
over Ethernet compatible camera like
this<00:00:25.429> one<00:00:25.669> you<00:00:26.239> will<00:00:26.329> simply<00:00:26.539> run<00:00:26.869> a<00:00:26.929> cat5

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:27.589 
this one you will simply run a cat5

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.009 
this one you will simply run a cat5
cable<00:00:28.189> from<00:00:28.729> your<00:00:28.909> camera<00:00:29.179> to<00:00:29.509> your<00:00:29.630> POS

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
cable from your camera to your POS

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.440 
cable from your camera to your POS
switch<00:00:30.380> this<00:00:31.189> will<00:00:31.369> provide<00:00:31.669> both<00:00:31.999> network

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
switch this will provide both network

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.720 
switch this will provide both network
connectivity<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.320> power<00:00:33.649> to<00:00:33.949> your<00:00:34.039> camera<00:00:34.460> if

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
connectivity and power to your camera if

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.400 
connectivity and power to your camera if
you're<00:00:35.239> not<00:00:35.420> using<00:00:35.629> a<00:00:35.780> power<00:00:35.960> over<00:00:36.260> ethernet

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
you're not using a power over ethernet

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.680 
you're not using a power over ethernet
camera<00:00:37.370> then<00:00:37.850> you'll<00:00:37.969> still<00:00:38.269> connect<00:00:38.570> your

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
camera then you'll still connect your

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.990 
camera then you'll still connect your
camera<00:00:38.929> to<00:00:39.170> a<00:00:39.350> switch<00:00:39.739> or<00:00:39.949> router<00:00:40.070> typically

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
camera to a switch or router typically

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.360 
camera to a switch or router typically
using<00:00:41.269> an<00:00:41.359> Ethernet<00:00:41.480> cable<00:00:42.010> but<00:00:43.010> you'll<00:00:43.160> also

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
using an Ethernet cable but you'll also

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.790 
using an Ethernet cable but you'll also
use<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.850> DC<00:00:44.539> power<00:00:44.750> supply<00:00:45.260> that<00:00:45.649> was

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
use the DC power supply that was

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.479 
use the DC power supply that was
included<00:00:46.190> with<00:00:46.399> your<00:00:46.489> camera<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.239> power<00:00:47.420> it

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.919 

that'll<00:00:52.489> simply<00:00:52.789> plug<00:00:53.030> into<00:00:53.239> a<00:00:53.449> standard<00:00:53.870> wall

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
that'll simply plug into a standard wall

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.239 
that'll simply plug into a standard wall
outlet

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.649 

once<00:00:58.249> your<00:00:58.399> camera<00:00:58.730> is<00:00:58.819> physically<00:00:59.239> connected

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
once your camera is physically connected

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.119 
once your camera is physically connected
to<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.809> network<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.440> next<00:01:00.710> step<00:01:00.859> is<00:01:01.010> to

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
to the network the next step is to

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.799 
to the network the next step is to
locate<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.550> IP<00:01:01.760> address<00:01:02.269> that<00:01:02.300> was<00:01:02.539> assigned

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
locate the IP address that was assigned

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.929 
locate the IP address that was assigned
to<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.109> camera<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:03.949> that<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.190> can<00:01:04.309> access<00:01:04.729> it

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
to the camera so that you can access it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.149 
to the camera so that you can access it
from<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.360> client<00:01:05.720> application<00:01:06.350> such<00:01:06.799> as<00:01:06.829> a<00:01:06.979> web
