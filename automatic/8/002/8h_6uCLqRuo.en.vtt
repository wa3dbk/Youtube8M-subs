00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.230
 hi Guys 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.629
 Today there is a new video namely 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.300
 my eaten video it is today 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.480
 Sweets and acid vegan again 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.340
 sweets partly without sugar 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.650
 partly with garden thick juice but me 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.510
 believe everything without white even 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.850
 cane sugar and so on so i believe 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.950
 if then only agave thick juice in it 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.400
 and yes I'll show you now 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.629
 short 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.250
 i got pretty great from 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.680
 govinda discovered and that was me 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.510
 Winner chocolates very much 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.770
 because they are always so natural 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.810
 So I'm the ingredients too 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.970
 really all completely natural and 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.090
 sometimes d'or sugar in it knows in 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.230
 In this case it was not a cane sugar we 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.030
 have a very clear in here 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.239
 content list respectively 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.050
 ingredient list 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.910
 this is sort of like a bullet 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.620
 to be made of dates so that's how it is 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.440
 the sweetener substance I say now there 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.939
 in it with espresso taste and 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.590
 they were really really good I like 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.180
 this taste of coffee and 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.700
 I think that's a very good chocolate 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.680
 combo and just as an example I want 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.510
 briefly introduce this list of ingredients 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.690
 here are other almonds 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.340
 coconut butter cocoa powder coffee powder 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.170
 cocoa beans cinnamon and vanilla in there then 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.090
 You do not even see sugar at all 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.440
 the only thing that's cute all over here 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.060
 Dates and the things were real 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.979
 damn sweet then there is one here 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.810
 chocolate bar I suppose he still had 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.360
 also tasted pretty delicious and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.700
 Although he is from life chocolate and the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.460
 in my wg hamburgs in it is such a 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.170
 latch with lemon whiteboard does not ask 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.860
 what this building is i have one 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.090
 Girlfriend that I know exactly 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.409
 Unfortunately, do not tell you now 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.060
 maybe it 'll hit me down in one 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.280
 but the comments more accurate 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.009
 and here I am also very good here 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.960
 even no cane sugar or 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.789
 otherwise any sugar in there are 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.049
 easy again that the sweetening substance 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.909
 the packs are not quite there anymore 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.130
 perhaps she recognizes one 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:06.280
 from you that is from love talk such 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.610
 round little so the hot love 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.620
 rocks so velden and are there too 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.989
 somehow with mouth will be with dates 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 and sweetened with coconut blossoms sugar too 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.340
 always a little bit with cocoa and this 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.900
 super lesson well that's just completely 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.220
 small under good for my nibble 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.350
 I'm sure that most of you 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.870
 already know this love talk chocolate 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:32.500
 that is here again and exactly from 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:36.170
 the same brand are these love rocks 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.930
 Another product here once the role 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.900
 As a rule, I have three rules here 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.069
 of you i like a lot and year 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.650
 I really like the brand 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.630
 all of this pipe at too everything 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.760
 again without sugar that's all almost 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.019
 on river and dachshund basis and then 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.160
 refined with different 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.350
 so here is for example 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.420
 cocaine in it for example apples too 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.880
 take and that is cacau 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.460
 and yes, I'll believe it someday 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.380
 biting berry with lemon or 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.960
 and they are very delicious and also 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.210
 in the direction of protein and no idea what 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.340
 and now just important that the 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.250
 chocolate without white refined 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.190
 have sugar and since the so rich 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.900
 they are usually only one of them 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.820
 Half the pack I would have accepted it 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.770
 which I do quite well as well 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.230
 what sweet or 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.600
 very refreshing is the coconut water 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.370
 so coconut water drains the water 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.540
 Green coco you can see that here too 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.300
 the picture a bit 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.900
 and that's what I think, that's me too 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.180
 think there is energy easy and many 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.130
 but you do not know that 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.720
 So it came a bit in fashion 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.520
 this coconut water but I mean it 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.170
 is already for eternal years 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.450
 but not from us but from 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.910
 the people the halt this criticism is it 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.770
 very always available and if I have 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.480
 I was not mistaken now even that 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:01.210
 coconut water as a kind of replacement for blood 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.010
 used because it electrolytes so much 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.350
 contains and it really became partial 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.610
 then administered intravenously or 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.990
 I do not know if they are still done 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.460
 So I'll have that somewhere 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.080
 I have nothing now 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.450
 read more about it but that 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.100
 I had just bought domini 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.410
 usually I always come from that 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.910
 a tour and then I drink that as 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.410
 on the way so I hope so 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.510
 whenever I'm in town I've 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.060
 Never had such a sesame 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.860
 rule this season rule it finds 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.000
 pity sesam sprinkmann me right 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.050
 good and I am also this taste 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.210
 of roasted sesame and this sweet 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.800
 In addition, I find that really delicious 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.630
 problem here is just the example 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.310
 second and third already put glucose 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.140
 and cane sugar that means the 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.660
 Share relatively rover as soon as you have that 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.700
 you do not know a list of ingredients should you 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.140
 always interpret this way and also 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.770
 that's how it's mean , too 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.360
 that she is the leading ingredient 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.740
 So here in the case for example sesame 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.479
 is main in this product 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.180
 so the rule is simple 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.660
 for the most part sesame and last 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:07.160
 For example, Stelle is cane sugar 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.960
 that's 32 cane sugar museum to yesterday 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.259
 so third is the little one 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.750
 share of sugar when I take in 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:16.280
 carbohydrates look here 47 grams 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.139
 carbohydrates to 100 grams 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.819
 and there is already the most part 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.500
 from the sugar against which is in there 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.569
 I also terribly tasty 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.880
 Product is maroni sweetmeats 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.050
 I totally hated maronis in the past 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.270
 I was totally disgusting 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.490
 my mum has always been on the market 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.500
 Eaten earlier so these chestnuts man 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.080
 you have to do something about it then 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.520
 eat and i just found that i found 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.620
 just not tasty so taste it now 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.659
 it was intended to eg me as soup 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.729
 linden so far, I just think it 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.380
 Dream tastes so delicious and then have 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.300
 I only maroni sweetmeat of winners 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.639
 and here are also the ingredients 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.310
 kept simple and two chestnuts 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.590
 with coconut oil dates is foreseeable 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.419
 gave thick juice and cinnamon in it and mine 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.789
 last idea for you so to speak 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.139
 the last 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.490
 It's a buy recommendation because it's real 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.380
 is good and you may know that 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.960
 already eaten from the last video that 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.000
 This bonus is chocolate without sugar 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.740
 namely only with exalead and crumbly 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.530
 Grad down everything is in it and me 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.060
 I did not stop until it was ok 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.120
 That's an alternative to chocolate 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.650
 is and i want to be really good and so on 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.159
 a bit tense it tastes good 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.169
 bit like 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.969
 So it's just like peanut 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.240
 is not in there but the soy more 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:27.979
 So beware allergy in those 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.469
 small amounts but it is okay I think 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.860
 and yes as I said so based on 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.240
 xylitol that's old by 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.830
 the occupation medium must only 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.930
 you should not take more than one 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.530
 eat two girls because the power 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.479
 flatulence 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.979
 that was my eaten video for you 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.430
 and I hope I liked it now 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:46.409
 Do you have any inspiration for sweets without 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.759
 sugar and then if you want to have 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:49.740
