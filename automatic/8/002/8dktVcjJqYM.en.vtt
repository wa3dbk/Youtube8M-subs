oh<00:00:30.070> you<00:00:31.070> put<00:00:31.669> your<00:00:32.140> pattern<00:00:33.579> which<00:00:34.579> we're

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
oh you put your pattern which we're

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.430 
oh you put your pattern which we're
going<00:00:35.090> to<00:00:35.149> use<00:00:35.300> construction<00:00:35.690> paper<00:00:35.900> is<00:00:36.260> our

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
going to use construction paper is our

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.030 
going to use construction paper is our
patterns<00:00:36.940> blocking<00:00:37.940> is<00:00:38.180> how<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:38.989> put<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.739> on

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
patterns blocking is how you put it on

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.189 
patterns blocking is how you put it on
the<00:00:40.220> wind<00:00:40.430> block<00:00:40.670> this<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.600> important<00:00:42.110> because

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
the wind block this is important because

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.500 
the wind block this is important because
this<00:00:42.710> is<00:00:42.829> what<00:00:43.010> you're<00:00:43.129> going<00:00:43.339> to<00:00:43.489> follow<00:00:43.760> this

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
this is what you're going to follow this

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.200 
this is what you're going to follow this
is<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:45.079> guideline<00:00:45.530> this<00:00:46.370> is<00:00:46.579> going<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:46.909> be<00:00:47.059> our

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
is a guideline this is going to be our

00:00:47.210 --> 00:01:35.260 
is a guideline this is going to be our
pattern<00:00:47.720> normally<00:00:48.620> your<00:00:48.829> pattern

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.630 

and<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:37.229> curve<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.010> on<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> curved

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
and this curve this is on a curved

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.109 
and this curve this is on a curved
surface<00:01:39.260> so<00:01:40.260> it's<00:01:41.100> not<00:01:41.370> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.970> exactly

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
surface so it's not going to be exactly

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.240 
surface so it's not going to be exactly
perfect<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:43.560> want<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.830> use<00:01:44.070> your

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
perfect and then you want to use your

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.210 
perfect and then you want to use your
ball<00:01:44.490> pins<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:45.900> pin<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.170> down<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.070> not

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
ball pins to pin it down so it's not

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.740 
ball pins to pin it down so it's not
going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.550> move<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.970> don't<00:01:48.150> want<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.479> block

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
going to move you don't want to block

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.080 
going to move you don't want to block
this<00:01:49.020> yet<00:01:49.410> because<00:01:50.040> you're<00:01:50.220> constructing<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
this yet because you're constructing the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:59.930
