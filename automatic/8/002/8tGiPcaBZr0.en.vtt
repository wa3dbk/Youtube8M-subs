00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 in the championship of Russia on parachute 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.740
 sport in the column tragically died alone 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.000
 of the participants 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.309
 Andrew Vendin is one of the strongest 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.179
 athletes of the country decided to win 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.280
 take a chance 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.590
 our calculations are the first in history 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.870
 case of death of the participant in the competition 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.250
 by the so-called letter one of the most 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.880
 extreme disciplines in parachute 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.710
 sport 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.570
 it is not enough for her to jump 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.350
 overcome complex tricks in seconds before 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.369
 landings 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.560
 Shushan Minasyan More Tragedy 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.359
 occurred during the 3 jump Andrei 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.610
 vundin lost control on 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.570
 the most dangerous part of the trajectory and on 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.410
 full speed hit him 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 [music] 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.670
 jump athletes from a height of one and a half 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.830
 thousand meters the powder opens immediately 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.140
 under the board and while hover perform the most 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.330
 important work is calculated as captures 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.550
 every action to the right place on 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.780
 the right height to go to the most dangerous 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.000
 maneuver at an altitude of 300 meters from the ground 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.580
 sharp turn for maximum dialing 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.890
 speeds up to 150 kilometers per hour after 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.780
 why the rapid flight to the ground in this 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.940
 The main thing is to have time to bring the body into 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.490
 horizontal position to fall into narrow 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.280
 the gate and fly by the 70 liter corridor 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.830
 it is not given to everyone to have nerves of steel 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.979
 keen eye and overcome your fear 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.170
 in front of the earth in front of the space which 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.479
 under you are and it is very small already 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.310
 remains to solve problems dome 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.320
 paratroop piloting is considered 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.690
 one of the most dangerous disciplines where 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.729
 Only experienced athletes they wonder 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.740
 called pilots deal with high 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.780
 speeds therefore any error in the sky 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.660
 on the ground turns at least 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.520
 trails I broke my leg in america go 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.720
 on the tantra gathering operations do 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.369
 bolts were stuck in the spokes death 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.170
 29-year-old Andrei velvet first case 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.179
 in the Russian bathing piloting 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.160
 the athlete made a mistake in the calculations and turned out 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.770
 on forbidden for dangerous reversal 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.929
 low altitude he could go the distance and 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.569
 flee on preferred to fight to the end 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:06.640
 it seems to me that he saw it that he 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:08.770
 is mistaken and instead of showing 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.750
 Well, that is, the result is already zero 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.150
 let's say that is, he clearly did not get the gate 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.900
 he was on his own in the spirit of an athlete 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.400
 blood and he wanted whatever it was 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.840
 show the highest possible result 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.760
 Andrei was in the top ten 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.340
 the skydiver to lie strong to his account 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.170
 one and a half thousand jumps pilots with all 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.670
 countries confessed in the cabin for the right 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.890
 get to the world championship 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.110
 Andrew was among the leaders after 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.030
 tragedy championship continued in memory of 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.400
 dead comrade leaned out 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.720
 In fact, the choice of each of us but I think 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.550
 that Andrei would like to have a good start
