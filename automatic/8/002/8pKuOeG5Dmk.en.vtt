00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.140
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.969
 gosplan is the second part of the answer from 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.580
 developers subscribe to the channel 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.309
 put the likes to the author to please everyone 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.959
 successful viewing 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.820
 question how the process will be reflected in the game 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.320
 technology 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.520
 the answer is to access the best 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.410
 machines and equipment 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 will need to gain experience on technology 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.730
 lower level get your 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.740
 disposal of the most modern machines with 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 first day I can not get more 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.870
 in detail the topic of progress will be reasonable 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.059
 later in a separate article 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.949
 question how do you support mods fortress 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.989
 response engine allows you to implement 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.879
 such a mechanic well, the possibility of 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.550
 not earlier than the developer beats in 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.170
 full security the question is whether 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.159
 be considered portrayed combat statistics 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.620
 players 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.079
 the answer in the game will be a block of statistics more 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.030
 in detail about him, we will tell later now 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.460
 This item is under construction. 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.069
 question how do you want what layer will be on 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.839
 pvp card number answer 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:01.559
 determined by developers to pick 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.269
 player numbers 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.250
 who created a comfortable gaming 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.620
 environment and would not create excessive 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.590
 loads can only communicate something with 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.470
 you more than 10 question what will be 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.330
 environmental degradability response 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.820
 a huge number of others Verka 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.070
 objects will be destructible for example at home 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.170
 even fireplaces and will be constantly reliable 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.450
 shelters will eventually collapse 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.560
 hits by tank suspension will break 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.840
 trees and bushes 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 it is more than enough for development 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.350
 taxi driver component in the game out 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.690
 destroy fundamentally objects 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.300
 uncover korolev knock out pit 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.550
 it will be impossible the question whether the machine can 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.040
 get stuck in a fight for example tied up in the sand 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.870
 answer for easy game control 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.510
 such opportunities will be excluded 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.460
 however it does not cancel the place hits 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.920
 where the equipment will not be able to get out 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.140
 its tth for example hitting 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.550
 ravine question what will happen 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.860
 fall technique 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.020
 drop height response 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.510
 technicians will obey different 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.220
 severity damage question how will 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.800
 affect tank speed 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.690
 terrain response soil type will be 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.610
 determine the speed of the machine 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.160
 Of course a lot will depend on the most 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.970
 technology models question how will change 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.850
 eat 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.890
 not in the course of the battle answer besides destruction 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.990
 made by the players themselves in the game will be 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.180
 dynamic environment that is 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.100
 certain moment and match on the map 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.320
 certain events may occur 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.780
 affect which player is not able 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.400
 for example a bridge might break down 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.890
 air attack or something happens 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.840
 similar however these elements 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.260
 makes the combat mechanics and tactics of the game 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.850
 significant changes guys on this 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.660
 everything 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.080
 subscribing to my channel you can
