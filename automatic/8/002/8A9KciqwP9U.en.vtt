underground

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:29.960 

via<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.930> team<00:01:22.850> back<00:01:23.850> miss<00:01:26.840> Maud<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.760> buried<00:01:29.760> in

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
via the team back miss Maud is buried in

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:43.460 
via the team back miss Maud is buried in
the<00:01:30.150> ground<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.920> module<00:01:42.260> this<00:01:43.260> would<00:01:43.440> be

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the ground the module this would be

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.790 
the ground the module this would be
buried<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.280> ground<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.360> surface

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
buried in the ground up to that surface

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.380 
buried in the ground up to that surface
and<00:01:46.800> that<00:01:47.040> would<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.790> barrel<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.270> you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and that would be the barrel if you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:34.880 
and that would be the barrel if you
mount<00:01:48.570> them

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:52.470 

so<00:02:35.890> if<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.310> got<00:02:37.240> out<00:02:37.420> my<00:02:37.570> top<00:02:37.870> here<00:02:51.480> barrel

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
so if you got out my top here barrel

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.460 
so if you got out my top here barrel
going<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:54.340> then<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.700> 90<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:58.350> kill<00:02:59.350> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
going this and then the 90 and kill the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.760 
going this and then the 90 and kill the
Japanese<00:02:59.950> embankment<00:03:00.850> refer<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.480> case<00:03:02.350> vendor

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
Japanese embankment refer in case vendor

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.530 
Japanese embankment refer in case vendor
case<00:03:03.060> something<00:03:04.060> like<00:03:04.210> that<00:03:04.680> but<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:07.180> United

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
case something like that but the United

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.180 
case something like that but the United
States<00:03:07.720> built<00:03:08.110> six<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.770> these<00:03:08.890> there<00:03:09.580> enough

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
States built six of these there enough

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.780 
States built six of these there enough
prototypes<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:13.800> then<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:15.100> nuclear<00:03:15.430> weapons

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
prototypes and then the nuclear weapons

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.880 
prototypes and then the nuclear weapons
and<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:18.430> project<00:03:18.940> was<00:03:19.120> abandoned<00:03:19.780> at<00:03:19.900> five

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
and this project was abandoned at five

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:46.110 
and this project was abandoned at five
of<00:03:21.100> them<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.460> kept<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:43.050> composer<00:03:45.120> this

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
of them and kept this composer this

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.930 
of them and kept this composer this
turns<00:03:47.040> like<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.190> far<00:03:48.430> too<00:03:48.460> much<00:03:50.550> this<00:03:51.550> is<00:03:51.730> I

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
turns like it far too much this is I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:01.510 
turns like it far too much this is I
guess<00:03:52.330> 70<00:03:52.960> 80<00:03:53.350> 75<00:03:54.280> years<00:03:55.030> old<00:03:55.210> like<00:03:55.870> that

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.740 

little<00:04:02.520> David<00:04:02.880> mortar<00:04:03.270> is<00:04:03.570> what<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:03.960> is<00:04:04.170> okay
