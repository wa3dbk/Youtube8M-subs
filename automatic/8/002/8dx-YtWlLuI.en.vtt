00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:03.600
 25% and in the dicos 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.660
 5 7% just about three hours this summer 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.420
 to be able to write again for a year 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.309
 in this part it is especially in the reflections of substance that the 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.099
 more culture 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.850
 so we will watch it 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.199
 how can we read it 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.539
 the best delays that will be present in the scene where we have a 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.159
 lighting 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.789
 outer 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.930
 the light of day is the sun and returnac 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 here a ramp of light that 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.360
 it's a color temperature of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.190
 about 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.120
 Rebalancing 5000 and then here we have an artificial light the victim 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 size 4 thousand degrees Kelvin 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.870
 so we have already watched and I have not known him for a long time 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 which is so that the exposure and the camera 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.730
 e we will see in the dico 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.139
 three morning settings 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:08.289
 the linear lorraine arte p the camera so blown a calculated bay 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.170
 different exhibitions 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.990
 peuget here chosen and the camera exposure do is quite simple if you 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.030
 you are using a camera 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.990
 so you have 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.290
 the sensitivity of the film in ten days 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.450
 the aperture of the lens and then the shutter speed so the speed 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.540
 shutter 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.340
 and she the diaphragm will be adjusted% indirectly in maya before we explore 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.770
 it's finally a diploma 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.870
 the sensitivity parameter of the film so for the moment net for his envy 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.090
 zoned 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.090
 we can follow him 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.740
 increase a little 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.460
 we're going to give back a little bit I'm fine 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.430
 that's another lighting 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.430
 it's with multiple somehow a little more brightness 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.430
 this is so very handy to the change for the sensitivity of the film 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.860
 to lighten the image if needed the sailcloth disseminated several orders very 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.860
 meanly 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.550
 for this it is set to refresh a little near every ten 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.809
 days in India 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.469
 so that's the part of the same coin 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.430
 as for the city also means that we have the possibility in chief of 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.799
 go out vote directly the images have more than eight Serbian 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.799
 that is, the coded 32-bit years 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.139
 we will still be able to touch him in fact 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.379
 the exposure of our image in photoshop 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.349
 at the time when the future now in the best 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.289
 legacy and direct control 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.769
 diddy science lighting 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.209
 so we have the best 0% and 6% by default so that solar lighting 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.239
 years 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.919
 that's what makes next in maya 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.499
 so I created materials that annuities 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:06.949
 a spam 6% the ramps and then as for this lighting there 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.430
 and so genesis is coded in the materials saying that everyone 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.459
 a better e corresponding 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.459
 station station by default we still have good 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.319
 who is the pastor for them each of the lights that by default is timely 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.009
 and we can see the edit them 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.769
 interactively directly 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.689
 during rendering 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.039
 we will do it 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.729
 break will cool off 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:38.519
 a little faster
