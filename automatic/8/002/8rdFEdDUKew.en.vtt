either side right here and this is the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
arms will hit the canopy

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.070 
arms will hit the canopy
therefore<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.890> pouch<00:01:08.670> has<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.659> get<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> cut

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
therefore this pouch has to get a cut

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.550 
therefore this pouch has to get a cut
out<00:01:10.229> right<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.510> once<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.900> done<00:01:13.140> the
