00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.650
 Well then 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.620
 For example it did not seem entirely new 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:12.799
 We take off damage measures product and repel dot man ah 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.880
 To develop this name is right under my wing Yama's Yasuda 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.090
 Ye 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.500
 It is a commodity, for example, the net until now 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.240
 Scorpio 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.920
 Gel 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.810
 These are products that are physically shaped so that birds do not enter 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.950
 Among them are still damage 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:36.590
 Because I am talking to you in various places 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:41.780
 Since the say the bird is the why everyday life 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:48.019
 As you make this hypothesis and still rely on your eyes so the part is very large 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:50.190
 Naturally, it is not effective early if people who rely on their eyes and make a living make secret products 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.930
 A by say whether 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.120
 About half a year from that concept 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.040
 various 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.780
 While making form of oneself 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.059
 These are the products we have reached hey 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.950
 I we have introduced what say hen comparison lens 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:12.979
 Why does not fit is this focus 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:18.280
 Of course. The pattern itself of ten ten is difficult to narrow the very focus say 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:23.409
 There is such a thing, but the information that the right eye information and the left eye vote come in is different 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:28.750
 Such a thing keeps the sense of distance that is also illusion with the military law 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:34.110
 Birds are said to have an alternative 56 times the eyesight of human output 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.930
 Of course if that such a thing is installing a these things where flying 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.060
 Extremely uncomfortable 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.660
 For example , there are cd and eyeballs , but it's quite different from what they say 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.360
 but 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.970
 As you can see if you look 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:55.220
 Basically, we do not have a win and not get no shop is much 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:59.659
 Now in reality I 'm selling this here and it will be a little over three years 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:03.079
 Speaking in Ota Gassan-san, it's Tanaka in a power company's storehouse 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.240
 It's a steel tower It 's a communication company from that 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.310
 Although Thank 3-year-old car giant 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.790
 I am introduced to the base station of that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:18.239
 Maintenance management to be developed in the future 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.799
 A cushion attached to the end of a bridge like this is that pigeon 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:25.140
 You or rusted in Hun 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:27.319
 Although we are in Fu I say nothing now for the sake of those things Katsuya to our dot Man 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:35.420
 I say I think we lock leaves come out 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:36.650
 This is basically a product based on 1223 meters, so in the future this is 3 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.540
 Kg 5 km 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.140
 Trade sales of food measures 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.969
 By all means it can to naturally put out ideas 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.969
