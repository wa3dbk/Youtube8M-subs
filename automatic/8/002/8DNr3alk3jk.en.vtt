 amy ban - 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.090
 together 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.079
 we also cultivate all the most interesting varieties of the campaign 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.069
 the one that today is considered to the reggina 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.409
 of enology campanula falanghina 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.140
 it is not appealing with a nice name 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.060
 from the wine or just as intriguing the falanghina in recent years 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.489
 it has become the symbol valley 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:32.129
 beautiful their already field spreading sig. of territories probably like 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.350
 the emblem 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.440
 of the new year new course of the viticulture of the territory 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.590
 the falanghina stands out as the falanghina beneventano falanghina of the Phlegraean fields 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.500
 that of the Phlegraean fields is naturally cultivated almost exclusively 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.200
 in the area near pozzuoli 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.350
 the Falanghina beneventano to the far more famous one 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.720
 and the cultivated mass one 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.390
 for a long time they are distinguished for or above all for the form of the ciro that in the case 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.550
 of the falanghina beneventano 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.240
 it's a berry 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.860
 olive a basin in lithic 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.130
 while reading in the case of the falanghina of the flegrei fields the acer caroppo 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.920
 the characteristics of the wine are also different but I concentrated more on 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.720
 the characteristics of Beneventana flour in how many 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.490
 best known 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.490
 the bunch is quite large as we can see 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 parity therefore very productive vigorous 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.430
 it also has a shape usually with a wing 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.370
 so I have an asymmetric regular pyramid-shaped mail 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.539
 much I would say tendentially productive 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.140
 this is another reason why I know if it is very widespread 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.420
 the pigtail 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.430
 can pass from banality and therefore afloat 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.790
 from being a real white wine to being able to become a really yellow wine yes 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.720
 treated correctly 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.770
 it is not true that the simple falanghina lumino is not true that the product 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.050
 has a place to last and varda debut is consumed at 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.870
 in the vintage year, but it is true that we are winemakers 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.659
 oenologists to make it so the falanghina is left and respected 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.940
 in its development in its care of nothing very delicate 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.370
 the wheelbase with date during the quoto vinification will really give 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.040
 of the very great satisfaction bisazza - they are relative to being able to 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.179
 be sparkling 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:41.799
 there. produced differently so it targets on eclecticism but above all towards 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.189
 its characteristics 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.240
 that kings in wine are recognizable 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.329
 these fruits almost 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.969
 vegetables the dried eeeh fruits characterize this wine and make it 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:54.930
 there really is one 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.419
 an example of 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.579
 the liquids brioss at lido in bocca because it has a city that is always alive el 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.819
 with the alcoholic gradations not excessive 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.509
 the falanghina is truly one of the grape variety still to be discovered 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:15.509
 we discovered faith as it is rightly also enjoying great success 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:16.490
 on the market 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.780
 but the vine is really 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.080
 to know to be able to manage it and then obtain 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.970
 the best 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.460
 from ex otherwise the risk of being very trivial is the variety of Campania 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.119
 in general they are generous generous like 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:33.050
 for the fertile countryside 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.720
 the countryside was defined as Romans 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.300
 therefore great care in the vineyard great care to obtain personal ddd 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.369
