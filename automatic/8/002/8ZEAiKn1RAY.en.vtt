device in terms of opening apps in it

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.810 
device in terms of opening apps in it
and<00:00:10.679> which<00:00:10.920> one<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.190> better<00:00:11.400> when<00:00:11.639> we<00:00:11.790> are

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
and which one is better when we are

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.390 
and which one is better when we are
trying<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.269> open<00:00:12.389> up<00:00:12.690> multiple<00:00:13.410> apps<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:14.160> these

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
trying to open up multiple apps on these

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.700 
trying to open up multiple apps on these
devices<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.179> guys<00:00:15.870> before<00:00:16.080> starting<00:00:16.590> this

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
devices so guys before starting this

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.290 
devices so guys before starting this
comparison<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.609> want<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.880> point<00:00:18.029> out<00:00:18.240> that

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
comparison I just want to point out that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.120 
comparison I just want to point out that
these<00:00:18.750> devices<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.320> connected<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> same

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
these devices are connected to the same

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.890 
these devices are connected to the same
Wi-Fi<00:00:20.400> because<00:00:20.820> some<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> apps<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.660> we

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
Wi-Fi because some of the apps that we

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.320 
Wi-Fi because some of the apps that we
use<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.170> daily<00:00:22.320> basis<00:00:22.769> like<00:00:23.060> Facebook<00:00:24.060> Twitter

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
use on daily basis like Facebook Twitter

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.420 
use on daily basis like Facebook Twitter
and<00:00:24.779> many<00:00:24.930> more<00:00:25.170> connected<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> Wi-Fi<00:00:25.890> and

and many more connected to Wi-Fi and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.800 
and many more connected to Wi-Fi and
it's<00:00:26.550> why<00:00:26.730> don't<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:26.970> connect<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.359> devices

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
it's why don't you connect these devices

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.779 
it's why don't you connect these devices
with<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> same<00:00:28.080> Wi-Fi<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:29.310> get<00:00:29.490> accurate

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
with the same Wi-Fi to get accurate

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.700 
with the same Wi-Fi to get accurate
result<00:00:30.480> when<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:30.929> trying<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.289> open<00:00:31.560> apps

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
result when we are trying to open apps

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.220 
result when we are trying to open apps
on<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.309> devices<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.840> people<00:00:34.020> are

background of these devices and both of
them<00:01:01.770> are<00:01:01.949> ready<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.520> into<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.719> opening

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
them are ready to get into this opening

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.190 
them are ready to get into this opening
app<00:01:04.589> speed<00:01:05.430> comparison<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.510> first<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.869> all<00:01:06.990> we

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
app speed comparison so first of all we

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.690 
app speed comparison so first of all we
are<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> launch<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.920> phone<00:01:08.130> keypad<00:01:08.490> on

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
are going to launch a phone keypad on

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.590 
are going to launch a phone keypad on
these<00:01:08.880> devices<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.060> has<00:01:12.240> launched<00:01:12.450> at

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
these devices so this has launched at

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.330 
these devices so this has launched at
the<00:01:12.630> same<00:01:12.900> time<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.530> devices<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the same time on these devices there is

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.850 
the same time on these devices there is
no<00:01:14.490> time<00:01:14.700> difference<00:01:14.960> now<00:01:15.960> let's<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.770> an

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
no time difference now let's go for an

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.810 
no time difference now let's go for an
email<00:01:17.070> app<00:01:18.680> launch<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> same<00:01:20.250> time<00:01:20.520> there

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
email app launch at the same time there

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.630 
email app launch at the same time there
is<00:01:20.970> no<00:01:21.119> time<00:01:21.330> difference<00:01:21.890> now<00:01:22.890> let's<00:01:23.220> go<00:01:23.430> for

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
is no time difference now let's go for

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.590 
is no time difference now let's go for
Facebook<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.579> interface<00:01:30.030> seems<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> be

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
Facebook so the interface seems to be

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600 
Facebook so the interface seems to be
more<00:01:30.810> smooth<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.680> iPhone<00:01:32.130> 6<00:01:32.430> in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
more smooth on the iPhone 6 in

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.240 
more smooth on the iPhone 6 in
comparison<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> 6<00:01:33.570> plus<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:34.170> opening<00:01:35.070> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
comparison to the 6 plus in opening this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.700 
comparison to the 6 plus in opening this
app<00:01:36.770> well<00:01:37.770> let's<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.310> Google+<00:01:39.710> launched

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
app well let's go for Google+ launched

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.260 
app well let's go for Google+ launched
at<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> same<00:01:41.250> time<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:44.060> proceedings<00:01:45.060> are

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
at the same time and proceedings are

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.060 
at the same time and proceedings are
also<00:01:45.600> similar<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.350> these<00:01:46.619> devices<00:01:48.799> now<00:01:49.799> let's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
also similar on these devices now let's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.560 
also similar on these devices now let's
go<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.490> tap<00:01:50.729> 2

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.600 

so<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.440> has<00:01:57.650> launched<00:01:58.010> little<00:01:58.280> bit<00:01:58.400> quicker

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
so this has launched little bit quicker

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.070 
so this has launched little bit quicker

Twitter launch at the same time

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.810 
Twitter launch at the same time
proceedings<00:02:29.709> seems<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.890> be<00:02:31.010> similar<00:02:31.370> on<00:02:31.400> both

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
proceedings seems to be similar on both

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.699 
proceedings seems to be similar on both
of<00:02:32.000> them<00:02:35.740> now<00:02:36.740> let's<00:02:37.010> launch<00:02:37.280> Safari<00:02:38.709> launch

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
of them now let's launch Safari launch

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.150 
of them now let's launch Safari launch
at<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.010> same<00:02:40.340> time<00:02:41.590> there<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:42.620> no<00:02:42.920> time

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
at the same time there is no time

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.800 
at the same time there is no time
difference<00:02:44.860> now<00:02:45.860> let's<00:02:46.190> go<00:02:46.400> for<00:02:46.580> FIFA<00:02:46.850> 15<00:02:47.300> game

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
difference now let's go for FIFA 15 game

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.150 
difference now let's go for FIFA 15 game
on<00:02:47.959> these<00:02:48.110> devices<00:02:50.770> launched<00:02:51.770> at<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.070> same

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
on these devices launched at the same

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.360 
on these devices launched at the same
time<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.750> shooting<00:02:57.140> are<00:02:57.380> exactly<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.340> same

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
time the shooting are exactly the same

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.339 
time the shooting are exactly the same
on<00:02:58.850> these<00:02:59.030> devices

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.190 

so<00:03:04.859> performance<00:03:05.430> wise<00:03:05.700> both<00:03:06.299> of<00:03:06.540> them<00:03:06.780> seems

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
so performance wise both of them seems

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:20.839 
so performance wise both of them seems
to<00:03:07.319> me<00:03:07.530> identical<00:03:08.159> in<00:03:08.370> opening<00:03:08.909> apps

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.670 

so<00:03:21.450> again<00:03:21.749> here<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.140> witness<00:03:22.439> that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
so again here you can witness that

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.339 
so again here you can witness that

a single lag on these devices while
opening<00:05:25.910> up<00:05:26.060> these<00:05:26.870> apps<00:05:28.120> don't<00:05:29.120> forget<00:05:29.450> a

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
opening up these apps don't forget a
