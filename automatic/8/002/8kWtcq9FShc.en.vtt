00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.719
 we give the graphic of the proper paranza 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.380
 to find out what ingredients 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.540
 we will use to fry fried of 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.640
 paranza fiumicino a kilo of fish 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.410
 fresh from the double flour 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.370
 zero oil to fry lemon and salt 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.890
 very few ingredients but there 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.120
 we will use it in an important way 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.100
 we also put a couple of 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.170
 red shrimp here but what does it do 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.210
 say paranza paranza and all that 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.250
 small catch that ends up exactly 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.890
 in the network of paranza we have gods here 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.300
 codfish these goldfish yes 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.190
 they call the evils 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.430
 we have also put some inside 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.620
 menu we took 37 then the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.600
 paranza the word net of paranza said 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.840
 Christian first is none other than the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.079
 paranza the typical boat that oh well 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.310
 that goes fishing in the Tyrrhenian so it is one 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.760
 boat of the Tyrrhenian let's flour the fish 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.650
 then the fish is already wet and the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.870
 cod cod we do first 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.760
 do a few at a time and 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.820
 control the cooking instead you do the 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.409
 fish for fish a small small 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.030
 suggestion when you are at home e 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.820
 you have to fry or use the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.620
 flour litter in one hand because 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.600
 that other one maybe you will need for 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.130
 touch kitchen objects not 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.470
 he still has that plunge he has 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.530
 fact that this thing is particular not 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:35.640
 wet then do it twice 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:38.020
 and this will give our fry 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.360
 more crunchiness can give her 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.909
 go go then meanwhile let's start with i 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.010
 our cods then you know it's there 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.369
 also another another technique that 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.229
 because if you can do it was hurry alone 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.979
 only fried take the fish first 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.380
 great after having ground all that 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.960
 that you will have to fry down first 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.060
 big fish and then with the little ones so 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.090
 that's when the cooking time of that 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.159
 small will have come to fruition 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.379
 means that even the big one 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.980
 he made up for the weather just because he is 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:16.299
 been immersed first, here we are 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.819
 losing the war and beautiful stever 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.310
 glitters having made it with the double 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.140
 shirt that there are so many customers and 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.810
 restaurant they ask may have it 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.340
 only cod is the one that collects the most 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.610
 success with cod 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.019
 look with this double shirt that 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.450
 made him a Christian with flour 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.849
 how much clearer remains the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.750
 instead of the shrimp fish I make one 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.250
 alone you know I want to keep it clearer in 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.530
 so that red is also seen 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.629
 of the shrimp I am going to get even 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.790
 attention red prawn always in the 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:56.440
 in cooking fish you can never 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.599
 lower too much fish in the oil 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.030
 otherwise the rapporteur if you do not have a 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.940
 big fire just because 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.489
 the fish being cold and taken away from 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.989
 refrigerator lowers the temperature of the 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.120
 grappa is called street democratura 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.829
 oil the flour begins to 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.380
 the car absorbs the oil 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.680
 thanks to our heavy fat office 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.769
 and jeremy and social no I've always seen 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.269
 that we put the prawns a few moments 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.730
 precisely because these are prawns 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.489
 fresh we leave well crispy and said 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.060
 a little bit of salt and then finish the 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:34.230
 flat while I cut you lemon lemon 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.230
 as if it were raining 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.740
 don't look at the best technique for 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.630
 cut lemon you go diagonally you do 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.320
 then this diagonal goes back on 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.920
 so diagonal and go straight and is the 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.920
 our proposal
