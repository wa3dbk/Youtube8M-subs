00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.879
 to me 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.970
 a total lady is a manca teacher and 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.740
 well here is a my channel there is a new 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.980
 tutorial that is what I am doing 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.070
 in which I'm going to teach you a good 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.020
 repair is good enough for the 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.230
 people who see the fact in legend that is 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.670
 the sun and good we are giving many 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.650
 tutorials when it happened to me there are 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.680
 many that are wrong that is a lie 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.280
 that would be graphics card and their molars 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.500
 that not that they are not all lies 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.280
 until I found one on a web page 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 I saw it well and good because that was what 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.070
 it passed neither what has the forum nor what 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.470
 they did or nothing a kid in a forum what 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.870
 He said and I wanted to share it because 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.320
 there are very few people who have it and therefore 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.450
 I want to inform you this is worth sometimes 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.920
 start laws away and when you are 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.180
 starting the battle with say the 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.100
 characters rods to start the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.140
 battle suddenly closes and you 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.210
 appears this little message that is the ship 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.610
 exploit what happens with this 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.040
 if you are with a computer because I 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.540
 I'm for example with windows 7 going to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.220
 improve has a good compatibility 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.650
 very easy the repair is very 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.950
 simple very simple is to go to team 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.820
 it's worth it and we went to local disk equipment and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.850
 we went to where it was like that riot games and 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.800
 what's happening here we have legends services 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.540
 the launcher is worth the launcher is what 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.100
 start the game therefore we have to 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.100
 right click on the click voucher 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.800
 right in the and properties and we're going to 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.380
 pestaÃ±ita compatibility this is what 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.330
 makes it compatible there are times that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.280
 You could have played yes, but there are 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.100
 times that there is no also has gone van 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.259
 good is very easy and compatibility and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.869
 what's wrong you have to have this tick 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.830
 It's worth it as normal that it's not 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.959
 JCE worth it activates itself we would 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.019
 worth the activities by clicking here 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.350
 and they are windows this is very important 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.030
 the windows xp service pack 3 or if not 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.790
 know the service pack put the windows 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.709
 xp is worth and already there are people who 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.700
 put this voucher but it is for you to do 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.569
 warning to execute as 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.090
 administrator 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.609
 bullshit but I can put it 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.620
 I do not put it well and even that could already 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:35.500
 and apply it to accept 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.190
 and apply or apply and accept is already 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.010
 very easy it is very easy and simple and nothing 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.269
 beyond would start the game and now 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.659
 a start because I do not feel like playing 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.580
 Ok I swear it works if it works 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.930
 leave your in the I would appreciate it 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.409
 a lot and until next time 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.409
 goodbye
