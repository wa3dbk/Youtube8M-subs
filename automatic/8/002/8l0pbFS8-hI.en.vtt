00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
mad at me it's just this was my favorite

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.150 
mad at me it's just this was my favorite
if<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.400> castle<00:02:28.900> themes<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.800> that's<00:02:30.980> why<00:02:31.100> I

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
if the castle themes and so that's why I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.120 
if the castle themes and so that's why I
said<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.400> sometime<00:02:32.140> here's<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.410> black

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
said that sometime here's the black

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.430 
said that sometime here's the black
Falcons<00:02:34.610> wall<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.180> wish<00:02:35.720> I'd<00:02:35.870> kept<00:02:36.140> some<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.320> the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
Falcons wall I wish I'd kept some of the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.330 
Falcons wall I wish I'd kept some of the
other<00:02:36.560> castle<00:02:37.070> sets<00:02:37.310> assembled<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.030> do<00:02:38.090> have<00:02:38.420> I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
other castle sets assembled I do have I

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.620 
other castle sets assembled I do have I
think<00:02:40.340> one<00:02:40.490> of<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.700> smaller<00:02:41.060> ones<00:02:41.450> that

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
think one of the smaller ones that

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.440 
think one of the smaller ones that
didn't<00:02:42.080> actually<00:02:42.200> connect<00:02:42.710> with<00:02:42.770> this<00:02:43.040> but

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
didn't actually connect with this but

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.790 
didn't actually connect with this but
I'll<00:02:44.450> get<00:02:44.660> I'll<00:02:44.870> get<00:02:45.050> around<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.350> building<00:02:45.530> the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
I'll get I'll get around to building the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.560 
I'll get I'll get around to building the
black<00:02:45.980> Falcons<00:02:46.430> castle<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.270> some<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.510> the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
black Falcons castle and some of the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.060 
black Falcons castle and some of the
other<00:02:47.690> sets<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:48.230> then<00:02:48.380> show<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.590> how<00:02:48.710> you<00:02:48.860> can

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
other sets and then show you how you can

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.460 
other sets and then show you how you can
connect<00:02:49.490> them<00:02:49.610> all<00:02:49.760> now<00:02:50.570> there<00:02:50.750> are<00:02:50.870> just<00:02:50.990> thin

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
connect them all now there are just thin

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.630 
connect them all now there are just thin
and<00:02:51.710> they're<00:02:51.800> like<00:02:51.920> two-dimensional

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
and they're like two-dimensional

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.150 
and they're like two-dimensional
practically<00:02:53.600> not<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.410> lot<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.740> details

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
practically not a lot of details

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.220 
practically not a lot of details
sometimes<00:02:56.030> they<00:02:56.180> will<00:02:56.300> have<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.600> weapons<00:02:57.020> in

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
sometimes they will have the weapons in

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.830 
sometimes they will have the weapons in
here<00:02:57.530> but<00:02:57.740> there's<00:02:57.950> usually<00:02:58.100> not<00:02:58.840> interior

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
here but there's usually not interior

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.980 
here but there's usually not interior
details<00:03:00.380> it's<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:01.040> castle<00:03:01.520> wall

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
details it's just a castle wall

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.270 
details it's just a castle wall
essentially<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.590> does<00:03:03.740> look<00:03:03.980> really<00:03:04.160> cool

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
essentially and it does look really cool

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.980 
essentially and it does look really cool
when<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.760> join<00:03:05.000> several<00:03:05.420> of<00:03:05.690> them<00:03:05.810> together

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
when you join several of them together

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.280 
when you join several of them together
they<00:03:06.860> have<00:03:07.010> these<00:03:07.130> printed<00:03:07.640> pieces<00:03:08.090> some<00:03:08.750> Lego

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
they have these printed pieces some Lego

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.870 
they have these printed pieces some Lego
purists<00:03:09.800> didn't<00:03:10.040> like<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.370> when<00:03:10.490> we<00:03:10.580> got<00:03:10.760> these

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
purists didn't like it when we got these

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.210 
purists didn't like it when we got these
big<00:03:11.090> pieces<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.780> for<00:03:12.080> one<00:03:12.200> did<00:03:12.560> like<00:03:12.800> them<00:03:13.070> I

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
big pieces I for one did like them I

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.550 
big pieces I for one did like them I
like<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.550> windows<00:03:14.020> some<00:03:15.020> would<00:03:15.200> prefer<00:03:15.530> that

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
like the windows some would prefer that

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.760 
like the windows some would prefer that
you<00:03:15.950> have<00:03:16.250> brick<00:03:16.490> built<00:03:16.790> there<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:18.380> can

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
you have brick built there and I can

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.940 
you have brick built there and I can
understand<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.720> this<00:03:20.720> is<00:03:20.900> kind<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.350> weird<00:03:21.500> I

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
understand that this is kind of weird I

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.830 
understand that this is kind of weird I
always<00:03:22.670> feel<00:03:22.850> like<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.090> left<00:03:23.330> something<00:03:23.720> off

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
always feel like I left something off

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.250 
always feel like I left something off
here<00:03:24.220> there's<00:03:25.220> just<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.989> headlight<00:03:26.989> brick

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
here there's just that headlight brick

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.110 
here there's just that headlight brick
looks<00:03:27.950> like<00:03:28.100> it<00:03:28.250> should<00:03:28.280> be<00:03:28.430> holding<00:03:28.820> a<00:03:28.880> shield

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
looks like it should be holding a shield

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.550 
looks like it should be holding a shield
or<00:03:29.360> something<00:03:29.390> but<00:03:29.900> it's<00:03:30.020> not<00:03:30.200> really<00:03:30.440> holding

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
or something but it's not really holding

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.290 
or something but it's not really holding
anything<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.300> is<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.890> wall<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.700> then

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
anything so that is the wall and then

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.060 
anything so that is the wall and then
the<00:03:35.510> Kings<00:03:35.840> people<00:03:36.200> are<00:03:36.530> supposed<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:36.950> come

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
the Kings people are supposed to come

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.320 
the Kings people are supposed to come
over<00:03:37.190> here<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.580> try<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.730> get<00:03:37.910> in

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
over here and try to get in

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.240 
over here and try to get in
so<00:03:38.840> they<00:03:38.959> got<00:03:39.080> this<00:03:39.260> battering<00:03:39.709> ram<00:03:39.920> which

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
so they got this battering ram which

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.580 
so they got this battering ram which
that's<00:03:41.239> pretty<00:03:41.540> detailed<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:42.050> little<00:03:42.230> Clark

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
that's pretty detailed a little Clark

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.670 
that's pretty detailed a little Clark
for<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.040> time<00:03:44.000> period<00:03:44.140> it's<00:03:45.140> got<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.470> old

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
for the time period it's got the old

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.890 
for the time period it's got the old
wagon<00:03:45.860> wheels<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.670> then<00:03:47.270> this<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.750> the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
wagon wheels and then this is the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.600 
wagon wheels and then this is the
battering<00:03:48.320> ram<00:03:48.530> part<00:03:48.800> so<00:03:48.920> you<00:03:49.040> get<00:03:49.430> your

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
battering ram part so you get your

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.850 
battering ram part so you get your
momentum<00:03:49.910> up<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.420> then<00:03:50.540> when<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.720> stop<00:03:50.989> goes

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
momentum up and then when you stop goes

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.260 
momentum up and then when you stop goes
like<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:52.400> supposed<00:03:52.850> to<00:03:52.880> be<00:03:52.970> like<00:03:53.090> some

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
like that I supposed to be like some

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.570 
like that I supposed to be like some
kind<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.510> weight<00:03:53.690> you're<00:03:54.290> supposed<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.590> put<00:03:55.550> a

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
kind of weight you're supposed to put a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.310 
kind of weight you're supposed to put a
hole<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.150> door<00:03:56.330> you<00:03:56.810> know<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.050> pushed

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
hole in the door you know you pushed

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.110 
hole in the door you know you pushed
around<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.950> door<00:03:58.390> somehow<00:03:59.410> like<00:04:00.410> that<00:04:01.120> and

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
around the door somehow like that and

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.290 
around the door somehow like that and
then<00:04:02.300> they<00:04:02.390> can<00:04:02.450> climb<00:04:02.810> up<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:04.060> it's<00:04:05.060> called

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
then they can climb up and it's called

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.520 
then they can climb up and it's called
the<00:04:05.390> battering<00:04:05.750> ram<00:04:05.930> they<00:04:06.110> also<00:04:06.260> had<00:04:06.500> another

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
the battering ram they also had another

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.380 
the battering ram they also had another
one<00:04:06.860> called<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.220> siege<00:04:07.430> Tower<00:04:07.790> but<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.180> see

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
one called the siege Tower but you see

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.630 
one called the siege Tower but you see
how<00:04:08.570> they<00:04:09.170> get<00:04:09.290> up<00:04:09.440> there<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.130> all<00:04:10.250> we<00:04:10.370> got<00:04:10.520> to

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
and for a number of years like three

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.640 
and for a number of years like three

it's if features actually the battering
ram<00:05:33.410> I<00:05:33.590> thought<00:05:33.770> that<00:05:33.920> was<00:05:34.070> pretty<00:05:34.250> neat<00:05:34.400> and

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
ram I thought that was pretty neat and

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.030 
ram I thought that was pretty neat and
then<00:05:35.510> it<00:05:35.630> shows<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:35.870> those<00:05:36.200> alternate<00:05:36.710> builds

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
then it shows you those alternate builds

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.000 
then it shows you those alternate builds
which<00:05:37.190> are<00:05:37.370> on<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.670> box<00:05:38.170> so<00:05:39.170> with<00:05:39.890> the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
which are on the box so with the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.120 
which are on the box so with the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
Legoland Collection a lot of

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.620 
Legoland Collection a lot of
possibilities<00:05:43.790> there<00:05:43.820> so<00:05:44.180> I<00:05:44.240> thought<00:05:44.420> that

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
possibilities there so I thought that

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.340 
possibilities there so I thought that
was<00:05:44.780> pretty<00:05:44.960> cool<00:05:45.850> classic<00:05:46.850> time<00:05:47.270> in<00:05:47.540> Lego

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
was pretty cool classic time in Lego

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.990 
was pretty cool classic time in Lego
