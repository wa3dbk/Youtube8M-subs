00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
like cocoa powder on steroids because it

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.990 
like cocoa powder on steroids because it
has<00:00:26.200> branched<00:00:26.980> chain<00:00:27.130> amino<00:00:27.160> acids<00:00:27.849> in<00:00:27.970> it

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
has branched chain amino acids in it

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.330

notice how I'm keeping it on low just

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.669 
notice how I'm keeping it on low just
I'm<00:01:33.130> not<00:01:33.160> really<00:01:33.459> trying<00:01:33.729> to<00:01:33.940> blend<00:01:34.330> it<00:01:34.679> at

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
I'm not really trying to blend it at

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.169 
I'm not really trying to blend it at
high<00:01:35.979> speed<00:01:36.369> if<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.580> blend<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:36.910> at<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.030> higher

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
high speed if you blend it at a higher

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.510 
high speed if you blend it at a higher
speed<00:01:37.660> it<00:01:37.899> gets<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.319> little<00:01:38.500> bit<00:01:38.679> more<00:01:38.950> frothy

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
speed it gets a little bit more frothy

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.430 
speed it gets a little bit more frothy
so<00:01:39.789> if<00:01:39.849> you<00:01:39.970> like<00:01:40.179> it<00:01:40.360> that<00:01:40.539> way<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:40.899> can<00:01:41.110> do<00:01:41.259> it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
so if you like it that way you can do it

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.630 
so if you like it that way you can do it
so<00:01:41.979> 30<00:01:42.220> seconds<00:01:42.700> or<00:01:42.789> so<00:01:42.819> that<00:01:43.330> quick<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:48.009> what

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
so 30 seconds or so that quick and what

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.740 
so 30 seconds or so that quick and what
I<00:01:48.670> typically<00:01:49.149> like<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.539> do<00:01:49.750> is<00:01:50.440> I<00:01:50.740> like<00:01:51.429> to<00:01:51.750> put

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
I typically like to do is I like to put

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.930 
I typically like to do is I like to put
some<00:01:52.990> cinnamon<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.069> here<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.459> little<00:01:54.640> bit<00:01:54.819> of

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
some cinnamon in here a little bit of

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.279 
some cinnamon in here a little bit of
cayenne<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.390> if<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:55.750> have<00:01:55.959> a<00:01:55.990> liquid<00:01:56.560> like

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
cayenne and if you have a liquid like

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.350 
cayenne and if you have a liquid like
almond<00:01:59.289> milk<00:01:59.560> or<00:01:59.860> something<00:02:00.280> like<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:00.459> you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
almond milk or something like that you

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.639 
almond milk or something like that you
can<00:02:01.509> also<00:02:01.660> use<00:02:02.140> that<00:02:04.050> so<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.349> fast

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
can also use that so it's that fast

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:13.880 
can also use that so it's that fast
makes<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:06.009> really<00:02:06.399> nice<00:02:06.729> hot<00:02:07.090> cocoa<00:02:07.330> beverage

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.100 

so<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> next<00:02:14.700> version<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.240> can<00:02:15.480> use<00:02:15.690> with<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
so the next version you can use with the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.080 
so the next version you can use with the
Craig<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.470> Koko<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.040> actually<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> pudding<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
Craig and Koko is actually a pudding and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.660 
Craig and Koko is actually a pudding and
so<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.660> way<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.810> do<00:02:18.960> this<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:20.400> put<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
so the way I do this is I just put the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.150 
so the way I do this is I just put the
blender<00:02:20.850> here<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.360> I'm<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:21.450> gonna<00:02:21.630> do<00:02:21.980> 4<00:02:22.980> to

it in a bowl and now I'm gonna stick it
into<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.880> refrigerator<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.930> let<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.970> begin

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
into the refrigerator and let it begin

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.390 
into the refrigerator and let it begin
to<00:03:12.240> cachito<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.780> little<00:03:13.170> bit<00:03:13.290> more<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.070> I

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
to cachito a little bit more and so I

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.490 
to cachito a little bit more and so I
basically<00:03:15.030> put<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.600> in<00:03:15.810> here<00:03:18.080> what<00:03:19.080> happens

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
basically put this in here what happens

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.750 
basically put this in here what happens
is<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.830> fibers<00:03:20.400> begin<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:22.230> know<00:03:22.260> really

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
is the fibers begin to you know really

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.920 
is the fibers begin to you know really
absorb<00:03:23.760> all<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:23.940> water<00:03:24.300> make<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.660> much

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
absorb all that water make it much

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.110 
absorb all that water make it much
thicker<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.920> basically<00:03:26.220> stick<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:26.850> in

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
thicker so I basically stick that in

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.090 
thicker so I basically stick that in
there<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.690> I'm<00:03:28.230> gonna<00:03:28.350> leave<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.890> there

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
there and I'm gonna leave it in there

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.920 
there and I'm gonna leave it in there
for<00:03:29.130> 30<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.640> 60<00:03:29.970> minutes<00:03:30.000> or<00:03:30.330> so<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.720> have

well and now I'm gonna get this blending
I'm<00:04:12.680> gonna<00:04:12.860> start<00:04:13.070> out<00:04:13.280> on<00:04:13.310> low<00:04:17.140> then<00:04:18.140> one

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
I'm gonna start out on low then one

and<00:04:25.050> I'm<00:04:25.140> gonna<00:04:25.290> get<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.740> amped<00:04:26.190> up<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.430> little

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
and I'm gonna get this amped up a little

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.000 
and I'm gonna get this amped up a little
bit

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.700 

imma<00:04:30.580> let<00:04:30.730> that<00:04:30.910> blend<00:04:31.180> for<00:04:31.480> 30<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.870> 60<00:04:31.900> seconds

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
imma let that blend for 30 to 60 seconds

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.620 
imma let that blend for 30 to 60 seconds
or<00:04:32.830> so<00:04:33.100> a<00:04:33.490> nice<00:04:34.390> shake<00:04:34.810> in<00:04:35.050> there

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.690 

it<00:04:38.170> helps<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.620> have<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.860> high-powered<00:04:39.460> blender

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
it helps to have a high-powered blender

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.430 
it helps to have a high-powered blender
as<00:04:40.270> well<00:04:40.380> but<00:04:41.380> it's<00:04:41.560> not<00:04:41.740> necessary<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:43.440> then

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
as well but it's not necessary and then
