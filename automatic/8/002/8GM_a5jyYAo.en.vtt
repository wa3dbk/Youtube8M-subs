to do is is offset that a little bit it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.590 
to do is is offset that a little bit it
helps<00:01:29.020> me<00:01:29.259> get<00:01:29.410> a<00:01:29.470> better<00:01:29.649> hook<00:01:29.979> up<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:31.539> what

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
helps me get a better hook up and what

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.240 
helps me get a better hook up and what
I'll<00:01:31.750> do<00:01:31.899> is<00:01:32.020> just<00:01:32.200> grab<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.440> with<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.770> pliers

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
I'll do is just grab it with the pliers

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.130 
I'll do is just grab it with the pliers
don't<00:01:33.640> touch<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.149> point<00:01:34.360> with<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.930> pliers

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
don't touch the point with the pliers

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.260 
don't touch the point with the pliers
because<00:01:35.470> you'll<00:01:35.649> feel<00:01:35.950> dull<00:01:36.190> it<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.520> just

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
because you'll feel dull it and just

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.090 
because you'll feel dull it and just
take<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.259> good<00:01:38.530> twist<00:01:38.830> on<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:40.799> might<00:01:41.799> have<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.040> do

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
take a good twist on it might have to do

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.490 
take a good twist on it might have to do
it<00:01:42.159> a<00:01:42.220> couple<00:01:42.430> times<00:01:42.729> but<00:01:43.119> now<00:01:43.960> if<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.200> look<00:01:44.290> at

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
it a couple times but now if you look at

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.270 
it a couple times but now if you look at
that<00:01:44.710> hook<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:46.299> an<00:01:46.450> offset<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.950> that'll

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
that hook it's an offset and that'll

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.219 
that hook it's an offset and that'll
give<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.549> a<00:01:48.610> whole<00:01:49.330> lot<00:01:49.510> better<00:01:49.659> hook<00:01:49.960> set

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
give you a whole lot better hook set

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.830 
give you a whole lot better hook set
it's<00:01:50.799> important<00:01:51.340> when<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.580> use<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.850> circle

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
it's important when you use a circle

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.219 
it's important when you use a circle
hook<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:54.070> choose<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.340> rod<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:55.180> has<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.479> soft

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
hook is to choose a rod that has a soft

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.560 
hook is to choose a rod that has a soft
tip<00:01:56.740> what<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.340> mean<00:01:57.580> by<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.880> or<00:01:58.030> maybe<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.270> fast

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
tip what I mean by that or maybe a fast

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.630 
tip what I mean by that or maybe a fast
action<00:01:58.869> softer<00:01:59.500> tip<00:01:59.710> you<00:02:00.220> don't<00:02:00.430> want

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
action softer tip you don't want

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.880 
action softer tip you don't want
anything<00:02:00.909> real<00:02:01.270> stiff<00:02:01.720> because<00:02:02.320> that's<00:02:02.650> just

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
anything real stiff because that's just
