00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.849
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.559
 you are so good I come with a boxing 

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:08.510
 ok but the purpose of this video is not 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.760
 it's just boxing, but 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.460
 I bring this doll worth Disney 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.250
 infinite and to try it on the new 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.470
 chrome endorsements one let's say so 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.560
 cro study say chroma between 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.510
 quotes to make recordings to 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.770
 any time of day worth every 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.500
 so I could make recordings 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.660
 with white background and others using a 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.010
 technique that is called luma kane or chroma 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.090
 key 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.979
 but what had to be by day 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.170
 then now that there has been change of 

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:37.729
 schedule here in Spain and so on 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.219
 truth is that it is quite complicated 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.839
 record record at certain hours starting 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.100
 at 6 o'clock in the afternoon or so 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.639
 darken and that's very complicated 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.499
 so then I do not dedicate anything to the ikea 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:50.780
 is a store that really is that good 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.789
 is a Swedish store that here in Spain 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.350
 the truth is that it has many successes 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.870
 it's like a department store 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.489
 Lamp and other furniture and wait 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.799
 pretty cheap lamps for 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.229
 mount me the chroma key for my account worth 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.300
 and the truth is that if you try to make a 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.290
 chroma key if you try to buy a chroma 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.590
 key profession 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.360
 It's going to cost you a big coin and the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.160
 truth is that with this solution I believe 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.880
 that the result is pretty good 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.170
 and you spend a lot less money what 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.900
 that yes it is true that it has to have 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.370
 room to store the lamps is worth 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.890
 I will teach you if you want as they are 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.330
 exactly all those lamps but 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.430
 it's just to make this little 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.110
 test voucher is a small test of 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.120
 quality I will still try to polish a 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.120
 little bit more and well then since we are 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.330
 let's do the boxing to see what 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.460
 it seems this woody boxing that was 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.759
 the other doll I was missing from disney 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.070
 infinity was I was looking for one that 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.410
 did not have any damage and good at last 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.479
 what is found here we have it so what 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.720
 I'm going to take out so that 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.030
 you see and you have to know how you see this 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.910
 doll does not have greens if it had green 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.170
 I would not go out I would not go out because it would look 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.810
 transparent is worth it because we are 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.270
 making a chroma then that's what it is 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.509
 what you have we can not here we have it 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.160
 here we have woody i'm going to throw this 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.640
 because I do not have tables nor do I have anything 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.230
 I have to manage, it's a bit 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.350
 the truth and good because the truth is that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.510
 I'm going to say about the doll that I'm 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.760
 in love with disney dolls 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.600
 trinity here we have it the truth is that 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.010
 It has a great quality as always 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.580
 the infinite disney dolls and I think 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.430
 that are pretty cured is worth 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.489

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.290
 you know they are buzz lightyear 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.540
 jesse and buddy are worth so far 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.790
 come out these three in fact I do not think that 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.650

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.110

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.590
 you want to have all of you, you have to 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.780
 buy separately to woody vale 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.569
 I had to tell you something about disney 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.890
 infinity and the gameplays is worth if I go 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.420
 to try to make more gameplays in the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.860
 channel is ok but it's a matter of time 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.379
 Right now I'm trying to do 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.420
 certain changes in the channel are worth we have 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.040
 the news we have the voice podcast 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.750
 of the gamers there are many things and the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.010
 truth is that it is complicated among all 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.010
 this and the work is quite 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.569
 complicated to be up to date so to speak 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.160
 also now comes lamadrid game quick 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.860

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.760
 chroma and if you have any doubt and want 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.650
 make you a chroma at home or whatever and 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.810
 I tell you that it does not come out very expensive either 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.670
 Why do you ask me? 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.459
