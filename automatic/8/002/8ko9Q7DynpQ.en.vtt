00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.670
 70 when we get to death when 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.309

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.180
 regrets that it goes first and then to 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.160
 throw balls to heaven 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.930
 to heaven not but far away we can 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.980
 then pick up or not sense yes but that 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.980
 up to 74 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.930
 we 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.649
 me yo yo 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:12.149
 the son of a bitch 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.750
 and this is not a ghost not 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.850
 yes 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.719
 to dead 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.890
 ah no no no 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.960
 we are the four bombings 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.960
 He marched each one with the camera 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.340
 with this 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.610
 two 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.480
 to unlock a down 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.480
 we are already killed 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.110
 as silenced 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.270
 and up 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.040
 when I touch you 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.040
 and I think it was killing when they killed you 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.570
 of atypical 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.570
 take out another bomber 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.550
 away you have to kill 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.329
 also for brands but not for 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.329
 nothing 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:20.340
 a lot more 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.340
 and when we take 6 minutes 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.510
 do not 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.560
 the default the default 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.130
 when he got to 70 again nobody alone 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.130
 First 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.800
 even if you have one in front of 4 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.220
 to kill kill with care when I 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.220
 tell anyone we go to the other side 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.709
 271 expect to kill one more 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.470
 marias only now only kills and now 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.470
 single player 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.879
 up how are you 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:47.660
 what do I always say even though I 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.660
 you have front not matrix and walter to 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.030
 it gives me like the house of this game 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:04.370
 yes but from a distance it is not already the boom in 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.340
 birds and up close and nonsense those not something 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.360
 handsome from afar although the doctors wait 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.360
 that is handsome if we do it 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.930
 is losing 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.750
 but nobody else 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.020
 injectable 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.690
 and b 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.690
 says not what it amounts to enumerating from 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.560
 far out of more clear power thieves 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.560
 that things do not ask 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.060
 friends 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.620
 or this way 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.360
 when 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.060
 or 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:15.200
 but I 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.980
 A) Yes 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.390
 but nobody 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.660
 It was easy but by far uncle 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.560
 good 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.560
 we started
