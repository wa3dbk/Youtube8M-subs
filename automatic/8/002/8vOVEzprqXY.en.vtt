 because today's cold on the street on 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.710
 the river today did not go 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.410
 decided to do all sorts of business 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.170

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:29.960
 yesterday I watched the video comrades crow 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:34.680
 78 in which he reasoned about 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.550
 I am not a collection of my knives 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.140

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.000
 fans of knives and not just use but 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.100
 I was wondering what kind of knives I have 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.710

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.559
 find out what i use what am i 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.050

 as a result of their current research 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.500
 I came to the conclusion that I am somehow 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:08.369
 company latent viking fans dead 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:14.189
 well, it probably makes sense to show 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:22.560
 What kind of knives do I use? 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:25.560

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.899
 how would we need a cutting edge 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.890

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.970

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.670
