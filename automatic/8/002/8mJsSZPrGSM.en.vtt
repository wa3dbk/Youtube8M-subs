00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.780 
because my hair is kind of short and
it's<00:02:50.510> like<00:02:50.690> awkward<00:02:51.410> looking<00:02:51.739> like<00:02:52.519> it's<00:02:52.670> like

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
it's like awkward looking like it's like

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.640 
it's like awkward looking like it's like
an<00:02:52.910> awkward<00:02:53.300> length<00:02:53.570> it's<00:02:53.720> not<00:02:54.050> too<00:02:54.230> short<00:02:54.470> or

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
an awkward length it's not too short or

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.310 
an awkward length it's not too short or
too<00:02:54.709> long<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.880> it's<00:02:56.090> kind<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.360> hard<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.170> it's

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
too long so it's kind of hard and it's

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.770 
too long so it's kind of hard and it's
an<00:02:57.850> asymmetrical<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:59.500> line<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:02.060> kind<00:03:02.690> of

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
an asymmetrical a line so it's kind of

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.410 
an asymmetrical a line so it's kind of
hard<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.260> even<00:03:03.650> curl<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.850> especially<00:03:05.090> in<00:03:05.299> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
hard to even curl it especially in the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.800 
hard to even curl it especially in the
back<00:03:05.630> when<00:03:06.079> it's<00:03:06.290> like<00:03:06.500> where<00:03:06.769> it's<00:03:06.950> bulky<00:03:07.280> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
back when it's like where it's bulky and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.229 
back when it's like where it's bulky and
kind<00:03:08.810> of<00:03:08.959> like<00:03:09.769> shorter<00:03:10.220> layers<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.820> stuff<00:03:10.910> so

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
kind of like shorter layers and stuff so

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.160 
kind of like shorter layers and stuff so
it's<00:03:12.079> kind<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.410> hard<00:03:12.500> but<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.670> can<00:03:13.730> see<00:03:14.170> kind

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
it's kind of hard but you can see kind

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.289 
it's kind of hard but you can see kind
of<00:03:15.380> getting<00:03:15.590> there<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.430> one<00:03:16.640> is<00:03:16.850> kind<00:03:17.180> of

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
of getting there this one is kind of

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.319 
of getting there this one is kind of
more<00:03:17.560> softer<00:03:18.560> curls<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:19.700> side<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.000> more

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
more softer curls and this side is more

more softer curls and this side is more
um<00:03:21.430> volumize<00:03:22.430> curls<00:03:23.260> okay<00:03:24.260> will<00:03:24.500> do<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.799> last

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
um volumize curls okay will do the last

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.610 
um volumize curls okay will do the last
piece<00:03:25.340> right<00:03:25.579> here<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:26.329> then<00:03:27.260> i'll<00:03:27.380> try<00:03:27.560> to

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
piece right here and then i'll try to

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.620 
piece right here and then i'll try to
volumize<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.340> other<00:03:28.489> side<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.090> looks<00:03:29.269> the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
volumize the other side so it looks the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:40.180 
volumize the other side so it looks the
same<00:03:34.269> then<00:03:35.269> we'll<00:03:35.540> do<00:03:35.690> this<00:03:35.870> side<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:39.769> you
