00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.890
 now i'm done this way 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.069
 but a new bridge is being built here at the end of 2010 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.979
 and that bridge is necessary for the forest according to alderman cutters 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:12.780
 there has to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.029
 It really necessary a new one to slow traffic they enter 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.679
 this entire borough west we have the overpressure truck bosvelt but camp 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.000
 also the cross camp but also the new areas that develop the price 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.039
 entertainment and willemspoort and all functions that day are hospital education as well 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.710
 counts mega cinema with the city center that they can really slow traffic going 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.410
 come between the city center on one side and the city district on the other 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.840
 westmalle functions that kg diary that lay knees are going to come 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.050
 the route runs father fighting beach 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.230
 about 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.910
 on the bridge over the door moods would like to moor on the royal road 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.260
 then you pass 6 along the track 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.660
 Gheit turned over the new magistratenlaan and arrives 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.840
 about a task 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.490
 from the old camp the harmful mega cinema in england arrives alongside 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.740
 affect patients and eventually come to the new 5 2 to be framed 2 nd 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.420
 bridge that probably gets the appropriate name the woods bridge 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.020
 must become a landmark of the city 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.020
 with a few weeks with benches of trees and lighting 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.500
 the park 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.330
 on a the back the bridge gets a green design that it is very pleasant to 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.260
 later 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.060
 all before the Bruges walk but on tarik comes to stay 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.950
 the college had a choice of three designs 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.150
 the chosen design comes from the benthem crouwel architecture firm 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.110
 Amsterdam 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.380
 the choice fell precisely on this because the material appearance and the best with the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.780
 city â€‹â€‹fits 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.549
 the council decided in July on its card for the short or long variant of it 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.430
 design 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.410
 the costs of the costs variant are thirteen million 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.560
 but it is wise to invest that much in a time like this 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.350
 you have to invest 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.220
 I think if you as a government have to act very anti-cyclically and you have to 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.170
 must look at the investments that are already planning and value for money 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.149
 You have to get it if you can get it to make sure it is there 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.470
 employment therefore comes from an economic perspective 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.400
 reason to go the very many miles to go the bridge it seemed it would go into 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.280
 Be put into use in 2012
