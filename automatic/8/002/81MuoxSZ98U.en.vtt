00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 the son 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:21.130
 It's always good that you can not represent 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.169
 independent selection was the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.349
 I do not go into the categories of 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.619
 base and I'm quite happy grateful 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.029
 goodbye for the opportunity once more 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.180
 even if you are not a 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.100
 professional is also a very proud 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.079
 great power to be in teaching the shirt of the 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.079
 selection in the base categories 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:05.100
 I think it's one to one cycle of a job 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.940
 which has come a long time I think 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 since last year thank god i'm 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.590
 You can do a good job here at 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.400
 palm trees and I think it all counts 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.340
 in a training session he should 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.750
 to be watching is very many games 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.910
 so I'm glad he's able to 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.869
 trust in the work that I am being 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.100
 is being done here in the palm trees and is 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.149
 continue to give my maximum to me and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.149
 God wants the new cleaning 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.079
