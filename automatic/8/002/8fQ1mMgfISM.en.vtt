00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:16.949
 papers on my channel I want yes how are you 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.560
 already understood where they show their guns from 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.439
 papers will not be on the weapon 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.109
 tutorials 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.949
 Well let's get started the first thing I want you 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:38.579
 show it here 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:47.219
 American carbine 41 now not visible 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:51.210
 that's why we start with why 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.320
 here is a pen on the side and yes a pen with a block 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.559
 because because I wanted to 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 because it is but not really 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:05.129
 because I still want to do 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:10.369
 podstvolnik and respectively me pen 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.049
 will get in the way before 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.259
 if anyone knows that there will be no later 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.170
 questions why she cares here 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:26.689
 It costs because you can because you can 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:31.320
 put it here m41 is on the side 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:41.540
 special things to install what 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:41.540
 accessories from the bottom and top apologize so 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:02:00.689
 continue with the removable pieces the first is 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:06.500
 silencer here it is quietly removed as 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:10.069
 see the silencers have a hole 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.069
 somehow not strange 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:21.569
 and more drying or otherwise they can 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:31.750
 call 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:36.940
 legs and here they are also shot as 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:40.510
 see I ask you just do not write 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.209
 in the comments that this is how it somehow 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.640
 set the bipod 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:52.090
 so far after all, in principle, sshki here 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.750
 Here I put them here because 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:03.030
 that i don't know why because laziness 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:11.700
 was put them there so we will continue 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:17.440
 a battle we calmly removed here and 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.290
 quietly dressed as well as 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.560
 conventional machine 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.480

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.480

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:37.739
 rightly said yes also the same to me 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.500
 mounted here are collimator sights 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:49.890

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:57.549
