00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.510
 because 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.929
 Dr 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.730
 ca 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.039
 the family home that the cantons Zug and Continental 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.880
 the surrounding unspoiled nature and the fantastic viewpoints 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.360
 On fair weather days you can even see the Neusiedlersee 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.940
 Although sometimes crucial to the residential property in this parking lot too 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940
 establish 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.850
 The positioning of the object has to be on the elongated plot 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.400
 highest vantage point proved most efficient 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.540
 Who in this way the whole garden and meadow reason unreasonable 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.540
 inhabited and can be used 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.600
 the Pirker family has a conventional house in the past 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.230
 The new residential building should therefore be based on a classic modern style 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.790
 This is how a two-storey living area was created 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.640
 characterized on the one hand by its straightforward and clear language of forms 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.240
 on the other hand on the homely feel - good character him inner 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.840
 Do not give up building 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.190
 Linz 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.870
 noteworthy is that you have the house with the glass front to the north 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.940
 has aligned 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.790
 This can be counteracted by overheating in the summer months 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.799
 we planned it that way 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.190
 and so wanted balls also percentage children we have the sun all day long 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.750
 and not the sun is in the house 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.340
 As a result, we have the morning sun very nicely throughout the house 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.490
 of course it turns and of course it is so if we are the biggest 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.330
 Heat is a sim card and not at the house 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.480
 Therefore, we must also not covered the balcony 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.590
 the kings with a concert can enjoy the sun 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.550
 so everything was finished then the multipart protected from the heat 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.130
 the garden plot is still emerging as our hosts 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.370
 70 sandstone walls give the first elements for a Mediterranean garden 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.729
 We want Dan Caten like that 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.689
 the percent so far little 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.859
 Flowers are as he the green plants 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:26.479
 Percent 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:32.009
 and so Boxwood Lavender II says Itera has a powerfully favorable one 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:36.249
 maybe percent if they are lucky and also find changes 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:40.169
 I want to have bleeding in this point, have an old that 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.429
 Flooding in the garden is 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.539
 but although currently the cards turn 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.309
 there tend to be cards in winning 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.449
 and the earth stays on nature 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.510
 through the little foals you get into the also for the living room 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.770
 In addition, a fairground is affiliated with the large window openings and the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.840
 Oversized eye level in the gallery area of ​​the upper floor 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.840
 generate transparency and freedom of living 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.419
 The church is located in the southern hemisphere in the direction of the trial judgments 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.799
 frosted glass sliding door which is separated from the living room on relatively small 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.799
 Surface, this work space should be simple and straightforward but functional 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.799
 to be 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.989
 on so-called bells and whistles one has waived 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.409
 in the basement there are again rooms and a children's room all 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.120
 Rooms were handicapped accessible for the son of the family Plöger 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.749
 built 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.549
 a cozy retreat in march there is upstairs here you can 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.229
 Lizards want to be undisturbed immediately, even if their favorite place is one sooner 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.229
 is more unusual 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.389
 Her favorite place is the bathroom 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.039

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:08.400
 Sun shines on I can make% EBITDA on the roof beyond
