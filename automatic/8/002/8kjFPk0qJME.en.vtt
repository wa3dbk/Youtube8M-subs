00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
also do this from 85 already between

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
also do this from 85 already between
questing<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.330> killing<00:01:09.600> those<00:01:09.720> acts<00:01:09.990> from<00:01:10.140> 85

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.100 
to 87 where I think it would be way
fatter<00:01:13.710> faster<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:14.970> fruit<00:01:15.869> jate<00:01:16.080> forest

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
fatter faster to go fruit jate forest

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.380 
fatter faster to go fruit jate forest
