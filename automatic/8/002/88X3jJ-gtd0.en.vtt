00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
anything to do with it so the trick of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720 
anything to do with it so the trick of
this<00:00:30.359> braid<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.619> your<00:00:31.800> hair<00:00:32.009> tangley

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
this braid is to have your hair tangley

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.180 
this braid is to have your hair tangley
ish<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.239> not<00:00:33.390> too<00:00:33.570> tingly<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:35.040> don't

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
ish but not too tingly but just don't

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220 
ish but not too tingly but just don't
straighten<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.360> hair<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.020> completely

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
straighten your hair so it's completely

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.750 
straighten your hair so it's completely
and<00:00:38.010> utterly<00:00:39.440> straight<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.399> okay<00:00:41.730> if

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and utterly straight so it's okay if

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400 
and utterly straight so it's okay if
it's<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> little<00:00:42.090> wavy<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:42.750> curly<00:00:42.809> it's

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
it's a little wavy or curly it's

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.889 
it's a little wavy or curly it's
especially<00:00:43.800> good<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.160> textured<00:00:44.730> hair<00:00:44.910> okay

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
especially good for textured hair okay

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.479 
especially good for textured hair okay
anyway<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.829> divide<00:00:47.039> your<00:00:47.100> hair<00:00:47.280> into

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
anyway so you divide your hair into

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.850 
anyway so you divide your hair into
three<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.809> normally<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
three like and you normally do for a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.500 
three like and you normally do for a
break<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:51.829> then<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.000> keep<00:00:54.210> braiding

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
break and then you just keep braiding

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.260 
break and then you just keep braiding
and<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.230> trick<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.800> not<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.489> untangle

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and the trick of it is not to untangle

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.779 
and the trick of it is not to untangle
this<00:00:57.620> part<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.829> tingles<00:00:59.280> together<00:00:59.579> while

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
this part that tingles together while

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.510 
this part that tingles together while
you<00:00:59.910> bring<00:01:00.149> usually<00:01:00.870> go<00:01:00.960> ahead<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:02.250> try<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
you bring usually go ahead and try to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.929 
you bring usually go ahead and try to
like<00:01:02.699> untangle<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.019> um<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:05.519> should<00:01:05.580> do

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
like untangle it but um you should do

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.490 
like untangle it but um you should do
that<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.110> will<00:01:07.350> not

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that because if you do that you will not

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.590 
that because if you do that you will not
get<00:01:07.770> an<00:01:07.890> inverted<00:01:08.340> right<00:01:08.520> at<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.420> I'm

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
get an inverted right at all so I'm

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
get an inverted right at all so I'm
going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.810> take<00:01:09.960> my<00:01:10.170> pieces<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.770> hair<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.340> just

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
going to take my pieces of hair and just

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.039 
going to take my pieces of hair and just
divide<00:01:11.880> them<00:01:12.030> into<00:01:12.090> three<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> already<00:01:12.810> told

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
divide them into three I already told

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.620 
divide them into three I already told
you<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> keep<00:01:14.460> braiding<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
you that so you keep braiding but you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
you that so you keep braiding but you
don't<00:01:15.750> separate<00:01:16.259> end<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.130> keep<00:01:17.280> braiding

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
don't separate end so just keep braiding

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.920 
don't separate end so just keep braiding
in<00:01:17.939> your<00:01:18.119> section<00:01:18.590> like<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.460> really

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
in your section like that so not really

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.460 
in your section like that so not really
separating<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.200> while<00:01:22.290> you're<00:01:22.439> doing

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
separating it and while you're doing

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.200 
separating it and while you're doing
that<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:23.159> braiding<00:01:23.970> itself<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> bottom

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
that it's braiding itself at the bottom

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.560 
that it's braiding itself at the bottom
so<00:01:27.210> keep<00:01:27.689> braiding<00:01:28.020> until<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:29.159> finally<00:01:29.570> can

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
so keep braiding until you finally can

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.440 
so keep braiding until you finally can
braid<00:01:31.049> no<00:01:31.680> longer<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.820> Rea<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.060> tight

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
braid no longer you can Rea that tight

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.819 
braid no longer you can Rea that tight
or<00:01:33.600> loose<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.930> doesn't<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.290> matter<00:01:34.500> but

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
or loose it doesn't really matter but

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.230 
or loose it doesn't really matter but
Tiger<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.280> better<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:37.979> braid<00:01:38.490> until<00:01:38.759> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
Tiger is better so you braid until you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.030 
Tiger is better so you braid until you
have<00:01:39.420> no<00:01:39.689> more<00:01:39.720> room<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.470> brain<00:01:40.650> there's<00:01:40.920> this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
have no more room to brain there's this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.270 
have no more room to brain there's this
big<00:01:41.280> hole<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.939> then<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.110> stick<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.799> end<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
big hole and then you stick the end of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.520 
big hole and then you stick the end of
the<00:01:44.399> braid<00:01:44.990> through<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.350> hole<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.990> then<00:01:48.990> pull

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the braid through the hole and then pull

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.160 
the braid through the hole and then pull
and<00:01:50.100> then<00:01:50.210> guess<00:01:51.210> what<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.860> tied<00:01:53.720> this<00:01:54.720> is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and then guess what it is tied this is

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.319 
and then guess what it is tied this is
tied<00:01:55.500> together<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.790> made<00:01:57.180> an

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
tied together and I just made an

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.620 
tied together and I just made an
