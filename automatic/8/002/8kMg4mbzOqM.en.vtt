00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
very did switch him up occasionally to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.130 
very did switch him up occasionally to
left<00:01:53.310> wing<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.360> try<00:01:54.600> them<00:01:54.720> out<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:55.020> that

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
left wing to try them out in that

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.690
