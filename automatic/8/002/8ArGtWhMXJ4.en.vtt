00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.920 

alpha<00:00:05.220> waves<00:00:05.370> are<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.879> particular<00:00:06.569> type<00:00:06.779> of

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
alpha waves are a particular type of

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.140 
alpha waves are a particular type of
brain<00:00:07.170> activity<00:00:07.529> where<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.160> big<00:00:08.580> groups<00:00:08.880> of

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
brain activity where a big groups of

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.450 
brain activity where a big groups of
your<00:00:09.420> neurons<00:00:09.750> all<00:00:10.110> fire<00:00:10.559> together<00:00:11.160> and

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
your neurons all fire together and

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.660 
your neurons all fire together and
synchrony<00:00:12.090> 10<00:00:12.450> times<00:00:12.809> every<00:00:13.110> second<00:00:13.650> 10<00:00:14.370> Hertz

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
synchrony 10 times every second 10 Hertz

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.060 
synchrony 10 times every second 10 Hertz
so<00:00:14.969> it's<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.360> 10<00:00:15.870> fires<00:00:16.230> every<00:00:16.680> second<00:00:17.010> this

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
so it's like 10 fires every second this

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.599 
so it's like 10 fires every second this
big<00:00:17.310> group<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.699> neurons<00:00:18.619> how<00:00:19.619> big<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.279> Alpha

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
big group of neurons how big the Alpha

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.010 
big group of neurons how big the Alpha
peaks<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.060> troughs<00:00:21.180> are<00:00:21.449> represents<00:00:21.869> how

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
peaks and troughs are represents how

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.080 
peaks and troughs are represents how
many<00:00:22.320> neurons<00:00:22.619> are<00:00:23.010> contributing<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.939> this

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
many neurons are contributing to this

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.839 
many neurons are contributing to this
electrical<00:00:24.660> field<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:25.859> thought<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
electrical field it was thought in the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.029 
electrical field it was thought in the
past<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.510> alpha<00:00:27.990> waves<00:00:28.199> represented<00:00:28.920> just

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
past that alpha waves represented just

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.099 
past that alpha waves represented just
kind<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> idling<00:00:30.150> process<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> brain

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
kind of the idling process of the brain

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.860 
kind of the idling process of the brain
so<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.219> put<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:32.730> car<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.059> neutral<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so when you put your car in neutral and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.990 
so when you put your car in neutral and
just<00:00:33.899> starts<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.620> idle<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.820> was

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
just starts to idle that that was

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
just starts to idle that that was
thought<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:36.719> an<00:00:36.840> alpha<00:00:37.020> wave<00:00:37.350> was

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
thought of as what an alpha wave was

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.280 
thought of as what an alpha wave was
just<00:00:37.860> kind<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.489> visual<00:00:39.030> cortex<00:00:39.290> stopping

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
just kind of your visual cortex stopping

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.369 
just kind of your visual cortex stopping
processing<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.730> come<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.570> found<00:00:43.050> in

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
processing but it's come to be found in

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
processing but it's come to be found in
many<00:00:43.770> more<00:00:44.129> brain<00:00:44.430> areas<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.390> kind

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
many more brain areas that this is kind

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110 
many more brain areas that this is kind
of<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.809> general<00:00:46.190> inhibitory<00:00:47.190> mechanism<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
of a general inhibitory mechanism in the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.110 
of a general inhibitory mechanism in the
brain<00:00:48.239> does<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.260> an<00:00:49.440> off<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.879> just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
brain does not just an off that just

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.369 
brain does not just an off that just
happens<00:00:51.539> whenever<00:00:51.719> you're<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.140> doing

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
happens whenever you're not doing

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.590 
happens whenever you're not doing
anything<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.120> selectively<00:00:54.120> choose

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
anything but you can selectively choose

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.080 
anything but you can selectively choose
which<00:00:55.079> parts<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.860> your<00:00:55.980> brain<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.489> inhibit

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
which parts of your brain to inhibit

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.840 
which parts of your brain to inhibit
with<00:00:57.390> these<00:00:57.570> alpha<00:00:57.930> oscillations<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.820> okay<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
with these alpha oscillations so okay I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.490 
with these alpha oscillations so okay I
have<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> goal<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> want<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> pay<00:01:01.079> attention<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
have a goal I want to pay attention to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
have a goal I want to pay attention to
all<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.890> stuff<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:02.520> lane<00:01:03.120> while

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
all the stuff that's in my lane while

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.910 
all the stuff that's in my lane while
I'm<00:01:03.600> driving<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.170> none<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> stuff<00:01:04.769> in

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I'm driving and none of the stuff in

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.760 
I'm driving and none of the stuff in
that<00:01:04.949> Lane<00:01:05.369> oncoming<00:01:05.970> traffic<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.260> do

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that Lane oncoming traffic and so to do

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.480 
that Lane oncoming traffic and so to do
that<00:01:08.240> it's<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:09.450> magic<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.140> has<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
that it's not magic it has to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.070 
that it's not magic it has to
selectively<00:01:11.490> boost<00:01:11.939> some<00:01:12.270> processing<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
selectively boost some processing and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.750 
selectively boost some processing and
decrease<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:13.890> other<00:01:14.040> processing<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
decrease some other processing and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.940 
decrease some other processing and
that's<00:01:14.939> what<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.170> where<00:01:16.500> alpha

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that's what we think that where alpha

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
that's what we think that where alpha
oscillations<00:01:17.700> come<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.390> can

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
oscillations come in is that they can

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
oscillations come in is that they can
target<00:01:19.380> those<00:01:19.740> different<00:01:20.220> circuits

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
target those different circuits

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
target those different circuits
selectively<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.570> any<00:01:21.869> brain<00:01:22.140> area<00:01:22.439> can

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
selectively in any brain area can

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.060 
selectively in any brain area can
express<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.549> alpha<00:01:24.030> activity<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> way<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
express this alpha activity as a way to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
express this alpha activity as a way to
dampen<00:01:26.070> down<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.549> activity<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.210> it's

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
dampen down the activity there it's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.179 
dampen down the activity there it's
become<00:01:28.170> clearer<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.710> kind<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> give

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
become clearer you can kind of give

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.330 
become clearer you can kind of give
people<00:01:29.220> feedback<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.840> real<00:01:31.409> time<00:01:31.770> about<00:01:32.009> their

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
people feedback in real time about their

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.670 
people feedback in real time about their
alpha<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.390> measure<00:01:33.689> their<00:01:34.020> alpha<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
alpha so you can measure their alpha and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.609 
alpha so you can measure their alpha and
tell<00:01:35.159> them<00:01:35.400> how<00:01:35.549> how<00:01:36.000> much<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.350> say

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
tell them how how much they have and say

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.980 
tell them how how much they have and say
we<00:01:38.100> increase<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.810> don't

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
we increase it and they don't

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.960 
we increase it and they don't
necessarily<00:01:40.110> know<00:01:40.829> how<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.159> increase<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.850> but

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
necessarily know how to increase it but

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.210 
necessarily know how to increase it but
they<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.270> they'll<00:01:43.079> try<00:01:43.470> something<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.130> if

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
they just they'll try something and if

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.590 
they just they'll try something and if
it<00:01:44.280> works<00:01:44.520> you'll<00:01:44.759> give<00:01:44.909> them<00:01:45.060> feedback<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it works you'll give them feedback and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.810 
it works you'll give them feedback and
slowly<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.680> them<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.950> boost<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.579> or

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
slowly you can get them to boost up or

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.810 
slowly you can get them to boost up or
dampen<00:01:48.329> their<00:01:48.509> alpha<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.549> think<00:01:50.549> that's<00:01:50.700> a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
dampen their alpha I think that's a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.880 
dampen their alpha I think that's a
really<00:01:51.090> exciting<00:01:51.649> Avenue<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.770> research

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890

they'll stay like a tattoo onto your

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.650 
they'll stay like a tattoo onto your
head<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.640> can<00:02:50.790> imagine<00:02:51.000> people<00:02:51.480> wearing

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
head so you can imagine people wearing

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
them more permanently around the sides

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.449 
them more permanently around the sides
of<00:02:54.300> their<00:02:54.450> head<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.900> know<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.470> u.s.<00:02:55.830> archery

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
team and the marksmen team already uses

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.110 
team and the marksmen team already uses
portable<00:03:00.360> EEG<00:03:00.720> systems<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.860> train<00:03:02.489> people<00:03:02.940> to

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
portable EEG systems to train people to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.360 
portable EEG systems to train people to
get<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.630> right<00:03:03.830> cognitive<00:03:04.830> state<00:03:05.130> as

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
get in the right cognitive state as

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.340 
get in the right cognitive state as
they're<00:03:05.760> leading<00:03:06.000> into<00:03:06.330> their<00:03:06.450> Schatzi<00:03:07.110> and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
they're leading into their Schatzi and

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.530 
they're leading into their Schatzi and
they<00:03:07.769> know<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.310> certain<00:03:08.790> state<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
they know that a certain state is the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.020 
they know that a certain state is the
best<00:03:09.780> for<00:03:10.230> getting<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.980> optimal<00:03:11.550> targeting

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
best for getting the optimal targeting

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.030 
best for getting the optimal targeting
and<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.690> something<00:03:13.019> like<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.260> might<00:03:13.800> be

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
and so something like that might be

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.770 
and so something like that might be
better<00:03:14.250> not<00:03:14.459> just<00:03:14.670> for<00:03:14.850> archers<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.390> shooters

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
better not just for archers and shooters

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.140 
better not just for archers and shooters
and<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.140> Olympics<00:03:16.829> but<00:03:17.070> for<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.790> average

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
driving to get groceries should maybe

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.319 
driving to get groceries should maybe
also<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:23.250> something<00:03:23.579> warning<00:03:24.030> her<00:03:24.150> when

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
also have something warning her when

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.750 
also have something warning her when
she's<00:03:24.540> not<00:03:24.750> paying<00:03:24.989> attention<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.829> as<00:03:26.400> that

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
she's not paying attention and as that
