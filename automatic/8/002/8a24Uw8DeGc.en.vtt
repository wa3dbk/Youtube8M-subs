that I am cornrowing here for biracial

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.019 
that I am cornrowing here for biracial
here<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.450> have<00:00:16.320> tried<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.710> many<00:00:17.430> different<00:00:17.580> ways

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
here I have tried it many different ways

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.700 
here I have tried it many different ways
and<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.300> found<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> best<00:00:18.869> way<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.350> start

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and I found the best way is to start

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.640 
and I found the best way is to start
with<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.039> damp<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.630> dampen<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.470> with

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
with it damp and so I dampen it with

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.800 
with it damp and so I dampen it with
either<00:00:22.859> my<00:00:23.100> spray<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.730> else<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.119> start<00:00:24.600> right

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
either my spray or else I start right

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.570 
either my spray or else I start right
after<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> bath<00:00:25.590> or<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.859> shower<00:00:25.890> after<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> hair

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
after a bath or a shower after the hair

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.700 
after a bath or a shower after the hair
has<00:00:26.670> been<00:00:26.789> washed<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.269> conditioned<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.050> when

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
has been washed and conditioned and when

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.290 
has been washed and conditioned and when
I<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.859> cornrows<00:00:29.490> that's<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:29.939> time<00:00:30.119> where

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
I do cornrows that's the one time where

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.720 
I do cornrows that's the one time where
I<00:00:30.330> will<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.140> good<00:00:31.679> quality<00:00:32.099> natural<00:00:32.399> as

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
this section I'm going to start with

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.770 
this section I'm going to start with
here<00:00:43.800> you're<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> take<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> very<00:00:45.210> small

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
here you're going to take a very small

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.680 
here you're going to take a very small
section<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> top<00:00:46.710> there's<00:00:47.640> two<00:00:48.120> ways<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
section at the top there's two ways to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.380 
section at the top there's two ways to
do<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:48.960> underhand<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.920> overhand<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.670> found<00:00:51.120> I

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
do it underhand and overhand I found I

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.010 
do it underhand and overhand I found I
usually<00:00:51.960> keep<00:00:52.170> my<00:00:52.350> nails<00:00:52.559> short<00:00:53.219> and

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
usually keep my nails short and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.779 
usually keep my nails short and
underhand<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.289> when<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:56.219> fee<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.670> een

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
underhand is when you do fee I'm een

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
underhand is when you do fee I'm een
over<00:00:57.059> handles<00:00:57.329> when<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.660> your<00:00:57.809> fingertips

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
over handles when you do your fingertips

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
over handles when you do your fingertips
I<00:00:58.530> don't<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.129> way<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.520> my<00:00:59.820> nails<00:00:59.969> are

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
I don't do that way because my nails are

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.310 
I don't do that way because my nails are
always<00:01:00.449> shortened<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.930> way<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.289> just

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
always shortened this way it's just

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
always shortened this way it's just
easier<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.739> me<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.640> divide<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.210> hair

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
easier for me so you divide the hair

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.530 
easier for me so you divide the hair
into<00:01:03.570> three<00:01:03.870> sections<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.729> you're<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
into three sections and you're going to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.590 
into three sections and you're going to
just<00:01:06.810> put<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> hair<00:01:07.470> under<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> goes

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
just put the hair under so it goes

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
just put the hair under so it goes
outside<00:01:10.760> under<00:01:11.760> center<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> each<00:01:13.979> time<00:01:14.340> you're

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
outside under center so each time you're

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.570 
outside under center so each time you're
going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> bring<00:01:14.909> outside<00:01:15.689> under<00:01:16.590> Center<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
going to bring outside under Center and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.289 
going to bring outside under Center and
I<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.509> few<00:01:18.810> stitches<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.790> take<00:01:21.090> from

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
I do a few stitches and then I take from

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.179 
I do a few stitches and then I take from
the<00:01:21.509> center<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.930> always<00:01:22.650> take<00:01:22.890> from<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the center you always take from the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.370 
the center you always take from the
center<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.460> again<00:01:26.759> outside

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
center and then you go again outside

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.740 
center and then you go again outside
center<00:01:28.380> outside<00:01:29.280> Center<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.509> go<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
center outside Center and when you go to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.700 
center outside Center and when you go to
the<00:01:31.020> center<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.500> add<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.890> hair

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.330 

so<00:01:37.220> if<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:37.550> see<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:37.850> pinch<00:01:38.890> when<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:39.920> do<00:01:40.040> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
so if you see I pinch when I do the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.970 
so if you see I pinch when I do the
center<00:01:40.760> grab<00:01:41.150> right<00:01:42.140> there<00:01:42.410> that's<00:01:42.620> when<00:01:42.890> I'm

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
center grab right there that's when I'm

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.430

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.300 
placement this way you keep the hair on
the<00:01:50.720> sides<00:01:50.750> as<00:01:51.320> far<00:01:51.350> as<00:01:51.710> possible<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.190> that

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
the sides as far as possible so that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.440 
the sides as far as possible so that
they<00:01:52.580> don't<00:01:52.790> tangle<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:57.880> you're<00:01:58.880> constantly

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
they don't tangle and you're constantly

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.170 
they don't tangle and you're constantly
just<00:01:59.600> adding<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.470> hair<00:02:00.680> from<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:00.890> center<00:02:01.400> so
