gonna get titles anyway or you're going

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.770 
gonna get titles anyway or you're going
to<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.220> certain<00:01:38.549> things<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.509> don't<00:01:39.659> go

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
to get certain things I just don't go

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
to get certain things I just don't go
through<00:01:39.960> doing<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> challenges<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.430> used

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
through doing all the challenges it used

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.429 
through doing all the challenges it used
to<00:01:41.759> do<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> rank<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.450> faster<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.290> way

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
to do it to rank up faster but the way

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.560 
to do it to rank up faster but the way
the<00:01:43.619> point<00:01:43.860> system<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.340> now<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the point system is now you can do it so

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.240 
the point system is now you can do it so
much<00:01:45.720> faster<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.470> much<00:01:46.619> cleaner<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.040> you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
much faster and so much cleaner and you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.980 
much faster and so much cleaner and you
know<00:01:47.369> basically<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.850> ranking<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.540> anyway

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
know basically be ranking up anyway

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.050 
know basically be ranking up anyway
because<00:01:49.170> well<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.369> drop<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.670> shit<00:01:50.850> ton

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
because well you just drop it shit ton

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.030 
because well you just drop it shit ton
of<00:01:51.090> kills<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.630> lot<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.869> points<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.409> drop

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
of kills and a lot of points and drop

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160 
of kills and a lot of points and drop
some<00:01:53.280> swarms<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.149> you're<00:01:54.450> usually<00:01:54.630> good<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
some swarms and you're usually good and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.660 
some swarms and you're usually good and
you're<00:01:55.259> gonna<00:01:55.350> rank<00:01:55.649> up<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:56.189> really<00:01:56.490> super

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you're gonna rank up really really super

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.240 
you're gonna rank up really really super
fast<00:01:56.939> anyway<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.899> why<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.409> around<00:01:58.680> trying<00:01:58.979> to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
fast anyway so why go around trying to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.670 
fast anyway so why go around trying to
you<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.759> break<00:02:00.090> your<00:02:00.270> legs<00:02:00.479> jump<00:02:00.869> 15<00:02:01.350> feet

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you know break your legs jump 15 feet

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.770 
you know break your legs jump 15 feet
jump<00:02:02.219> 30<00:02:02.460> feet<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.850> kill<00:02:03.000> yourself<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.659> do

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
jump 30 feet and kill yourself and do

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.539 
jump 30 feet and kill yourself and do
all<00:02:03.930> those<00:02:04.079> stupid<00:02:04.380> bootcamp<00:02:04.950> challenges

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
all those stupid bootcamp challenges

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.639 
all those stupid bootcamp challenges
you're<00:02:05.670> probably<00:02:05.850> gonna<00:02:06.060> do<00:02:06.240> anyway<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you're probably gonna do anyway and you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.279 
you're probably gonna do anyway and you
know<00:02:07.680> try<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> knife<00:02:08.580> kill<00:02:08.910> 30<00:02:09.539> times<00:02:09.959> or

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
know try to get a knife kill 30 times or

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.530 
know try to get a knife kill 30 times or
the<00:02:10.410> blade<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.099> 30<00:02:11.550> times<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.120> ballistic

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.690 
knife
yeah<00:02:13.650> there's<00:02:13.830> no<00:02:13.920> point<00:02:14.100> doing<00:02:14.220> those<00:02:14.460> little

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
yeah there's no point doing those little

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.430 
yeah there's no point doing those little
challenges<00:02:15.090> yes<00:02:15.420> they<00:02:15.600> do<00:02:15.660> give<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.110> points

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
challenges yes they do give you points

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.110 
challenges yes they do give you points

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
but it's not something I really cared a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.420 
but it's not something I really cared a
half<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.410> it's<00:02:19.590> whatever<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.250> gotta

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
whatever you don't have a team that you

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.680 
whatever you don't have a team that you
know<00:05:10.410> necessarily<00:05:10.980> is<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.190> greatest<00:05:11.550> then<00:05:12.330> it

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
know necessarily is the greatest then it

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.780 
know necessarily is the greatest then it
makes<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.930> complete<00:05:13.050> difference<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:13.920> you<00:05:14.610> know

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
makes a complete difference and you know

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.690 
makes a complete difference and you know
a<00:05:15.030> lot<00:05:15.330> of<00:05:15.480> it<00:05:15.600> is<00:05:15.870> learned<00:05:16.440> like<00:05:17.220> I<00:05:17.370> guess
