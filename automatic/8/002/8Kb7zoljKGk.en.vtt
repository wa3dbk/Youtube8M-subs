00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.540

 recognizes its very green color 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.580
 and now let's go down a little bit again in the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.740
 Poitou-Charentes region more precisely Aquitaine but we 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.920
 are on the special bench arguin 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.360
 that holidaymakers who go to the cap ferret know well percent the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.380
 liter at the really imposing size at the back beautiful almost metallic 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.380

 we finally finish the tasting 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.290
 e on an oyster that comes from the Mediterranean and more specifically the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.159
 thau lagoon 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.279
 we call it corals at special 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.620
 special obviously for its size euros because of the color 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.539
 preferring the flair hurt a lot 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.319
 almost perfect 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.620
 what is interesting in this tasting is you have both 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.019
 so August 18 at the imposing size and fleshy 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.140
 soon after very important to me it was much more goals 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.260
 discreet it's a war we presented before 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.359
 how long have I been 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.649
 the appointment per year 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.510
 no, unfortunately it's something we keep confidential 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.799
 what we can tell you is about the selection for you proposed 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.819
 especially for example at gilardo we are surprised at a 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.949
 of a quantity by his parents over 10 tons a little advice for 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.999
 taste properly unique 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:50.699
 we throw in the water 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.120
 always to always wait the second in why because the first water 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.830
 and often marked by the osce which is called the lot of washing, that is to say 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.800
 before sending the oysters or there always 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.590
 we always wash them and so it is better to ubs to pour this 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.410
 surplus water 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.830
 to focus on the second mother bypasses made inside so 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.869
 seashell and which is much more interesting from this point of view 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.059
 he took a very big novelty in all your holidays to him 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:16.549
 since a few years 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.169
 not quite a novelty so global in fact we just launched 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.980

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.739
 replaces who come not replace paper cards obviously interest 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.650
 ecological 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.620
 marc interest is unequally what does this allow us both 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.439
 to consult geographical maps 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.109
 from our letter that we could see outside there is little 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:36.729
 of time 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.159
 it is also interesting for all rafael benitez our products 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.540

 stéphane keller the first action of the mighty 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.479

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.639
 hudon is big shell 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.699
 - like this 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.689

 and then it was at that moment stéphane that we put the author 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.610
 absolutely 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.610

 10:05 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.150
 if the pure sound 2 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.229
 so the final touches abutments a copy aching are very much we 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:57.830

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.360
 smoked of ladoucette in 1602 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.069
 we are on the freshness of minerality and I think we are well 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.190

 when it's good 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.219
 there is no better
