00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.610
 excellent news since I am very 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.670
 pleased to announce that the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.360
 untethered jailbreak of ios 7 is finally 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.859
 available 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.690
 so we've been waiting for him all since 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.880
 several months he is finally here 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.160
 compatible with all devices and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.990
 all versions of ios is a 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.070
 jailbreak of untethered type it means 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.560
 it's just a jailbreak 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 complete you will have if there installed on 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.189
 your iphone ipod touch and ipad and you 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 will not need any software or 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.630
 any tools to restart it 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.790

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.289
 3 and 7 points 0.4 for the moment so 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.120
 as usual I propose a 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.690
 very simple method to achieve this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 jailbreak 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.449
 all you have to do is 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.829
 click on the link found in 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.660
 the description of the video to be 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.370
 redirected to my website and to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.930
 the full tutorial where you can 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.270
 especially download the software of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.100
 escape jailbreak once you 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.750
 have downloaded it for windows or for 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.309
 mac you plug your iphone your 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.189
 ipod touch or your ipad to your 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.630
 computer with usb dock cable 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.560
 escape recognizes it if you have a 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.060
 security code 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.220
 wanting to lift then you can click 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.450
 on jailbreak so we only have one button to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.530
 click that's why I told you 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.900
 in the beginning of the video it's really 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.890
 extremely simple then you 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.810
 wait while the jailbreak 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.400
 start I remind you that it 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.439
 works for any iphone 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.900
 any ipod touch and any 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.570
 what ipod seals is so for ipod 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.619

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.780

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.439

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.049
 second generation 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.460
 so to get back to the jailbreak at 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.810
 after a while escape will you 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.180
 say that you can unlock your 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.350
 device and on the second page you 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.290
 see a new icon 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.640

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.750
 just a little bit above for 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.009
 able to pursue the escape jailbreak 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.140

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.210
 Handling and restarting your device 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.649
 it was the only manipulation you had 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.020
 to do now you just need 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.810
 just wait your iphone is going 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.160

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.870
 on faith and after a while 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.630
 you will see this screen that appears 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.370
 with the escape logo and software 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.760
 who loads the jailbreak on your 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.590
 apparatus 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.390
 so you do not disconnect and especially not 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.819

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.170
 moment gives 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.180
 you can close the little software and 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.769
 then the jailbreak is over you 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.110

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.140
 past if you have it work you can 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.030
 unplug your iphone your ipod touch 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.350

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.840
 wait while the packages get 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.069
 charge then that cydia then restarts 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.930
 once it's done you 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.819
 unlock your device you can 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.750
 return to cydia is the first 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.819
 thing you're going to have to do 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.370
 select your user type 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.260
 so I'm going to pick this one you 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.090
 do hockey and then cydia charge 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.799
 for a few seconds and you 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.870
 land on the home page it's 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.459
 all good your jailbreak is over 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.680
 cydia is very well installed and 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.480
 perfectly functional so there is 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.160
 maybe one or two little bugs and the 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.500
 ios's first jailbreak is it will 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.120
 corrected later and especially thought about 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.790

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.600
 are compatible with this jailbreak so 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.829
