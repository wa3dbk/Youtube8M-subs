00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:04.279
 why the complex numbers to do you look at why he finds you 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.180
 Numbers that are spread out in the plain these Enztal are indeed on the 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.119
 Numbers beam 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.369
 Kemmer is to say 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.809
 warm find I paid in the just laid out just out of laziness 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.980
 otherwise it will 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.380
 they are mathematical in the snow science that is exciting though 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.380
 in engineering only hold women 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.779
 the reason is the so-called Rollers identity percent 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.750
 identity 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.190
 the families do not have to justify 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.070
 the identity founders we see that it is a me no drama though 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.040
 it takes half an hour to come to mind 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010
 despite persecution of 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.940
 if I generalize the exponential function more generally then 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.040
 that also takes complex numbers 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.850
 if I can do that 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.640
 a complex power of p 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.640
 how high two beers former 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.930
 Georg half Wehrer 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.960
 just 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.770
 the root outlook exactly their high - 1 would be expressed normal 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.130
 I mean exactly 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.980
 and here one comes from the absurd thoughts of thinking about what they like 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.080
 Ever Something has been down to this invented TSA 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.050
 Kandern super think about what the Evoque the Milanese should be on very 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.690
 Of course, building that obviously has nothing to do with it 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.500
 to do 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.410
 so direct direct and relate do not fix so obviously uncomfortable 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.590
 It's a very natural way of saying what they do 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.590
 goethe-uni something is 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.280
 and then find 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 that this is nothing else than the one in the big house 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.290
 from which stands much better 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.509
 + the times of service - 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.840
 from these many 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.980
 simply naked Satan she Georgi Malicks is equal big Sixtus never minus 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.780
 x 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.780
 for all 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.070
 from the BN numbers so big complex numbers is not 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.580
 this property does not mean that 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.309
 instead of counting on the great son of Victor 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.619
 with which you can count on its function it is much easier with the function too 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.749
 counting is having big goals to report 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:19.489
 that's the big one 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.930
 these stories Lakos US the sum of two angles Alfa + Peter 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.699
 Percent monster out went with ADITION Co 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.339
 what is the photos Peter 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.769
 Buzzing exponents 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.059
 the product of 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.559
 potencies 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.379
 if they have that at the sum 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.269
 in the function that that is relatively cheap if they have that of Cosynus and when 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.380
 they have a sole 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.229
 has been the recession in Russian Katyn 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:55.319
 Totality that is the reason why you do not believe you stand in Bohmte 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.459
 Tell numbers 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.099
 one does 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.539
 Grosse pillion unemployed 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:05.749
 and instead count on the marriage of Zion 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.969
 what is the reason to use concrete numbers 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:10.580
 it was a mediator reckoning 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.610
 Do not put too much under it Philosophy is just one 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.799
 computational trick 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.869
 to be able to treat vibrations more easily 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.449
 passively Bernanke 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.409
 Prudhomme the 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.409
 complex numbers in total 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.769
 a long chain 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.409
 Numbers areas 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.549
 the Greens so far are the complex numbers 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.359
 and it started with the natural numbers 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.169
 from 1 upwards 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.840
 a real clock lot of it are in the lucky creams 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.869
 only upwards 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:49.539
 the whole numbers of it a real upper amount the negative to it 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.189
 the rational numbers 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.849
 So the breaks too 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.199
 pro and then the percentages so only two piquet to 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:01.549
 over the complex numbers are 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.759
 even bigger 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.759
 you can say that the real numbers 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.539
 this dispute came 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.489
 if they 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.059
 to watch 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:16.090
 is that really 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.189
 the crowd of dancers 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:20.829
 this is demonized 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.340
 5 +0 Marlene 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.340
 this is 2+ normals 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.330
 this axis 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.849
 all points that are exactly on the stock 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.809
 Iran axis 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:36.759
 are the amount of Iran numbers they are the quantity comes that is all clear 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.009
 greater 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.009
 be as the amount of the world 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.830
 a real upper ranks 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.660
 With the numbers ranges they usually come through in focus 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.350
 already hinted "There is further 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.280
 the intel numbers 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.230
 it is, so to speak, a two-dimensional surface 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.730
 Pay Paternion can use the other in robotics if they have anything 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.099
 do with space travel or 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.120
 Planes probably also orientation describe rotation 

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:06.939
 describe 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:07.889
 but rare 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.849
 typically what a soft-watered bender is paying for 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.009
 definitely complex numbers 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.719
 because everything that happens with vibrations, whether it is in the grid voltage is the 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.740
 AC voltage from the grid 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.270
 around 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.509
 if there are any atoms that are swinging 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.250
 whatever you can do with the EU immediately if that works 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.280
 with complex figures
