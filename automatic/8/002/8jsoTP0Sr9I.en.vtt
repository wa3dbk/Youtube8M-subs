00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.620
 young and innocent of the brz is the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.010
 tenderest temptation since it's compact 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.290
 sports coupes give the four meters 24 long 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.630
 body already promises on the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.010
 first look with me you can have fun 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.949
 have and no obligations no 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.460
 gram fat too much no beguiling line 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.640
 too little of the brz after 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.390
 attention 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.610
 the focus is on his mission 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.100
 beauty with features the canal ferry 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.460
 name rear spoilers hold the hind legs 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.129
 im to the typical subaru under the long 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.420
 hood boxes a four-cylinder his 200 ps 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.260
 Performance direction behind you only 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.829
 the most important 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.230
 also the interior only one purpose 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.230
 focus on essential driving 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.470
 we are sitting here in the subaru brz that is 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.640
 the new community development with 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.190
 toyota subaru has a real one 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.420
 sports car put on the wheels 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:16.170
 he has a four-wheel drive rear-wheel drive 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.890
 boxer motor good subaru is well known for 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.770
 boxer motors but just for the first time 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.950
 for a long time a subaru with 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.110
 rear -wheel drive not all-wheel drive 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.190
 youngest scion from the house subaru goes 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.190
 another way 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.170
 in contrast to the big brother wrx is 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.970
 less and less under him 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.649
 the hood 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.180
 the two-liter boxer is a pure one 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.350
 suction motor so not charged 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.300
 is represented you see 1000 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.200
 turns and you have to 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.450
 really turn 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.340
 that same 200 ps to the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.750
 rear axle so over four and a half 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.789
 a thousand is going on again 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.530
 at 5,000 then you really do it 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.689
 fun 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.420
 slim 205 newton meters provide for 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:08.920
 moderate passage shows for the prestige 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.800
 Now let's see how the brz 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.760
 with his two-liter boxer like that 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.700
 accelerated esp is already the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.540
 activated he needs a pretty high 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.540
 represented 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.380
 Yes 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:32.920
 you really have to answer that 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.800
 meet that hatch but has 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.210
 not too much but speed allowed 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.660
 Do not break anything in the cellar 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.970
 therefore no performance in 7.1 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.860
 seconds it goes to 100 tempo 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.950
 Half a second faster than the factory 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.600
 specified next task the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:05.470
 recovered propulsion again 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:09.580
 negate pedal feeling first league 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.410
 brake your second rate after 37 9 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.060
 meters, the japanese comes to a standstill 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.370
 a car that demands a firmer hand 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.950
 nothing for daydreamers and tempomat 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.600
 fetishists a balanced companion 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.600
 for the everyday driving pleasure 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.900
 the weight distribution of the baz is 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.000
 it has almost parity subaru 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.290
 managed the weight distribution well 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.850
 balance 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:48.390
 it's nearly 50 50 exactly 53 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.580
 percent of the weight in front 47 at the back 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.450
 You can tell that by the following 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.540
 drive 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.090
 the car is very neutral it is neither 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.340
 especially strong under still over steering 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.440
 so i can make it ideal by the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.650
 drive curve because it is always accurate car 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.510
 remains of the concept should be the 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.000
 brz year really good at slalom 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.880
 beat with the neutral 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.380
 weight distribution and in fact he 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.420
 steers class 1 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.040
 with the rear axle handlebars with 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.310
 but easy to control 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.370
 the steering ideally located not too sharp 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.390
 So that's really easy to drive 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:30.170
 with 63 3 km h the baz dance through the 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.170
 little parcours 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.349
 Understeer there is hardly but if you 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.460
 you want to be so beautiful about 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.230
 control 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.969
 almost hits 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.879
 how I want 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.829
 The steering is so precise that I 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:54.379
 always bring them back immediately 

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:57.669
 So it can really work like that 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.669
 just as long no more 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.550
 brz are fabric for every patriot 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.930
 tangible fulfillment 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.930
 every male dream
