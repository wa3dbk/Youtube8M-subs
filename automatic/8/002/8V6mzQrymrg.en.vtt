00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello good here lie 19 in hunter's 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.730
 trophies we go for the super trophy 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.080
 compensation third mission of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.950
 special operations in three stars 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.910
 excessive reaction 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.070
 a good mission that can be carried 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.580
 easily 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.400
 apart we have the night vision that 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.230
 both inside with the smoke as much as 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.259
 outside with the smoke like inside can we 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.089
 help a lot 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.879
 and well now we will start to see the 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.329
 video and if they tell you some tricks 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.980
 some things 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.390
 just start you have to for the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.270
 organization 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.559
 the night vision because next to the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.879
 boat will smoke to the right and the 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.460
 left of which will come a 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.329
 furtive of Carl Zeiss from there comes the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.010
 first on the right and we kill 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.460
 and they settled on the left portal 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 elevated 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.239
 with the pump 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.190
 and we enter calderÃ³n 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.730
 well then here with care 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.600
 it took me a little more crazy 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.290
 we have plenty of time to 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.770
 turn it off 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.929
 the impending merger 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.609
 and good to no movement or balls in 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.880
 the technique but for example for 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:24.740
 locate enemies comes in handy 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.250
 If, for example, it does not strike well, 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.250
 technique 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 Well, nothing killed him 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.630
 and we go with the one on the right 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.050
 and well, we get ready and we continue 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.100
 going down more to 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.030
 a bad weariness 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.030
 for this they will leave 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.090
 we both take care of them and now by the center 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.740
 we need to kill everyone as you see me 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.760
 leave inside the left there are who 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.300
 Relax, you are seeing me 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.000
 better to the gods is very close 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.090
 we drag the ones on the right and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.920
 we recharged and we went to deactivate the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.140
 impending merger 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.180
 they shot us they will always shoot us not 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.480
 nothing happens they will kill you in principle no 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.040
 we saw nothing because we were going 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.340
 to the complete that shortens distances is 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.340
 the best 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.330
 in remembering 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.670
 and until we get out of here it happens 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.319
 not good if you change 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.430
 they shoot me but here we change to 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.239
 the technique that comes in handy 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.599
 so we owe it to all the 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.599
 mandates 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.930
 we have 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.450
 still I am killing as are the forgotten 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.630
 they are not as difficult as nothing 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.550
 previous 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.440
 ok and here we have to go back to 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.210
 change the thermal because they are in the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.930
 smoke 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.930
 Well, no 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.340
 of the other showed when the others 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.990
 and the game a little 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.690
 we have to be careful can kill and 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.110
 better to be careful we do not have to 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.110
 To repeat 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:53.200
 that is, you can throw them away 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:55.770
 mowers and grenades good now for 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.510
 the embroidery threw it 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.060
 at any time you can get to both 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.390
 to the players at heights like the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.670
 grenades 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.020
 and they come pretty well Balearic we do not go 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.230
 on the left we will be 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.470
 how many and as soon as we tell these 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.150
 Well, we will not have passed it 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.930
 in the bilingual radio 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.930
 the word 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.420
 if you do not let them get close they'll shoot 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.520
 so shoot them fast what they 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.430
 pointing to the homeland and well then 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.160
 is already in mom is the last one and already 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.500
 they organize is complicated 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.150
 because nothing we are not here will have to 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.150
 wait for the helicopter to arrive 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.080
 and nothing more 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.610
 I hope you liked it already 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.540
 you know I like favorite channel and I 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.540
 I ask until soon
