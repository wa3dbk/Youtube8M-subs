00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
 hayatou nostra zac so your 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.319
 today for a brand new dolega 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.930
 today a video preview of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.710
 cards for 16 ultimate team versus 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.000
 at the last episode I could do 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.870
 to see there frankly there is a lot of 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.549
 good feedback 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.289
 compared to these series I see you 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.910
 enjoy and in addition you have 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.199
 really a lot of players so that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.000
 especially puts for example kevin de bruyne 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.039
 true to propose of course I will you 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.119
 in any case, it's a pleasure even if 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.380
 on the last episode I believe there is 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.699
 had a little less garlic than on the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.960
 last two but that is no more 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.429
 bordeaux I hope at least you 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.260
 enjoy this series we will start with 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.899
 the first player to be the goalkeeper 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.670
 spanish iker casillas who signed the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.770
 side of the fc porto he was a little 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.629
 little I spoke to you in madrid while he 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.950
 had spent his entire career and made 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.090
 really tremendous season by 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.000
 past but it's true that hey he has a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.350
 little less good from year to year and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 that's why I lower them again 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.430
 frozen 1083 system went badly to 82 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.280
 but you so good we'll leave when 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.050
 even 83 at once no porto it will be a 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.760
 good little rookie for him it is not necessary 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.440
 forget that he's still 34 years old 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.949
 casillas was not great too 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.180
 for a guard 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.030
 so I think he'll do the trick there 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.580
 will have a league player 1 so that's it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.619
 hold upright fall the losc player 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.100
 the Moroccan who arrived by condensing 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.689
 so I have the last wintry transfer window 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.400
 is in any case he will have a nice map 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.229
 I always think with 4 and 2 I try 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.670
 that michele bad foot he will be in 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.500
 right winger but to note also that he 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 could possibly be old or blunt 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.180
 he can play on the three positions and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.290
 hawaii beautiful card 73 money frankly 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.150
 I think it will be one of the best 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.560
 money players and I did not want to put 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.500
 more because ben he proved that a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.320
 half season in league 1 there will be faouzi 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.869
 ghoulam the Algerian who evolves on the side of the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.790
 napoli the former former Saint Etienne who 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.439
 makes a very very good season of 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.970
 naples side and in selection 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.220
 Algerian he is very good too 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.210
 so I'm adding a star of 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.920
 technical sheriff so I think he 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.600
 could have three bad feet 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.090
 always four and especially I 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.680
 was passing 74 to 78 in that could be 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.780
 one of the best left defender of 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.909
 series a and even maybe why not 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.490
 of the game with a very very beautiful card I 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.560
 think because the vdn 24,74 now 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.210
 passed to robin van persie 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 yes I know the card froze a little bit 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.950
 a little bit missed but I have not found 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.340
 better 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.890
 about photos with at 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.010
 fenerbahÃ§e himself signed just recently 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.290
 so that's it I think he'll have 86 of 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.000
 notes of ginals small drop of 2 already 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.000
 I think the last som for me there 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.500
 merit is to have 87 and boletes like 88 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.150
 but frankly it will be a very 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.530
 good player maybe he'll have 87 I do not 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
 do not know but I do not see people in 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.049
 below 86 he will always have very 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.459
 beautiful stats with its four stars 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.629
 technical gestures and wet the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.030
 feet on a very nice shot that in 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.060
 then took it to kevin to grind so 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.040
 to finish the Belgian resource player 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.360
 so that 's his card not going too 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.380
 changed to the stars I know 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.180
 that they always feet us four 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.530
 celtic star and 5 stars but 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.299
 the feet but he's going to especially take a 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.950
 big increase for me I put 86 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.090
 so maybe it's being abused 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.200
 but no I do not find it because it has 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.480
 was truly one of the best 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.069
 young chaplain threatening bass 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.049
 was the best player simply and 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.010
 global members if any of all 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.049
 best right now so for me 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.459
 deserve this 86 and frankly he will have 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.110
 a map but really really 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.670
 hallucinating France it will be the best 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.290
 blunted from the game or so really not 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.760
 far but yeah I think frankly 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.420
 his card at prg is really very very 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.489
 very like 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.780
 so here are the 101 new ones that these five 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.250
 new players will want to please 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.650
 you disagree with me 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.049
 guys and space comments for me 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.250
 to share your opinion say me here 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.319
 what you may have put to my 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.690
 place and then it's always nice 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.609
 and here is nice is not so much to propose 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.989
 other players for the next 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.030
 episodes here I know that there is not bad 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.139
 low paul who come back a lot of 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.430
 league players 1 had been trying to 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.139
 diversify a little bit of not put 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.639
 hurt other players championship 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.049
 even if it's true you're not my 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.430
 league 1 for the most part if you are 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.829
 French is normal but try a 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.880
 little bit of them diversified and that's me 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.260
 I tell you next time for a 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.880
 all the videos I hope very much appreciated 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.880
 and it was razak beit lahya
