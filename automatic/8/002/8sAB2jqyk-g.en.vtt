those okay so the two things that make
this<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.220> quite<00:01:23.610> unique<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.360> tripod<00:01:24.630> head

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
this one quite unique for a tripod head

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.280 
this one quite unique for a tripod head
first<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.060> locking<00:01:27.570> mechanism<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
first of all the locking mechanism it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.359 
first of all the locking mechanism it
has<00:01:28.320> let's<00:01:28.890> give<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:31.369> so

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
has let's give you a look at that so

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.210 
has let's give you a look at that so
instead<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.360> traditional<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:35.100> know

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
instead of your traditional you know

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.859 
instead of your traditional you know
screw<00:01:35.790> down<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.180> something<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.780> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
screw down or something this one you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.630 
screw down or something this one you
push<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.439> button<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.009> plate<00:01:38.250> slides

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
push down this button the plate slides

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.810 
push down this button the plate slides
in<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.280> rotate<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.520> dial

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
in and then you just rotate this dial

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.789 
in and then you just rotate this dial
forward<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.810> further<00:01:43.020> your<00:01:43.200> oh<00:01:43.290> tater<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
forward to further your oh tater the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.859 
forward to further your oh tater the
tighter<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.250> gets<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.240> locks<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.720> in

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
tighter it gets and that locks it in

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539 
tighter it gets and that locks it in
place<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.680> wiggled<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> bit<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.430> that

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
place that wiggled a bit because that

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700 
place that wiggled a bit because that
this<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> column<00:01:48.270> undone<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.259> locks<00:01:49.500> it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
this in a column undone that locks it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.179 
this in a column undone that locks it
down<00:01:50.030> okay<00:01:51.259> undo<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.500> then<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.890> gives

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
down okay undo it and then that gives

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.760 
down okay undo it and then that gives
you<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.490> wiggle<00:01:53.820> room<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.240> other<00:01:54.770> unusual

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you your wiggle room the other unusual

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to this position it gives you you know

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.140 
to this position it gives you you know
full<00:02:08.910> movement<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.110> rotate<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.770> all

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
full movement you can rotate it in all

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.920 
full movement you can rotate it in all
areas<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:13.290> no<00:02:14.130> problem<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.670> if<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.930> increase

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
areas and no problem and if you increase

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.360 
areas and no problem and if you increase
the<00:02:16.170> tension<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.620> little<00:02:16.860> bit<00:02:17.010> then<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.250> can

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
the tension a little bit then you can

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.280 
the tension a little bit then you can
have<00:02:17.550> nice<00:02:17.790> amount<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.270> resistance<00:02:18.570> there<00:02:19.050> so

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
have nice amount of resistance there so

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.740 
have nice amount of resistance there so
it's<00:02:19.410> nice<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.830> fluid<00:02:20.330> however<00:02:21.330> if<00:02:21.600> you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
it's nice and fluid however if you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.170 
it's nice and fluid however if you
switch<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.620> back<00:02:22.800> then<00:02:23.460> that<00:02:23.670> locks<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.150> down

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
switch it back then that locks it down

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.010 
switch it back then that locks it down
and<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.720> extra<00:02:25.680> rotation<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.580> taken<00:02:27.030> out<00:02:27.210> so

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
and that extra rotation is taken out so

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.070 
and that extra rotation is taken out so
you've<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.290> got<00:02:28.800> more<00:02:29.730> precise<00:02:30.240> movements

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
you've just got more precise movements

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.310 
you've just got more precise movements
and<00:02:31.260> then<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.580> know<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.940> other<00:02:32.970> ones<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
and then you know the other ones the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.170 
and then you know the other ones the
legs<00:02:34.560> snap<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.340> out<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.610> place<00:02:35.790> really

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
legs snap in and out of place really

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.170 
legs snap in and out of place really
easily<00:02:36.570> because<00:02:37.080> they're<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.530> lightweight

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
easily because they're so lightweight

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.090 
easily because they're so lightweight

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
just throw them open pull it down and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.460 
just throw them open pull it down and
it's<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.090> quick<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.630> as<00:02:43.200> quick<00:02:43.440> to
