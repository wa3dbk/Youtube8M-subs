00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.340
 of the description this game the truth

 is that it is highly recommended more pomegranate 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.100
 for its graphics and for its gameplay I'm going 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.760
 I'm going to open the game 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.060
 until this gp crypt 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.060
 two 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.660

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.950
 unlimited coins that I invite you to 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.430
 what space in the android video 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.280
 future if they want to have the video 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.910
 with 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.740
 forgive the game with unlimited coins 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.450
 well once here in the game to see 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.750
 want I'm going to lower the volume a little 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.340
 good touch from bumps and listen 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.200
 the bottom of the fan but here 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 It's very hot and I really do not 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.859
 I hold 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.750
 good in the main menu we have the 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.359
 online career option that 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.969
 means playing online that the truth is 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:28.280
 in a way does not prohibit it richard lens 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.500
 I do not know why it's all 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.840
 ways when analyzing something multiplayer not 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.770
 I know but well let's give career 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.659
 and all these types will appear to us 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.520
 of racing as you see we need 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.539
 stars to go unlocking the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.539
 other courts 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.369
 so far help unblock you're 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.369
 Let's see, let's go back 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.280
 in settings, we're going to do it 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.280
 links 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.270
 in controls 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.500
 I recommend you activate all the 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:18.750
 sensitivity to drive better 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.670
 we go back in graphics 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.590
 well I have that in resolution at 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.810
 maximum and that will depend on your game 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.690
 your type of device 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.300
 we go back we go back and see if 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.300
 we are going to 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.350
 start the game we are going to put the 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.350
 first that the easiest 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.060
 how she passed me you're 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.400
 in my case my device score many 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.520
 load it seems to me that this game I can 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.510
 run the level of 3 although I do not remember 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.450
 if it was the one returned but maybe if 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.960
 walk since it ends completely fluid as 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.260
 see the graphics are excellent enough 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.260
 good 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.840
 good control of the game is accelerates 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.010
 alone and we will have to tilt 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.860
 the device 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.860
 to grip the curves well 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.939
 and not crash here on the ramp we could 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.730
 do as you see I just did some kind 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:35.090
 of pirouette or something like that will help us 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.030
 win the turbo to go faster as 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.180
 come here is the turbo bar above 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.349
 that if we touch the flame it will begin 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.349
 to go fast 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.379
 to go filling the turbo bar 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.959
 we'll have to go pirouetting every 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.829
 Once we approach a ramp 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.780
 you just have to do some 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.470
 combination of fingers with two fingers 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.620
 with both thumbs and now some kind 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.980
 back and it will help us increase the 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.980
 Turbo 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.610
 it seems to me that my passion a bit with the 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.170
 sensitivity of the game 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.419
 but I come back 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.430
 I remind you, the graphics are excellent 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.430
 obviously it depends on the device in the 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.090
 to play them but in this they look very 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.680
 good 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.260
 the game I'm telling you is pretty 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.850
 entertaining about the 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.440
 combinations to make the jumps 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.600
 can be anyone can be is 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.030
 up is down or on the sides 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.820
 anyway better and we will win the 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.460
 same amount of shift nit 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.730
 good and finish the race I left 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.730
 First 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.770
 As you see give us money every time 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.220
 we won and experience we give to 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.220
 continuous 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.570
 and well I think that would be all 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.009
 let's see I'm going to change the 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.009
 accessibility of the game because 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:08.439
 the truth that I put a little we're going 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.889
 to controls and we put it around more or 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:15.539
 less a little more than half that yes 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.539
 let's go back 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.560
 if we play here we can win more money 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.710
 but I think you have to pay if you like that 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.250
 It is with a credit card if we give it 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.069
 here where is the username 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.680
 we can say that they have the silver 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:39.480
 necessary to increase the characteristic 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.700
 of our of our watercraft 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.860
 as you can see I only have in full of great 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.340
 because I already spent everything as I have the 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:51.270
 money hub I could increase everything 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:55.880
 and we can also buy new ones 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.880
 Jet skis which you want 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.730
 we can paint our own our 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.240
 own motorcycle and also our suit what 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.240
 we can change 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.990
 which one you like the most in a case 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.050
 different and I can change the green color 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.810
 by yellow 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.970
 or by red to see 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.360
 there's going to come in if we give it to 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:25.409
 save 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.409
 in buin and we can buy new motorcycles 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:31.139
 and it seems to me that this cava would be 

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:32.729
 the review of this great game will undoubtedly 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.729
 I recommend you install them in your 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:39.449

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:41.549
