00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
being a part of the whole thing what

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.920 
being a part of the whole thing what
sort<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.320> stands<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.800> your<00:00:55.829> mind<00:00:56.039> nah<00:00:56.930> just

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
sort of stands out in your mind nah just

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.650 
sort of stands out in your mind nah just
obviously<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.760> game<00:01:00.059> five<00:01:00.329> is

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
obviously then you know game five is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.709 
obviously then you know game five is
pretty<00:01:01.020> cool<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.800> uh<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.370> think<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
pretty cool but uh I think just like the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.910 
pretty cool but uh I think just like the
Denver<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.339> Houston<00:01:05.760> series<00:01:06.000> were<00:01:06.860> by<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
Denver in the Houston series were by the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.320 
Denver in the Houston series were by the
way<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.460> kind<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> gel<00:01:08.939> their<00:01:09.119> team

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
way I think kind of gel their team

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.980 
way I think kind of gel their team
together<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> toughness<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.770> them

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.150 

especially<00:01:13.990> late<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.200> that<00:01:14.380> Denver<00:01:14.770> series

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
especially late in that Denver series

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.940 
especially late in that Denver series
five<00:01:15.760> and<00:01:16.000> six<00:01:16.240> or<00:01:16.540> think<00:01:17.320> what<00:01:17.500> kind<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.770> put

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
five and six or think what kind of put

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.620 
five and six or think what kind of put
us<00:01:17.980> over<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.280> edge<00:01:18.430> thinking<00:01:19.330> that<00:01:19.450> we<00:01:19.600> could

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
us over the edge thinking that we could

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.780 
us over the edge thinking that we could
win<00:01:19.960> this<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.890> could<00:01:21.040> just<00:01:21.070> see<00:01:21.400> it<00:01:21.430> on<00:01:21.700> the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
win this you could just see it on the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.580 
win this you could just see it on the
board<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.300> how<00:01:22.660> guys<00:01:22.870> are<00:01:23.080> playing<00:01:23.320> after

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
board and how guys are playing after

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.100 
board and how guys are playing after
that<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:25.360> did<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.510> try<00:01:25.660> to<00:01:25.690> bring<00:01:25.990> in

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110

that what did you try to bring in
practice<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:26.980> I<00:01:27.160> think<00:01:27.520> you<00:01:27.790> said<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.150> you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
burn a guy's burdens sort of like that

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.610 
burn a guy's burdens sort of like that
was<00:01:31.060> your<00:01:31.210> chance<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.660> sort<00:01:31.870> of<00:01:32.020> contribute
