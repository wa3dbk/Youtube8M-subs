00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.200 
of it this tinted moisturizer I actually
don't<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.380> had<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> while<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
don't like I had it for a while and the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
don't like I had it for a while and the
formula<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.869> doesn't<00:01:37.259> work<00:01:37.380> after<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.799> while

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
formula just doesn't work after a while

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.890 
formula just doesn't work after a while
and<00:01:38.340> when<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> put<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.270> skin<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.570> kind<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and when I put it on my skin and kind of

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.530 
and when I put it on my skin and kind of
flakes<00:01:40.170> off<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.430> i<00:01:41.520> combine<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:42.299> two

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
flakes off so if i combine these two

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.120 
flakes off so if i combine these two
together<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.259> mix<00:01:43.530> them<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> palm<00:01:44.100> of

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
together like I mix them on the palm of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
together like I mix them on the palm of
my<00:01:44.399> hand<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.850> then<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.329> them<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.570> my<00:01:45.600> face

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
my hand and then I put them on my face

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.600 
my hand and then I put them on my face
with<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.110> Beauty<00:01:46.380> Blender<00:01:46.409> then<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.340> can

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
with a Beauty Blender then I can

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
with a Beauty Blender then I can
actually<00:01:48.000> use<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.930> I've<00:01:49.140> been<00:01:49.290> combining

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
these two almost every morning to use

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.389 
these two almost every morning to use
and<00:01:52.079> I'm<00:01:52.560> actually<00:01:52.710> wearing<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.189> right<00:01:53.250> now

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and I'm actually wearing it right now

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
and I'm actually wearing it right now
and<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.880> works<00:01:54.329> well<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.720> my<00:01:54.960> skin<00:01:55.200> when<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.350> put

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and it works well on my skin when I put

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.170 
and it works well on my skin when I put
them<00:01:55.740> together<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.280> use<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> beauty<00:01:56.820> blender

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
them together and I use a beauty blender

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.770 
them together and I use a beauty blender
which<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> Beauty<00:01:58.380> Blender<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
which I have a Beauty Blender here and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.450 
which I have a Beauty Blender here and
then<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.930> actually<00:02:01.110> works<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.799> then<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.100> use<00:02:02.280> it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
then it actually works so then I use it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.969 
then it actually works so then I use it
so<00:02:02.790> i've<00:02:03.540> been<00:02:03.600> using<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.110> almost<00:02:04.530> every<00:02:04.829> day

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
so i've been using that almost every day

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.319 
so i've been using that almost every day
I<00:02:05.009> don't<00:02:05.430> love<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:05.759> I'm<00:02:05.939> trying<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.240> get

rid<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.350> think<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.799> may<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.009> able<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
