00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.210 
how to develop this UI webview connected
and<00:00:27.320> program<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.560> into<00:00:28.740> simple

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and program that into simple

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.130 
and program that into simple
applications<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.960> go<00:00:31.109> ahead

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
applications so we're going to go ahead

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.290 
applications so we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:31.320> launch<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.650> new<00:00:31.769> project<00:00:32.309> here<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.210> we'll

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and launch a new project here and we'll

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.430 
and launch a new project here and we'll
just<00:00:33.420> go<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.690> simple<00:00:33.989> view<00:00:34.200> based

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
just go with the simple view based

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.420 
just go with the simple view based
application<00:00:36.110> template<00:00:37.110> give<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> name<00:00:38.160> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
application template give it a name of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
application template give it a name of
webview<00:00:42.500> go<00:00:43.500> ahead<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.739> create<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:45.440> as

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
webview go ahead and create it and as

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.660 
webview go ahead and create it and as
that's<00:00:46.680> getting<00:00:46.980> launched<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.370> basically

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that's getting launched we basically

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.790 
that's getting launched we basically
have<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> establish<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.660> outlet<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
have to establish the outlet and the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010 
have to establish the outlet and the
outlets<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> UI<00:00:50.879> view<00:00:51.449> outlet

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
outlets going to be the UI view outlet

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.889 
outlets going to be the UI view outlet
uiwebview<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.270> within<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.629> we're<00:00:54.780> going

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
uiwebview and so within that we're going

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.520 
uiwebview and so within that we're going
to<00:00:54.960> go<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> webview<00:00:55.649> view<00:00:56.100> controller

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
to go to the webview view controller

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.840 
to go to the webview view controller
give<00:00:58.530> ourselves<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.070> bit<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.370> room<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
give ourselves a little bit of room and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.099 
give ourselves a little bit of room and
this<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.120> where<00:01:00.300> we're<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> declare<00:01:00.960> our

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
this is where we're going to declare our

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.709 
this is where we're going to declare our
outlets<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:02.910> declare<00:01:03.270> our<00:01:03.300> outlet

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
outlets and so as we declare our outlet

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.130 
outlets and so as we declare our outlet
we're<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> simply<00:01:04.350> put<00:01:04.650> iboutlet

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
we're just going to simply put iboutlet
uiwebview<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.939> then<00:01:08.939> we're<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> name

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
uiwebview and then we're going to name

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
go into the implementation and within

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.920 
go into the implementation and within
the<00:02:20.430> implement<00:02:20.850> implementation<00:02:21.810> you're

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the implement implementation you're

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.960 
the implement implementation you're
going<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.110> look<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.970> implement

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
going to look for this implement

viewdidload and so we're just going to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.440 
viewdidload and so we're just going to
kind<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.490> go<00:02:26.610> around<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.940> scenes<00:02:27.150> we're<00:02:27.330> not

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
kind of go around the scenes we're not

kind of go around the scenes we're not
going<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.630> hook<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.870> into<00:02:27.990> any<00:02:28.230> buttons<00:02:28.680> we're

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
going to hook it into any buttons we're

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.530 
going to hook it into any buttons we're
just<00:02:29.430> going<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.580> have<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.060> as<00:02:30.120> they<00:02:30.360> launch

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
just going to have it so as they launch

want<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.700> activate<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:39.390> we're<00:02:39.480> going<00:02:39.600> to

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
want to activate it so we're going to

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.600 
want to activate it so we're going to
take<00:02:39.780> out<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.140> brackets<00:02:40.650> there<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.190> take

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
take out that brackets there and take

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.240 
take out that brackets there and take
away<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.600> as<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.470> can<00:02:43.560> see<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.860> came
