light<00:00:44.670> portion<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> become<00:00:46.110> really

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
light portion is going to become really

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.119 
light portion is going to become really
obvious<00:00:46.890> when<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.129> create<00:00:47.489> our<00:00:47.610> repeat<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:49.129> I'm

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
obvious when we create our repeat so I'm

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.590 
obvious when we create our repeat so I'm
going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> pull<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> portion<00:00:50.940> from<00:00:51.180> right<00:00:51.390> about

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
going to pull a portion from right about

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.560 
going to pull a portion from right about
here<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.350> I'll<00:00:52.980> hit<00:00:53.190> enter<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.730> crop<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.239> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
with the pattern swatch now the fill is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.810 
with the pattern swatch now the fill is
a<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.470> bit<00:01:49.619> big<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.009> swatch<00:01:50.220> texture<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
a little bit big the swatch texture is a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.399 
a little bit big the swatch texture is a
little<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:51.240> large<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.930> control<00:01:52.290> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
little bit large so I can control that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.310 
little bit large so I can control that
pretty<00:01:52.680> easily<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.369> object<00:01:54.320> transform

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
pretty easily I go object transform

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.880 
pretty easily I go object transform
scale<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.700> from<00:01:57.630> within<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> scale<00:01:58.380> dialog

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
scale and from within the scale dialog

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.740 
scale and from within the scale dialog
box<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.640> make<00:01:59.759> sure<00:01:59.790> my<00:02:00.149> options<00:02:00.600> are

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
box I want to make sure my options are

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.260 
box I want to make sure my options are
set<00:02:01.020> correctly<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:02.310> want<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> transform

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
set correctly I do not want to transform

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.240 
set correctly I do not want to transform
objects<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.930> only<00:02:04.259> want<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.740> transform

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
objects I only want to transform

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.160 
objects I only want to transform
patterns<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.149> make<00:02:06.299> sure<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.810> only

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
patterns so just make sure the only

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.400 
patterns so just make sure the only
checkbox<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:08.039> transform<00:02:08.940> patterns<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.750> then

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
checkbox is transform patterns and then

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.990 
checkbox is transform patterns and then
you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.709> adjust<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.160> size<00:02:11.370> accordingly

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
you can adjust the size accordingly

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.460 
you can adjust the size accordingly
until<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.480> get<00:02:12.629> something<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:12.989> looks

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
until you get something that looks

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.770 
until you get something that looks
Eisai<00:02:13.770> think<00:02:13.980> about<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> 10%<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.270> example

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
Eisai think about a 10% on this example

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.510 
Eisai think about a 10% on this example
looks<00:02:15.900> pretty<00:02:16.140> good<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.190> hit<00:02:17.340> okay<00:02:19.250> now<00:02:20.250> if<00:02:20.430> i

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
looks pretty good so I hit okay now if i

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.100 
looks pretty good so I hit okay now if i
zoom<00:02:20.550> in<00:02:22.580> you'll<00:02:23.580> see<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:24.150> pretty<00:02:24.510> clear

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
zoom in you'll see it's pretty clear

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.990 
zoom in you'll see it's pretty clear
where<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.470> edge<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.190> denim<00:02:26.490> texture

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
where the edge of the denim texture

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.260 
where the edge of the denim texture
lines<00:02:27.420> up<00:02:27.780> now<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.350> not<00:02:28.500> terrible<00:02:29.240> but<00:02:30.240> I

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
lines up now it's not terrible but I

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.820 
lines up now it's not terrible but I
think<00:02:30.510> we<00:02:30.630> can<00:02:30.780> do<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> better<00:02:31.170> job<00:02:31.260> doing<00:02:31.680> a

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
think we can do a better job doing a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.290 
think we can do a better job doing a
little<00:02:32.010> bit<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.220> tweaking<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.790> Photoshop

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
little bit of tweaking and Photoshop

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.180 
little bit of tweaking and Photoshop
first<00:02:33.570> before<00:02:34.050> we<00:02:34.170> bring<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.410> texture<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.010> so

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
first before we bring the texture in so

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.170 
first before we bring the texture in so
that's<00:02:35.370> what<00:02:35.490> I'm<00:02:35.580> going<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.730> show<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:35.970> how<00:02:36.150> to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
that's what I'm going to show you how to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180 
that's what I'm going to show you how to
do<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.110> we'll<00:02:37.260> jump<00:02:37.410> back<00:02:37.500> over<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.920> photoshop

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
do so we'll jump back over to photoshop

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.070 
do so we'll jump back over to photoshop
and<00:02:39.290> with<00:02:40.290> our<00:02:40.880> swatch<00:02:41.880> already<00:02:42.390> cropped<00:02:42.690> we

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
and with our swatch already cropped we

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.690 
and with our swatch already cropped we
will<00:02:43.260> choose<00:02:43.560> filter<00:02:44.430> other<00:02:44.880> offset<00:02:45.530> and

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
will choose filter other offset and

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.920 
will choose filter other offset and
essentially<00:02:47.700> what<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:48.000> want<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.330> do<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.750> we

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
essentially what we want to do is we

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.170 
essentially what we want to do is we
want<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.260> offset<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.140> see

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
want to offset this so that we can see

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.290 
want to offset this so that we can see
where<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.450> pattern<00:02:55.140> seems<00:02:55.590> up<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.160> both<00:02:56.730> axes

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
where the pattern seems up on both axes

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.330 
where the pattern seems up on both axes
so<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.480> can<00:02:57.690> see<00:02:57.959> on<00:02:58.080> my<00:02:58.110> horizontal<00:02:58.800> axis<00:02:59.130> it's

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
so I can see on my horizontal axis it's

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.520 
so I can see on my horizontal axis it's
lining<00:02:59.550> up<00:02:59.760> right<00:02:59.970> about<00:03:00.150> here<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.840> I'll

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
lining up right about here and I'll

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.610 
lining up right about here and I'll
adjust<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.130> one<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:03.990> have<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.380> play

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
adjust this one you just have to play

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.650 
adjust this one you just have to play
with<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.920> positioning<00:03:05.490> now<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.060> can<00:03:06.300> see<00:03:06.480> that

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
with the positioning now I can see that

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.080 
with the positioning now I can see that
axis<00:03:07.260> lines<00:03:07.530> up<00:03:07.709> right<00:03:07.950> about<00:03:08.160> here<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.000> we

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
axis lines up right about here and we

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.910 
axis lines up right about here and we
actually<00:03:09.209> did<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> really<00:03:09.810> good<00:03:10.080> job<00:03:10.140> cropping

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
actually did a really good job cropping

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.470 
actually did a really good job cropping
this<00:03:11.130> it's<00:03:11.430> going<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.670> be<00:03:11.820> kind<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.300> gamble

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
this it's going to be kind of a gamble

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.630 
this it's going to be kind of a gamble
depending<00:03:13.080> on<00:03:13.170> your<00:03:13.260> crop<00:03:13.500> how<00:03:13.770> bad<00:03:14.100> or<00:03:14.430> good

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
depending on your crop how bad or good

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.190 
depending on your crop how bad or good
the<00:03:14.880> seam<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.360> going<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.600> look<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.959> one's

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
the seam is going to look this one's

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.560 
the seam is going to look this one's
really<00:03:16.410> not<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.860> terrible<00:03:17.340> but<00:03:18.209> sometimes

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
really not that terrible but sometimes

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.820 
really not that terrible but sometimes
it<00:03:18.720> looks<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:19.110> bad<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.470> needs<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.709> little

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
it looks really bad and needs a little

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.460 
it looks really bad and needs a little
bit<00:03:20.100> more<00:03:20.160> fixing<00:03:20.820> before<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.330> feel<00:03:21.570> like<00:03:22.260> it's

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
bit more fixing before we feel like it's

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.890 
bit more fixing before we feel like it's
ready<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.040> use<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.610> then<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:23.940> take<00:03:24.150> our<00:03:24.390> marquee

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
ready to use so then we take our marquee

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.520 
ready to use so then we take our marquee
tool<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.820> we<00:03:26.820> select<00:03:27.330> this<00:03:27.570> portion<00:03:28.200> where<00:03:28.410> we

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
tool and we select this portion where we

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.400 
tool and we select this portion where we
can<00:03:28.739> see<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.220> seam<00:03:29.640> in<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.180> pattern<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.780> we

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
can see the seam in the pattern and we

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.970 
can see the seam in the pattern and we
choose<00:03:31.769> edit<00:03:32.340> fill<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.720> we<00:03:33.750> want<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.800> choose

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
choose edit fill and we want to choose

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.670 
choose edit fill and we want to choose
content<00:03:35.610> aware<00:03:35.760> from<00:03:36.150> our<00:03:36.330> drop-down<00:03:36.680> leave

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
content aware from our drop-down leave

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
actually looks really good I always like

to<00:03:58.380> come<00:03:59.070> back<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.280> and<00:04:00.380> offset<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.739> pattern<00:04:02.610> a

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
to come back in and offset the pattern a

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.000 
to come back in and offset the pattern a
little<00:04:02.970> bit<00:04:03.239> more<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.900> see<00:04:04.170> if<00:04:04.470> there's<00:04:04.739> any

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
little bit more to see if there's any

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.820 
little bit more to see if there's any
weird<00:04:05.970> spots<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:07.140> missed<00:04:07.410> sometimes

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
weird spots that I just missed sometimes

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.680 
weird spots that I just missed sometimes
bumping<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.459> around<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:08.940> little<00:04:09.060> bit<00:04:09.209> can

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
bumping it around a little bit can

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.810 
bumping it around a little bit can
really<00:04:10.019> bring<00:04:10.470> things<00:04:11.010> up<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.549> didn't

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
really bring things up that you didn't

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.340 
really bring things up that you didn't
see<00:04:11.940> from<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.209> beginning<00:04:12.570> I<00:04:12.720> think<00:04:13.260> it

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
see from the beginning I think it

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.960 
see from the beginning I think it
actually<00:04:13.470> looks<00:04:13.680> pretty<00:04:13.890> good<00:04:14.130> you<00:04:14.730> could

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
actually looks pretty good you could

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.000 
actually looks pretty good you could
come<00:04:15.150> in<00:04:15.180> here<00:04:15.480> with<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.870> clone<00:04:16.350> stamp<00:04:16.859> tool

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
come in here with the clone stamp tool

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.099 
come in here with the clone stamp tool

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
or the Healing Brush tool if you wanted

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.780 
or the Healing Brush tool if you wanted
to<00:04:19.200> do<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.320> little<00:04:19.530> bit<00:04:19.739> more<00:04:19.769> editing<00:04:20.310> but<00:04:20.760> I

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
to do a little bit more editing but I

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.190 
to do a little bit more editing but I
feel<00:04:21.000> like<00:04:21.150> we've<00:04:21.299> got<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.539> pretty<00:04:21.780> good<00:04:21.870> so

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
feel like we've got it pretty good so

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.350 
feel like we've got it pretty good so
I'm<00:04:22.650> going<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.800> select<00:04:23.010> all<00:04:23.370> command<00:04:23.789> or<00:04:23.970> ctrl

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
I'm going to select all command or ctrl

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.379 
I'm going to select all command or ctrl
a<00:04:24.390> copy<00:04:25.289> that

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
a copy that

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.140 
a copy that
jump<00:04:27.050> over<00:04:27.259> to<00:04:27.620> illustrator<00:04:28.009> and<00:04:28.719> paste<00:04:29.719> that

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
jump over to illustrator and paste that

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.640 
jump over to illustrator and paste that
now<00:04:32.150> I'm<00:04:32.360> going<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.599> take<00:04:32.810> this<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.349> I'm<00:04:33.530> going

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
now I'm going to take this and I'm going

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.129 
now I'm going to take this and I'm going
to<00:04:33.710> drag<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.129> drop<00:04:34.189> it<00:04:34.520> in<00:04:34.669> here<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.810> notice

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
to drag and drop it in here and notice

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.600 
to drag and drop it in here and notice
the<00:04:36.169> one<00:04:36.379> on<00:04:36.469> the<00:04:36.560> bottom<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:37.159> I<00:04:37.219> created

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
the one on the bottom that I created

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.140 
the one on the bottom that I created
second<00:04:38.349> so<00:04:39.349> we'll<00:04:39.469> come<00:04:39.680> in<00:04:39.889> and<00:04:40.129> I<00:04:40.879> will

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
second so we'll come in and I will

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.510 
second so we'll come in and I will
select<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:44.810> denim<00:04:45.439> texture<00:04:45.949> again<00:04:46.069> that<00:04:46.490> I

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
select the denim texture again that I

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.119 
select the denim texture again that I
want<00:04:46.729> to<00:04:46.819> refill<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.620> I'm<00:04:48.620> going<00:04:48.740> to<00:04:48.770> fill

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
want to refill and I'm going to fill

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.770 
want to refill and I'm going to fill
that<00:04:49.370> with<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.849> one<00:04:50.000> on<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.180> bottom<00:04:50.330> that<00:04:50.629> is

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
that with the one on the bottom that is

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.809 
that with the one on the bottom that is
the<00:04:50.810> new<00:04:51.110> pattern<00:04:51.469> that<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.650> created<00:04:52.009> now<00:04:52.550> if<00:04:52.729> i

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
the new pattern that I created now if i

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.959 
the new pattern that I created now if i
zoom<00:04:52.849> in<00:04:53.270> here<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:54.020> can<00:04:54.500> see<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:54.830> don't<00:04:54.949> see<00:04:55.430> the

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
zoom in here you can see I don't see the

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.480 
zoom in here you can see I don't see the
seam<00:04:56.330> where<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.289> pattern<00:04:57.680> lines<00:04:57.979> up<00:04:58.280> as

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
seam where the pattern lines up as

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.149 
seam where the pattern lines up as
opposed<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.360> earlier<00:04:59.509> I<00:05:00.169> could<00:05:00.379> see<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.889> break

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
opposed to earlier I could see the break

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.760 
opposed to earlier I could see the break
in<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.520> pattern<00:05:01.699> a<00:05:02.120> little<00:05:03.050> bit<00:05:03.259> more<00:05:03.409> obvious

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
in the pattern a little bit more obvious

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.249 
in the pattern a little bit more obvious
if<00:05:03.919> you<00:05:04.009> come<00:05:04.219> in<00:05:04.340> really<00:05:04.610> really<00:05:04.849> close<00:05:05.259> so

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
if you come in really really close so

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:07.719 
if you come in really really close so
essentially<00:05:06.680> what<00:05:06.949> that's<00:05:07.129> done<00:05:07.340> is<00:05:07.400> it

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
essentially what that's done is it

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.610 
essentially what that's done is it
smooths<00:05:08.150> out<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.479> edges<00:05:09.020> so<00:05:09.199> that<00:05:09.229> you<00:05:09.409> have<00:05:09.590> a

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
smooths out the edges so that you have a

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.850 
smooths out the edges so that you have a
perfectly<00:05:10.400> seamless<00:05:11.300> repeating<00:05:12.110> pattern<00:05:12.529> and

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
perfectly seamless repeating pattern and

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.589 
perfectly seamless repeating pattern and
you<00:05:13.219> can<00:05:13.250> bring<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.580> into<00:05:13.879> illustrator<00:05:14.090> and

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
you can bring that into illustrator and

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:15.999 
you can bring that into illustrator and
fill<00:05:14.840> your<00:05:15.020> flats<00:05:15.319> with<00:05:15.500> that<00:05:15.650> which<00:05:15.830> really

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
fill your flats with that which really

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.689 
fill your flats with that which really
adds<00:05:16.279> a<00:05:16.430> lot<00:05:16.460> of<00:05:16.669> dimension<00:05:16.879> and<00:05:17.270> character<00:05:17.750> to

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
adds a lot of dimension and character to

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.800 
adds a lot of dimension and character to
these<00:05:19.699> vector<00:05:20.090> flats<00:05:20.360> that<00:05:20.479> we're<00:05:20.659> creating

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
these vector flats that we're creating
