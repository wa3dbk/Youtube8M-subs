use invisible thread in your projects so
here's<00:00:07.140> some<00:00:07.290> invisible<00:00:07.649> thread<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:07.919> have<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.250> a

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
here's some invisible thread I have on a

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.850 
here's some invisible thread I have on a
small<00:00:08.610> spool<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.360> stuff<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.870> not<00:00:10.380> made<00:00:10.620> out

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.470 
small spool this stuff is not made out
of<00:00:10.889> fibers<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.519> our<00:00:11.700> cotton<00:00:12.059> threads<00:00:12.300> are

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
of fibers like our cotton threads are

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.700 
of fibers like our cotton threads are
instead<00:00:12.929> they<00:00:13.110> can<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.349> made<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.620> either

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
instead they can be made of either

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.670 
instead they can be made of either
polyester<00:00:14.429> or<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.670> nylon<00:00:15.210> rule<00:00:16.020> number<00:00:16.170> one<00:00:16.440> you

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
polyester or a nylon rule number one you

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.130 
polyester or a nylon rule number one you
only<00:00:17.369> want<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> use<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.210> invisible<00:00:18.750> thread<00:00:18.960> up

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
only want to use the invisible thread up

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.590 
only want to use the invisible thread up
top<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.920> would<00:00:20.160> load<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.550> spool<00:00:20.850> here

thread<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.870> where<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> would<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
thread is this is where I would have it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.560 
thread is this is where I would have it
because<00:00:53.160> I'm<00:00:53.280> using<00:00:53.550> invisible<00:00:54.120> thread<00:00:54.390> I

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
because I'm using invisible thread I

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.439 
because I'm using invisible thread I
would<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.440> change<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.219> about<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.120> three

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
would then change it to about a three

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.240 
would then change it to about a three
another<00:00:58.109> tip<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:58.680> working<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
another tip I have for working with the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.310 
another tip I have for working with the
invisible<00:00:59.430> thread<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:00.989> clear

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
invisible thread is because it's clear

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.349 
invisible thread is because it's clear
and<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.620> transparent<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.789> may<00:01:02.940> want<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and so transparent you may want to get a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.899 
and so transparent you may want to get a
black<00:01:03.690> permanent<00:01:03.960> marker<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:05.220> mark<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
black permanent marker and just mark the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.679 
black permanent marker and just mark the
tip<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.979> your<00:01:07.979> thread<00:01:08.939> seems<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.600> be

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
tip of it if your thread seems to be

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.750 
tip of it if your thread seems to be
coming<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.619> bit<00:01:10.710> too<00:01:11.010> loose<00:01:11.340> you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
coming off a little bit too loose you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
coming off a little bit too loose you
want<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.240> use<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.170> thread

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
want to use one of these little thread

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.980 
want to use one of these little thread
spool<00:01:13.979> sleeves<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.270> does<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
spool sleeves and what this does is it

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
spool sleeves and what this does is it
fits<00:01:16.290> over<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.920> spool<00:01:17.280> cap<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> does

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
fits over the spool cap and what it does

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
fits over the spool cap and what it does
is<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.229> adds<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.619> little<00:01:19.710> bit<00:01:19.920> more<00:01:20.070> tension<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
is it adds a little bit more tension and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.940 
is it adds a little bit more tension and
controls<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:22.140> thread<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.830> more

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
controls the thread a little bit more

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.130 
controls the thread a little bit more
evenly<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.700> unwinds<00:01:24.060> off<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.659> spool<00:01:24.930> if
