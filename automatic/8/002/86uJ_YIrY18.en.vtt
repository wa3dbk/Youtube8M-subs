00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
so we're just going to go through some

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.790 
so we're just going to go through some
of<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.910> performance<00:00:09.450> features<00:00:10.260> it's<00:00:10.500> got<00:00:10.590> an

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
of the performance features it's got an

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.690 
of the performance features it's got an
Nvidia<00:00:11.330> quad-core<00:00:12.330> Tegra<00:00:12.630> 2<00:00:12.750> processor<00:00:13.700> which

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
Nvidia quad-core Tegra 2 processor which

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.880 
Nvidia quad-core Tegra 2 processor which
is<00:00:14.849> running<00:00:15.150> at<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.599> point<00:00:15.839> four<00:00:16.560> gigahertz

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
is running at one point four gigahertz

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.200 
is running at one point four gigahertz
and<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:17.760> got<00:00:18.020> 1<00:00:19.020> gig<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.260> ram<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.740> well<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.150> you

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
and it's got 1 gig of ram as well so you

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.509 
and it's got 1 gig of ram as well so you
can<00:00:21.449> tell<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.020> quite<00:00:22.170> snappy<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:23.160> terms

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
can tell that it's quite snappy in terms

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.779 
can tell that it's quite snappy in terms
of<00:00:23.810> responsiveness<00:00:24.830> if<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.039> am<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.550> click
