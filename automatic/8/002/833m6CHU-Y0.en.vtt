00:00:06.664 --> 00:00:10.700
 Hello! We are in the kitchen and today we will cook something very tasty 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.356
 Since it is summer now on the street, it seems to me that summer is the ideal time for gathering 

00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:18.213
 with friends somewhere on a visit, or go on picnics, 

00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:20.705
 if the weather allows, if you do not live in the Urals, 

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:23.026
 because in the Urals it never allows anything to anyone 

00:00:23.026 --> 00:00:26.529
 Therefore, I decided that this week will be devoted to easy and simple recipes, 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.850
 that are ideally suited for the case when locusts came running to you 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.236
 a bunch of friends and you need to quickly cook something to feed them 

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:36.907
 It will be something tasty, perhaps not very healthy, 

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:41.188
 but then quickly and everyone will be satisfied, a hundred pounds 

00:00:41.598 --> 00:00:45.581
 In today's video, we will be preparing an interesting recipe for which I have long been 

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:48.642
 I look on the Internet and I drool, because there are a lot of photos 

00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:52.184
 This is bread baked with cheese and garlic. 

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:55.112
 For today's bread I will use a loaf, 

00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:57.162
 this, in my opinion, is like ciabatta 

00:00:57.162 --> 00:01:01.377
 I have such a rye loaf, in principle you can go to the bakery and take any bread, 

00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:05.303
 which you like, any shape, any size, we also need cheese, 

00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:08.631
 I think that cheese can be taken any, because it will be baked 

00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:11.440
 you can even Russian, I have some kind of just Dutch cheese 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.679
 We’ll use garlic as stink-flavoring supplements and I have 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.807
 ground paprika, you can take any seasonings that you like 

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:24.031
 And also, to make our bread juicy and fatty, we will use creamy 

00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:28.332
 oil, and in addition fresh green onion 

00:01:28.332 --> 00:01:29.931
 All, we will not long smear, let's go to cook 

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:34.635
 Now I have a super-complex engineering task to cut this bread, 

00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:41.371
 without cutting his back, lower back, ass, in general, cut into diamonds or squares 

00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:42.867
 I hope that I will succeed 

00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:46.210
 Obviously, I will now try different knives and different methods. 

00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:51.693
 you can not do it very carefully, the main thing is not to cut the ass until the end 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.610
 The easiest is over, so we cut it, there are still diamonds left to do. 

00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:08.313
 Listen, this is actually not an easy task, but I think that here 

00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:12.033
 hyperacutive should not be straight, the main thing is to incise the upper crust, 

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:15.356
 and the crumb can be separated by hands later 

00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:19.298
 The main thing is the concentration in practice 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.916
 We cut our bread, we got such pretty diamonds, and now we’ll do it. 

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:29.482
 cheese and butter, because we will need to melt it and make a creamy sauce 

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:32.860
 We take butter, I think that so many 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.051
 this piece of bread will be more than enough 

00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:41.232
 I will put our butter in the microwave for a few seconds so that it melts 

00:02:41.232 --> 00:02:42.716
 because we need liquid 

00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:45.325
 We need a clove of garlic 

00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:50.360
 and garlic just fine crumble 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.266
 the most advanced people can use the garlic press 

00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:57.183
 I think it will be easier 

00:02:57.183 --> 00:03:02.112
 the butter is melted and I put the garlic in there and now I’ll cut some green onions 

00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:12.690
 that's what we're gonna do with our bread 

00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:15.483
 things are easy, it remains to chop cheese 

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:19.540
 I will cut the cheese just thin slices, 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.880
 he will serve as a gasket, it sounds disgusting, 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.076
 but I think you will understand 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.688
 I almost forgot, add more paprika in butter, more 

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:33.966
 Here we have this sauce 

00:03:35.724 --> 00:03:42.517
 Next solid creative, we need to take our sliced ​​bread, take the cheese and just 

00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:45.357
 to make of it such here liners 

00:03:47.357 --> 00:03:51.020
 I think that it will take a lot of cheese here. I'll break it like this 

00:03:56.305 --> 00:04:00.697
 and it remains to build these cubes 

00:04:03.962 --> 00:04:08.705
 I lay the foundation of my fat ass 

00:04:09.543 --> 00:04:12.413
 Bun stuffed with cheese and now we have to do the following 

00:04:12.873 --> 00:04:16.919
 take the foil, by the way I have already heated the oven to 180 degrees 

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:21.523
 Now we will pack our bread in foil and pour just the creamy sauce 

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:27.843
 how would our bun then put I take this sauce and I will be neatly 

00:04:27.843 --> 00:04:33.263
 try to fill it with a little bit too 

00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:35.581
 Oh it's gonna be fat 

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:45.670
 Haha, everything's ready, I'm packing my bread 

00:04:46.514 --> 00:04:50.921
 I sincerely hope that he will not stick 

00:04:55.476 --> 00:04:59.715
 Now I send this space object straight to the oven for 15 minutes 

00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:02.953
 it will still be baked in foil, then we will open the foil and see 

00:05:02.953 --> 00:05:04.982
 may need to bake 

00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:10.830
 put at the same time a timer for 15 minutes 

00:05:15.302 --> 00:05:18.843
 We pulled out our bread, it smells amazing all over the kitchen. 

00:05:18.843 --> 00:05:21.148
 Now the task is to deploy 

00:05:21.636 --> 00:05:24.024
 oh what a ruddy he is 

00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:27.403
 We zagnul foil and put another 5 minutes 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.328
 let it dry with us, because the bread is still soft, 

00:05:30.328 --> 00:05:32.397
 let it be such a drought 

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:35.909
 it smells like some kind of pizza, divine smell, godly 

00:05:37.947 --> 00:05:40.842
 Everything, we have baked the bread, the crust became crispy absolutely 

00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:45.728
 the cheese has melted, now you can put it on a plate and eat 

00:05:45.728 --> 00:05:48.591
 My bun is already cold, I even dared to pick it up 

00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:53.947
 she is insanely crunchy, she was not like this when I was still dead on the table 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.129
 now it is real with a crisp 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.247
 and so here you can get a piece, it goes straight with the syric 

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:08.026
 Cheese is not sorry, you can just get cheese 

00:06:10.447 --> 00:06:12.212
 Well, what's the point, it's garlic 

00:06:12.212 --> 00:06:15.189
 There are recipes for the same bread, only with the use of mushrooms 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.736
 so if you like mushrooms, you can just go in cream sauce, 

00:06:18.736 --> 00:06:22.400
 which consists of butter, fry some mushrooms there too 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.222
 and add between the pieces of bread along with the cheese 

00:06:25.222 --> 00:06:27.360
 then it seems to me to be divine 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.672
 ideal, I don't know, maybe someone dares to eat it with soup, 

00:06:30.672 --> 00:06:32.715
 but I would just eat such tea with tea 

00:06:32.715 --> 00:06:37.187
 Well, for friends it seems to me, too, it would be cool, everyone would snatch up a bit, 

00:06:37.187 --> 00:06:40.393
 ate a little and it's getting fun 

00:06:40.393 --> 00:06:41.592
 Here is a simple and tasty recipe. 

00:06:41.592 --> 00:06:45.065
 We will see you in the next video, where we will cook something else. 

00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:47.543
 for gathering with friends or for a picnic 

00:06:47.693 --> 00:06:50.136
 Thank you very much for watching and all for now! 

00:06:50.441 --> 00:06:54.103
 Cheese, cheese in general, cheese, a lot of cheese 

00:06:54.836 --> 00:06:56.315
 It needs a lot of cheese 

00:06:56.662 --> 00:06:58.852
 what kind of bread can you just eat cheese 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.634
 I'm so ugly at all, eat with my hands 

00:07:02.582 --> 00:07:03.732
 cat, do you want bread? 

00:07:05.976 --> 00:07:07.891
 Operator, do you want a piece?
