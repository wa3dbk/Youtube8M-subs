little bit of an update on the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.330 
little bit of an update on the
twin-turbo<00:00:09.120> project<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.650> will<00:00:10.800> be<00:00:10.950> 3<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
twin-turbo project so this will be 3 and

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.840 
twin-turbo project so this will be 3 and
turbos<00:00:14.340> mounted<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> downpipe<00:00:16.850> fitted

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.280 

this<00:00:26.060> is<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.540> engine<00:00:26.870> that's<00:00:26.990> going<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:27.230> be

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
this is the engine that's going to be

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.479 
this is the engine that's going to be
going<00:00:27.410> in<00:00:28.150> prototype<00:00:29.150> for<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.630> twin<00:00:29.840> turbo

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.280 

actuators<00:00:42.140> and<00:00:45.129> we<00:00:46.129> can<00:00:46.340> see<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.870> actual

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
actuators and we can see that the actual

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:57.540 
actuators and we can see that the actual
down<00:00:48.500> pipe

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.620 

have<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.300> do<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.450> little<00:00:58.690> bit<00:00:58.900> of<00:01:00.630> persuading

have to do a little bit of persuading
just<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.410> get<00:01:02.560> it<00:01:02.620> past<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.860> steering<00:01:03.220> box

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
just to get it past the steering box

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.570 
just to get it past the steering box
underneath<00:01:03.730> there<00:01:04.150> where<00:01:04.300> it's<00:01:04.390> been<00:01:04.570> TIG<00:01:04.809> and

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
bump us off that's the large radiator

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.150 
bump us off that's the large radiator
you<00:02:26.920> can<00:02:27.130> fit<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:29.260> put<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.560> largest<00:02:29.830> into

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
you can fit and we put the largest into

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.190 
you can fit and we put the largest into
getting<00:02:30.400> into<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.090> radiators<00:02:31.660> in<00:02:31.690> there<00:02:31.990> just

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
getting into the radiators in there just

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.199 
getting into the radiators in there just
so<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.590> will<00:02:32.680> go<00:02:32.770> extra<00:02:33.040> cooling<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:36.209> the

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
so that will go extra cooling and the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.720 
so that will go extra cooling and the
radiator<00:02:37.569> bracket<00:02:38.020> mods<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.590> go<00:02:38.740> on<00:02:38.920> they're

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
radiator bracket mods to go on they're

welded to the car and bit dirty at the
moment<00:02:47.500> needs<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.130> good<00:02:48.280> clean-out<00:02:49.349> that's

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
moment needs a good clean-out that's

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.900 
moment needs a good clean-out that's
about<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:51.240> that's<00:02:52.240> all<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.599> have<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.870> report

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
about it that's all we have to report

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
is that the truck the red super truck is

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.040 
is that the truck the red super truck is
gone<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:06.860> this<00:03:07.860> can<00:03:08.040> only<00:03:08.190> mean<00:03:08.280> one<00:03:08.430> thing<00:03:08.610> a

new super truck is going to be built

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.380 
new super truck is going to be built
bigger<00:03:12.690> faster<00:03:13.530> more<00:03:14.310> powerful<00:03:14.370> more<00:03:15.180> will

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
bigger faster more powerful more will
