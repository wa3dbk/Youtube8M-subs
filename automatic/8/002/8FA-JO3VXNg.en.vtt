00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.110 
for you but this soft cotton material
again<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.180> doesn't<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.510> any<00:02:23.780> abrasive<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:24.739> it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
again it doesn't have any abrasive in it

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.390 
again it doesn't have any abrasive in it
so<00:02:26.120> it's<00:02:26.360> not<00:02:26.540> scratching<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.410> metal<00:02:27.709> but

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
so it's not scratching the metal but

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.850 
so it's not scratching the metal but
it's<00:02:28.550> just<00:02:28.790> taking<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.330> tarnish<00:02:29.750> right<00:02:30.620> off

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
it's just taking the tarnish right off

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.190 
it's just taking the tarnish right off
of<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.220> surface<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.239> can<00:02:32.330> see<00:02:32.480> all<00:02:33.140> of

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
of the surface and you can see all of

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.190 
of the surface and you can see all of
that<00:02:33.349> tarnish<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.360> ending<00:02:35.360> up<00:02:35.480> right<00:02:36.019> on<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
that tarnish is ending up right on the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.100 
that tarnish is ending up right on the
cloth<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.519> can<00:02:37.700> use<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.209> cloth<00:02:38.599> until

cloth and you can use this cloth until
it's<00:02:39.319> completely<00:02:40.010> gray<00:02:41.019> from<00:02:42.019> end<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:43.760> end<00:02:43.970> and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
it's completely gray from end to end and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.770 
it's completely gray from end to end and
it'll<00:02:45.200> still<00:02:45.530> work<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:46.069> fine<00:02:46.599> one<00:02:47.599> of<00:02:47.690> the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
it'll still work just fine one of the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.170 
it'll still work just fine one of the
ways<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.380> can<00:02:48.560> really<00:02:48.860> add<00:02:49.280> longevity

oxidized sterling silver blank and the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.440 
oxidized sterling silver blank and the
oxidation<00:03:18.170> is<00:03:18.590> due<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.519> chemical<00:03:19.940> oxidation

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
oxidation is due to a chemical oxidation

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.960 
oxidation is due to a chemical oxidation
I<00:03:20.750> used<00:03:20.959> silver<00:03:21.500> black<00:03:21.680> in<00:03:22.069> this<00:03:22.250> case<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.819> it's
