about a really popular 80 10 10 way of

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.090 
about a really popular 80 10 10 way of
eating<00:00:13.219> monomials<00:00:14.240> now<00:00:15.240> me<00:00:15.480> personally<00:00:16.100> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
eating monomials now me personally the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.849 
eating monomials now me personally the
only<00:00:17.250> time<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.430> really<00:00:17.640> do<00:00:17.850> monomials<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.859> when

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
only time I really do monomials is when

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.380 
only time I really do monomials is when
it's<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.550> fruit<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:20.939> something<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
it's just a fruit or something that I

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.439 
it's just a fruit or something that I
like<00:00:21.740> it's<00:00:22.740> not<00:00:23.100> because<00:00:23.400> I'm<00:00:23.640> doing<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.269> mono

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
like it's not because I'm doing a mono

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.689 
like it's not because I'm doing a mono
meal<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:24.990> not<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.590> goal<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.340> anything<00:00:26.670> like

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
meal it's not my goal or anything like

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.189 
meal it's not my goal or anything like
that<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.150> our<00:00:27.420> meeting<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> down<00:00:27.960> or

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
that it's just our meeting of a down or

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.169 
that it's just our meeting of a down or
three<00:00:28.470> bananas<00:00:28.619> or<00:00:29.039> some<00:00:29.699> peaches<00:00:29.880> or<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
three bananas or some peaches or a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.530 
three bananas or some peaches or a
watermelon<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.859> reason<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.550> as

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
watermelon the reason I do that is as

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.810 
watermelon the reason I do that is as
you<00:00:33.690> guys<00:00:33.840> already<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.200> my<00:00:34.440> goal<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you guys already know my goal are to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
you guys already know my goal are to
build<00:00:36.000> muscle<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.420> strength<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.680> already

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
build muscle and strength and I already

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.680 
build muscle and strength and I already
talked<00:00:38.370> about<00:00:38.460> protein<00:00:38.969> synthesis<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.600> my

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
talked about protein synthesis in my

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.000 
talked about protein synthesis in my
last<00:00:39.870> video<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:41.000> basically<00:00:42.530> for<00:00:43.530> monomials

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
last video and basically for monomials

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.639 
last video and basically for monomials
it<00:00:44.700> takes<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.329> lot<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> amino<00:00:46.020> acids<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it takes a lot of the amino acids to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.549 
it takes a lot of the amino acids to
stimulate<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> protein<00:00:47.579> synthesis

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
stimulate the protein synthesis

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.810 
stimulate the protein synthesis
especially<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> fruit<00:00:50.550> source

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
especially if it's just a fruit source

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.450 
especially if it's just a fruit source
if<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.149> take<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> high<00:00:51.989> protein<00:00:52.230> fruit<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.949> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
if I take a high protein fruit like I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.680 
if I take a high protein fruit like I
said<00:00:54.390> tomatoes<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:55.559> nine<00:00:55.980> percent<00:00:56.690> protein

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
said tomatoes about nine percent protein

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.709 
said tomatoes about nine percent protein
they<00:00:58.590> only<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.730> amino<00:01:00.120> acid<00:01:00.480> talked

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
they only have the amino acid talked

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.529 
they only have the amino acid talked
about<00:01:00.960> leucine<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:02.340> only<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.579> about<00:01:02.670> 25

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
about leucine they only have about 25

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.920 
about leucine they only have about 25
milligrams<00:01:04.110> per<00:01:04.589> hundred<00:01:05.369> grams<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.570> you're

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
milligrams per hundred grams so you're

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.050 
milligrams per hundred grams so you're
talking<00:01:07.080> about<00:01:07.350> eating<00:01:07.680> frickin<00:01:08.220> 10<00:01:08.549> pounds

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
talking about eating frickin 10 pounds

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.899 
talking about eating frickin 10 pounds
of<00:01:09.350> tomatoes<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.890> try<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> stimulate<00:01:11.340> protein

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
of tomatoes to try to stimulate protein

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.880 
of tomatoes to try to stimulate protein
synthesis<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.420> put<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> body<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.799> an

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
synthesis and put the body in an

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.880 
synthesis and put the body in an
anabolic<00:01:14.340> state<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> build<00:01:14.880> muscle<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.890> that's

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
anabolic state to build muscle so that's

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.870 
anabolic state to build muscle so that's
the<00:01:16.950> main<00:01:17.100> reason<00:01:17.130> why<00:01:17.460> don't<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
the main reason why don't do them and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.789 
the main reason why don't do them and
nothing<00:01:20.880> wrong<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.330> them<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.049> uh<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.710> know

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
nothing wrong with them but uh you know

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.469 
nothing wrong with them but uh you know
they<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.070> good<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.430> digestion<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.150> whatnot

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
they are good for digestion and whatnot

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.999 
they are good for digestion and whatnot
but<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.990> don't<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.409> how<00:01:25.500> many<00:01:25.530> digestion

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
but I don't know how many digestion

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.390 
but I don't know how many digestion
issues<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.909> don't<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:27.600> them<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.049> uh<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> cut

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
issues so I don't do them but uh so cut

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.370 
issues so I don't do them but uh so cut
that<00:01:29.520> out<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.820> way<00:01:29.850> people<00:01:30.840> were<00:01:31.020> asking

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that out of the way people were asking

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.289 
that out of the way people were asking
me<00:01:31.530> about<00:01:31.560> saying<00:01:32.100> stuff<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.729> got<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> couple

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
me about saying stuff I got a couple

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.380 
me about saying stuff I got a couple
emails<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.020> messages<00:01:34.409> saying<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
emails and messages saying that if you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
emails and messages saying that if you
have<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.720> amino<00:01:36.930> acids<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.619> that's<00:01:38.040> enough

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
have the amino acids that that's enough

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.480 
have the amino acids that that's enough
that<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> don't<00:01:38.820> need<00:01:39.090> xml<00:01:39.659> well<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:41.220> is

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that you don't need xml well that is

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.980 
that you don't need xml well that is
true<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.390> false<00:01:42.619> if<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.399> them<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:45.810> can

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
true and false if you have them you can

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.020 
true and false if you have them you can
put<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> body<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> small

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
put the body in a you know a small

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.359 
put the body in a you know a small
anabolic<00:01:48.689> state<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.229> after<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> long

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
anabolic state but after a long

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.399 
anabolic state but after a long
endurance<00:01:50.850> exercise<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.750> weightlifting<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
endurance exercise or weightlifting the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.069 
endurance exercise or weightlifting the
body<00:01:52.590> isn't<00:01:52.979> breaking<00:01:53.280> down<00:01:53.840> catabolic<00:01:54.840> state

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
body isn't breaking down catabolic state

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.620 
body isn't breaking down catabolic state
and<00:01:55.700> that's<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.880> where<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.149> want<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> body

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
and that's not where you want the body

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.530 
and that's not where you want the body
at<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.710> want<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.670> an<00:01:59.820> anabolic<00:02:00.180> state

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
at you want it in an anabolic state

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.499 
at you want it in an anabolic state
where<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:00.990> building<00:02:01.290> muscle<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.829> or<00:02:02.759> just

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
where it's building muscle and or just

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.170 
where it's building muscle and or just
repairing<00:02:03.869> tissue<00:02:04.140> basically<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:06.030> do

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
repairing tissue basically and so to do

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.229 
repairing tissue basically and so to do
that<00:02:06.710> you're<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.979> need<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.610> get<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.940> from

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
that you're going to need to get it from

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.979 
that you're going to need to get it from
other<00:02:09.959> sources<00:02:10.590> than<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.310> purely<00:02:12.239> fruit<00:02:12.780> if

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
other sources than just purely fruit if

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
other sources than just purely fruit if
that's<00:02:13.290> your<00:02:13.500> goal

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that's your goal

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
that's your goal
that's<00:02:13.950> not<00:02:14.130> your<00:02:14.160> goal<00:02:14.460> not<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> big<00:02:15.210> issue<00:02:15.300> so

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
that's not your goal not a big issue so

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.400 
that's not your goal not a big issue so
I<00:02:16.940> said<00:02:17.940> I'd<00:02:18.060> do<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.240> from<00:02:18.420> spirulina<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.140> got

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
I said I'd do it from spirulina I got

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.410 
I said I'd do it from spirulina I got
some<00:02:19.650> messages<00:02:20.340> saying<00:02:20.520> people<00:02:20.850> about<00:02:21.000> asking

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
some messages saying people about asking

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
some messages saying people about asking

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
hemp protein not real familiar with them

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.170 
hemp protein not real familiar with them
I<00:02:26.220> know<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:27.030> 80<00:02:27.300> 10<00:02:27.540> 10<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:28.080> technically

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
I know the 80 10 10 is technically

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.540 
I know the 80 10 10 is technically
against<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.390> because<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:32.160> should<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.370> able

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
against that because you should be able

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.850 
against that because you should be able
to<00:02:32.700> get<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:33.030> proper<00:02:33.300> amount<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.840> fruit<00:02:34.230> even

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
to get a proper amount and fruit even

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.320 
to get a proper amount and fruit even
though<00:02:35.190> you're<00:02:35.430> only<00:02:35.550> getting<00:02:35.730> say<00:02:36.060> four

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
though you're only getting say four

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.320 
though you're only getting say four
percent<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.380> my<00:02:37.710> opinion<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:39.030> need<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
percent and in my opinion you need to

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.120 
percent and in my opinion you need to
stimulate<00:02:39.510> protein<00:02:40.080> synthesis<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.890> put<00:02:41.040> the

stimulate protein synthesis to put the

stimulate protein synthesis to put the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.590 
body in the muscle building anabolic
state<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.650> you're<00:02:43.800> not<00:02:44.100> going<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.600> if

state and you're not going to do that if

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.540 
state and you're not going to do that if
you're<00:02:45.840> not<00:02:45.990> getting<00:02:46.410> enough<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> branch

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
you're not getting enough of the branch

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.000 
you're not getting enough of the branch

that you need specifically l-leucine as
it<00:02:52.650> more<00:02:52.830> we're<00:02:52.950> mainly<00:02:53.190> talking<00:02:53.430> about<00:02:53.730> so

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
it more we're mainly talking about so

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.740 
it more we're mainly talking about so
getting<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.910> out<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.240> way<00:02:57.270> you're<00:02:57.570> gonna

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
getting that out of the way you're gonna

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.380 
getting that out of the way you're gonna
need<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.860> eat<00:03:00.320> something<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.740> do<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:02.460> you

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
need to eat something to do that so you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.390 
need to eat something to do that so you
could<00:03:03.540> go<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.900> nutrition<00:03:04.740> data<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.100> check<00:03:05.280> it

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
could go on nutrition data and check it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.160 
could go on nutrition data and check it
out<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:06.120> watercrest<00:03:06.720> raw<00:03:06.960> pumpkin<00:03:07.820> leaves

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
out that watercrest raw pumpkin leaves

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.990 
out that watercrest raw pumpkin leaves
spirulina<00:03:10.170> raw<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.040> don't<00:03:11.250> do<00:03:11.460> actually

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
spirulina raw and I don't do actually

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.960 
spirulina raw and I don't do actually
raw<00:03:12.630> spirulina<00:03:13.290> some<00:03:13.770> slimy<00:03:14.160> sea<00:03:14.820> algae

raw spirulina some slimy sea algae
freakin<00:03:15.780> see<00:03:16.080> crap<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.650> don't<00:03:17.190> do<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:18.300> do

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
freakin see crap I don't do that I do

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.080 
freakin see crap I don't do that I do
the<00:03:19.310> like<00:03:20.310> dehydrated<00:03:20.670> like<00:03:21.270> powder<00:03:21.570> draw<00:03:21.870> and

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
the like dehydrated like powder draw and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.820 
the like dehydrated like powder draw and
and<00:03:24.090> that's<00:03:24.420> what<00:03:24.660> works<00:03:24.840> for<00:03:25.020> me<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.380> that's

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
and that's what works for me and that's

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.020 
and that's what works for me and that's
how<00:03:25.950> i'm<00:03:26.040> getting<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.340> results<00:03:26.640> i<00:03:26.700> want<00:03:26.910> if

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
how i'm getting the results i want if

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.490 
how i'm getting the results i want if
you're<00:03:27.120> not<00:03:27.240> stimulating<00:03:27.750> protein<00:03:28.050> synthesis

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
you're not stimulating protein synthesis

you're not stimulating protein synthesis
you're<00:03:29.280> not<00:03:29.520> going<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.700> get<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.880> results<00:03:30.150> you

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
you're not going to get the results you

you're not going to get the results you
want<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.720> do<00:03:31.440> need<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> have<00:03:32.010> enough

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
want and you do need to have enough

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.970 
want and you do need to have enough
protein<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:32.850> do<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.480> say<00:03:33.900> say<00:03:34.709> i<00:03:34.740> had

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
protein to do that and say say i had

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.710 
protein to do that and say say i had
enough<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.730> stimulate<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.270> with<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.540> three

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
enough to stimulate it with the three

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.380 
enough to stimulate it with the three
grams<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:37.050> leucine<00:03:37.380> through<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.459> whatever

i don't have the full amount to
maximally<00:03:46.980> stimulate<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.730> then<00:03:48.060> i'm<00:03:48.870> not

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
maximally stimulate it then i'm not

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.530 
maximally stimulate it then i'm not
going<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.440> get<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> maximal<00:03:50.550> optimal<00:03:51.090> benefit

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
going to get the maximal optimal benefit

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.590 
going to get the maximal optimal benefit
and<00:03:51.690> me<00:03:52.410> i<00:03:52.680> do<00:03:52.770> that<00:03:53.250> two<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.090> three<00:03:54.120> times<00:03:54.270> a
