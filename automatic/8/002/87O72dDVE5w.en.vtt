00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.869
 dot com 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.599
 the geo tv channel on youtube also for 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.040
 the entire microsoft technet community 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.189
 In this video here I'll show you how 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.230
 disable automatic updates 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.180
 of the applications you download and install 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.090
 on windows history 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.420
 then this option has already been marked is 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.100
 by default and enabled or is all 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.420
 application that you download on windows 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.230
 store is as soon as you play nuno in dos 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.140
 flights 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.620
 he will always check for 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.149
 updates from those applications that you 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.489
 installed by windows history 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.850
 This is important mainly for 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.739
 You who have a slow internet are 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.010
 because sometimes you can feel a 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.920
 some slowness on their internet and in 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.110
 background may be 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.950
 performed this update of these 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.320
 windows history applications then 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.619
 disabling this option you do not 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.290
 runs the risk of using the 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.780
 computer and suddenly you are downloading the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.810
 updates of these applications to 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.829
 to disable is very simplistic you go 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.420
 open here 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:34.700
 windows store windows good 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.740
 procedure is very simple 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.289
 Okay, there is the possibility that you 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.789
 disable this option using gp 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.340
 diponto msc 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.689
 but we will use and graphical interface 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.490
 a very simple way is only to give 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.009
 click on an option it will already 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.780
 Disable Ok, let's go here from the side 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.299
 lower right on the charm bar 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.680
 update settings 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.000

 close this screen it will not save 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.950
 This change you made 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.990
 So if I get here and close if I 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.210
