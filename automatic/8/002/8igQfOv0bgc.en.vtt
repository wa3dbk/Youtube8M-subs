00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
I think he handled it the wrong way

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.530 
I think he handled it the wrong way
I'm<00:03:48.890> sure<00:03:49.070> he<00:03:49.340> knows<00:03:49.489> that<00:03:49.790> definitely<00:03:50.150> by<00:03:50.330> now

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
I'm sure he knows that definitely by now

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.600 
I'm sure he knows that definitely by now
that<00:03:50.600> he<00:03:50.900> handled<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.860> wrong<00:03:52.070> way<00:03:52.100> but<00:03:52.310> he

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
that he handled it the wrong way but he

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.250
