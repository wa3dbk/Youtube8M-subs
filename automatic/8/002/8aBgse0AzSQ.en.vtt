brown that's what I use and then for the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.310 
brown that's what I use and then for the
stencils<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:18.070> weave<00:02:18.340> pattern<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
stencils to get that weave pattern the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.630 
stencils to get that weave pattern the
grass<00:02:22.140> some<00:02:23.140> more<00:02:23.290> leaves<00:02:24.000> up<00:02:25.000> here<00:02:25.750> I

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
grass some more leaves up here I
