you're<00:04:50.580> playing<00:04:50.849> with<00:04:51.029> at<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.330> moment<00:04:51.749> um

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:51.899 
you're playing with at the moment um

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:53.779 
you're playing with at the moment um
just<00:04:52.740> due<00:04:52.889> to<00:04:53.009> the<00:04:53.099> fact<00:04:53.249> that<00:04:53.399> you<00:04:53.550> don't<00:04:53.699> know

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
just due to the fact that you don't know

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.040 
just due to the fact that you don't know
what's<00:04:53.999> going<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.240> change<00:04:54.270> or<00:04:54.749> what<00:04:54.899> they're

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
what's going to change or what they're

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.450 
what's going to change or what they're
going<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.199> do<00:04:55.409> but<00:04:55.619> I'm<00:04:55.770> assuming<00:04:55.949> that

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
going to do but I'm assuming that

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.469 
going to do but I'm assuming that
they're<00:04:56.580> going<00:04:56.669> to<00:04:56.759> try<00:04:56.879> to<00:04:56.939> keep<00:04:57.089> the<00:04:57.270> rules

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
they're going to try to keep the rules

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.219 
they're going to try to keep the rules
pretty<00:04:58.460> like<00:04:59.460> pretty<00:04:59.819> much<00:05:00.029> the<00:05:00.210> same<00:05:00.389> also

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
pretty like pretty much the same also

didn't<00:05:11.009> really<00:05:11.129> read<00:05:11.399> too<00:05:11.520> much<00:05:11.669> on<00:05:11.849> that<00:05:11.969> part

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
didn't really read too much on that part

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.540 
didn't really read too much on that part
but<00:05:12.869> the<00:05:13.770> tournament<00:05:14.189> is<00:05:14.279> going<00:05:14.309> to<00:05:14.460> be

but the tournament is going to be

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.629 
but the tournament is going to be
structured<00:05:14.939> into<00:05:15.240> a<00:05:15.830> round-robin<00:05:16.830> pool<00:05:17.369> play

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
structured into a round-robin pool play

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.629 
structured into a round-robin pool play
among<00:05:18.360> eight<00:05:18.569> groups<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:19.229> four<00:05:19.529> teams<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.399> top

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
among eight groups of four teams the top

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.579 
among eight groups of four teams the top
two<00:05:20.849> teams<00:05:21.059> from<00:05:21.210> each<00:05:21.479> group<00:05:21.539> will<00:05:21.839> advance

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:22.589 
two teams from each group will advance

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.619 
two teams from each group will advance
to<00:05:22.740> a<00:05:22.889> 16-team<00:05:23.580> double<00:05:23.969> elimination<00:05:24.209> bracket

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629 
to a 16-team double elimination bracket

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.170 
to a 16-team double elimination bracket
so<00:05:25.349> that's<00:05:25.619> when<00:05:25.830> things<00:05:25.979> get<00:05:26.219> serious<00:05:26.490> so

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
so that's when things get serious so

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.059 
so that's when things get serious so
basically<00:05:27.539> if<00:05:27.869> you<00:05:28.050> go<00:05:28.259> there<00:05:28.499> you<00:05:28.770> got<00:05:28.949> to

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
basically if you go there you got to

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.949 
basically if you go there you got to
show<00:05:29.279> up<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:29.729> hopefully<00:05:30.149> you<00:05:30.419> get<00:05:30.539> put<00:05:30.809> in<00:05:30.899> a

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:30.959 
show up and hopefully you get put in a

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.529 
show up and hopefully you get put in a
bad<00:05:31.199> bracket<00:05:31.860> or<00:05:32.009> bad<00:05:32.279> pool<00:05:32.610> play<00:05:32.879> because<00:05:33.389> if

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
bad bracket or bad pool play because if

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.809 
bad bracket or bad pool play because if
you<00:05:33.659> do<00:05:33.779> automatically<00:05:34.319> your<00:05:34.529> top<00:05:34.680> 16<00:05:35.219> then

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
you do automatically your top 16 then

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.609 
you do automatically your top 16 then
you<00:05:35.969> just<00:05:36.180> got<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:36.330> win<00:05:36.509> two<00:05:36.779> games<00:05:36.990> I<00:05:37.289> think<00:05:37.529> it

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:37.619 
you just got to win two games I think it

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:39.109 
you just got to win two games I think it
would<00:05:37.709> be<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:37.919> be<00:05:37.949> in<00:05:38.159> top<00:05:38.369> eight<00:05:38.639> and<00:05:38.849> that

00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:39.119 
would be to be in top eight and that

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:41.869 
would be to be in top eight and that
would<00:05:39.240> be<00:05:39.330> huge<00:05:39.599> um<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.439> then<00:05:40.889> you<00:05:41.039> just<00:05:41.249> 125

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:41.879 
would be huge um and then you just 125

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.879 
would be huge um and then you just 125
thousand<00:05:42.270> dollars<00:05:42.509> so<00:05:42.749> definitely<00:05:43.619> get<00:05:43.770> on
