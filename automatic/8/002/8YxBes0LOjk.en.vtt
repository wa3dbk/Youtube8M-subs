minor minor or major and then I move

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.200 
minor minor or major and then I move
into<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.720> triad<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.530> Triad<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.220> simple<00:00:59.670> if<00:00:59.850> I

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
into the triad the Triad is simple if I

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.850 
into the triad the Triad is simple if I
number<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.660> notes<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.110> scale<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.680> two

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
number the notes of the scale one two

number the notes of the scale one two
three<00:01:02.100> four<00:01:02.340> five<00:01:02.610> all<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.750> play<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
three four five all I do is I play the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.040 
three four five all I do is I play the
first<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:05.040> third<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.180> fifth<00:01:06.420> notes<00:01:06.840> at

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
first the third and the fifth notes at

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.680 
first the third and the fifth notes at
the<00:01:07.290> same<00:01:07.590> time<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.220> creates<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.880> triad

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
the same time and that creates a triad

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.410 
the same time and that creates a triad
in<00:01:10.050> this<00:01:10.530> case<00:01:10.800> I'm<00:01:11.009> creating<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.610> minor<00:01:12.090> triad

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
in this case I'm creating a minor triad

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
in this case I'm creating a minor triad
C<00:01:12.750> minor<00:01:12.960> triad<00:01:13.229> alright<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.070> our<00:01:14.280> C

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
C minor triad alright so we have our C

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.749 
C minor triad alright so we have our C
minor<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.810> finger<00:01:16.320> scale<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.250> our<00:01:17.399> C

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
minor my finger scale and we have our C

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.450 
minor my finger scale and we have our C
minor<00:01:18.630> triad<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:19.860> let's<00:01:20.040> go<00:01:20.190> through<00:01:20.399> some

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
minor triad so now let's go through some

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.800 
minor triad so now let's go through some
of<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> cool<00:01:20.880> ways<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.270> which<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.600> break

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
of the cool ways in which you can break

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.840 
of the cool ways in which you can break
this<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.320> create<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.649> cool<00:01:22.979> piano

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this up and create a cool piano

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
this up and create a cool piano
technique<00:01:24.330> exercise<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:25.050> yourself<00:01:25.350> first

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
technique exercise for yourself first

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.260 
technique exercise for yourself first
thing<00:01:26.190> I'm<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> separate<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.119> by<00:01:27.210> two

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
thing I'm going to separate it by two

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.249 
thing I'm going to separate it by two
octaves<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> scale<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.070> down

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
octaves just go up the scale and down

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.330 
octaves just go up the scale and down
alright<00:01:31.259> pretty<00:01:31.440> simple<00:01:31.830> now<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.039> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
alright pretty simple now do the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.000 
alright pretty simple now do the
arpeggio

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
arpeggio

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.920 
arpeggio
again<00:01:34.700> I'm<00:01:34.820> just<00:01:34.850> taking<00:01:35.180> that<00:01:35.270> minor<00:01:35.570> triad

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
again I'm just taking that minor triad

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.410 
again I'm just taking that minor triad
I'm<00:01:36.110> just<00:01:36.290> breaking<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:36.830> up<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:38.210> I'm<00:01:38.300> not

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
I'm just breaking it up so I'm not

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.760 
I'm just breaking it up so I'm not
playing<00:01:38.660> all<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.960> notes<00:01:39.140> at<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.290> same<00:01:39.410> time

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
playing all the notes at the same time

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.630 
playing all the notes at the same time
I'm<00:01:39.890> just<00:01:40.070> breaking<00:01:40.310> them<00:01:40.580> up<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.000> scale

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
I'm just breaking them up so scale

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.870 
I'm just breaking them up so scale
arpeggio<00:01:43.750> scale<00:01:45.340> arpeggio

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
arpeggio scale arpeggio

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.390 
arpeggio scale arpeggio
our<00:01:48.390> pegida<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.950> nice<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.189> slow

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
our pegida so they do that nice and slow

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
let's get a little bit more challenging

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.820 
let's get a little bit more challenging
try<00:02:41.239> doing<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.660> arpeggio<00:02:42.290> with<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> left

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
try doing the arpeggio with the left

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.410 
try doing the arpeggio with the left
hand<00:02:43.040> while<00:02:43.220> doing<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.610> scale<00:02:44.030> with<00:02:44.330> the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
hand while doing the scale with the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.080 
hand while doing the scale with the
right<00:02:44.599> hand<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.019> check<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:45.319> out

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.610

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
scale in the left hand I'm just

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.490 
scale in the left hand I'm just
arpeggiating<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.390> Triad<00:02:58.690> now<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.230> course<00:02:59.349> I

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
arpeggiating the Triad now of course I

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.750 
arpeggiating the Triad now of course I
don't<00:02:59.560> have<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.890> appreciate<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.370> try<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:00.670> I

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
don't have to appreciate to try it I

exercises I can use my own imagination
and<00:03:51.100> come<00:03:51.280> up<00:03:51.400> with<00:03:51.520> exercise<00:03:52.060> after<00:03:52.480> exercise

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
and come up with exercise after exercise

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.350 
and come up with exercise after exercise
I<00:03:53.230> could<00:03:53.620> even<00:03:53.800> try<00:03:54.100> moving<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.790> between<00:03:54.940> two

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
I could even try moving in between two

I could even try moving in between two
separate<00:03:55.810> keys<00:03:56.050> so<00:03:56.560> rather<00:03:56.740> than<00:03:56.860> just

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
separate keys so rather than just

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.060 
separate keys so rather than just
playing<00:03:57.300> C<00:03:58.300> minor<00:03:58.600> tries<00:03:59.230> C<00:03:59.590> minor<00:03:59.830> in<00:04:00.010> the
