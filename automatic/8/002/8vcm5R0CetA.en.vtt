00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.929
 whenever elections date approaches 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.179
 be it for the federal state power 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.049
 to a question raised between 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.939
 church 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.720
 is it permissible to deal with issues 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:24.390
 policies in our 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.000
 Sunday School will be that pastors 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.910
 priests and deacons should speak 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.309
 preach in teaching about politics and about 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.180
 the relationship between the people of God and the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.309
 state 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.719
 important point that we will have in 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.100
 mind is that the Bible speaks a lot about 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.820
 policies on the relations between the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.280
 of God the church and the state in the old 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.390
 testament we have stories of kings and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.250
 love 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.989
 we have the perspective of who is in the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.390
 street the perspective of who is in the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:00.000
 palace we have the answer or are the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.699
 according to David's second model 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.800
 we have summarized to those who did not give if the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.610
 path of the road 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.979
 we have prophets calling kings to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.510
 obey the covenant word in the new 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.380
 testament we have the roman empire 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.990
 like a shadow present above all that the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.299
 church makes us remember for 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.170
 example of the apostle Paul in Romans 13 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.470
 directing the church showing that in 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.460
 some measure god supreme authority 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.009
 he commands authority and interesting that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.990
 at the same time that paulo remembers that all 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.890
 authority ordained by god 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.320
 he already gives us the tips or clues of which 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.500
 is the legitimate authority and Romans 13 and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.430
 recalls that the legitimate authority it 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.009
 reward good protect and punish evil and 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.890
 so we pay tax to us 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.450
 We can remember Pedro talking almost 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.729
 similar words 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.880
 on the other hand we remember the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.219
 apostle john and apocalypse 13 making the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.179
 caricature of a state and unique of a 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.829
 state that is not legitimate then there is 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.989
 pastors already cross 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.870
 they are called to preach to teach 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.790
 policy on relations between the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.579
 god state people 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.010
 that all sacred scripture speaks of 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.340
 some measure of these relations to people 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.319
 Can you remember Jesus picking up a coin? 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.930
 and remembering that we should give 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.269
 God what is God to the emperor 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.730
 it is from the emperor to Caesar that which is Caesar's 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:42.239
 then we have in the deed a 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.959
 mandate for us to teach about 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.310
 the relationship between church and state and 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.129
 political issue 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.549
 the other question on the other side that is 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:56.430
 important to consider is that we 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.250
 we live in the world we are in the world 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.260
 despite not being in the world then the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.439
 light of sacred scripture we are going to 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.340
 positioning in relation to e.g. 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.000
 violence 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.010
 the issue of homosexuality abortion 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.060
 the brutal tax burden to us 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.760
 imposed on every nation because of the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.870
 Revelation of God in Sacred Scripture 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.209
 we must give direction to politics to 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.549
 the church not the party leadership but 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.389
 a political direction to light the sacred 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.090
 writing 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.449
 thinking about how the church should behave 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.470
 to the situation we experienced issues 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.199
 new life 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.159
 launched this book is in a group in 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:42.000
 politics according to the bible is a book to 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.419
 I enjoy 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.229
 are four short chapters each 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:51.329
 chapter focusing on a theme of 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:55.349
 our relationship or to help us 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:57.870
 relate to the state to this book 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.359
 has several uses for example it can be 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.519
 used in small groups at school 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.949
 Biblical Sunday Commissions Chapters 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.120
 for example, one can study the 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.120
 cast for one month at school 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.010
 in a special class for 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.799
 those who want some direction 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.750
 in this area or have passed and if they prefer 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.829
 they can even use the book as 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.680
 a kind of stimulus, the guide to 4 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.860
 sermons on how Christians should deal 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.810
 with the state and with the political questions 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.779
 who are before us and who in the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.620
 challenge then those who want a 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.290
 direction 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.040
 get a black political envelope book 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.040
