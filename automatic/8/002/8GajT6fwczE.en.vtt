00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
cover it doesn't like to be in the light

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.859 
cover it doesn't like to be in the light
and<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.140> likes<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.470> be<00:00:28.619> kept<00:00:28.890> at<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.580> nice<00:00:29.939> kind

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
of a warm room temperature and it does

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.360 
of a warm room temperature and it does
need<00:00:34.110> some<00:00:34.170> air<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:34.920> keep<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.219> covered

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
need some air so I just keep it covered

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.660 
need some air so I just keep it covered
with<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> piece<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.480> cloth<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.309> like<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> large

with a piece of cloth and like a large
elastic<00:00:39.210> band<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:41.070> if<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.210> remove<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.600> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
elastic band so if we remove that this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.420 
elastic band so if we remove that this
is<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> vinegar<00:00:43.770> working<00:00:44.280> inside<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> jar<00:00:46.430> as

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
is the vinegar working inside the jar as

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.459 
is the vinegar working inside the jar as
you<00:00:47.670> look<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> side<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.110> see

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
you look in the side here you can see

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590 
you look in the side here you can see
kind<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> layers<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> mud<00:00:51.390> litter

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
kind of the layers of the mud litter

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.680 
kind of the layers of the mud litter
vinegar<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.550> dump<00:00:53.820> fresh<00:00:54.180> wine<00:00:54.449> in

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
vinegar so you just dump fresh wine in

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.630 
vinegar so you just dump fresh wine in
here<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.020> occasion<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.309> want<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> put

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
here on occasion you don't want to put

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.360 
here on occasion you don't want to put
too<00:00:57.180> much<00:00:57.360> too<00:00:57.809> much<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.039> time

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
too much too much in all at one time

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.240 
too much too much in all at one time
because<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.180> sometimes<00:01:00.570> overcome<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
because you can sometimes overcome the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
because you can sometimes overcome the
mother<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.270> vinegar<00:01:03.570> culture<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> there

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
mother of vinegar culture and there

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
mother of vinegar culture and there
that's<00:01:04.530> changing<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> alcohol<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.909> acetic

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that's changing the alcohol to acetic

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.330 
that's changing the alcohol to acetic
acid<00:01:07.369> let<00:01:08.369> me<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:11.040> mother

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
acid let me see if I can get the mother

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.260 
acid let me see if I can get the mother
vinegar<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> surface<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.180> can

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
vinegar to the surface here so you can

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.050 
vinegar to the surface here so you can
kind<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.540> see<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.020> looks<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:17.000> see<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
kind of see what it looks like see it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.310 
kind of see what it looks like see it
looks<00:01:18.330> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:22.100> almost<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
looks kind of like a almost like a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.120 
looks kind of like a almost like a
jellyfish<00:01:25.320> Shura<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.470> could<00:01:28.650> take<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
jellyfish Shura so you could take this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.130 
jellyfish Shura so you could take this
out<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.000> use<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> culture<00:01:31.110> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
out here and use this as a culture to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.120 
out here and use this as a culture to
start<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.619> new<00:01:31.860> batch<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.000> vinegar<00:01:34.130> that's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
start a new batch of vinegar that's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
start a new batch of vinegar that's
there's<00:01:35.759> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.540> loaded

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
there's going to be this can be loaded

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.770 
there's going to be this can be loaded
with<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:38.000> bacteria<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.210> change<00:01:41.540> wine<00:01:42.540> into

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
with the bacteria that change wine into

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.359 
with the bacteria that change wine into
vinegar<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.009> there's<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> couple

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
vinegar so you can see there's a couple

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.770 
vinegar so you can see there's a couple
different<00:01:44.759> layers<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.240> that's<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
different layers and that's that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.080 
different layers and that's that
sometimes<00:01:46.140> happens<00:01:46.560> when<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.890> add<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.030> have

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
sometimes happens when you add you have

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.670 
sometimes happens when you add you have
a<00:01:48.180> mother<00:01:48.450> vinegar<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:48.960> then<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.140> add<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> new

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
a mother vinegar and then you add a new

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.490 
a mother vinegar and then you add a new
layer<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.610> new<00:01:51.000> batch<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.659> wine<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
layer or new batch of wine to this and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620 
layer or new batch of wine to this and
then<00:01:53.130> it'll<00:01:53.310> convert<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.970> create<00:01:54.360> those

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
then it'll convert and create those

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.350 
then it'll convert and create those
mother's<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.170> vinegar<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:56.030> just<00:01:57.030> run<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
mother's of vinegar I just run this

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.590 
mother's of vinegar I just run this
through<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> coffee<00:01:57.930> filter<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:59.450> strain<00:02:00.450> out

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
through a coffee filter to strain out

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630 
through a coffee filter to strain out
any<00:02:00.630> solids<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.710> worked<00:02:01.890> out<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
any solids that have worked out and to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.690 
any solids that have worked out and to
strain<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.149> culture<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.460> end<00:02:05.640> up

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
strain out the culture and you end up

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.410 
strain out the culture and you end up
with<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.909> fairly<00:02:06.180> clear<00:02:07.069> probably<00:02:08.069> nut<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.489> it's

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
with a fairly clear probably nut is it's

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.990
