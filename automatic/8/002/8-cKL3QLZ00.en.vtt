most comfortable boot that seems I've

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.709 
most comfortable boot that seems I've
ever<00:01:01.469> made<00:01:01.760> there's<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> lot<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.090> similarities

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
ever made there's a lot of similarities

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.649 
ever made there's a lot of similarities
to<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.619> boot<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.369> old<00:01:05.549> guide<00:01:05.850> boot

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
to to this boot and the old guide boot

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.109 
to to this boot and the old guide boot
you<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.680> they<00:01:07.890> can't<00:01:08.159> completely

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you know if they can't completely

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.539 
you know if they can't completely
redesign<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> entire<00:01:10.590> platform<00:01:11.220> simply

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
redesign the entire platform simply

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.609 
redesign the entire platform simply
because<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> worked<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.600> damn<00:01:12.869> well<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.320> first

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
because it worked so damn well the first

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.410 
because it worked so damn well the first
time<00:01:13.920> they<00:01:14.130> did<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:14.820> what<00:01:15.000> they've<00:01:15.180> done

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
time they did it but what they've done

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.899 
time they did it but what they've done
is<00:01:15.810> they've<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.860> upgraded<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> bits

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
is they've just upgraded the bits

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
is they've just upgraded the bits
they've<00:01:18.390> listened<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> anglers<00:01:19.439> they've

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
they've listened to the anglers they've

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.530 
they've listened to the anglers they've
listened<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> guides<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> pros<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
listened to the guides and the pros and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.359 
listened to the guides and the pros and
just<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> people<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> ground<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.340> know

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
just the people on the ground you know

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.789 
just the people on the ground you know
they<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.820> lot<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.180> research<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.229> in

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
they do a lot of research in that in

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.920 
they do a lot of research in that in
that<00:01:25.979> area<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.610> listening<00:01:27.600> which<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that area of listening which is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.480 
that area of listening which is
important<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.560> you're<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> build<00:01:29.220> stuff

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
important if you're going to build stuff

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.870 
important if you're going to build stuff
that<00:01:29.670> people<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.570> live<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.880> they've

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
that people have to live in and they've

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.999 
that people have to live in and they've
upgraded<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> bits<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.710> pieces

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
upgraded a lot of the bits and pieces

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.670 
upgraded a lot of the bits and pieces
that<00:01:35.220> mean<00:01:35.670> something<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.329> anglers<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.350> I

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
that mean something to anglers and I

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.969 
that mean something to anglers and I
think<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.040> really<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:38.579> important<00:01:39.979> for

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
think that's really really important for

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.819 
think that's really really important for
me<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> biggest<00:01:41.549> upgrade<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:43.229> guide<00:01:43.530> boot

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
me the biggest upgrade of the guide boot

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.210 
me the biggest upgrade of the guide boot
this<00:01:44.009> season<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.729> something<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.450> seems<00:01:45.689> call

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
this season is something that seems call

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.880 
this season is something that seems call
proprioception<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:48.320> for<00:01:49.320> me<00:01:49.470> what<00:01:49.860> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
proprioception and for me what that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.960 
proprioception and for me what that
means<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.899> how<00:01:51.899> rocks<00:01:52.290> feel<00:01:52.770> coming<00:01:53.579> through

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
means is how rocks feel coming through

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.209 
means is how rocks feel coming through
the<00:01:54.180> tread<00:01:54.570> base<00:01:54.810> into<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.380> sole<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:55.890> foot

both on the outside and on the inside of

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.979 
both on the outside and on the inside of
course<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.769> they've<00:03:20.459> had<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.730> employ<00:03:21.660> these

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
course and they've had to employ these

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.460 
course and they've had to employ these
these<00:03:22.680> stud<00:03:23.489> alignment<00:03:24.360> markers<00:03:24.930> on<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.200> sole

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
these stud alignment markers on the sole

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.530 
these stud alignment markers on the sole
here<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:25.860> that's<00:03:26.010> what<00:03:26.160> these<00:03:26.370> red<00:03:26.880> marks<00:03:27.330> are

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
here and that's what these red marks are
