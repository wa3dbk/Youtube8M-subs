00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.059
 everyone is christophe thunder 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.429
 especially for breaking news or rather 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.900
 not about the new gta I was 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.179
 sit that before you start putting a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.220
 comment or your opinion on the video 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.510
 thank you at least from the listened it would be 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.580
 that's why you clicked 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.779
 above to see a little bit of everything 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.150
 as the title says anyway 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.320
 we're going to talk about it pretty much 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.849
 already all the information we have 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.330
 on because yes we have small 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.490
 stuff on it 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.990
 and then after you do not talk about the title 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.270
 a little bit of something 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.829
 I really wanted but specialized 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.540
 plane level dance I'm going 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.700
 tell you right after gold already the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.290
 first thing is that the game was 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 announced in any case no roxas has been 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.649
 confirmed then what is it a 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.210
 story on twitter it's by auxerre 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.360
 directly it's actually a company 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 who works for rockstar who have received 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.690
 lots of questions all about 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.980
 fans who said arm when is it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.329
 will already be there I was sitting and when 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.399
 is he out was answered 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.649
 like what will be good I was at 6 and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.590
 which will be released at the end of 2016 or in 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.180
 beginning of the year 2010 is either in about 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.080
 two years we will say that like that I 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.670
 thought more in my head because in 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.310
 often does rock that likes to put a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.590
 year in advance or if they sweat at 8 months in 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.030
 advance and well a trailer for the game 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.530
 you mean that finally the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.000
 trailer will appear in a year and a half 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.790
 two years it's true it's going to be like 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.170
 quite fast will not have to expect 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.150
 what the game not to go out in five years 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.530
 but really the fastest 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.200
 possible then why also some 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.030
 share he's going out in two years in 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.890
 two three years just not because 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.020
 it will be sloppy but simply because 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.009
 I was at five was worked a lot 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.450
 they did a lot of time 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.040
 in four to five still working 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.049
 of development and whether to know 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.420
 it's actually that it will be based gta5 too 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.220
 a little bit on the next gen and that the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.600
 next gta throw to 6 be really 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.040
 based on the next generation ie 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.049
 he will be spent on playsation card on 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.460
 xbox live and on pc 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.229
 but what you really need to know is 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.600
 that the bases of ch and at 5 will be 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.890
 retransmitted on jeddah settle at 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.479
 level of textures at the level of the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.840
 mountain modeling and that's it 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.610
 in the state 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.560
 after we do not know when the map asset 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.600
 that's for sure I said my style 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.530
 cat and kill no mountain but what 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.240
 I am telling you what is it 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.920
 it's going to take it will take them less 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.630
 of time to create I was at six because 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.849
 that somewhere modeling of all 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.679
 end of the game it is almost already done 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.390
 at the level of objects will of course have 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.610
 work has reinforced the game itself 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.319
 but we will have much less than 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.980
 go from gta iv to gta 5 because 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.239
 I was at 5 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.670
 it fulfills a very good quality 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.200
 of image and she was also a lot 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.489
 betrayed by roxane so they go a little bit on 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.390
 will say take back gta 5 for the wrapped 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.610
 so that they are much stronger 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.110
 and well of a g was at 6 years old it is necessary 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.390
 know in gt5 and where even though two 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.650
 one hundred sixty-one vehicle with 1000 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.239
 possible modifications it's still 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.500
 not bad at the level of vehicles at 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.569
 plane level because if I you 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.640
 talked about planes and the cargo plane the 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.019
 cube to 800 the airship fans 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.790
 also count two teeth the tester the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.430
 devil luxury in itself is it 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.810
 simple ep 996 laser making it the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.190
 military hunting language is a pity 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.489
 we did not have too many vehicles 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.560
 army 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.390
 my not discussing it over the cat 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.700
 male for example the titan and screenwriter 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.930
 has a taste has twelve planes that are 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.220
 available in a cottage to what we 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.769
 could very well be said when I was 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.659
 at 6 beats there will be more planes by 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.709
 example certainly even because 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.390
 I was a child I was in Ben on 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.040
 improves in number 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.379
 number of vehicles 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.330
 we really do not have fun planning his nose 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.420
 pass a mini modifications in gta 5 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.950
 with 261 vehicle while in gta iv 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.120
 extending it to the hundred is true 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.430
 that there is still a very very big 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.900
 difference between these two and so 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.860
 inevitably in the third I know you 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.510
 assists who will be better 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.620
 1 we do not see to sell a game then 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.110
 that it will be less good that is to say that 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.060
 not to say I was at 5 to 261 vehicle 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.400
 we'll see a six-man jet 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.200
 against that 200 to the water the logic there 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.420
 so it does not necessarily have a large roof and 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.549
 I was at about 300 or even more than 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.629
 integrated vehicles of no it did when 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.430
 even a lot of things a lot of 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.989
 textures but somewhere if he resumes 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.209
 gta 5 vehicles which will do 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.650
 necessarily and bassa will ask them less 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.280
 of work they will have more than 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.930
 work to amuse actually inside 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.310
 certain vehicles 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.420
 so what do I want from you 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.069
 talk I'll show you on the screen 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.560
 screen has a lot of san andreas and 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.790
 of late gta iv and gta 5 excuse me 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.900
 like what they are related to in fact 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.010
 it's really juice that feels 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.000
 enormously ie at the level of 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.520
 France vehicles invites you game 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.410
 noticed at the level of planes 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.210
 flashing Sendres found there by t400 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.500
 example the fighter plane I have no 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.050
 nonsense we find ourselves together stone 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.450
 planes where many others to many others 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.520
 planes and to which actually if you 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.239
 want to really find one 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.680
 resemblance 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.900
 finally it's the same thing if you want 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.150
 except that in gta 5 they improved the 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.650
 vehicles practically for beat game 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.540
 address so it's possible to say 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.850
 that I was six months that inevitably he 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.290
 will be a little a redevelopment of 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.490
 all this is Raymond resume the 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.350
 resources to they have worked since 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.940
 the beginning like that they will resume the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.750
 vehicles put it back in and then 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.280
 add a few 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.530
 so it's true that it can be very 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.510
 interesting about it after of course that 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.770
 will also depend on the map 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.600
 will it be a great tablecloth a 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.650
 small map it would surprise me nally 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.190
 play in play in assists to more 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.450
 large maps 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.920
 so we will inevitably find ourselves again 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.180
 with a bigger tablecloth but how 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.470
 it will exclude a desert corner 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.850
 and that's acceptable 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.560
 we can really ask ourselves a lot 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.060
 a lot of question on it and especially 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.980
 it's going to depend in fact it's going to influence 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.110
 the number of planes we end up with 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.820
 12 planes at 5 gta necessarily in a gite 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.410
 at 6 we will have more we have one 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.730
 fifteen or so even that would be good 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.290
 and so we could really 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.910
 be interested in it and me your I you 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.080
 gave my ideas so also a bar 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.490
 comments it would be super cool if 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.140
 you give your ideas to you what is it 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.030
 all we know he'll see it's all 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.560
 game that's for sure that I'm not rushed 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.150
 to make lots of videos of this 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.220
 style there we will wait will take the 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.480
 time and then we will also watch we go 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.370
 to be very present I looked a lot 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.350
 Ebodé we twitter social networks 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.120
 of those big companies the silk that 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.650
 is rockstar be they have them 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.270
 with rockstar pass we can deduce 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.190
 also a lot of things on it then 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.690
 at the aircraft level not necessarily me 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.100
 my opinion will have a lot of aura will be there 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.960
 big planes inevitably there will be 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.400
 diets and this is his best in my opinion 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.360
 there will be novelty ie 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.190
 at the level of the Germans what do we 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.500
 can invent new and well that's 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.180
 simple rather modern planes and 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.260
 simple at the level of the aircraft army 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.670
 of transition do not know if you 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.620
 know by and large it's a take-off at the 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.600
 vertical for now it's true at 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.210
 level of the army we have nothing we have 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.130
 that at an age when we have only one jet that's 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.030
 do not talk nonsense paint 996 hours 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.860
 it's true that it's pretty average is 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.780
 well a good one we have a fighter plane is 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.430
 cool but hey we all would have liked 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.070
 to have a few more the different 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.290
 types but it will come necessarily on gta 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.970
 6 and so that somewhere we would have 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.440
 well they will definitely pick up the 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.350
 planes we found basic is to 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.630
 say that is the large aircraft 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.100
 ex nice jets you have but certainly they 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.330
 add a little sauce a little 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.650
 pepper from there in to spice 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.970
 stuff that is not a nice 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.440
 transition example as I say 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.700
 the army for example 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.140
 Angles uses that is actually 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.550
 planes taking off like 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.230
 helicopters do that they have not 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.580
 need roads 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.010
 they simply have a low need 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.410
 space in height is all and then 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.210
 after they can they can take off 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.530
 so what's the point of the army 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.450
 all that they used that so that's it 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.710
 a little bit of history low when in 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.180
 did I wanted there are wars between 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.080
 Netherlands in fact if we do and that 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.030
 destroyed the airstrips 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.380
 like that they can not land 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.510
 the planes are they can not 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.970
 take off like that in fact we'll say that 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.040
 really it blocks their air system 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.110
 and well these famous planes and well they 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.430
 fly vertically so necessarily 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.050
 be no need for tracks so basically 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.670
 even if the track is destroyed and ben um 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.470
 they can fly it's still pretty 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.060
 good thing so that's an idea when 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.280
 I give you and alain of official 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.600
 ah because I had to start but good 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.060
 somewhere we could really 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.560
 think after we can also talk about 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.110
 cockpit for example is what there will be 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.460
 the cockpit or not we would have it 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.880
 waited anyway in this case that we 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.250
 did not get it 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.390
 although in the light of time for example 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.950
 if you're in multiplayer mode in the 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.620
 titan you can have a really view 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.030
 the cockpit earth so you walk 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.230
 will I believe you really have 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.400
 a life in the inter so it's not bad if 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.730
 that action courteous and that I was 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.140
 bag 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.970
 but will that be thorough and 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.440
 mandatory limit in the game gta si 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.000
 ie mandatory does it mean 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.500
 when we go on foot will be in 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.720
 Any plane will have the view of 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.650
 pilot that it will be really a big 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.610
 change on it 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.960
 abbas before all the siblings it 's 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.820
