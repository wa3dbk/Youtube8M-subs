00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.320 
for the team and my pro tip is just play
as<00:02:09.769> much<00:02:09.950> as<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.190> can<00:02:10.369> just<00:02:10.549> practice<00:02:10.729> as<00:02:11.209> much

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
as much as you can just practice as much

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.150 
as much as you can just practice as much
as<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.600> can<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.440> once<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.680> get<00:02:12.799> to<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> certain

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
as you can and once you get to a certain

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.500 
as you can and once you get to a certain
stage<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:13.549> don't<00:02:13.819> have<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.120> pay<00:02:14.239> as<00:02:14.360> much

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
stage you don't have to pay as much

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.120 
stage you don't have to pay as much
because<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.900> already<00:02:15.049> kind<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:15.920> learn<00:02:16.100> the
