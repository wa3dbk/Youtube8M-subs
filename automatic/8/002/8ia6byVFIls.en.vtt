placing and cleaning nuts there are two

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.760 
placing and cleaning nuts there are two
great<00:00:35.180> ways<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.420> practice<00:00:35.900> placing<00:00:36.440> and

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
great ways to practice placing and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.040 
great ways to practice placing and
cleaning<00:00:37.130> one<00:00:37.640> way<00:00:37.820> is<00:00:38.060> to<00:00:38.239> follow<00:00:38.450> a<00:00:38.660> lot<00:00:38.900> of

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
cleaning one way is to follow a lot of

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.750 
cleaning one way is to follow a lot of
TRADD<00:00:39.380> not<00:00:39.890> only<00:00:40.040> do<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:40.340> get<00:00:40.460> to<00:00:40.550> practice

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
TRADD not only do you get to practice

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.549 
TRADD not only do you get to practice
cleaning<00:00:41.450> but<00:00:41.660> you<00:00:41.750> also<00:00:41.900> get<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.230> see<00:00:42.380> how<00:00:42.530> a

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
cleaning but you also get to see how a

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.549 
cleaning but you also get to see how a
more<00:00:42.890> experienced<00:00:43.610> climber<00:00:44.059> places<00:00:44.660> gear<00:00:45.020> the

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
more experienced climber places gear the

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.290 
more experienced climber places gear the
other<00:00:45.739> way<00:00:45.980> is<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:46.250> do<00:00:46.489> what<00:00:46.640> we've<00:00:46.790> done<00:00:47.000> here

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
other way is to do what we've done here

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.630 
other way is to do what we've done here
and<00:00:47.480> that's<00:00:47.629> come<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.379> base<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.800> crag<00:00:49.040> we

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
and that's come to the base of a crag we

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.250 
and that's come to the base of a crag we
found<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.090> crag<00:00:50.300> that<00:00:50.480> has<00:00:50.600> lots<00:00:50.809> of<00:00:50.930> cracks

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
found the crag that has lots of cracks

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.900 
found the crag that has lots of cracks
and<00:00:51.530> pods<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.010> we<00:00:52.070> can<00:00:52.220> practice<00:00:52.640> placing

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
and pods and we can practice placing

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.869 
and pods and we can practice placing
without<00:00:53.390> any<00:00:53.629> real<00:00:53.870> risk<00:00:54.160> nuts<00:00:55.160> are<00:00:55.340> known<00:00:55.610> as

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
without any real risk nuts are known as

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.240 
without any real risk nuts are known as
passive<00:00:56.390> protection<00:00:56.600> because<00:00:57.589> they<00:00:57.769> have<00:00:57.980> no

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
passive protection because they have no

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.759 
passive protection because they have no
moving<00:00:58.610> parts<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:59.420> basically<00:01:00.170> works<00:01:00.559> by

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
moving parts it basically works by

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.670 
moving parts it basically works by
geometry<00:01:01.580> the<00:01:01.760> shape<00:01:02.000> of<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.600> nut<00:01:02.839> wedges

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
geometry the shape of the nut wedges

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.000 
geometry the shape of the nut wedges

into a crack when I was learning to play

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.460 
into a crack when I was learning to play
skier<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:07.790> learned<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.420> mnemonic<00:01:08.900> running

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470

constriction bet the nut will wedge into

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.120 
constriction bet the nut will wedge into
and<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.750> constriction<00:01:48.380> actually<00:01:48.710> will<00:01:48.860> hold

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
and the constriction actually will hold

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.670 
and the constriction actually will hold
it<00:01:49.250> in<00:01:49.400> place<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:50.510> S<00:01:50.690> stands<00:01:51.050> for<00:01:51.170> surface

it in place the S stands for surface
contact<00:01:52.220> we<00:01:52.790> want<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.120> have<00:01:53.300> as<00:01:53.510> much<00:01:53.690> as

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
contact we want to have as much as

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.500 
contact we want to have as much as
possible<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:54.710> here<00:01:55.370> you<00:01:55.490> can<00:01:55.670> see<00:01:55.970> that<00:01:56.210> it's

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
possible so here you can see that it's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.530 
possible so here you can see that it's
fully<00:01:56.900> touching<00:01:57.380> on<00:01:57.500> both<00:01:57.680> sides<00:01:58.180> so<00:01:59.180> let's<00:01:59.210> go

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
fully touching on both sides so let's go

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.970 
fully touching on both sides so let's go
over<00:01:59.810> that<00:01:59.930> if<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.230> were<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.380> place<00:02:00.620> a<00:02:00.650> piece<00:02:00.950> of

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
over that if I were to place a piece of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.180 
over that if I were to place a piece of
gear<00:02:01.400> I've<00:02:02.390> climbed<00:02:02.750> up<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.110> my<00:02:03.260> crack<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.100> I'm

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
gear I've climbed up to my crack so I'm

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.700 
gear I've climbed up to my crack so I'm
going<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.400> place<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.610> nut<00:02:05.230> so<00:02:06.230> I<00:02:06.290> pull<00:02:06.530> all<00:02:06.680> my

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
going to place a nut so I pull all my

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.219 
going to place a nut so I pull all my
nuts<00:02:07.040> off<00:02:07.280> I'm<00:02:07.970> going<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.269> find<00:02:08.569> one<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.200> I

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
nuts off I'm going to find one that I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.059 
nuts off I'm going to find one that I
think<00:02:09.349> is<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.769> right<00:02:09.950> size<00:02:11.530> I'm<00:02:12.530> going<00:02:13.010> to

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
think is the right size I'm going to

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.690 
think is the right size I'm going to
slide<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.519> down<00:02:13.810> into<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> constriction<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.670> I

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
slide it down into the constriction so I

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.440 
slide it down into the constriction so I
like<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.360> placement

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
like that placement

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.250 
like that placement
so<00:02:20.020> I'm<00:02:20.080> going<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.260> take<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.620> off

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.440 

and<00:02:24.260> then<00:02:24.530> what<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.579> want<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.849> do<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.299> want

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
and then what you want to do is you want

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.449 
and then what you want to do is you want
to<00:02:26.540> set<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.930> nut<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.409> to<00:02:27.859> do<00:02:28.010> that

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
to set the nut and to do that

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.330 
to set the nut and to do that
want<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.700> give<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:28.849> a<00:02:28.939> nice<00:02:29.090> sharp<00:02:29.629> tug<00:02:30.340> so

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
want to give it a nice sharp tug so

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.830 
want to give it a nice sharp tug so
let's<00:02:31.549> review<00:02:31.790> RDCs

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
let's review RDCs

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.830 
let's review RDCs
we<00:02:33.739> know<00:02:33.859> the<00:02:34.069> rock<00:02:34.219> quality<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.790> good<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
we know the rock quality is good the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.319 
we know the rock quality is good the
direction<00:02:36.379> of<00:02:36.469> pull<00:02:36.739> mostly<00:02:37.370> down<00:02:37.640> slightly

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
direction of pull mostly down slightly

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.080 
direction of pull mostly down slightly
out<00:02:39.069> constriction<00:02:40.069> is<00:02:40.189> really<00:02:40.519> solid<00:02:40.790> it's

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
out constriction is really solid it's

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.089 
out constriction is really solid it's
being<00:02:41.269> held<00:02:41.569> in<00:02:41.720> place<00:02:41.870> by<00:02:41.989> that<00:02:42.319> narrow<00:02:42.620> area

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
being held in place by that narrow area

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.970 
being held in place by that narrow area
and<00:02:43.400> surface<00:02:44.299> contact<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.989> good<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.739> being

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
and surface contact is good it's being

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.640 
and surface contact is good it's being
touched<00:02:46.340> on<00:02:46.579> both<00:02:46.790> sides<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:48.049> that's<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.349> really

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
touched on both sides so that's a really

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.009 
touched on both sides so that's a really
good<00:02:48.799> placement<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:50.420> now<00:02:50.569> we're<00:02:50.720> going<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.930> go

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
good placement so now we're going to go

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.390 
good placement so now we're going to go
over<00:02:51.049> cleaning<00:02:51.859> a<00:02:51.920> nut

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
over cleaning a nut

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.099 
over cleaning a nut
the<00:02:52.969> biggest<00:02:53.180> thing<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.480> do<00:02:53.780> when<00:02:53.959> you're

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
the biggest thing you do when you're

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.289 
the biggest thing you do when you're
cleaning<00:02:54.379> nuts<00:02:54.739> is<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.250> pay<00:02:55.430> attention<00:02:55.939> to<00:02:56.060> how

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
cleaning nuts is to pay attention to how

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.420 
cleaning nuts is to pay attention to how
it<00:02:56.599> went<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.290> try<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:57.920> remove<00:02:58.159> it<00:02:58.310> the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
it went in and try and remove it the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.550 
it went in and try and remove it the
same<00:02:58.639> way<00:02:58.849> so<00:02:59.510> most<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.959> time<00:03:00.109> with<00:03:00.319> nuts

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
same way so most of the time with nuts

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.379 
same way so most of the time with nuts
we're<00:03:00.829> slotting<00:03:01.310> them<00:03:01.459> downward<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.239> they're

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
we're slotting them downward so they're

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.089 
we're slotting them downward so they're
going<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.540> need<00:03:02.720> an<00:03:02.870> upward<00:03:03.290> force<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.950> get

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
going to need an upward force to get

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.879 
going to need an upward force to get
them<00:03:04.250> out<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.549> crack<00:03:05.079> sometimes<00:03:06.079> you<00:03:06.739> can

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
them out of the crack sometimes you can

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.550 
them out of the crack sometimes you can
get<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.040> nut<00:03:07.310> out<00:03:07.519> with<00:03:08.180> just<00:03:08.419> a<00:03:08.569> simple<00:03:09.049> upward

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
get a nut out with just a simple upward

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.500 
get a nut out with just a simple upward
tub<00:03:09.859> and<00:03:10.450> other<00:03:11.450> times<00:03:12.669> when<00:03:13.669> nuts<00:03:13.939> are<00:03:14.120> really

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
tub and other times when nuts are really

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.170 
tub and other times when nuts are really
stuck<00:03:14.900> or<00:03:15.139> maybe<00:03:15.290> they've<00:03:15.500> caught<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.799> fall<00:03:16.189> we

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
stuck or maybe they've caught a fall we

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.809 
stuck or maybe they've caught a fall we
need<00:03:17.359> to<00:03:17.450> use<00:03:17.599> a<00:03:17.629> nut<00:03:17.930> tool<00:03:18.519> it's<00:03:19.519> really

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
need to use a nut tool it's really

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.940 
need to use a nut tool it's really
simple<00:03:20.120> it's<00:03:20.780> pretty<00:03:21.049> much<00:03:21.169> the<00:03:21.409> same<00:03:21.620> thing

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
simple it's pretty much the same thing

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.679 
simple it's pretty much the same thing
you<00:03:22.099> want<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.340> create<00:03:22.609> an<00:03:22.730> upward<00:03:23.120> force<00:03:23.389> that

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:23.689 
you want to create an upward force that

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.140 
you want to create an upward force that
will<00:03:23.780> push<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.139> nut<00:03:24.560> out<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.950> its<00:03:25.069> spot<00:03:25.370> so

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
will push the nut out of its spot so

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.119 
will push the nut out of its spot so
what<00:03:26.329> you<00:03:26.449> want<00:03:26.629> to<00:03:26.720> do<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.169> take<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:27.949> little

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
what you want to do is take the little

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.020 
what you want to do is take the little
end<00:03:28.340> here<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:29.479> just<00:03:30.199> give<00:03:30.379> it<00:03:30.409> a<00:03:30.560> few<00:03:30.769> taps<00:03:31.190> and

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
end here and just give it a few taps and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:04:45.990 
end here and just give it a few taps and
it<00:03:32.479> comes<00:03:32.720> right<00:03:32.840> out

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.060 

you
