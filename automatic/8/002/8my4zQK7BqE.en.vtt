was planning to get my ears pierced and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.790 
was planning to get my ears pierced and
I<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.829> knew<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.969> Claire's<00:00:42.750> did<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.379> but

I first I knew that Claire's did it but

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.520 
I first I knew that Claire's did it but
I<00:00:44.270> wasn't<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.390> hundred<00:00:45.539> percent<00:00:45.780> sure<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.440> would

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
I wasn't a hundred percent sure it would

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.290 
I wasn't a hundred percent sure it would
be<00:00:46.680> safe<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.489> came<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.270> point

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
be safe but then it came to the point

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.810 
be safe but then it came to the point
where<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.820> so

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
where I was like you know it just so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.610 
where I was like you know it just so
many<00:00:51.000> people<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.449> gone<00:00:51.660> their<00:00:51.989> ears<00:00:52.199> pierce

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
many people have gone their ears pierce

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.490 
many people have gone their ears pierce
and<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.210> very<00:00:54.390> unlikely<00:00:55.079> chance

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and it's it's a very unlikely chance

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
and it's it's a very unlikely chance
that<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.010> would<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.280> something<00:00:56.699> wrong<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.329> I

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that they would do something wrong so I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.470 
that they would do something wrong so I
one<00:00:57.570> declares<00:00:58.309> my<00:00:59.309> mom<00:00:59.550> signed<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> paper<00:01:00.149> I
