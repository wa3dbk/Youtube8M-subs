the problems I've had with the show one
of<00:04:29.890> them<00:04:30.040> is<00:04:30.220> how<00:04:30.430> later<00:04:30.730> on<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.300> fights<00:04:31.570> get

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
rather monotonous basically the main

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.690 
rather monotonous basically the main
characters<00:04:35.380> used<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.740> say<00:04:35.950> move<00:04:36.190> over<00:04:36.430> and

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
characters used to say move over and

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.210 
characters used to say move over and
over<00:04:37.000> again<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.510> win<00:04:37.750> which<00:04:38.110> mix<00:04:38.530> battles<00:04:38.980> feel

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
over again to win which mix battles feel

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.710 
over again to win which mix battles feel
pit<00:04:39.430> blander<00:04:39.910> than<00:04:40.120> if<00:04:40.240> there<00:04:40.420> were<00:04:40.570> more

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
pit blander than if there were more

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.020 
pit blander than if there were more
tactics<00:04:41.290> involved<00:04:41.620> or<00:04:41.919> if<00:04:42.310> there<00:04:42.550> were<00:04:42.730> a<00:04:42.760> bit

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
tactics involved or if there were a bit

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.909 
tactics involved or if there were a bit
more<00:04:43.180> variety<00:04:43.690> in<00:04:43.720> how<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:43.990> fights<00:04:44.320> ended<00:04:44.770> I

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
more variety in how the fights ended I

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.500 
more variety in how the fights ended I
mean<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.280> fights<00:04:45.520> themselves<00:04:45.970> are<00:04:46.090> all<00:04:46.210> very

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
mean the fights themselves are all very

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.170 
mean the fights themselves are all very
but<00:04:46.810> just<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.200> way<00:04:47.410> they<00:04:47.650> end<00:04:47.919> aren't<00:04:48.280> some<00:04:49.090> of

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
but just the way they end aren't some of

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.700 
but just the way they end aren't some of
the<00:04:49.240> slice-of-life<00:04:49.450> episodes<00:04:50.110> can<00:04:50.320> be<00:04:50.440> a<00:04:50.470> bit

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
the slice-of-life episodes can be a bit

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.800 
the slice-of-life episodes can be a bit
slow<00:04:50.950> but<00:04:51.310> that's<00:04:51.520> nothing<00:04:51.970> compared<00:04:52.600> to<00:04:52.660> the

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
slow but that's nothing compared to the

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.570 
slow but that's nothing compared to the
blatant<00:04:53.350> misconduct<00:04:53.740> during<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.310> tournament

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
blatant misconduct during a tournament

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.610 
blatant misconduct during a tournament
that<00:04:54.730> everyone<00:04:55.330> just<00:04:55.570> ignores<00:04:55.750> without<00:04:56.440> good

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
that everyone just ignores without good

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.409 
that everyone just ignores without good
reason<00:04:56.650> but<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.400> think<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.760> fierce<00:04:58.000> battles

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
reason but I think the fierce battles

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.700 
reason but I think the fierce battles
between<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.690> likeable<00:04:59.110> characters<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.650> the
