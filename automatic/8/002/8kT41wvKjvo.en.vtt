00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
check out in the past few days might get

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.029 
check out in the past few days might get
some<00:01:21.060> pretty<00:01:21.210> cool<00:01:21.390> views<00:01:21.720> down<00:01:21.929> Canyon<00:01:22.289> and

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
some pretty cool views down Canyon and

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.249 
some pretty cool views down Canyon and
could<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.149> suitable<00:01:24.330> shot<00:01:24.690> I<00:01:24.869> don't<00:01:25.200> know

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
could be a suitable shot I don't know

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.770 
could be a suitable shot I don't know
but<00:01:25.530> again<00:01:26.009> something<00:01:26.789> I<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.179> today<00:01:27.270> it's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
but again something I go for today it's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:48.149 
but again something I go for today it's
just<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.959> have<00:01:28.020> fun<00:01:28.289> relax<00:01:28.759> enjoy<00:01:29.759> myself

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.029 

I<00:01:51.179> think<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:52.329> hike<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:52.840> observation<00:01:53.770> point

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
I think the hike to observation point

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.340 
I think the hike to observation point
was<00:01:54.159> a<00:01:54.189> great<00:01:54.429> way<00:01:54.579> to<00:01:54.640> round<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:54.969> out<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.350> loose

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
was a great way to round it out a loose

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.770 
was a great way to round it out a loose
in<00:01:56.469> my<00:01:56.590> opinion<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.039> great<00:01:57.250> trip<00:01:57.460> no<00:01:58.359> of<00:01:58.509> course

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
in my opinion a great trip no of course

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.569 
in my opinion a great trip no of course
I<00:01:59.140> won't<00:01:59.319> truly<00:01:59.740> know<00:01:59.859> until<00:02:00.069> I<00:02:00.250> get<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.429> film

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
I won't truly know until I get the film

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.190 
I won't truly know until I get the film
back<00:02:00.700> from<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.939> lab<00:02:01.090> which<00:02:01.479> I'm<00:02:01.689> certainly

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
back from the lab which I'm certainly

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.949 
back from the lab which I'm certainly
looking<00:02:02.259> forward<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.859> in<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.009> coming<00:02:03.039> days

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959
