sleeve seam on top of each other and
then<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.760> work<00:00:30.029> your<00:00:30.060> way<00:00:30.359> around<00:00:30.570> first

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
then you just work your way around first

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
then you just work your way around first
a<00:00:31.260> couple<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.590> pins<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> left<00:00:32.430> couple<00:00:32.850> of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
a couple of pins to the left couple of

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.090 
a couple of pins to the left couple of
pins<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.390> right<00:00:33.660> before<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> top

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
pins to the right before you do the top

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400 
pins to the right before you do the top
and<00:00:35.309> whilst<00:00:36.120> you're<00:00:36.360> doing<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.020> very

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and whilst you're doing that it's very

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.639 
and whilst you're doing that it's very
important<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.340> rule<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.000> fabric<00:00:39.530> towards<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
important to rule the fabric towards the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.840 
important to rule the fabric towards the
outside<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.629> quite<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
outside so that you get quite a lot of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.670 
outside so that you get quite a lot of
fabric<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.059> there<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.110> turn<00:00:46.500> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
fabric in there so when you turn it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.979 
fabric in there so when you turn it
around<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:47.879> sets<00:00:48.149> beautiful<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
around it really sets beautiful and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.619 
around it really sets beautiful and
round<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.070> top<00:00:50.340> don't<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.820> tempted<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
round at the top don't be tempted to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.139 
round at the top don't be tempted to
sort<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.050> ease<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.920> sleeve<00:00:53.190> over<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> edge

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
sort of ease the sleeve over the edge

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.139 
sort of ease the sleeve over the edge
but<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.170> rid<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.469> all<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.890> extra<00:00:56.340> fabric

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
but get rid of all that extra fabric

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.360 
but get rid of all that extra fabric

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
shape you might want to pull your thread

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.050 
shape you might want to pull your thread
a<00:01:03.629> little<00:01:03.899> bit<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.060> don't

be tempted to push it over and increase

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.510 
be tempted to push it over and increase
the<00:01:09.540> seam<00:01:09.750> allowance<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.560> not<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.280> sit

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the seam allowance it's not going to sit

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.660 
the seam allowance it's not going to sit
like<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.760> which<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.720> what<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.080> want<00:01:13.670> then

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
when you sew in your sleeve again you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.880 
when you sew in your sleeve again you
need<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> really<00:01:17.850> take<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.210> time<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.720> that

any<00:01:22.259> pleats<00:01:22.619> underneath<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.700> very

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
any pleats underneath it so it's very

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
any pleats underneath it so it's very
important<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> make<00:01:24.750> sure<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.590> always

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.929 
important to make sure that it's always
flat<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.939> tiny<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.810> steps<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> time

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
flat so go tiny little steps at a time

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.179 
flat so go tiny little steps at a time
take<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.180> pin<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:30.570> only<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
take the pin out only as you get to it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.999 
take the pin out only as you get to it
and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.820> use<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.450> pin<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.290> also

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and then you can use the pin to also

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.399 
and then you can use the pin to also
ease<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.520> fabric<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.240> works<00:01:36.810> really

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
ease the fabric in that works really

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:48.920 
ease the fabric in that works really
well

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.990
