00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.389
 certainly the new rodius 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.559
 something else but huge ramón where 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.559
 you are not seeing you 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.520
 this car is gigantic 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.380
 the truth is great inside but 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.240
 especially big on the outside and now 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.420
 let's try to go to the road of 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.619
 burgos if they leave us 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.619
 people 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.360
 the engine responds quite well for what 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.180
 what do you expect from a car of two 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.760
 tons like this 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.059
 are two liters turbodiesel 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:50.559
 own blood production no longer 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.510
 uses that 2.7 of nazaret v6 and the 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.199
 truth is that it is surprising 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.710
 surprising because I think it has 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.540
 lower than the 270 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.219
 and then we found some things 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.620
 curious for example that this car does not 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.619
 has absolutely everything from browser 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.630
 has rear view camera has 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.000
 everything and it's huge in the bad is that as 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.960
 has so much equipment many times the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.640
 Ergonomics is a little careless 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.130
 I commented to ramón earlier that for example 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.440
 the space that before the door is that without 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.750
 nothing you can not put a bottle of 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.110
 half a liter nothing more door sir 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.110
 bottles 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.880
 that yes the position is elevated that so much 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.850
 people like people who drive 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.649
 you and your SUVs have it but I 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.360
 It seems that it is not an advantage because 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.850
 you need all the vision you can 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.399
 have because the back window is 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.560
 so far that it's kind of like 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.970
 hatch and in the background 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.520
 If I get some sports car 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.750
 behind 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.509
 unless possibly a meter that 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.049
 camera that has because mainly 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.049
 which is quite missing 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.810
 if ramón focused cars you're going 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.230
 around we are seeing look except the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.030
 jeep that we have in front 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.860
 we see all the breasts of all 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.260
 cars 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.410
 that lofty position that lacks much 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.410
 make
