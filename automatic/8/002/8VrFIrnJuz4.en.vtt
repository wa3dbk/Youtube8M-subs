00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
back and then you squeeze the air out

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.660 
back and then you squeeze the air out
you<00:00:33.670> put<00:00:33.940> your<00:00:34.800> oxygen<00:00:35.800> also<00:00:36.190> in<00:00:36.340> there

nothing but then I did that cool so then
I<00:00:41.980> get<00:00:42.250> it<00:00:42.370> by<00:00:42.550> half<00:00:42.789> and<00:00:43.030> half<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.559> then<00:00:44.890> I

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
I get it by half and half and then I

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.210 
I get it by half and half and then I
twist<00:00:45.310> it<00:00:46.290> we're<00:00:47.290> going<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.500> happen<00:00:47.829> happen

twist it we're going to happen happen

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:56.850 
twist it we're going to happen happen
and<00:00:48.400> I<00:00:48.460> twisting<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:50.110> then<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:56.230> then<00:00:56.710> when<00:00:56.829> I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
and I twisting and then and then when I

and I twisting and then and then when I
tighten<00:00:57.190> our<00:00:57.550> I<00:00:57.820> make<00:00:58.000> sure<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.270> I<00:00:58.510> pull<00:00:58.899> down

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
tighten our I make sure that I pull down

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.560 
tighten our I make sure that I pull down
but<00:00:59.920> it's<00:01:00.070> not<00:01:00.280> types<00:01:00.700> of<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.329> loose

otherwise it
I<00:01:03.610> should<00:01:04.180> punish<00:01:04.540> tight<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.379> then<00:01:05.800> you<00:01:05.920> make

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
I should punish tight and then you make

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.620 
I should punish tight and then you make
cut<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.610> excess<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:11.470> flipped<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.630> upside

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.350 

and<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:35.170> prevent<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:36.399> oxygen<00:01:37.119> from<00:01:37.299> getting

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
and to prevent the oxygen from getting

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.149 
and to prevent the oxygen from getting
out<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.840> bag<00:01:38.020> because<00:01:38.289> not<00:01:38.619> have<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.009> get

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
out of the bag because not have to get

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.300 
out of the bag because not have to get
out<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:40.420> water<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:40.899> he<00:01:40.990> can<00:01:41.229> do<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:42.220> a

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
out to water and he can do it it's a

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.499 
out to water and he can do it it's a
particle<00:01:42.789> water<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:45.070> either<00:01:45.490> way<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:45.789> good<00:01:46.030> to

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
particle water now either way is good to

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.950 
particle water now either way is good to
go<00:01:46.690> you<00:01:47.350> see<00:01:47.530> how<00:01:47.619> much<00:01:47.830> water<00:01:48.100> is<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:48.369> there
