and your warlock for some reason fairly

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.179 
and your warlock for some reason fairly
easy<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.060> curse<00:01:48.299> eyes<00:01:48.600> us<00:01:48.920> but<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.070> you've

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
easy for the curse eyes us but if you've

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.190 
easy for the curse eyes us but if you've
watched<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.549> game<00:01:50.729> ID<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.630> batter<00:01:51.869> we're

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
watched a game ID we batter we're

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.100 
watched a game ID we batter we're
stumped<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.220> we've<00:01:53.850> Rowand<00:01:54.240> case<00:01:54.479> schools

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.810 
stumped and we've Rowand case schools
and<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.189> an<00:01:56.280> elbow<00:01:56.579> at<00:01:56.640> halftime

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and I think it was an elbow at halftime

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.410 
and I think it was an elbow at halftime
and<00:01:57.360> him<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.079> after<00:01:58.560> laughing<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> bit

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
and him just after laughing so was a bit

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.300 
and him just after laughing so was a bit
unfair<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.290> you're<00:02:04.439> not<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.159> at<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
unfair and you're not to do that at a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.359 
unfair and you're not to do that at a
time<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.990> know<00:02:07.110> all<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.469> easy<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.979> was<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
time you know all the easy that was a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.059 
time you know all the easy that was a
draw<00:02:08.640> chef<00:02:09.000> related<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.599> day<00:02:09.950> from<00:02:10.950> their

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
draw chef related that day from their

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:18.140 
draw chef related that day from their
own<00:02:11.190> ground<00:02:12.860> but<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.580> question<00:02:17.730> we

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
own ground but so the the question we

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.050 
own ground but so the the question we
can<00:02:18.300> only<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.629> valid<00:02:19.050> if<00:02:19.709> he<00:02:19.920> was<00:02:20.069> again<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
can only be valid if he was again and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:31.460 
can only be valid if he was again and
hopefully<00:02:21.629> we<00:02:22.230> don't<00:02:22.489> wonder<00:02:23.489> winner<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:30.470> don't

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
hopefully we don't wonder winner I don't

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.360 
hopefully we don't wonder winner I don't

we<00:04:01.430> don't<00:04:01.579> want<00:04:01.790> that

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.640
