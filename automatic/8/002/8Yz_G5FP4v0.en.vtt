00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.760
 you 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.760
 all 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.400
 and what 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.480
 everyone 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.480
 or not 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:02.680
 and seven stories just a piece of metal 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.259
 to be free I want the rules 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.210
 did not exist to be able to go to that 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.220
 place that awaits me so eagerly and 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.680
 migrate like birds looking for 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.810
 Spring but wait, I still have 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.390
 things to say without reasons to cry 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.310
 there will be more to smile a reason for 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.430
 live and do everything with joy and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.259
 Enjoy it as if it were your last day 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.119
 feel the first rays of the sun on 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.460
 your skin trust that there are outside 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.770
 there is always a faithful friend and that despite 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.960
 everything always has to go ahead on 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.149
 Little bear is when with so little you feel 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.179
 big and if they do not sell me I'll just tell them 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.789
 I'm here I'm still alive and never 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.590
 I gave up that time went by and this was 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.720
 came back in my life that is a well without 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.119
 bottom of which there is no way out and although 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.369
 I've lost so much more than I've won 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.130
 I look to the future and I do not forget my letters 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.289
 from the past I'm afraid of the routine of 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.569
 society of which only my companion accompanies me 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.759
 friend loneliness because to go towards 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.620
 forward is not an option because the 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.870
 more beautiful things always come out of it 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.060
 heart when there is a reason and also 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.340
 There is a reason why I sing for you 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.830
 I cry for you river for you I live for you 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.690
 I write more than twenty thousand songs of 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.270
 I gave my love and all my love without 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.370
 conditions the music invites me to follow 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.260
 standing by the one I was laying for 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.110
 he arrived and also the one who left 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.120
 I am a simple citizen who works a 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.490
 to be that he does not live that he does not dream that he does not 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.070
 fits a ray of sunshine is the one that always 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.070
 bathes me and the reflection of the moon by 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.380
 my guide accompanies me to go towards 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.090
 no part tells me when to get there 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.950
 that's always late and although the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.560
 Time is worth gold I always like 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.080
 losing it is the only way to not 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.180
 having it for a long time I was waiting and 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.730
 I never left because it will last forever 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.830
 what I feel for you I heard the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.900
 Advice from the wise men of life 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.000
 they showed the entrance but never the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.310
 I was told that life is for 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.680
 learn from mistakes and that is part 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.140
 to learn to be better than to laugh is 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.060
 as indispensable as crying and that 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.030
 even if he turns one hundred years old, never stop 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.430
 dream and avoid failure in the most one 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.709
 can look for tranquility in everything 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.810
 surrounds you because life is like that for 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.200
 learn to fall to run for 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:20.400
 grow to never retreat 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.400
 clear that yes once again it is terror 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:30.030
 Well, if in the first degree the new one was the 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.030
 2013 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.150
 direct from the record infection
