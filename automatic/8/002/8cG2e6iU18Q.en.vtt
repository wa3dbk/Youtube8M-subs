00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 I am a leader today uno game note viola 7 grade model 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.010
 I checked it out and it's like how time is 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.510
 Once you have a lot of design 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:20.040
 The computer is processed because it causes metal. 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.930
 There is this p-pattern which can see the inside well, 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.290
 It gives a luxurious feeling 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:31.140
 And on the side that you see on the roof , 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:34.170
 Giving the bent itguyo something a little more attractive and unique design 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.850
 If you look at the thickness 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:43.940
 But the game is the motto ah 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:49.489
 The thicker we are showing it. Of course, the weight is quite large. 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.430
 What era is that the device can be a little taxing another model what 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:01:00.079
 Because there is one game Notebook 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:05.409
 If you like games and hardware, then you'd be tempted to work on it 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:09.899
 I think it might be a little more suitable for those who have a laptop. 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.899
 3 years old 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.360
 In the special case of the keyboard part 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:22.070
 Side trapped atmosphere has become a red lock process 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:28.880
 Itguyo give a little showy feel part of the red lights darkened again 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.409
 The lights come on and support the game at night. 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.770
 There is 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.880
 And the feature we are looking at 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:43.939
 For both sides 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.500
 The jbl sound system is so rich that if you play 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.550
 It is characteristic 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.910
 Let's check it through the game. 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.000
 Monitor at 15.6 inches 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.760

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.380

 Coming only three companies alike called ultra hd mode, it also smokes most sent 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.630
 The 2 hd coming 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.630

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.570
 Well 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:42.269
 But even mosquitoes how good the game is to let out 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.860
 Through watching something into space 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.860
 What if this game 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.000
 If you are in the same situation, 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.560

 Good morning, guys . 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.650
 Oh, really, there are three games that have hardware that does not envy the pc 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.370
 Laptop. 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.870
 It's like a fallen corruption. 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.870
 Popera juljul 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:16.730
 Oh, the touchpad response is very umbrella. 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:22.360
 But that Cho felt no more enviable, such as on the Mac today 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.360
 To include Windows-based investment agenda that will bosim sometimes 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.020

 Very fast and no meeting 2 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:51.120
 You may find that many things are missing. 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:56.940
 These good weight Oh, graphics and lots of air operations in some places 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:02.670
 And to replace the desktop PC with a home hardware 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:04.290

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.770
