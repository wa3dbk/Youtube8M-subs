00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.690
 Actually, I am an environmentally aware person 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.580
 human being i try to save energy 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.770
 Drive your bike as often as possible 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.680
 at least in good weather and me 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.660
 mostly buy organic products but it feels 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.090
 are increasingly wrong with a little meat 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.529
 or eat imported food or 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.610
 if I think about a new one 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.980
 buy mobile phone that can do more 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.270
 not to mention the amount 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:41.499
 plastic packaging every week 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:44.170
 disposed of as harmful to the climate is mine 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:47.699
 I actually calculate lifestyle 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.989
 my co2 output is staggering 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.519
 25 tons per head would be with the 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.010
 climate protection goals compatible 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.539
 my personal record of nine 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.760
 tons of co2 a year 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.850
 at least I'm still under it 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.989
 German average of eleven tonnes 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.600
 I want my ecological 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.120
 it is possible to reduce footprint 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.740
 without loss of quality of life ours 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.130
 we will already change lifestyle 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.470
 have to 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.760
 but from the imagination at any time everything 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.960
 We want to be able to have each other 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.790
 obviously do not run new better 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.930
 Products replace the old ones in always 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.060
 shorter distances 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.100
 after all, our economy needs 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.230
 steady growth in this belief 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.090
 We are stuck even when rising 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.830
 growth rates with garbage 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.650
 climate pollution and wastage of 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.420
 resources go hand in hand only when we 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.610
 Consuming more and more 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.070
 but the gross domestic product is the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.420
 accumulation of goods and services 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.840
 really a good measure of prosperity 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.840
 and luck 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.329
 or do we block ourselves with growing 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.340
 consumption and increasing mobility 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.960
 chance of a good life in the world too 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.819
 future alternative there are those on 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.719
 I am looking for answers 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.719
 on a trip
