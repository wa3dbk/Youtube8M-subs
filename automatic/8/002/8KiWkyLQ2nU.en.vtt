00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.580
 So everyone lost to the next episode of 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 five things in minecraft you still have 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.660
 did not know today again 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.430
 to agree on some interesting things 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.690
 funny stuff and the last fact 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.039
 I honestly thought if we were 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.840
 not fooled but it worked 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.850
 Apparently, it still pretty much sucks me 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.109
 stunned the ye shall therefore see 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.430
 definitely targeted today 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.960
 interesting it stays like much like 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.189
 many post you write the comments 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 be the end of enz if you are 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.460
 have ideas to send in things 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.260
 minecraft not necessarily 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 white writes the video to the comments 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.809
 then you are good with the next one 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.190
 video with it 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.579
 so I say it's already going on 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.020
 with the first story the first one 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.789
 The thing is dominique and he writes 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.190
 it is the one or the only one 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.780
 possibility of a village with 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.190
 rename name tag is im 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.410
 survival mode when in a letter 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.960
 portal stands because otherwise open the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.760
 Gui from the witcher and I have that 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.239
 exposure is actually something that is 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.290
 in creative mode does not exist but in 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.820
 as well as fashion, apparently 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.560
 i made short name tag 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.369
 and let's just name it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:17.030
 times itself calls in to insert 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:21.119
 Let's just call it Horst 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.680
 call the sum and become more profitable 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.420
 now immediately horst and 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.500
 He wants to be challenged when I am 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.880
 stand it on permanently so or that 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.210
 That's why I push the time very short 1 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.210
 to the rear 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.810
 So then created a place for space 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.479
 the blocks legally the English 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.370
 is ported or so the building authority village 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.180
 ag short in the 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.770
 game 0 1 I can only do the cow here 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.360
 even with shift I can only open the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.430
 allowed if someone's never portal goes 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.020
 and then rename it I can hear it 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.760
 even though I do not actually call it 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.740
 This is probably because you can 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.880
 totally sa can not open will believe 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.130
 I have shown before I do not know 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.480
 if I have to often mentioned that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.610
 only possibility I never thought 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.470
 In any case, brilliant idea and it works 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.229
 the next thing is my little john 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.380
 lp knows you know caste 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.340
 a book has a limit of 50 pages a 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.720
 I did not know 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:22.340
 I 've just suspended it 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:24.680
 goes through 23 45 o'clock thus 554550 69 67 19 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.790
 it just keeps going through the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.960
 treasure chamber per second I click 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.050
 do not know , can click quickly 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.150
 but stays at 50 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.230
 books have a limit of 50 pages 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.340
 I did not know correctly yet 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.840
 the next thing is walls 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.520
 eckhardt and he writes when in the 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.720
 spectator looked at us 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.890
 the actually nonexistent 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.430
 all calls visible again 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.630
 it actually goes well short as the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.270
 Inspector mode as you can see it 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.430
 you are nothing there one presses here 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.110
 middle mausrad you have your menu that 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.350
 again disappears but we have 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.489
 no crosshairs cross no crosshairs 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.920
 war zones jet also disappears 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.660
 but then I will go down 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.300
 the beacon draufschauen the 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.770
 crosshair again because the only block 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.989
 where the vehicle is on my back 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.660
 blog it away back there again so so 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.480
 offer makes reticule inspector again 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.610
 Visible not really useful though 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.890
 why is not bank at all 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.930
 just okay the next thing from fork 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.630
 Mitch and he writes when in the game 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.280
 red zero on level 30 enchants attracts 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.150
 it now only three spoon off me 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.470
 must admit I then 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.940
 probably the change I use 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.380
 really attentive because I read 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.480
 thought it will still be the 30 level 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.640
 deducted now with the renewal 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.019
 you have to pay lapis three 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.799
 but now you can if you want 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.260
 At level 30, only three enchants 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.630
 regional 30 always 323 enchantment 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.989
 second levels with levels a shadow 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.840
 level 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.650
 you have to pay more so much 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:00.380
 but we have 29 years a vehicle 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.270
 two times so bad yes really 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.650
 not bad 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.120
 I would have a bit more 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.760
 level again sometimes goes to level 30 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.020
 xp let's just go and join us 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.270
 level 30 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.630
 then we can easily without problems 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:22.360
 to enchant the enchanted so charming 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:25.210
 became drastically cheaper and drastically 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.650
 the last person is stronger now 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.940
 the thing is where i thought what the 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.730
 fuck who fooled me 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.860
 no, it actually works, he writes 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.560
 can also build snow golems horizontally 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.060
 the level I show curious to 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.890
 not only fooling like that but also so 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.440
 if now that puts down the pumpkin 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:48.370
 look right next to it 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.390
 nikolaus asked why and with it 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.980
 I did not expect 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.180
 but it's all you can also 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.710
 build horizontally so I believe 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.260
 in which directions the direction up 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.640
 maybe also what's going on exactly and 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.350
 they will end up on the blog where 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.820
 actually the foot is theoretically if 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.200
 you put it diagonally so here you have to 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.460
 then we end up that the foot blog is 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:13.570
 his head is showing he tracy chapman 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.190
 that was unexpected then it would be 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.450
 have been again from today's episode 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.340
 how many of the things do you have to do 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.620
 let me know if you like him 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.970
 embark on comments and then 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.640
 I would say see you next time 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.250
 video and relaxed from find out 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.030
 I want to continue like never ending 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.530
 he likes to be on the canal 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.530
 drop by corner partly 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.460
 Look, see you next time 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.699
 Yes
