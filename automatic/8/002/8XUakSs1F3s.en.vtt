00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.130 
did what he had was he had about five or
six<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.910> least<00:01:00.059> nucleus<00:01:00.539> bunched<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:00.960> together

top there I think that I came out on top
this<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.490> seemed<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.820> damage<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.210> her<00:01:18.330> number

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
this it seemed to damage of her number
or<00:01:21.030> maybe<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.659> was<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.869> boxer<00:01:22.350> actually

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
or maybe it was that boxer actually

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.080 
or maybe it was that boxer actually
moved<00:01:22.830> some<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.130> ms<00:01:23.310> CDs<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.670> because<00:01:23.970> it's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
moved some was ms CDs out because it's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.219 
moved some was ms CDs out because it's
impossible<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.659> he<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:24.930> built<00:01:25.080> so

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
impossible that he would have built so

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
impossible that he would have built so
many<00:01:25.320> stds<00:01:25.710> again<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> maybe<00:01:26.250> realizing<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
many stds again and maybe realizing that

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.700 
many stds again and maybe realizing that
his<00:01:27.030> defense<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.390> slightly<00:01:27.659> weak<00:01:27.990> he<00:01:28.470> sent

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
his defense was slightly weak he sent

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.140 
his defense was slightly weak he sent
his<00:01:28.829> STDs<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:29.670> you're<00:01:29.850> looking<00:01:29.939> at

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
his STDs out and now you're looking at

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.520 
his STDs out and now you're looking at
the<00:01:30.210> first<00:01:30.420> person<00:01:30.720> view<00:01:30.810> mode<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.380> can

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the first person view mode and you can

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
the first person view mode and you can
see<00:01:31.680> how<00:01:31.860> fast<00:01:32.130> these<00:01:32.310> players<00:01:32.610> play<00:01:32.759> when

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
see how fast these players play when

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.950 
see how fast these players play when
they're<00:01:33.090> playing<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> game<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.540> starcraft

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
they're playing a game of starcraft

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.480 
they're playing a game of starcraft
moving<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.290> units<00:01:34.590> around<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.369> is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
moving the units around and this is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.460 
moving the units around and this is
literally<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.360> boxer<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.930> doing<00:01:37.140> right<00:01:37.259> now

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
what what are your impressions of the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.109 
what what are your impressions of the
speed<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.420> which<00:01:39.450> he's<00:01:39.689> playing<00:01:40.549> um<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.970> don't

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
speed with which he's playing um I don't

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.730 
speed with which he's playing um I don't
know<00:01:42.360> how<00:01:42.600> many<00:01:42.810> units<00:01:42.960> he<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.290> move<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.530> once

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
know how many units he can move at once

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.499 
know how many units he can move at once
if<00:01:43.890> he's<00:01:44.009> moving<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.640> unit<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> time<00:01:45.299> he's

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
if he's moving one unit at a time he's

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.940 
if he's moving one unit at a time he's
doing<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:45.899> he's<00:01:46.200> able<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.500> select<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.829> group

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
doing a lot he's able to select a group

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.910 
doing a lot he's able to select a group
of<00:01:47.070> units<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.520> 12<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.880> once<00:01:48.590> well<00:01:49.590> he<00:01:49.710> seems

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
of units up to 12 at once well he seems

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.069 
of units up to 12 at once well he seems
to<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.040> doing<00:01:50.149> but<00:01:51.149> he<00:01:51.270> still<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.869> if<00:01:51.960> he's

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to be doing but he still but but if he's

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.719 
to be doing but he still but but if he's
if<00:01:52.380> he<00:01:52.560> has<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.829> assign<00:01:53.040> different<00:01:53.220> has<00:01:53.579> two

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
if he has to assign different has two

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.710 
if he has to assign different has two
different<00:01:53.850> units<00:01:54.210> has<00:01:54.360> two<00:01:54.420> selected

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
different units has two selected

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.789 
different units has two selected
individuals<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.290> see<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:55.530> now<00:01:55.649> he's

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
individuals you can see there now he's

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.560 
individuals you can see there now he's
just<00:01:55.829> got<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> single<00:01:56.280> SCB<00:01:56.670> now<00:01:57.210> he's<00:01:57.450> putting

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
just got a single SCB now he's putting

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.240 
just got a single SCB now he's putting
on<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> racks<00:01:58.049> with<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.040> we

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
on a racks with that one and I think we

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.289 
on a racks with that one and I think we
might<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.520> switching<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.880> Odense<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.180> so

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
might be switching to Odense you so

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.670 
might be switching to Odense you so
boxer<00:02:00.600> seems<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:00.960> new<00:02:01.020> orders<00:02:01.049> base<00:02:01.380> Odin

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
boxer seems to have new orders base Odin

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.590 
boxer seems to have new orders base Odin
is<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:01.890> coming<00:02:02.100> forward<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.430> lurkers<00:02:02.909> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
is now coming forward with lurkers and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.480 
is now coming forward with lurkers and
he's<00:02:03.719> got<00:02:03.899> some<00:02:04.140> medical<00:02:04.770> Marines<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
he's got some medical Marines so the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.649 
he's got some medical Marines so the
problem<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> those<00:02:06.000> lurkers<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.509> burrow

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
problem is those lurkers can burrow

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.690 
problem is those lurkers can burrow
underground<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.259> hit<00:02:07.380> boxers<00:02:07.770> units<00:02:08.129> so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
underground and hit boxers units so

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.219 
underground and hit boxers units so
boxer<00:02:09.090> can't<00:02:09.360> move<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:09.660> because<00:02:09.810> he<00:02:10.020> can't

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
boxer can't move out because he can't

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.290 
boxer can't move out because he can't
see<00:02:10.440> them<00:02:10.590> he's<00:02:11.190> got<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> scanning<00:02:11.879> technology

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
see them he's got a scanning technology

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.550 
see them he's got a scanning technology
which<00:02:12.390> allows<00:02:12.599> them<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
which allows them to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.600 
which allows them to
which<00:02:13.650> allows<00:02:13.830> him<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.190> them<00:02:14.340> he's<00:02:14.489> also

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
which allows him to see them he's also

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.089 
which allows him to see them he's also
got<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:15.000> star<00:02:15.810> port<00:02:16.080> up<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.680> science

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
got a star port up with a science

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.260 
got a star port up with a science
facility<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:17.550> once<00:02:17.730> he<00:02:17.760> has<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> Science<00:02:18.239> Vessel

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
facility so once he has a Science Vessel

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
facility so once he has a Science Vessel
out<00:02:18.569> then<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.720> can<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.020> hidden<00:02:19.260> units

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
out then you can see the hidden units

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.960 
out then you can see the hidden units
and<00:02:19.680> now<00:02:19.770> he's<00:02:19.980> actually<00:02:20.130> got<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> scan<00:02:20.640> off<00:02:20.790> and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
and now he's actually got a scan off and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.430 
and now he's actually got a scan off and
he's<00:02:21.060> seen<00:02:21.180> those<00:02:21.209> hidden<00:02:21.480> units<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.230> can

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
he's seen those hidden units so you can

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.260 
he's seen those hidden units so you can
see<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.800> there's<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.430> different<00:02:23.790> different

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
see that there's the different different

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.059 
see that there's the different different
kinds<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.720> units<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.020> can<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.319> used<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.739> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
kinds of units that can be used in the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.290 
kinds of units that can be used in the
game<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.310> starcraft<00:02:26.700> which<00:02:26.819> is<00:02:26.910> what<00:02:27.060> makes

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
game of starcraft which is what makes

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.570 
game of starcraft which is what makes
for<00:02:27.630> great<00:02:27.720> diversity<00:02:28.080> yeah<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:31.400> can<00:02:32.400> see<00:02:32.550> that

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
for great diversity yeah I can see that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.449 
for great diversity yeah I can see that
yeah<00:02:33.000> okay<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.170> mean<00:02:34.830> if<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.190> had<00:02:35.310> to

venture opinion you can see that for

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.020 
venture opinion you can see that for
example<00:02:36.870> Odin<00:02:37.530> has<00:02:37.650> got<00:02:37.800> four<00:02:38.459> bases<00:02:38.849> because

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
example Odin has got four bases because

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.820 
example Odin has got four bases because
he's<00:02:39.209> got<00:02:39.360> his<00:02:39.480> main<00:02:39.660> base<00:02:39.959> he's<00:02:40.440> got<00:02:40.500> another

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
he's got his main base he's got another

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.530 
he's got his main base he's got another
two<00:02:41.069> bases<00:02:41.400> inside<00:02:41.700> his<00:02:41.940> main<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.300> he's<00:02:42.390> got

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
two bases inside his main and he's got

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.690 
two bases inside his main and he's got
one<00:02:42.569> at<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.230> bottom<00:02:43.800> left-hand<00:02:44.280> corner<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
one at the bottom left-hand corner the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.530 
one at the bottom left-hand corner the
map<00:02:44.849> there<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.150> can<00:02:45.180> see<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.420> little

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
map there if you can see that little

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.000 
map there if you can see that little
white<00:02:45.810> blob<00:02:46.019> on<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> mini-map<00:02:46.440> yeah<00:02:46.830> which

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
white blob on the mini-map yeah which

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.500 
white blob on the mini-map yeah which
I'm<00:02:47.130> pointing<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.580> he's<00:02:48.000> got<00:02:48.150> those<00:02:48.269> four

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
I'm pointing to he's got those four

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.090 
I'm pointing to he's got those four
bases<00:02:48.810> where<00:02:48.930> his<00:02:49.019> boxer<00:02:49.350> seems<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.709> boxed

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
bases where his boxer seems to be boxed

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.650 
bases where his boxer seems to be boxed
in<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.549> bottom<00:02:50.850> left<00:02:51.060> hand<00:02:51.120> corner<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.540> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
in in the bottom left hand corner of the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.840 
in in the bottom left hand corner of the
map<00:02:51.810> right<00:02:51.989> now<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.769> mean<00:02:53.010> based<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.580> what

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
map right now so I mean based on what

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.400 
map right now so I mean based on what
you've<00:02:54.000> seen<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.269> far<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.019> have<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.290> say

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
you've seen this far if you have to say

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.170 
you've seen this far if you have to say
that<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.650> felt<00:02:55.860> one<00:02:56.040> players<00:02:56.310> was<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.760> top<00:02:56.970> who

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
that you felt one players was on top who

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.000 
that you felt one players was on top who
would<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.390> have<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.600> give<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.319> think

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
would you have to give that to I think

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.589 
would you have to give that to I think
this<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.370> very<00:02:59.400> basic<00:02:59.790> thing<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.269> say<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:00.480> i

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
this is a very basic thing to say but i

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.059 
this is a very basic thing to say but i
would<00:03:00.750> say<00:03:00.870> ordinance<00:03:01.319> on<00:03:01.410> top<00:03:01.620> he<00:03:01.769> seems<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
would say ordinance on top he seems to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.740 
would say ordinance on top he seems to
be<00:03:02.099> attacking<00:03:02.519> more<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.940> he<00:03:03.180> also<00:03:03.330> seems<00:03:03.630> to

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
be attacking more and he also seems to

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.870 
be attacking more and he also seems to
mean<00:03:03.870> basis<00:03:04.260> yeah<00:03:04.860> i<00:03:04.890> think<00:03:05.069> that<00:03:05.280> despite<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
mean basis yeah i think that despite the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.460 
mean basis yeah i think that despite the
fact<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.630> haven't<00:03:06.840> washed<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.260> lot<00:03:07.349> of

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
fact that you haven't washed a lot of

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.559 
fact that you haven't washed a lot of
starcraft<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.310> haven't<00:03:08.640> really<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.480> is

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
starcraft and you haven't really this is

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.240 
starcraft and you haven't really this is
your<00:03:09.690> first<00:03:09.959> time<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.440> pop<00:03:10.650> probably

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
your first time you pop probably

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.589 
your first time you pop probably
watching<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.549> proper<00:03:11.819> game<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.060> starcraft<00:03:12.420> and

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
watching a proper game of starcraft and

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.729 
watching a proper game of starcraft and
you've<00:03:12.690> never<00:03:12.810> played<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.380> don't<00:03:13.560> even

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
you've never played it you don't even

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:14.809 
you've never played it you don't even
know<00:03:13.830> what<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.099> basic<00:03:14.370> units<00:03:14.580> are<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.730> think

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
know what the basic units are I think

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.370 
know what the basic units are I think
you're<00:03:15.060> showing<00:03:15.239> an<00:03:15.330> incredible<00:03:15.780> grasp<00:03:16.170> of

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
you're showing an incredible grasp of

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.440 
you're showing an incredible grasp of
basic<00:03:16.709> tactics<00:03:17.069> because<00:03:17.519> one<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.299> key

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
basic tactics because one of the key

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.900 
basic tactics because one of the key
things<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.870> starcraft<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.400> ability<00:03:20.609> to

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
things in starcraft is the ability to

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.640 
things in starcraft is the ability to
put<00:03:21.060> pressure<00:03:21.390> on<00:03:21.810> your<00:03:21.989> opponent<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.410> keep

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
put pressure on your opponent and keep

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.520 
put pressure on your opponent and keep
him<00:03:22.799> on<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:22.950> back<00:03:23.190> foot<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:24.290> therefore<00:03:25.290> allow

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
him on the back foot and therefore allow

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.930 
him on the back foot and therefore allow
yourself<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.040> have<00:03:26.160> more<00:03:26.370> control<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.820> map

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
yourself to have more control of the map

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.150 
yourself to have more control of the map
to<00:03:27.090> expand<00:03:27.510> more<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.650> be<00:03:28.769> in<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:28.920> stronger

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
to expand more and to be in a stronger

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.460 
to expand more and to be in a stronger
position<00:03:29.600> but<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.720> difference<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.200> even

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
position but the difference is that even

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.020 
position but the difference is that even
though<00:03:31.650> Odin<00:03:31.980> has<00:03:32.160> done<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.880> key

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
though Odin has done that that the key

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.220 
though Odin has done that that the key
is<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.209> he<00:03:33.390> hasn't<00:03:33.540> done<00:03:33.720> too<00:03:33.870> much<00:03:34.170> damage

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
is that he hasn't done too much damage

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.199 
is that he hasn't done too much damage
to<00:03:34.530> boxers<00:03:34.890> economy<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.760> there's<00:03:36.000> still<00:03:36.120> a

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
to boxers economy so there's still a

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.240 
to boxers economy so there's still a
chance<00:03:36.299> because<00:03:36.690> Terran<00:03:37.109> players<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.950> that's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
chance because Terran players and that's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.530 
chance because Terran players and that's
the<00:03:38.370> difference<00:03:38.549> between<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.120> two<00:03:39.269> races

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
the difference between the two races

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.849 
the difference between the two races
Tara<00:03:39.750> players<00:03:39.900> are<00:03:40.140> very<00:03:40.380> good<00:03:40.500> at<00:03:40.590> absorbing

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
Tara players are very good at absorbing

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.979 
Tara players are very good at absorbing
damage<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.489> then<00:03:41.579> making<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.940> big<00:03:42.090> push<00:03:42.299> out<00:03:42.510> so

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
damage and then making a big push out so

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.050 
damage and then making a big push out so
and<00:03:43.340> because<00:03:44.340> of<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.670> map<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.940> we're

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
and because of the map that we're

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.160 
and because of the map that we're
playing<00:03:45.180> on<00:03:45.329> which<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.569> Andromeda<00:03:45.780> which<00:03:46.079> is

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
playing on which is Andromeda which is

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.240 
playing on which is Andromeda which is
exactly<00:03:46.290> designed<00:03:46.739> for<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.069> kind<00:03:47.130> of

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
exactly designed for this kind of

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.530 
exactly designed for this kind of
tournament<00:03:47.579> looks<00:03:47.790> like<00:03:47.880> Odin<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.209> now<00:03:48.329> coming

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
tournament looks like Odin is now coming

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.000 
tournament looks like Odin is now coming
to<00:03:48.630> try<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:48.930> set<00:03:49.049> up<00:03:49.139> a<00:03:49.200> flanking<00:03:49.590> attack<00:03:49.829> on

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
to try and set up a flanking attack on

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.379 
to try and set up a flanking attack on
boxer<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:50.880> might<00:03:51.030> be<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.209> critical

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
boxer and this might be the critical

main<00:04:27.190> basis<00:04:27.810> well<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.900> suppose<00:04:29.140> that<00:04:29.320> years

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
main basis well I suppose that years

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.500 
main basis well I suppose that years
leaving<00:04:29.800> himself<00:04:29.920> a<00:04:30.190> bit<00:04:30.340> vulnerable<00:04:30.610> but<00:04:31.120> he

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
leaving himself a bit vulnerable but he

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.090 
leaving himself a bit vulnerable but he
he's<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.110> one<00:04:32.230> who's<00:04:32.380> been<00:04:32.500> under<00:04:32.740> attack<00:04:32.890> in

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
he's the one who's been under attack in

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.590 
he's the one who's been under attack in
his<00:04:33.370> taken<00:04:33.550> in<00:04:33.670> for<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:33.820> bit<00:04:33.940> of<00:04:33.970> damage<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.570> I

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
his taken in for a bit of damage so I

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.270 
his taken in for a bit of damage so I
think<00:04:34.990> it's<00:04:35.080> about<00:04:35.140> time<00:04:35.440> for<00:04:35.500> him<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.860> do<00:04:36.070> some

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
think it's about time for him to do some

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
break past this defense of Odin's and it

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.850 
break past this defense of Odin's and it
does<00:05:10.840> look<00:05:11.020> like<00:05:11.140> Odin's<00:05:11.500> going<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:11.680> be<00:05:11.740> in<00:05:11.800> a

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
does look like Odin's going to be in a

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.170 
does look like Odin's going to be in a
very<00:05:12.100> strong<00:05:12.340> position<00:05:12.400> as<00:05:12.850> this<00:05:13.030> game

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
very strong position as this game

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.630 
very strong position as this game
progresses<00:05:13.800> this<00:05:14.800> box<00:05:15.160> for<00:05:15.370> attacking

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
progresses this box for attacking

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.820 
progresses this box for attacking
another<00:05:15.940> base<00:05:16.180> of<00:05:16.330> Odin<00:05:16.570> sounds<00:05:16.930> yeah<00:05:17.410> boxers

another base of Odin sounds yeah boxers

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.830 
another base of Odin sounds yeah boxers
now<00:05:18.010> because<00:05:18.520> his<00:05:18.610> attack<00:05:18.970> failed<00:05:19.300> at<00:05:19.510> Odin's

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
now because his attack failed at Odin's

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.660 
now because his attack failed at Odin's
main<00:05:20.020> base<00:05:20.260> at<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.500> front<00:05:20.710> door<00:05:20.890> he<00:05:21.370> decided

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
main base at the front door he decided

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.600 
main base at the front door he decided
to<00:05:21.820> move<00:05:21.940> his<00:05:22.120> army<00:05:22.840> south<00:05:23.140> and<00:05:23.440> go<00:05:23.680> for<00:05:23.950> the<00:05:23.980> or

to move his army south and go for the or

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.310 
to move his army south and go for the or
go<00:05:25.210> for<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.450> base<00:05:25.600> in<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.810> bottom<00:05:25.840> left-hand

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
go for the base in the bottom left-hand

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.630 
go for the base in the bottom left-hand
corner<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.710> map<00:05:26.860> but<00:05:26.980> he's<00:05:27.100> been<00:05:27.250> pushed<00:05:27.490> away

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
corner the map but he's been pushed away

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.550 
corner the map but he's been pushed away
from<00:05:27.850> there<00:05:28.000> as<00:05:28.090> well<00:05:28.240> so<00:05:28.270> so<00:05:28.570> far<00:05:28.780> both<00:05:29.320> of<00:05:29.470> his

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
from there as well so so far both of his

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.820 
from there as well so so far both of his
attacks<00:05:29.800> had<00:05:30.040> been<00:05:30.160> quite<00:05:30.370> an<00:05:30.490> effectual<00:05:31.830> so

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
attacks had been quite an effectual so

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.960 
attacks had been quite an effectual so
he<00:05:32.950> just<00:05:33.100> needs<00:05:33.280> to<00:05:33.340> make<00:05:33.460> his<00:05:33.550> army<00:05:33.820> a<00:05:33.850> bit

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
he just needs to make his army a bit

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.670 
he just needs to make his army a bit
stronger<00:05:34.240> and<00:05:34.480> attack<00:05:34.750> again<00:05:35.080> he<00:05:35.380> doesn't

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
stronger and attack again he doesn't

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.720 
stronger and attack again he doesn't
seem<00:05:35.800> like<00:05:35.860> he's<00:05:36.100> under<00:05:36.280> attack<00:05:36.520> at<00:05:36.640> the

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
seem like he's under attack at the

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.920 
seem like he's under attack at the
moment<00:05:37.000> so<00:05:37.090> that<00:05:37.120> gives<00:05:37.390> him<00:05:37.510> a<00:05:37.600> little<00:05:37.690> bit<00:05:37.870> of

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
moment so that gives him a little bit of

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.460 
moment so that gives him a little bit of
time<00:05:38.280> yeah<00:05:39.280> exactly<00:05:39.460> he<00:05:40.360> does<00:05:40.990> seem<00:05:41.200> to<00:05:41.380> be

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
time yeah exactly he does seem to be

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.920 
time yeah exactly he does seem to be
keeping<00:05:41.890> Orden<00:05:42.460> relatively<00:05:43.090> at<00:05:43.180> bay<00:05:43.360> but<00:05:43.780> the

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
keeping Orden relatively at bay but the

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.720 
keeping Orden relatively at bay but the
problem<00:05:44.290> for<00:05:44.410> boxer<00:05:44.770> is<00:05:44.920> that<00:05:45.070> Alden<00:05:45.400> has<00:05:45.550> now

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
problem for boxer is that Alden has now

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.270 
problem for boxer is that Alden has now
got<00:05:46.000> one<00:05:46.270> two<00:05:46.510> three<00:05:46.900> four<00:05:47.230> five<00:05:47.530> bases<00:05:48.100> two

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
got one two three four five bases two

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.000 
got one two three four five bases two
boxers<00:05:48.940> three<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:49.570> even<00:05:50.410> though<00:05:50.530> boxer<00:05:50.890> is<00:05:50.980> a

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
boxers three and even though boxer is a

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.980 
boxers three and even though boxer is a
Terran<00:05:51.370> and<00:05:51.520> he<00:05:51.580> requires<00:05:51.910> less<00:05:52.270> economy<00:05:52.870> he

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
Terran and he requires less economy he

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.750 
Terran and he requires less economy he
requires<00:05:53.260> less<00:05:53.500> minerals<00:05:54.100> and<00:05:54.250> gas<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.640> money

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
requires less minerals and gas and money

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.640 
requires less minerals and gas and money
to<00:05:55.390> make<00:05:55.660> his<00:05:55.780> attack<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.170> looks<00:05:56.320> like<00:05:56.410> bosses

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
to make his attack and looks like bosses

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.750 
to make his attack and looks like bosses
and<00:05:56.740> just<00:05:56.950> interest<00:05:57.190> at<00:05:57.280> these<00:05:57.370> two<00:05:57.520> scores

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
and just interest at these two scores

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.460 
and just interest at these two scores
here<00:05:57.910> once<00:05:58.390> again<00:05:58.630> looks<00:05:58.780> like<00:05:58.840> boxers<00:05:59.200> making

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
here once again looks like boxers making

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.560 
here once again looks like boxers making
an<00:05:59.590> attempt<00:05:59.890> to<00:05:59.950> push<00:06:00.250> northward<00:06:00.790> and<00:06:01.180> you<00:06:01.450> can

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
an attempt to push northward and you can

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.060 
an attempt to push northward and you can
see<00:06:01.660> that<00:06:01.810> that<00:06:01.840> he<00:06:02.260> boxer<00:06:02.590> doesn't<00:06:02.830> want<00:06:02.980> to

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
see that that he boxer doesn't want to

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.530 
see that that he boxer doesn't want to
fight<00:06:03.220> under<00:06:03.490> that<00:06:03.610> orange<00:06:03.940> swarm<00:06:04.270> because

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
fight under that orange swarm because

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.940 
fight under that orange swarm because
under<00:06:04.750> that<00:06:04.870> orange<00:06:05.110> swarms<00:06:05.410> org<00:06:05.590> units<00:06:05.860> are

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
under that orange swarms org units are

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.580 
under that orange swarms org units are
nearly<00:06:06.250> invulnerable<00:06:06.700> to<00:06:07.540> turn<00:06:07.810> attacks<00:06:08.170> so

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
nearly invulnerable to turn attacks so

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.870 
nearly invulnerable to turn attacks so
what<00:06:08.740> box<00:06:08.950> is<00:06:09.100> trying<00:06:09.280> to<00:06:09.340> do<00:06:09.430> is<00:06:09.490> he's<00:06:09.610> trying

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
what box is trying to do is he's trying

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.070 
what box is trying to do is he's trying
to<00:06:09.970> get<00:06:10.030> his<00:06:10.150> opponent<00:06:10.480> to<00:06:10.540> waste<00:06:10.690> the<00:06:10.780> swarms

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
to get his opponent to waste the swarms

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.470 
to get his opponent to waste the swarms
and<00:06:11.170> move<00:06:11.500> away<00:06:11.860> from<00:06:12.640> under<00:06:12.970> the<00:06:13.060> swarm<00:06:13.330> to

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
and move away from under the swarm to

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.300 
and move away from under the swarm to
fight<00:06:13.660> them<00:06:13.810> outside<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:14.290> a<00:06:14.620> plague<00:06:14.920> as<00:06:15.160> well

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.960 
you can see the red thing is a disease
plague<00:06:17.500> that<00:06:17.530> is<00:06:17.860> cast<00:06:18.130> by<00:06:18.310> deserve<00:06:18.580> players

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
plague that is cast by deserve players

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.240

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
on the Terran units which can be quite

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.820 
on the Terran units which can be quite
harmful<00:06:21.580> to<00:06:21.880> them<00:06:22.060> so<00:06:22.450> Odin<00:06:22.780> the<00:06:23.200> All<00:06:23.560> orden

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
really needs to do is continue to macro

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.000 
really needs to do is continue to macro
up<00:06:25.870> and<00:06:26.110> basically<00:06:26.410> continue<00:06:26.800> to<00:06:26.890> increase

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
up and basically continue to increase

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
it's been a long time since we've seen

nukes<00:06:40.330> in<00:06:40.449> this<00:06:40.570> game<00:06:40.780> and<00:06:41.470> if<00:06:41.590> boxer<00:06:41.919> manages

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250

nukes in this game and if boxer manages
to<00:06:42.340> execute<00:06:42.790> a<00:06:42.820> nuclear<00:06:43.300> he<00:06:43.870> could<00:06:44.020> really

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:44.139 
to execute a nuclear he could really

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.890 
to execute a nuclear he could really
turn<00:06:44.380> the<00:06:44.530> tide<00:06:44.680> of<00:06:44.710> this<00:06:44.889> game<00:06:45.509> maybe<00:06:46.509> so<00:06:46.780> but

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
turn the tide of this game maybe so but

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.379 
turn the tide of this game maybe so but
it<00:06:47.020> seemed<00:06:47.259> that<00:06:47.850> Odin's<00:06:48.850> controlling<00:06:49.330> the

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
it seemed that Odin's controlling the

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.210 
it seemed that Odin's controlling the
map<00:06:49.570> at<00:06:49.690> the<00:06:49.780> moment<00:06:50.050> on<00:06:50.110> boxers<00:06:50.500> just<00:06:50.770> boxed

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220

in<00:06:51.340> literally<00:06:51.669> in<00:06:51.820> a<00:06:51.880> corner<00:06:52.240> well<00:06:52.930> actually

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:53.139 
in literally in a corner well actually

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.290 
in literally in a corner well actually
I'm<00:06:53.650> not<00:06:53.830> sure<00:06:54.009> that's<00:06:54.190> a<00:06:54.430> completely<00:06:55.000> fair

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
I'm not sure that's a completely fair

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.670 
I'm not sure that's a completely fair
assessment<00:06:55.449> because<00:06:55.690> even<00:06:56.050> though<00:06:56.169> Odin<00:06:56.560> has

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
assessment because even though Odin has

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.499 
assessment because even though Odin has
got<00:06:56.800> more<00:06:56.979> expansions<00:06:57.520> boxers<00:06:58.240> actually

spread<00:06:58.750> out<00:06:58.870> more<00:06:59.110> on<00:06:59.289> the<00:06:59.380> map<00:06:59.500> he's<00:06:59.710> got

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
spread out more on the map he's got

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.129 
spread out more on the map he's got

a<00:07:07.449> lot<00:07:07.539> of<00:07:07.600> trouble<00:07:07.840> and<00:07:07.930> I<00:07:07.960> think<00:07:08.169> you've

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259 
a lot of trouble and I think you've

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.919 
a lot of trouble and I think you've
called<00:07:08.560> it<00:07:08.710> perfectly
