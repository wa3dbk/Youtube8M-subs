us in your water bath the first thing I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.930 
us in your water bath the first thing I

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
noticed when I unbox my item here is

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.789 
noticed when I unbox my item here is
that<00:01:54.150> it<00:01:54.270> sits<00:01:54.570> quite<00:01:55.110> large<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.650> a<00:01:55.680> lot

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
that it sits quite large it's a lot

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.740 
that it sits quite large it's a lot
larger<00:01:56.159> than<00:01:56.400> I<00:01:56.610> expected<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.060> be<00:01:57.270> based<00:01:57.570> on

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
larger than I expected to be based on

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.179 
larger than I expected to be based on
the<00:01:58.200> photos<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.619> everything<00:01:58.740> else<00:01:58.979> they'd

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the photos and everything else they'd

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.890 
the photos and everything else they'd
done<00:01:59.460> doing<00:01:59.729> research<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.360> looked<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.810> little

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
done doing research this looked a little

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.300 
done doing research this looked a little
bit<00:02:01.110> smaller<00:02:01.380> not<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.830> it's<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.070> bad<00:02:02.280> thing

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
bit smaller not like it's a bad thing

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.920 
bit smaller not like it's a bad thing
but<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.850> quite<00:02:03.119> begging<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.659> gonna<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.900> a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
but it is quite begging it's gonna be a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.240 
but it is quite begging it's gonna be a
little<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.260> harder<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.500> store<00:02:04.799> because<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
little bit harder to store because the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.800 
little bit harder to store because the
container<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.970> actually<00:02:06.210> comes<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.689> not

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
container that actually comes in is not

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
container that actually comes in is not
very<00:02:07.049> storable<00:02:07.470> because<00:02:07.650> it's<00:02:07.799> even<00:02:08.429> larger

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
very storable because it's even larger

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.460 
very storable because it's even larger
than<00:02:08.909> the<00:02:09.000> unit<00:02:09.239> itself<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.289> maybe

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
than the unit itself but so that maybe

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.839 
than the unit itself but so that maybe
you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.099> know<00:02:11.160> consideration<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:11.790> you

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
you can you know consideration if you

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.130 
you can you know consideration if you
got<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> small<00:02:12.180> kitchen<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:12.959> another

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
got a small kitchen and you have another

we<00:02:20.050> have<00:02:20.080> something<00:02:20.350> like<00:02:20.440> this<00:02:20.590> there<00:02:20.800> are

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
we have something like this there are

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.130 
we have something like this there are
markers<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:22.090> unit<00:02:22.540> itself<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.050> can

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
markers on the unit itself so you can

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.050 
markers on the unit itself so you can
measure<00:02:23.350> like<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.680> minimum<00:02:24.310> maximum<00:02:24.520> water

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060

on how to make this filet but basically
for<00:03:22.360> our<00:03:22.420> review<00:03:22.900> purposes<00:03:23.080> we're<00:03:23.380> going<00:03:23.500> to

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
for our review purposes we're going to

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.590 
for our review purposes we're going to
do<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.680> simple<00:03:23.920> filet<00:03:24.310> with<00:03:24.820> some<00:03:25.060> thyme<00:03:25.330> and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
do a simple filet with some thyme and

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.020 
do a simple filet with some thyme and
some<00:03:26.110> butter<00:03:26.350> here<00:03:26.709> in<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.890> back<00:03:27.010> when<00:03:27.880> you

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
some butter here in the back when you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.940 
some butter here in the back when you
put<00:03:28.630> this<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:28.900> here<00:03:28.930> we<00:03:29.350> need<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.620> seal<00:03:29.800> it<00:03:29.920> and

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
put this in here we need to seal it and

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.470 
put this in here we need to seal it and
get<00:03:30.100> rid<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.280> all<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.610> air<00:03:30.760> there's<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.330> few

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
get rid of all the air there's a few

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.850 
get rid of all the air there's a few
different<00:03:31.720> ways<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.110> get<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.320> air<00:03:32.440> out<00:03:32.470> using

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
different ways you get the air out using

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.680 
different ways you get the air out using
a<00:03:32.920> vacuum<00:03:33.250> sealer<00:03:33.489> is<00:03:33.700> very<00:03:33.880> popular<00:03:34.270> but<00:03:34.630> in

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
a vacuum sealer is very popular but in

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.490 
a vacuum sealer is very popular but in
this<00:03:34.780> case<00:03:34.930> we're<00:03:35.080> gonna<00:03:35.170> use<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.410> water

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
this case we're gonna use the water

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.870 
this case we're gonna use the water
displacement<00:03:36.100> method<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.610> we're<00:03:36.700> going<00:03:36.790> to

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
displacement method so we're going to

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.670 
displacement method so we're going to
simply<00:03:37.060> put<00:03:37.330> this<00:03:37.510> under<00:03:37.900> water<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:38.410> it's

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
simply put this under water and it's

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.350 
simply put this under water and it's
going<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.890> push<00:03:39.070> all<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.489> air<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.150> top

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
going to push all that air to the top

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.880 
going to push all that air to the top
and<00:03:40.570> once<00:03:40.750> all<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.050> air<00:03:41.170> is<00:03:41.290> out<00:03:41.440> we're<00:03:41.860> just

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
and once all the air is out we're just

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.009 
and once all the air is out we're just
going<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.190> seal<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.580> may<00:03:42.940> not<00:03:43.090> get<00:03:43.239> as<00:03:43.390> much<00:03:43.780> out

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
going to seal it may not get as much out

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.840 
going to seal it may not get as much out
as<00:03:44.050> like<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.500> vacuum<00:03:44.739> sealer<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.580> could<00:03:45.730> use<00:03:45.820> a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
as like a vacuum sealer you could use a

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.640 
as like a vacuum sealer you could use a
straw<00:03:46.239> if<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.690> would<00:03:46.810> like<00:03:46.989> put<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.410> straw<00:03:47.620> in

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
straw if you would like put a straw in

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.870 
straw if you would like put a straw in
there<00:03:47.860> leave<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.190> open<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.459> little<00:03:48.640> bit<00:03:48.730> and

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
there leave it open a little bit and

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.910 
there leave it open a little bit and
just<00:03:48.910> suck<00:03:49.239> all<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.480> air<00:03:49.720> out<00:03:49.769> remaining<00:03:50.769> air

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
just suck all the air out remaining air

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.710 
just suck all the air out remaining air
that<00:03:51.670> also<00:03:51.970> works<00:03:52.150> but<00:03:52.300> we're<00:03:52.390> just<00:03:52.510> gonna<00:03:52.600> go

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
that also works but we're just gonna go

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.420 
that also works but we're just gonna go
ahead<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:52.900> water<00:03:53.410> displacement<00:03:53.830> method<00:03:54.040> get

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
ahead and water displacement method get

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.920 
ahead and water displacement method get
the<00:03:54.519> water<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.820> bag<00:03:54.970> we're<00:03:55.450> going<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.690> fold

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
the water of the bag we're going to fold

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.290 
the water of the bag we're going to fold
it<00:03:56.019> over<00:03:56.080> here<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.580> strap<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:57.730> clamp<00:03:58.180> it

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
it over here and strap it clamp it

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.060 
it over here and strap it clamp it
attach<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.410> opposite<00:03:59.769> side<00:03:59.950> of<00:03:59.980> the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
attach it to the opposite side of the

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.199 
attach it to the opposite side of the
sous-vide<00:04:00.310> cooker<00:04:00.550> so<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:00.790> isn't<00:04:00.910> floating

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
sous-vide cooker so this isn't floating

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.000 
sous-vide cooker so this isn't floating
around<00:04:01.390> we<00:04:02.350> want<00:04:02.470> it<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.709> be<00:04:02.800> able<00:04:02.950> to

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
around we want it to be able to

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.410 
around we want it to be able to
circulate<00:04:03.400> we<00:04:03.550> don't<00:04:03.700> want<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:04.000> get<00:04:04.150> caught

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
circulate we don't want to get caught

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.940 
circulate we don't want to get caught
and<00:04:04.570> block<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.959> water<00:04:05.140> flow<00:04:05.380> so<00:04:05.590> we're<00:04:05.860> going

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950

bit of carbonization on the outside it

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.230 
bit of carbonization on the outside it
cooks<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.770> very<00:05:02.950> nice<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.280> even<00:05:03.580> and<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:03.940> look

you don't lose a lot of moisture here
obviously<00:05:05.770> if<00:05:06.070> this<00:05:06.160> would<00:05:06.280> then<00:05:06.370> cook<00:05:06.550> on<00:05:06.670> a

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
obviously if this would then cook on a

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.280 
obviously if this would then cook on a
grill<00:05:06.760> it<00:05:07.450> may<00:05:07.600> have<00:05:07.690> looked<00:05:07.750> a<00:05:08.050> little<00:05:08.140> bit

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
grill it may have looked a little bit

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.020 
grill it may have looked a little bit
smaller<00:05:08.620> as<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:08.860> lost<00:05:09.130> a<00:05:09.250> lot<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.400> juices<00:05:09.850> you

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
smaller as you lost a lot of juices you

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.490 
smaller as you lost a lot of juices you
can<00:05:10.390> then<00:05:10.540> go<00:05:10.690> ahead<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:10.960> top<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.230> off<00:05:11.290> a

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
can then go ahead and top it off a

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.260 
can then go ahead and top it off a
little<00:05:11.860> bit<00:05:11.950> of<00:05:12.040> pan<00:05:12.250> sauce<00:05:12.520> adding<00:05:12.880> some<00:05:13.060> wine
