okay<00:03:52.450> now<00:03:52.630> on<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:52.810> basing<00:03:53.380> this<00:03:53.620> is<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.890> final

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
okay now on to basing this is the final

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.290 
okay now on to basing this is the final
stage<00:03:54.520> of<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.790> model<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:56.670> for<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:57.790> model<00:03:58.060> I

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
stage of the model and for this model I

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.590 
stage of the model and for this model I
want<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.690> have<00:03:58.960> an<00:03:59.230> all<00:03:59.410> grass<00:03:59.800> base<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.480> we

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
want it to have an all grass base so we

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.470 
want it to have an all grass base so we
start<00:04:01.840> off<00:04:01.990> with<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.260> layer<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:02.650> PVA<00:04:03.190> glue<00:04:03.480> then

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
start off with a layer of PVA glue then

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.410 
start off with a layer of PVA glue then
use<00:04:04.750> an<00:04:04.900> old<00:04:05.280> rapid<00:04:06.280> brush<00:04:06.640> just<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.090> spread

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
use an old rapid brush just to spread

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.210 
use an old rapid brush just to spread
the<00:04:07.510> glue<00:04:07.660> around<00:04:07.840> doesn't<00:04:08.770> matter<00:04:08.980> if<00:04:09.130> it

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
the glue around doesn't matter if it

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.410 
the glue around doesn't matter if it
goes<00:04:09.370> on<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.640> feet<00:04:09.880> any<00:04:11.910> then<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.030> technique

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
goes on the feet any then the technique

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.310 
goes on the feet any then the technique
for<00:04:13.600> making<00:04:13.750> static<00:04:14.230> grass<00:04:14.620> stand<00:04:15.370> up<00:04:15.550> is<00:04:16.510> to

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
for making static grass stand up is to

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.500 
for making static grass stand up is to
pinch<00:04:17.830> a<00:04:18.130> good<00:04:18.400> amount<00:04:18.610> of<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.940> static<00:04:19.300> grass

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
pinch a good amount of the static grass

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.890 
pinch a good amount of the static grass
and<00:04:20.070> literally<00:04:21.070> poke<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.520> into<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:22.330> PVA<00:04:22.810> glue

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
and literally poke it into the PVA glue

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.050 
and literally poke it into the PVA glue
and<00:04:23.650> what<00:04:23.770> that'll<00:04:23.950> do<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.190> make<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.790> grass

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
and what that'll do is make the grass

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.760 
and what that'll do is make the grass
stand<00:04:25.420> on<00:04:25.540> its<00:04:25.690> end<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:30.960> we're<00:04:31.960> done<00:04:32.170> this<00:04:32.530> is

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
stand on its end and we're done this is

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:44.820 
stand on its end and we're done this is
a<00:04:32.830> finished<00:04:33.160> product

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.890
