a<00:00:33.320> year<00:00:34.190> of<00:00:34.309> design<00:00:34.640> development<00:00:34.970> and<00:00:35.420> testing

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
a year of design development and testing

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.250 
a year of design development and testing
went<00:00:36.050> into<00:00:36.230> making<00:00:36.380> our<00:00:36.649> section<00:00:36.980> cup<00:00:38.260> our

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
went into making our section cup our

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.900 
went into making our section cup our
goal<00:00:39.530> was<00:00:39.739> to<00:00:39.800> create<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.190> best<00:00:40.370> suction<00:00:40.760> cup

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
goal was to create the best suction cup

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.299 
goal was to create the best suction cup
available<00:00:41.390> for<00:00:41.540> action<00:00:41.930> cameras<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:42.500> we<00:00:43.100> did

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
available for action cameras and we did

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.400 
available for action cameras and we did
our<00:00:43.579> new<00:00:43.970> twist<00:00:44.270> lock<00:00:44.449> design<00:00:44.809> removes<00:00:45.140> bulk

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
our new twist lock design removes bulk

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.770 
our new twist lock design removes bulk
resulting<00:00:46.190> in<00:00:46.280> less<00:00:46.430> video<00:00:46.790> vibration<00:00:47.360> you

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
resulting in less video vibration you

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.450 
resulting in less video vibration you
simply<00:00:48.170> twist<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.590> lock<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:48.920> securely<00:00:49.040> in
