for future videos um they were

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.270 
for future videos um they were
definitely<00:02:09.479> trying<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.259> funny<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:10.739> I

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
definitely trying to be funny but I

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.050 
definitely trying to be funny but I
I<00:02:12.340> didn't<00:02:12.850> really<00:02:13.240> see<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:14.560> need<00:02:15.040> for<00:02:15.910> that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
I didn't really see the need for that

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.309 
I didn't really see the need for that
humor<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.740> then<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.670> second<00:02:19.360> one<00:02:19.390> well<00:02:20.110> I

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
humor and then the second one well I

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.070 
humor and then the second one well I
should<00:02:20.620> say<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:21.069> like<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.819> idea<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.540> just

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080

behind-the-scenes thing that they had
which<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.680> mentioned<00:02:32.950> before<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.819> was

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450

pretty<00:02:43.140> well<00:02:44.220> some<00:02:45.220> cool<00:02:45.400> information<00:02:46.060> about

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
pretty well some cool information about

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.699 
pretty well some cool information about
the<00:02:46.510> QbD<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:48.630> still<00:02:49.630> kind<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.080> think<00:02:50.140> it's<00:02:50.470> funny

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
the QbD I still kind of think it's funny

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.030 
the QbD I still kind of think it's funny
that<00:02:51.510> during<00:02:52.510> runefest<00:02:52.810> or<00:02:53.260> wherever<00:02:53.680> they

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
that during runefest or wherever they

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.800 
that during runefest or wherever they
leaked<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.989> concept<00:02:55.989> art<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:57.810> dragon

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.080 
leaked the concept art of the dragon
kite<00:02:58.989> shield<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.560> then<00:02:59.950> went<00:03:00.220> on<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.640> say<00:03:01.060> that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
been saying the dragon crossbow it's a

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.590 
been saying the dragon crossbow it's a
crossbow<00:04:18.070> of<00:04:18.190> some<00:04:18.430> sort<00:04:18.760> but<00:04:18.970> whether<00:04:19.390> it's

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
crossbow of some sort but whether it's

called<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.019> dragon<00:04:20.560> crossbow<00:04:21.039> or<00:04:21.070> not<00:04:21.370> I

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
called the dragon crossbow or not I

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:26.370 
called the dragon crossbow or not I
nobody<00:04:22.810> knows<00:04:23.200> quite<00:04:23.500> yet<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.750> nobody<00:04:25.750> knows

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
nobody knows quite yet and nobody knows

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.520 
nobody knows quite yet and nobody knows
well<00:04:26.620> I'm<00:04:27.690> guessing<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.170> will<00:04:29.380> be

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
well I'm guessing that it will be

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.430 
well I'm guessing that it will be
tradable<00:04:29.920> but<00:04:30.280> they<00:04:31.090> haven't<00:04:31.270> said<00:04:31.570> it<00:04:31.720> will

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
tradable but they haven't said it will

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.840 
tradable but they haven't said it will
be<00:04:32.620> or<00:04:33.160> hasn't<00:04:33.430> or<00:04:34.060> won't<00:04:34.600> be<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:39.430> course<00:04:39.700> the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
be or hasn't or won't be of course the

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.110 
be or hasn't or won't be of course the
kite<00:04:40.030> shield<00:04:40.270> will<00:04:40.480> probably<00:04:40.990> be<00:04:41.200> tradable<00:04:45.120> so

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
kite shield will probably be tradable so

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.570 
kite shield will probably be tradable so
let's<00:04:46.690> see<00:04:48.690> what<00:04:49.690> else<00:04:49.810> do<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.110> have<00:04:50.170> here<00:04:50.380> oh<00:04:50.950> of
