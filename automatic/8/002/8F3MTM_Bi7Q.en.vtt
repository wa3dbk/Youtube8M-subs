00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
see the the mail has done a great job of

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.860 
see the the mail has done a great job of
keeping<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.559> pristine<00:00:43.980> condition

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
keeping it in pristine condition

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.500 
keeping it in pristine condition
especially<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.410> box<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.520> i<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.300> cut<00:00:48.420> around

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
especially the box but i just cut around

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.790 
especially the box but i just cut around
the<00:00:48.660> edges<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.140> i<00:00:49.170> figured<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.590> could<00:00:49.680> open

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the edges so i figured we could open

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.400 
the edges so i figured we could open
this<00:00:50.039> thing<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.489> take<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> look<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.030> it

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
this thing up and take a look at it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.160 
this thing up and take a look at it
first<00:00:52.410> thing<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.390> an

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
first thing you can see here this is an

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.830 
first thing you can see here this is an
edge<00:00:55.379> connector<00:00:56.030> JAMA<00:00:57.030> edge<00:00:57.149> connector<00:00:57.600> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
edge connector JAMA edge connector and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.650 
edge connector JAMA edge connector and
that<00:00:58.199> thing<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:59.120> pretty<00:01:00.120> corroded<00:01:01.219> but<00:01:02.219> um<00:01:02.660> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that thing is pretty corroded but um it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.920 
that thing is pretty corroded but um it
looks<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.799> could<00:01:05.869> have<00:01:06.869> some<00:01:07.290> hope

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
looks like it could have some hope

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.969 
looks like it could have some hope
although<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> does<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.409> lot<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.619> corrosion

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
although it does have a lot of corrosion

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
although it does have a lot of corrosion
at<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.460> board<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.720> said<00:01:12.750> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
at this board here out like you said it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.789 
at this board here out like you said it
has<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> lot<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.400> lot<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.970> corrosion<00:01:15.750> around<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
has a lot a lot of corrosion around it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.679 
has a lot a lot of corrosion around it
so<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.640> doesn't<00:01:17.820> know<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.180> salvageable

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
so he doesn't know if it's salvageable

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.120 
so he doesn't know if it's salvageable
or<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.320> we'll<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:20.009> with

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
have to do some serious cleaning on this

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.450 
have to do some serious cleaning on this
board<00:02:11.570> got<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.110> snapped<00:02:12.410> off<00:02:12.590> capacitor<00:02:13.220> over

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
board got a snapped off capacitor over

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.860 
board got a snapped off capacitor over
here<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.140> fuse<00:02:15.440> holder<00:02:16.240> looks<00:02:17.240> yeah

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
here this is the fuse holder looks yeah

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.060 
here this is the fuse holder looks yeah
just<00:02:18.230> really<00:02:18.980> really<00:02:19.160> corroded<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:21.770> pins

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
just really really corroded the pins

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.360 
just really really corroded the pins
here<00:02:22.490> on<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.060> side<00:02:23.360> are<00:02:24.070> completely<00:02:25.070> rusted

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
here on the side are completely rusted

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.670 
here on the side are completely rusted
so<00:02:28.240> hopefully<00:02:29.240> it<00:02:29.330> won't<00:02:29.540> be<00:02:29.630> hopeless<00:02:30.350> but

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
so hopefully it won't be hopeless but

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.310 
so hopefully it won't be hopeless but
I'm<00:02:31.370> not<00:02:31.640> sure<00:02:31.670> here<00:02:32.240> wow<00:02:32.540> these<00:02:32.930> are<00:02:32.990> some

with<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:07.280> know<00:03:07.370> try<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.910> clean<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.080> up

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
with it you know try and clean this up

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.280 
with it you know try and clean this up
as<00:03:09.610> much<00:03:10.610> as<00:03:10.820> possible<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.570> don't<00:03:11.989> know<00:03:12.049> about

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
as much as possible I don't know about

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.979 
as much as possible I don't know about
these<00:03:12.880> easy<00:03:13.880> problems<00:03:14.299> in<00:03:14.420> here<00:03:14.630> though<00:03:14.780> these

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
these easy problems in here though these

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.560 
these easy problems in here though these
e<00:03:15.170> problems<00:03:15.530> probably<00:03:15.860> I'm<00:03:16.640> guessing<00:03:16.700> since

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
e problems probably I'm guessing since

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.259 
e problems probably I'm guessing since
they<00:03:17.750> have<00:03:17.930> all<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.580> covers<00:03:19.580> taken<00:03:19.970> off<00:03:20.090> of

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
they have all of the covers taken off of

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.610 
they have all of the covers taken off of
them<00:03:20.450> they've<00:03:20.630> probably<00:03:20.840> been<00:03:20.989> exposed<00:03:21.500> to

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
them they've probably been exposed to

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.340 
them they've probably been exposed to
some<00:03:21.860> sort<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.130> sunlight<00:03:22.580> or<00:03:23.260> something<00:03:24.260> like

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
some sort of sunlight or something like

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.870 
some sort of sunlight or something like
that<00:03:24.410> i'm<00:03:24.680> guessing<00:03:25.070> that<00:03:25.100> they<00:03:25.370> are<00:03:25.580> probably

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
that i'm guessing that they are probably

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.400 
that i'm guessing that they are probably
erased<00:03:26.540> or<00:03:27.519> non-functioning<00:03:28.519> but<00:03:29.290> we'll<00:03:30.290> give

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
erased or non-functioning but we'll give

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.259 
erased or non-functioning but we'll give
it<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.650> benefit<00:03:31.100> of<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.280> doubt<00:03:31.430> here<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:32.000> see

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
it the benefit of the doubt here and see

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.500 
it the benefit of the doubt here and see
what<00:03:32.299> we<00:03:32.450> can<00:03:32.690> do<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:33.200> don't<00:03:34.070> know<00:03:34.220> maybe<00:03:34.790> maybe

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
what we can do I don't know maybe maybe

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.449 
what we can do I don't know maybe maybe
there's<00:03:35.810> some<00:03:36.019> hope<00:03:36.049> for<00:03:36.200> this<00:03:36.440> board<00:03:36.739> we'll
