00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.030
 so this video I want to present to you for 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.190
 in order to 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.369
 you had a little idea 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.399
 how can you still play some 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.220
 Indian music or music can 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.830
 You can even call it Arabic 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.330
 there is closer to the sector that plays on 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.560
 sitar that plays on various 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.690
 exotic oriental instruments here 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.209
 that is, in this case the guitar is 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.620
 sounded like imitation there are such 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.900
 tools east here i'm not even 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.840
 I ordered I know where two are for them 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.420
 the strings here with the help of these two 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.840
 such music is touched to play as 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.480
 she turns out we will play two 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.310
 strings one string we will serve 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.470
 background that is, we will still be all 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.209
 We are open and we are even and will not be on it 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.800
 compress these waters it will be 4 strictly 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.480
 just it will serve as a background here 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.330
 music is naturally free here 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.670
 only one film adaptation on fantasy i 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.200
 I will only show you the water we clamp 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.980
 will be on the third string so we will 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.430
 use 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.989
 just two strings it will be 4 p 3 we 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.750
 we will use only these two strings 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.060
 you can play for example 4 big 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.160
 finger another time I will show you now 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.950
 what young people wish to clamp on the third 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.380
 string and always we will play the third 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.330
 simultaneity 4 so let's go hold down 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.620
 first 3 on 2 fret 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:31.670
 Here we played 4 open and 3 on the second 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.830
 next we take the third on the fifth one 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:47.180
 preferably here these frets how 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:54.050
 way you can play here we will go 10 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:58.400
 lat after 7 then you can play 12 later 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.750
 already burn 14 here in general is no longer 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.500
 sure it can cut 4 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.500
 Daladna 3 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.989
 4 5 6 turbo 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.990
 still study appropriate here is such a technique 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.990
 use a layer 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.479
 healthy we reach the 5th fret and sharply 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.479
 ride back 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:33.200
 kill like length can distinguish 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.200
 2 on 3 ran for launch in 2
