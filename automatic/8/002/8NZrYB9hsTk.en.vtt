 Okunev Ivan Vasilyevich director take it 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.490
 Pavel Sukhanov is the nickname before the bear 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.070
 Pasha accepted how did you get to the Urals 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.270
 steel tell me I arrived 100 kilometers 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.170
 from the city of Yekaterinburg and got on 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.570
 Ural steel you live and the boat will 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.039
 let's begin our interview with the main thing 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.869
 and the actual issue we are on 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.210
 today i am almost zero zero zero 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.700
 eight eight china impressions left 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 after after breeding by very and very 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.780
 good i've been waiting for new premium chinese 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.780
 cumulative pierce and at 300 but his 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.180
 ponerfili and made 250 and this brightened 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.989
 joy but in general the patch is suitable as are all 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.899
 previous today here in lower tagil 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.030
 in the framework of the Ural steel pass 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.489
 proper tournament Ural steel 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.399
 for the first time as if not for the first time but on stage 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.129
 gathered 4 northern team you have 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.710
 Already China impressions here and what 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.150
 specifically about this event 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.380
 the event is very good only the screen 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.700
 which is installed on it is impossible 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.979
 nothing to see because he 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.650
 LED and see nothing but 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.090
 the color of the card is therefore in this small 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.460
 minus but overall the tournament is good all 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.740
 teams that participate will highlight 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.020
 somebody's favorite well all the teams are good 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.659
 all guys are cool but my illness is given 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.210
 such department is actually not a secret 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.060
 that you are a part of the organization in 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.009
 You can already see the length of the various avatars 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.320
 on the youtube channel in contact, I will tell 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.970
 a little bit about this collaboration with us 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.680
 we cooperate while being studied 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.299
 detailed scheme of our joint 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.189
 pastime but overall very 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.560
 a lot of video will go out symbolism 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.540
 na'vi on the channel and on the channel navi tanks 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.909
 will go out some videos with that or 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.750
 otherwise built-in theme so see 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.350
 don't miss 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.790
 and I think it will be interesting anyway 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.659
 how do you develop events on your 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.159
 channel uphill every day every week 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.710
 how much time has passed since your beginning 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.719
 let's say such a driver's belay 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.790
 how do you generally position passed 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.170
 probably almost a year and a half but 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.069
 honestly did not expect this from 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.780
 simple hobby get something more 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.159
 weight and a day did not expect that it will be 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.840
 very serious part of my life as 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.250
 now that's why i am big 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.379
 I look forward to looking forward with pleasure 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.870
 will be further and while in anticipation 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.750
 something bigger than it is now 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.700
 that's how you position yourself after all 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.859
 Well, let's say my role is information 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.620
 informative video timed to the game 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.739
 world of tanks and in the future to all 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.569
 projects wargaming and now not 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.099
 decent for my replacement tanks yet 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.139
 airplanes I don't really like but with 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.790
 time may be beyond change therefore 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:44.030
 for now we are moving to control 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.040
 tanks and look into the future to itself 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.379
 game as you see the future 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.120
 Do you think that world on tv land 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.200
 has cyber sports ok let's say the future 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.209
 I believe that any trash 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.859
 cybersport future and that too but 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.049
 it depends a lot on several 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.359
 factors from a lack of balance in this or that 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.129
 otherwise itâ€™s not so clear 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.659
 not all balanced from the player 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.790
 depends much depends on luck on 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.620
 some kind of farta is something else and me 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.870
 It seems it is not the moments that are being taken out 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.370
 kinda for amateurs interesting 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.049
 feature but for professionals you need 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.209
 every every nezah and strange songs 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.220
 the enemy is very important therefore there is 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.769
 small difficulties in this regard the game 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.629
 let's say it is more sharpened by some 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.970
 equally player on the other side 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.310
 computer a and network games together 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.019
 eSports here seems to me but there is something 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.729
 what about what you need to think including here 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.709
 guys tune in before the tournament for 40 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.150
 minutes each team was quite possible 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.620
 would arrange some download 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.409
 whether something is fast 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.759
 but overall I honestly have this market 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.349
 computer games and changes very quickly 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:44.540
 fast it is what will be through 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.889
 few years without even a face you 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.979
 though every month what will happen next year 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:52.250
 Bears see it to you personally here 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:54.470
 at this stage, introduced to the war of tanks 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.090
 I would make an endless ignore list they do not 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.659
 it was enough for the first 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.770
 why because no bat filter 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.050
 no 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.450
 automatic ban system is nothing 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.670
 gives a good if not some player in 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.350
 I do not like the game, I would like to mark it 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.390
 yourself in the bank and remember him always 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.360
 I think the developers are listening to 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.340
 opinion question let's say so 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.520
 professional plan what qualities 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.500
 qualities should be a person who 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.080
 seeks to become a successful water streamer 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.540
 whether it is necessary to be 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.090
 successful in this business need to do 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.790
 something and do not give up as if very often 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.560
 and in any business start here difficult 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.900
 because all criticism arises and 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.000
 many burns on it are published but if 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.070
 overcome then further on criticism 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.570
 replaced by the fact that people start 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.610
 appreciate and respect some afterwards and 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.440
 love so the main thing is to start and not 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.210
 dwell on any I will but 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.790
 Now you as it would have been a whale 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.310
 Odessa on the complexity of the difficult moments 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.010
 when you just wanted to stop mining 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.550
 several times and how are you why and how 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.680
 corrected 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.090
 This was due to the fact that my 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.650
 activity crossed a little with 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.870
 personal life and with this arose 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.150
 problems but then with time I have it 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.640
 overcame what just made of it 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.280
 your piece of piles personal life from this 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.410
 Affairs question probably already know many 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.930
 some do not know his answer why 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.090
 amway here you tee shirt in related 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.730
 with makeup but it's not a circus is Svetik 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.480
 American company I work with 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.310
 it a few years and in general a lot of who I am 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.690
 now from myself was connected 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.970
 so that I learned a lot with 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.010
 this whole work, well, that's why my 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.780
 nickname amway words was taken easy 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.310
 so my team is 21 but so far 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.080
 well visit great for the interview there 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.750
