00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.959
 hi to all by giuseppe ragozzino we are here with an aifon a4 i1 who is 7 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.969
 to demonstrate 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.939
 in the second half 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.800
 both phones use the hd format then 1002 bandwidth 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.589
 120 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.719
 now we begin to demonstrate the Giacomo license 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.919
 you know how to take a look at the contrast project bros of the scooter 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.850
 in my opinion it is more distinct I am not glasses 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.570
 also in this case 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.800
 as you see the same subject red taken up 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.170
 from aifon and nochia the seven pardoned simonetto n8 fennel 7 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.600
 enrico medi here 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 the best presented eminem contrast 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 from the recording quality of nockia c7 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.420
 let's remember that the model we are 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.030
 trying in this moment and series I obviously speak the nights and 7 the aifon 4 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.900
 succeeded 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 one piece on the market 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.320
 in both cases we are talking about high-end phones as far as watching 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.010
 in particular 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.900
 the seven we still talk about a preser as 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.900
 this has been provided tano 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.800
 note the details of the sketches 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.010
 as for the slightly more faithful nisseno colors 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.010
 are glasses in this case the next comment 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.559
 note the definition of the writing 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.089
 regarding 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.089
 a quick cream 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:17.869
 I find that the images on the sects are better contrasted, I confirm this - 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:19.409
 and pressure tubes chi off 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.299
 using 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.779
 integrated into the phone 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:29.180
 however I don't think it deviates a lot this is the reality also results 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:30.799
 vision on your part 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.309
 unfortunately youtub a little to lose the colita however they are 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.139
 we go as our habit 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.829
 ada speak online exactly as they are recorded it is not 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.829
 there is no retouching 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.839
 I would like you to judge then obviously 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.839
 from you if the quality seems to you sufficient or not 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.569
 this is just a demonstration of how much you are a fan or phone as far as sapphire 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.569
 on the other 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.050
 online em then obviously you will also find with comparison photos with ostrava blade 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.029
 kick the first one even in that case to realize as in this 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.029
 in comparable photos as much as possible 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:07.259
 the videoconfronto ends here you have on the PC of material 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.199
 to be evaluated 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.930
 I recommend you subscribe to the channel so as not to miss the next ones 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.150
 comparisons we make for you 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.930
