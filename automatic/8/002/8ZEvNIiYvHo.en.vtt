00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello dear of us and today we are 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.230
 we will cook fried shrimp 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.630
 since this is a very long procedure 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.480
 very very sure about this killed about 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.519
 hours of time why in your 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.070
 in principle, we initially 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.410
 shows places 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.430
 means we need for this pepper 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.189
 chili red what else 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.250
 rosemary before you need it fresh 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.929
 it is natural that we have garlic garlic 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.090
 can be less but basically just 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.070
 considered that their hi dofiga and therefore 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.380
 need so much 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.969
 its sauce is desirable in principle simply 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.050
 so it was salty not necessarily 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.090
 for some reason 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.210
 sold if salty is just like that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.760
 and lemon can be more possible 1 means 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.170
 we will cook in olive oil 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.629
 olive oil can be any major 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.710
 for it was olive oil to cook 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.059
 we will pan grid which in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.800
 principle generally used on and 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.899
 cooking either soups or else 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.390
 something like that but roughly in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.000
 Asian cuisine 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.119
 pour olive oil we heat 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.580
 pan basically 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.460
 I don’t have to wait much so I put 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.229
 to maximum temperature 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.640
 while we have a hot pan 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.210
 we do than what is necessary as 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.210
 can be smaller 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:36.880
 Naturally before that, at least about music 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:38.950
 where he we had was unknown desirable 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.720
 so that it is really sharp but to 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.190
 Sorry in Moscow we find 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.190
 hot chili peppers are almost impossible 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.619
 here accordingly I do not know let's 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.320
 try to the right so much try it on 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.509
 the severity if someone does not know the closer to 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.509
 the tip of the subject is less bitter 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.489
 not even bitter wrong sharp here 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.899
 it's pretty sharp that is the principle 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.899
 we will not need much 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.170
 which is surprisingly a long time ago 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.000
 we haven't seen ck in Moscow for a long time 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.650
 taught pepper he is really hot 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.650
 for this case we have a beer 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.510
 for deep any chuvash 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:45.400
 so it means grind so I think more 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.910
 we do not need. against the severity but by 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.060
 I can see in principle , given that I 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.980
 love spicy food that pepper 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.850
 really turned out to be sharp so i 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.829
 I think that a little bit more like this 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.250
 enough 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.250
 we don't need more 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.810
 judging by the smell of olives oil 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.019
 it heats up you can even stick 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.000
 look how steam went out of it but it 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:24.019
 probably it should be so at an angle to watch 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.230
 Well, in principle, so it is clear by the way, we can 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.079
 we'll add not more onions 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.230
 very good since the main critic 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:43.370
 my cooking vs onions add we 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:45.620
 we will not mean that this whole thing is ground 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.560
 preferably smaller but how come 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.780
 if someone has not enough time or 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.609
 forces well you can use a blender but 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.379
 for the sake of such a quantity and use 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:59.299
 blender you somehow bust help 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.010
 That's why, in principle, the beam with a knife so 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.340
 here we all went accordingly 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.120
 process we lower the temperature 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:11.239
 the pan is already hot somewhere in the 11 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.139
 12 yes okay hour and carefully bypass 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.139
 not to get burned 

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:23.990
 Immediately by the way such a pleasant smell on up 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:29.990
 2pac probably the sea went straight 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:32.760
 great dream we take pin to hold everyone 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.880
 there is nothing standard 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.150
 there is no individual and we start it all 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.810
 did stir while pan on 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.980
 to-rum on and naturally we need to fry 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.830
 there will not be much Ukrainian here 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.670
 15 minutes probably no more all this 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:58.500
 everything will be hot now 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:59.810
 so it means to us and now let us 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.390
 these were still prune 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:07.440
 enough yes that is more precisely not because 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.570
 what will be acute if it does not become 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.070
 guys if anyone should be sharper 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.010
 accordingly make it sharper here 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:18.530
 no other privileges 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:21.950
 just in fact took us a little bit 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.990
 By the way, just in case I bought hl2 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.630
 they turned out to be thickets 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:36.990
 well and it is good housekeeping come in handy 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:38.550
 by the way hands but it's nice so yes we have 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.670
 idea should be cleaned if 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.350
 consistently go to the question on 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:46.320
 throw shrimp at this time clean 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.220
 garlic is still in this time but it's in 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.270
 principle not necessary 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:56.030
 especially could estuary and they all lemon lemon 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.190
 lemon 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:03.380
 Rosemary we probably will add on 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:06.270
 so that the project went to taste 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:10.410
 right here to be honest with rosemary and 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.750
 cook it for the first time but smell 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.230
 damn good and smell like 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.150
 ban when you come out of the bath 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.660
 or rather you go to the bathhouse and yours is good 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.969
 friend 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.039
 watering the pebbles of the bath just at 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.449
 im so the solution seems to be to 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:29.379
 Rosemary Well because such a brane 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.379
 healing party for 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:38.329
 but in general, for the time being, all because 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:40.369
 all the same 10-15 minutes we need to 

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:42.499
 so I’ll stop cooking for now 

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:44.629
 so that you and the video was not too long 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:47.860
 and when we go the next stage 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.860
 then more .
