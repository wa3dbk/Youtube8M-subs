there<00:00:09.269> are<00:00:09.389> four<00:00:09.599> main<00:00:09.809> types<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:10.170> scope<00:00:10.469> shots

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
there are four main types of scope shots

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.070 
there are four main types of scope shots
that<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> lot<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> good<00:00:12.300> snipers<00:00:12.870> they

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
that a lot of the good snipers they

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.480 
that a lot of the good snipers they
don't<00:00:13.230> really<00:00:13.440> give<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> name<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> because

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
don't really give a name to because

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.730 
don't really give a name to because
they're<00:00:14.639> just<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:14.910> used<00:00:15.120> sniping<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.680> all

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
they're just so used sniping but for all

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.260 
they're just so used sniping but for all
intensive<00:00:16.980> purposes<00:00:17.130> because<00:00:17.789> they<00:00:18.119> don't

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
intensive purposes because they don't

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.920 
intensive purposes because they don't
have<00:00:18.330> names<00:00:18.529> we're<00:00:19.529> going<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> name<00:00:20.130> them<00:00:20.930> so

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
have names we're going to name them so

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.710 
have names we're going to name them so
the<00:00:22.109> very<00:00:22.439> first<00:00:22.609> scope<00:00:23.609> shot<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the very first scope shot that that

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.910 
the very first scope shot that that
we're<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> go<00:00:25.109> over<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.500> slide

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
we're going to go over is the slide

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.839 
we're going to go over is the slide
scope<00:00:26.660> because<00:00:27.680> it's<00:00:28.680> useful<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.460> couple

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
scope because it's useful for a couple

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.130 
scope because it's useful for a couple
of<00:00:29.939> reasons<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> first<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.109> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
of reasons and the first one is that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.290 
of reasons and the first one is that
it's<00:00:31.410> good<00:00:31.650> for<00:00:31.800> beginning<00:00:32.040> snipers<00:00:32.489> it's

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
it's good for beginning snipers it's

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.600 
it's good for beginning snipers it's
good<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.690> shooting<00:00:33.930> close<00:00:34.140> targets<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.950> it's

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
good at shooting close targets and it's

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.860 
good at shooting close targets and it's
also<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> shooting<00:00:36.210> still<00:00:36.510> targets

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
also going to shooting still targets

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.660 
also going to shooting still targets
which<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.410> you're<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> good<00:00:38.399> it's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
which is if you're not that good it's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.880 
which is if you're not that good it's
what<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.450> used<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.899> mainly<00:00:40.290> so

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
what it's going to be used for mainly so

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.170 
what it's going to be used for mainly so
to<00:00:41.070> perform<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.610> zoom<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.030> your

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
to perform it you zoom in with your

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.490 
to perform it you zoom in with your
scope<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.629> adjust<00:00:42.960> your<00:00:43.079> position<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
scope you adjust your position with the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.930 
scope you adjust your position with the
analog<00:00:43.800> stick<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> fire<00:00:44.579> when<00:00:44.820> you're

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
analog stick and you fire when you're

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.490 
analog stick and you fire when you're
ready<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.840> difficult<00:00:45.960> now<00:00:46.320> here's

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
ready it's not that difficult now here's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.920 
ready it's not that difficult now here's
some<00:00:46.620> examples<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.070> shot<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.370> Marzu<00:00:47.930> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
some examples that I shot with Marzu you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:01:06.820 
some examples that I shot with Marzu you
have<00:00:49.140> taken<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> lead<00:00:56.420> killing<00:00:57.420> spree

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:22.219 

massacre<00:01:12.020> headshot<00:01:20.630> okay<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> second<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.170> the

four<00:01:22.260> main<00:01:22.680> scoping<00:01:23.430> shots<00:01:23.670> we're<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:23.940> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
four main scoping shots we're going to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
four main scoping shots we're going to
talk<00:01:24.090> about<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> glidescope<00:01:25.050> now<00:01:26.010> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
talk about is the glidescope now the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.530 
talk about is the glidescope now the
glidescope<00:01:26.550> is<00:01:26.820> useful<00:01:27.120> for<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.270> number<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
glidescope is useful for a number of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.020 
glidescope is useful for a number of
things<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.870> well<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:29.130> better<00:01:29.760> used

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
things as well and it's better used

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.310 
things as well and it's better used
bandra<00:01:30.270> media<00:01:30.540> players<00:01:30.750> because<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.080> harder

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
bandra media players because it's harder

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.380 
bandra media players because it's harder
to<00:01:31.350> pull<00:01:31.560> off<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:32.430> good<00:01:32.610> against<00:01:33.090> far<00:01:33.240> away

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
to pull off it's good against far away

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.550 
to pull off it's good against far away
targets<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.900> its<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.140> good<00:01:34.350> against

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
targets and its really good against

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.800 
targets and its really good against
running<00:01:34.800> targets<00:01:35.220> behind<00:01:35.340> walls<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:36.450> perform

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
running targets behind walls to perform

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the glidescope you zoom in with your

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.249 
the glidescope you zoom in with your
scope<00:01:38.550> you<00:01:39.030> point<00:01:39.300> a<00:01:39.360> remote<00:01:39.690> off-screen<00:01:40.140> in

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
scope you point a remote off-screen in

the direction the target is running you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.420 
the direction the target is running you
adjust<00:01:42.390> how<00:01:42.930> far<00:01:43.259> off<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.470> wiimote<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.070> for

adjust how far off the wiimote is for
