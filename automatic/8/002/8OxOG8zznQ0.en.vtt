what's<00:00:49.290> in<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> image

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
what's in the image

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.670 
what's in the image
it's<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.659> allure<00:00:52.019> of<00:00:52.050> trains<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.909> power<00:00:54.680> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
it's the allure of trains the power the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.100 
it's the allure of trains the power the
majesty<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:57.570> size<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:59.250> sound<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.930> smell

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
majesty the size the sound the smell

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.219 
majesty the size the sound the smell
that<00:01:01.890> captivates<00:01:02.519> our<00:01:02.729> attention<00:01:03.300> it

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that captivates our attention it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.500 
that captivates our attention it
fascinated<00:01:05.070> our<00:01:05.190> fathers<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.700> mothers<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
fascinated our fathers and mothers and

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.040 
fascinated our fathers and mothers and
it<00:01:07.080> will<00:01:07.229> fascinate<00:01:07.770> our<00:01:07.950> sons<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> daughters

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
it will fascinate our sons and daughters

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.930 
it will fascinate our sons and daughters
maybe<00:01:10.050> it's<00:01:10.260> because<00:01:10.440> trains<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.370> from<00:01:11.640> coast

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
maybe it's because trains go from coast

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.740 
maybe it's because trains go from coast
to<00:01:12.060> coast<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> mountaintop<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.620> mountaintop

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
to coast and mountaintop to mountaintop

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.330 
to coast and mountaintop to mountaintop
maybe<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.960> because<00:01:16.140> trains<00:01:16.650> don't<00:01:17.070> stop

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
maybe it's because trains don't stop

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.870 
maybe it's because trains don't stop
running<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.600> cold<00:01:18.870> outside

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
running just because it's cold outside

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880 
running just because it's cold outside
trains<00:01:20.880> don't<00:01:21.180> bed<00:01:21.479> down<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.049> night<00:01:22.140> they

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
trains don't bed down for the night they

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.580 
trains don't bed down for the night they
fire<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.579> and<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.689> only<00:01:24.869> thing<00:01:25.140> that's<00:01:25.350> nearly

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
fire up and the only thing that's nearly

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.020 
fire up and the only thing that's nearly
as<00:01:25.770> interesting<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.549> trains<00:01:26.820> themselves

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
as interesting is the trains themselves

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.370 
as interesting is the trains themselves
are<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.200> people<00:01:28.649> who<00:01:28.890> work<00:01:29.100> them<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:30.450> eye<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
are the people who work them the eye the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.490 
are the people who work them the eye the
mind<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:32.399> camera<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.060> Ted<00:01:33.450> Benson<00:01:33.899> brings

mind and the camera of Ted Benson brings

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.230 
mind and the camera of Ted Benson brings
the<00:01:34.680> railroad<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.700> life<00:01:37.969> every<00:01:38.969> shots

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the railroad to life every shots

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.050 
the railroad to life every shots
different<00:01:42.409> sometimes<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.219> simple<00:01:44.640> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
different sometimes it's just a simple a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.660 
different sometimes it's just a simple a
simple<00:01:45.719> depiction<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.859> is<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.039> really

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
simple depiction of this is a really

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.459 
simple depiction of this is a really
pretty<00:01:48.119> place<00:01:48.359> the<00:01:48.689> lights<00:01:48.929> just<00:01:49.049> nice<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
pretty place the lights just nice and

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:50.690 
pretty place the lights just nice and
the<00:01:49.770> only<00:01:49.890> thing<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.219> would<00:01:50.310> make<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.579> better

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the only thing that would make it better

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.300 
the only thing that would make it better
is<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> train<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.450> by<00:01:51.719> and<00:01:52.020> hey<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.100> train
