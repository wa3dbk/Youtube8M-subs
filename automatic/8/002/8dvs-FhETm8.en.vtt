 [Music] 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.980
 renovations still in the elevator 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.869
 it is therefore the central theme 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.730
 quite a few exhibitors at the construction fair 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.350
 of belgium if you talk on the facade of 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.060
 Your home where innovating there are numerous 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.950
 solutions that are solutions that are 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.300
 energy efficient and sustainable 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.119
 what's most important is they too 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.340
 aesthetically pleasing 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.350
 the brick is still the favorite 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.420
 cladding of the belgian buildings 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.430
 and renovate 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.809
 [Music] 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.460
 the facade is actually the calling card 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.899
 for your home it is therefore not 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.609
 surprising that there are so many species 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.440
 brick on the market are those that 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.359
 actually architecture of your home 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.210
 determine what 's whole nowadays 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.750
 popular is the braised brick and 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.390
 also the narrow, long formats 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.300
 [Music] 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.340
 a lot of architectural stones the gray 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.870
 braised stones are hugely popular 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.460
 give a very robust 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.460
 warm appearance on the facade 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.930
 it's a very narrow brick here 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.150
 that is actually 30% smaller than one 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.100
 traditional brick and that is ideal 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.110
 if you need insulation value during renovation 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.460
 on helping increase your living space 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.460
 and actually with shrink 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.710
 if you are looking for a creative one 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.690
 solution 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.550
 that can cover your facade and roof here 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.170
 with the same tile tiles 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.539
 this gives you a uniform and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.759
 sleek character of your home 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.830
 if one so after an existing facade 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.899
 isolate what is becoming important now 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.770
 and in the future to make your home perfect 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.380
 isolate 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.840
 is this an ideal narrow solution and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.110
 moreover, it is also a very sustainable one 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.240
 and cheaper solution because there is 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.920
 Only one contractor needs the roofer 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.150
 can place both your pans and you 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.360
 cladding 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.520
 [Music] 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.770
 this is another pan and clay pan 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.530
 specially developed for the facade 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.689
 as you can see it is completely tight there 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.880
 so no scale effect what a whole 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.170
 minimalist exclusive appearance 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.640
 also has structural engineering on the facade 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.560
 is constantly moving towards innovation 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.540
 wanted with the result 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.180
 intelligent building concepts and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.560
 total solutions 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.720
 that's how a construction technique was developed 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.760
 which contains the ceramic stones 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.170
 much faster and more efficient 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.370
 can become a sustainable way 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.290
 erected 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.150
 the stones are cut from above and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.070
 from under what is horizontal can 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.060
 gluing and you only get one early 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.060
 thickness of a millimeter 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.570
 the stone is glued the other 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.489
 system if people get with them in and 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.500
 add a centimeter and now they talk 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.000
 about 1 to 2 mm 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.709
 this stone is also much a big sister 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.709
 it also goes great faster 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.870
 [Music] 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.010
 the whole system is not new what now 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.410
 the very large stones of are new 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.940
 500 mm 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.010
 and whatever is practical so 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.630
 be compatible with the existing stones 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.790
 with the small sizes 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.080
 then more difficult or more complex 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.060
 structures and has to bond 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.400
 specially provided with two handles 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.780
 and if one takes with one hand over the 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.069
 Always have another hand in him 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.630
 stable 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.340
 so also the flowering arm and the whole day 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.680
 stones goes places where it is live 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.000
 stream out the people ergonomics their backs 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.000
 certainly not taxed in their wrists
