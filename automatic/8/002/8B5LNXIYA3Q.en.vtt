redstone tutorial today I have for you
an<00:00:06.870> invention<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.980> made<00:00:08.450> which<00:00:09.450> like<00:00:10.019> everybody

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
an invention I made which like everybody

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.570 
an invention I made which like everybody
else<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.860> made<00:00:11.070> since<00:00:12.290> 1.5<00:00:13.290> has<00:00:13.740> had<00:00:13.950> snapshots

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
else is made since 1.5 has had snapshots

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.769 
else is made since 1.5 has had snapshots
is<00:00:14.910> an<00:00:15.330> automatic<00:00:15.960> farm<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:17.039> one<00:00:17.779> produces

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
is an automatic farm this one produces

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.120 
is an automatic farm this one produces
melons<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.410> pumpkins<00:00:19.859> it'll<00:00:20.220> work<00:00:20.369> with<00:00:20.580> both

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
melons and pumpkins it'll work with both

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.220 
melons and pumpkins it'll work with both
basically<00:00:23.130> whenever<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.580> melon<00:00:24.029> grows<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.990> to

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
basically whenever a melon grows on to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.390 
basically whenever a melon grows on to
the<00:00:25.350> start<00:00:25.619> block<00:00:25.859> here<00:00:26.279> or<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> pumpkin<00:00:27.539> a

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
the start block here or a pumpkin a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.720 
the start block here or a pumpkin a
signal<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.670> sent<00:00:29.699> through<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:31.610> creates<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
signal is sent through it creates a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.299 
signal is sent through it creates a
pulse<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.210> crush<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.899> also<00:00:34.290> retracts<00:00:35.130> that

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
pulse to crush it and also retracts that

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
pulse to crush it and also retracts that
piston<00:00:35.700> from<00:00:35.880> below<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.290> rid<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> this

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
piston from below it to get rid of this

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.420 
piston from below it to get rid of this
dirt<00:00:37.980> lets<00:00:38.760> water<00:00:39.059> push<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.410> items<00:00:40.770> into<00:00:41.100> this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
dirt lets water push the items into this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.850 
dirt lets water push the items into this
hopper<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.059> those<00:00:42.899> items<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.710> this

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
hopper and those items going to this

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.740 
hopper and those items going to this
chest<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.760> collect<00:00:45.000> there<00:00:45.590> now<00:00:47.750> there's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
chest and just collect there now there's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
chest and just collect there now there's
also<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.320> comparator<00:00:50.309> coming<00:00:50.820> away<00:00:51.239> from<00:00:51.480> this

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
also a comparator coming away from this

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.450 
also a comparator coming away from this
hopper<00:00:52.789> to<00:00:53.989> remove<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.260> redstone<00:00:55.980> block

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
hopper to remove this redstone block

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.459 
hopper to remove this redstone block
whenever<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.780> chest<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.350> full<00:00:58.699> and<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:01.260> will

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
whenever this chest is full and it will

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.049 
whenever this chest is full and it will
leave<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> melon<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.670> way<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
leave the melon there so that way it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.939 
leave the melon there so that way it
doesn't<00:01:03.239> crush<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.989> has<00:01:04.470> nowhere<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> go

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
doesn't crush it and has nowhere to go

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
doesn't crush it and has nowhere to go
there<00:01:05.610> was<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.060> little<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.600> room<00:01:06.750> in

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
there was to be a little bit of room in

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.580 
there was to be a little bit of room in
the<00:01:06.960> hopper<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:08.630> no<00:01:09.630> sense<00:01:09.930> letting<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.409> build

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the hopper but no sense letting it build

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.890 
the hopper but no sense letting it build
up<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.340> make<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.490> more<00:01:11.640> compact<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.600> had<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
up and to make it more compact I had to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.270 
up and to make it more compact I had to
make<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.229> where<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.710> still<00:01:13.890> room<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
make it where there was still room and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
make it where there was still room and
left<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> hopper<00:01:15.000> which<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.200> holds

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
left in the hopper which this holds

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
left in the hopper which this holds
quite<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> bit<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.729> you'll<00:01:18.240> need

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
quite a bit so it's not like you'll need

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.649 
quite a bit so it's not like you'll need
all<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:19.549> but<00:01:21.259> it<00:01:22.259> will<00:01:22.530> keep<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> from<00:01:23.659> going

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
all that but it will keep it from going

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.969 
all that but it will keep it from going
and<00:01:25.580> it<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.970> prevent<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.020> lot<00:01:28.229> more<00:01:28.409> lack<00:01:28.650> now

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and it will prevent a lot more lack now

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.770 
and it will prevent a lot more lack now
this<00:01:29.130> isn't<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.549> hundred<00:01:29.939> percent<00:01:30.090> efficient

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
this isn't a hundred percent efficient

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.999 
this isn't a hundred percent efficient
every<00:01:31.259> once<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> while<00:01:32.030> melons<00:01:33.030> will

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
every once in a while melons will

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.640 
every once in a while melons will
disperse<00:01:35.009> around<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:36.000> that's<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.140> simply

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
disperse around here that's just simply

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.630 
disperse around here that's just simply
because<00:01:37.860> you're<00:01:38.579> breaking<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.439> it's

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
because you're breaking it and it's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.859 
because you're breaking it and it's
items<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.060> completely<00:01:42.299> unpredictable

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
items are just completely unpredictable

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.060 
items are just completely unpredictable
but<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> most<00:01:44.220> part<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.270> almost

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
but for the most part it is almost

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.420 
but for the most part it is almost
almost<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.490> hundred<00:01:47.549> percent<00:01:47.729> efficient<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
almost one hundred percent efficient and

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.210 
almost one hundred percent efficient and
completely<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.939> hundred<00:01:50.970> percent<00:01:51.240> automatic

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
completely one hundred percent automatic

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.940 
completely one hundred percent automatic
so<00:01:53.220> let's<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> tutorial<00:01:54.799> for<00:01:55.799> this

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
so let's get to the tutorial for this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.740 
so let's get to the tutorial for this
tutorial<00:01:56.100> I'll<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.579> showing<00:01:56.759> each<00:01:57.180> step<00:01:57.509> layer

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
tutorial I'll be showing each step layer

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.810 
tutorial I'll be showing each step layer
by<00:01:57.990> layer<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.590> way<00:01:58.799> it'll<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.579> lot<00:01:59.759> easier

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
by layer that way it'll be a lot easier

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.300 
by layer that way it'll be a lot easier
to<00:02:00.270> understand<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.439> want<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> start<00:02:01.890> out<00:02:02.040> with

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
to understand you want to start out with

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.490 
to understand you want to start out with
an<00:02:02.490> area<00:02:02.960> for<00:02:03.960> blocks<00:02:04.380> by<00:02:04.920> five<00:02:05.280> blocks<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
an area for blocks by five blocks and

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.219 
an area for blocks by five blocks and
that<00:02:07.500> will<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.000> entire<00:02:09.330> area<00:02:09.360> this

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
that will be the entire area this

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.160 
that will be the entire area this
machine<00:02:10.649> will<00:02:10.860> fit<00:02:11.099> inside<00:02:11.250> of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
machine will fit inside of

machine will fit inside of
for<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.290> first<00:02:13.590> layer<00:02:13.890> you're<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.430> to

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
for this first layer you're going to

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.210 
for this first layer you're going to
want<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.670> start<00:02:14.970> out<00:02:15.120> with<00:02:15.329> a<00:02:15.390> block<00:02:15.840> here

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
want to start out with a block here

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.369 
want to start out with a block here
three<00:02:17.220> blocks<00:02:17.489> in<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.730> back<00:02:18.140> three<00:02:19.140> blocks
