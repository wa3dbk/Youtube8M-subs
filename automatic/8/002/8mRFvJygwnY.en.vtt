rake for example in some conditions

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.060 
rake for example in some conditions
rakes<00:01:17.509> can<00:01:17.720> actually<00:01:18.020> twist<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.470> swath<00:01:18.740> tighter

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
rakes can actually twist a swath tighter

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.800 
rakes can actually twist a swath tighter

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.109 

but<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:39.650> I've<00:01:39.770> got<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.009> swath<00:01:40.460> here<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:40.820> can<00:01:40.939> see

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
but so I've got a swath here you can see

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.880 
but so I've got a swath here you can see
it's<00:01:41.240> quite<00:01:41.390> hair<00:01:41.750> high<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.470> narrow<00:01:42.680> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
it's quite hair high and narrow and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.160 
it's quite hair high and narrow and
bunched<00:01:43.280> there's<00:01:43.970> bunches<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.570> clumps<00:01:44.930> in<00:01:45.020> it

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
bunched there's bunches and clumps in it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.950 
bunched there's bunches and clumps in it
here's<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.250> swath<00:01:46.579> that<00:01:46.880> we've<00:01:47.030> moved<00:01:47.270> over<00:01:47.750> the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
here's a swath that we've moved over the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.219 
here's a swath that we've moved over the
eight<00:01:48.830> feet<00:01:49.189> on<00:01:49.340> center<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.990> can<00:01:51.020> see

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
eight feet on center and you can see

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:51.999 
eight feet on center and you can see
that's<00:01:51.350> wasa

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
that's wasa

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.609 
that's wasa
little<00:01:52.759> better<00:01:52.970> distribute<00:01:53.539> it<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:53.810> not<00:01:54.350> so

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
little better distribute it and not so

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.789 
little better distribute it and not so
bunched<00:01:55.039> as<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.539> swath<00:01:56.539> over<00:01:57.020> on<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.409> side

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
bunched as the swath over on that side

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.950 
bunched as the swath over on that side
so<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.220> Recon<00:01:58.610> is<00:01:58.729> actually<00:01:59.119> smooth<00:01:59.450> out<00:01:59.750> this

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
so the Recon is actually smooth out this

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.899 
so the Recon is actually smooth out this
way<00:02:01.869> so<00:02:02.869> here<00:02:03.080> we've<00:02:03.229> got<00:02:03.460> swath<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.729> was

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
way so here we've got swath that was

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.729 
way so here we've got swath that was
moved<00:02:05.149> over<00:02:06.100> clearly<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.369> completely<00:02:07.729> ground

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
moved over clearly and completely ground

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.180 
moved over clearly and completely ground
we've<00:02:09.739> got<00:02:09.950> ground<00:02:10.459> here<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:12.190> somewhat

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
we've got ground here that is somewhat

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.150 
we've got ground here that is somewhat
more<00:02:13.489> moist<00:02:13.910> then<00:02:14.840> ground<00:02:15.200> dug<00:02:15.500> up<00:02:15.680> over<00:02:16.010> to

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
more moist then ground dug up over to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.620 
more moist then ground dug up over to
the<00:02:16.280> side<00:02:16.519> where<00:02:16.549> it<00:02:16.910> was<00:02:17.030> laying<00:02:17.209> out<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.600> the

Sun<00:02:17.959> on<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.860> right<00:02:19.130> we've<00:02:19.370> got<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.700> moist

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
Sun on the right we've got the moist

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.960 
Sun on the right we've got the moist
dirt<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.540> we<00:02:20.660> just<00:02:20.900> threw<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.790> material<00:02:22.790> off

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
of and then in the day you see how this

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.110 
of and then in the day you see how this
is<00:02:26.120> lighter<00:02:27.049> colored<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.620> powder<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:28.819> stuff

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
is lighter colored and powder this stuff

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.570 
is lighter colored and powder this stuff
here<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.480> can<00:02:29.690> still<00:02:30.010> under<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.130> swath<00:02:31.370> you

here you can still under the swath you

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.970 
here you can still under the swath you

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
through it a bit more again I guess this

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.480 
through it a bit more again I guess this
material<00:03:36.640> was<00:03:37.530> higher<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.160> can<00:03:39.340> see

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490

these stems are shortened but by and

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.420 
these stems are shortened but by and
large<00:03:45.730> not<00:03:46.570> many<00:03:46.840> short<00:03:47.170> pieces<00:03:47.470> recons<00:03:48.130> don't

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
large not many short pieces recons don't

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.180 
large not many short pieces recons don't
shorten<00:03:48.850> stems<00:03:49.270> they<00:03:50.050> simply<00:03:50.590> conditioned

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
stems and this stem here you can see

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.580 
stems and this stem here you can see
it's<00:03:53.950> split<00:03:54.600> it's<00:03:55.600> not<00:03:55.840> sitting<00:03:56.170> split

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
it's split it's not sitting split

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.680 
it's split it's not sitting split
because<00:03:56.740> it's<00:03:57.130> wrapped<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.610> these<00:03:57.760> leaves<00:03:58.030> and

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
because it's wrapped in these leaves and

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.630 
because it's wrapped in these leaves and
doesn't<00:03:59.470> split<00:03:59.710> but<00:03:59.920> there's<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.340> splits

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
doesn't split but there's the splits

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.450 
doesn't split but there's the splits
again<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.390> still<00:04:02.320> it<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.680> whole<00:04:02.860> stem<00:04:03.250> is

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
again and still it the whole stem is

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.020 
again and still it the whole stem is
split<00:04:03.760> inside<00:04:04.210> of<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.660> leaf<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.640> and

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
split inside of that leaf and so on and

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.910 
split inside of that leaf and so on and
so<00:04:07.330> on<00:04:07.360> here's<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.990> node<00:04:08.260> we'll<00:04:08.500> take<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.680> good

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
so on here's a node we'll take a good

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.090 
so on here's a node we'll take a good
close-up<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:09.490> this<00:04:09.610> node<00:04:10.440> about<00:04:11.440> one<00:04:11.680> or<00:04:11.830> out

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
of two nodes is smashed you see how this

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.600 
of two nodes is smashed you see how this
node<00:04:14.290> is<00:04:14.470> just<00:04:14.680> smashed<00:04:14.980> there's<00:04:15.280> no<00:04:15.430> moisture

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610

node is just smashed there's no moisture
left<00:04:16.120> there<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:17.200> see<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.590> it's<00:04:17.920> just<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.370> boat

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
left there you see it it's just a boat

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.270 
left there you see it it's just a boat
broken<00:04:19.000> off<00:04:19.239> but<00:04:19.480> again<00:04:19.720> in<00:04:20.230> one<00:04:20.530> piece<00:04:20.860> easy
