00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it and pretty much all of the characters

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.789 
it and pretty much all of the characters
in<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> BRS<00:01:42.180> universe<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.840> decided<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.680> this

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
in the BRS universe I decided to do this

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.319 
in the BRS universe I decided to do this
one<00:01:43.979> first<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.579> only<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.030> love<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
one first not only because I love the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.960 
one first not only because I love the
sci-fi<00:01:45.770> cyborg<00:01:46.770> e-type<00:01:47.100> take<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:47.850> also

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
sci-fi cyborg e-type take on it but also

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.789 
sci-fi cyborg e-type take on it but also
because<00:01:48.270> she<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> first<00:01:48.869> VRS<00:01:49.380> figma<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
because she was the first VRS figma that

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.090 
because she was the first VRS figma that
I<00:01:49.860> bought<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.909> let's<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.540> closer<00:01:51.810> look<00:01:52.100> her

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
I bought so let's have a closer look her

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.340 
I bought so let's have a closer look her
pigtails<00:01:53.399> are<00:01:53.909> bloody<00:01:54.270> massive<00:01:54.899> which<00:01:55.170> is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
pigtails are bloody massive which is

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.170 
pigtails are bloody massive which is
awesome<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.130> love<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> way<00:01:56.579> they're<00:01:56.729> sculpted

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
awesome I love the way they're sculpted

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.219 
awesome I love the way they're sculpted
it<00:01:57.270> makes<00:01:57.420> them<00:01:57.540> look<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:57.869> something's

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it makes them look as if something's

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.690 
it makes them look as if something's
going<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.619> even<00:01:59.189> when<00:01:59.280> they're<00:01:59.490> posed

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
going on even when they're posed

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.039 
going on even when they're posed
neutrally<00:02:00.240> they<00:02:00.360> were<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.600> spikes

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
neutrally they were just spikes

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.230 
neutrally they were just spikes
everywhere<00:02:01.549> they're<00:02:02.549> being<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.850> joints<00:02:03.149> is

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
everywhere they're being on joints is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.880 
everywhere they're being on joints is
awesome<00:02:03.570> too<00:02:03.719> because<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.110> allows<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.500> crazy

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
awesome too because it allows for crazy

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.760 
awesome too because it allows for crazy
poses<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.700> made<00:02:05.880> even<00:02:06.659> crazier<00:02:07.200> because

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
poses to be made even crazier because

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.230 
poses to be made even crazier because
she's<00:02:08.160> worth<00:02:08.369> it

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
she's worth it

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.960 
she's worth it
the<00:02:10.050> most<00:02:10.290> iconic<00:02:10.500> thing<00:02:11.100> about<00:02:11.280> VRS<00:02:11.760> is

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the most iconic thing about VRS is

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.660 
the most iconic thing about VRS is
without<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> day<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> put<00:02:13.050> ie<00:02:13.290> being<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.860> fire<00:02:14.280> I

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
without a day to put ie being on fire I

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.130 
without a day to put ie being on fire I
was<00:02:15.150> going<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.360> say<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.870> choose

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
was going to say that you can choose

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.690 
was going to say that you can choose
whether<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.650> want<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.980> have<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.250> fire<00:02:17.460> there

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
whether you want to have the fire there

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.400 
whether you want to have the fire there
or<00:02:17.850> not<00:02:18.060> with<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.420> two<00:02:18.570> different<00:02:18.990> fringes

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
or not with the two different fringes

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.020 
or not with the two different fringes
but<00:02:19.920> there<00:02:20.070> really<00:02:20.160> isn't<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.490> choice<00:02:20.700> is

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
but there really isn't the choice is

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.200 
but there really isn't the choice is
there<00:02:21.330> fire<00:02:21.690> all<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.350> way<00:02:22.500> also<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:24.090> get

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
there fire all the way also you get

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.690 
there fire all the way also you get
angry<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.720> take<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.050> away<00:02:25.140> from<00:02:25.290> her<00:02:25.560> she's<00:02:26.550> got

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
angry to take it away from her she's got

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.370 
angry to take it away from her she's got
some<00:02:26.850> great<00:02:27.090> detail<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.750> middle<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.200> I
