00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 good morning evenings or youtube night 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.640
 well today I'm going to teach 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.040
 as they did the minecraft beta 1.7 point 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.080
 3 which is the latest version of minecraft 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.550
 until the good time let's go to the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.679
 link of the fly that I will leave in the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.549
 description of the video once we enter 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.020
 we are going to have to wait 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.020
 approximately 5 seconds 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.820
 after the 5 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.860
 we are going to give you seconds to jump 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.539
 advertising and let's hope that we 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.449
 take to the mediafire page 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.900
 Here the action will appear and we will 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.900
 let's give 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.540
 this I close it since it is publicity 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.500
 good as you see, I'm going to cancel it 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.500
 because I already have it 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.239
 they are going to go where they downloaded it is going to 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.010
 appear something similar to this we are going to 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.679
 give right click extract the main folder 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.239
 1.7 point 3 once we have extracted it 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.699
 we will see a folder similar to 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.260
 this one with these files and folders in the 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.000
 minecraft point folder we are going to give 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.579
 right click and then we will give 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.729
 copy then we're going to start 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.769
 execute and we're going to put app percentage 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.899
 percentage data but agreement that also 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.090
 can use the home key more 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.890
 already to clear them to unfold the option 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.840
 run 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.030
 in windows 7 you just need to give 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.050
 click on start and write the command 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.760
 percentage high percentage good we have 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.590
 done that as we already have the folder 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.320
 copied let's go here and we're going to click 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.540
 right paste 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.130
 and we will give yes to everything 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.450
 to start replacing all 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.450
 the files and add the new ones 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.600
 as the teacher is very fast then 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.610
 we are going to give you minecraft and then 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.030
 I would be all ready 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.090
 to have things by default because it's 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.880
 the folder that the user had the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.170
 went up as minecraft come to appear 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.990
 1.7 point 3 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.930
 and so I'm going to show you a bit of what 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.180
 The way you see it is changing with so much 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.220
 design when downloading and some 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.610
 things plus some details and some bushes 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.800
 aggregate 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.600
 it may seem a bit slow 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.820
 compared to the minecraft they had 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.250
 previously because if it already includes 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.190
 some basic mods and some notes 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.610
 basic but very popular example the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.280
 tumen teams the model 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.890
 jump the mold pokemon 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.940

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.110

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.110
