smaller diameter than the top that part
goes<00:00:38.480> on<00:00:38.780> like<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.270> then<00:00:41.270> your<00:00:42.520> your<00:00:43.520> bronze

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
goes on like so then your your bronze

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.180 
goes on like so then your your bronze
thrust<00:00:44.600> plate<00:00:46.270> has<00:00:47.270> a<00:00:47.300> tab<00:00:47.809> here<00:00:48.500> that<00:00:48.739> lines

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
thrust plate has a tab here that lines

thrust plate has a tab here that lines
up<00:00:49.460> with<00:00:49.520> your<00:00:49.820> pin<00:00:50.150> that<00:00:50.420> you've<00:00:50.570> already

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
up with your pin that you've already

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.820 
up with your pin that you've already
made<00:00:51.050> sure<00:00:51.320> is<00:00:52.360> raised<00:00:53.360> up<00:00:53.660> not<00:00:54.020> worn<00:00:54.379> flush

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
made sure is raised up not worn flush

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.780

that<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:56.510> rust<00:00:56.660> plate<00:00:56.930> goes<00:00:57.200> in<00:00:57.440> there<00:00:57.790> then

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
that the rust plate goes in there then

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.330 
that the rust plate goes in there then
your<00:00:59.030> steering<00:00:59.480> arm<00:00:59.750> goes<00:01:00.680> on

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
your steering arm goes on

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.400 
your steering arm goes on
I<00:01:01.510> would<00:01:03.009> lubricate<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:05.509> inside<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.229> this

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
I would lubricate the inside of this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.649 
I would lubricate the inside of this
