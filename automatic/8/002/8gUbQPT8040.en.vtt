00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
put over long-sleeve I suggested more

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.450 
put over long-sleeve I suggested more
fitted<00:00:37.170> long-sleeved<00:00:37.710> top<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.309> is

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
fitted long-sleeved top but this is

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.100 
fitted long-sleeved top but this is
really<00:00:38.820> great<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> wrap<00:00:39.750> or<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
really great it's like a wrap or the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.860 
really great it's like a wrap or the
belt<00:00:40.320> requires<00:00:41.219> no<00:00:41.460> band's<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.329> mini

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
belt requires no band's just a mini

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.119 
belt requires no band's just a mini
hypnotised<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> belt<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:46.500> way<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
hypnotised and the belt so the way in

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.590 
hypnotised and the belt so the way in
which<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> easiest<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
which I think it's the easiest to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.209 
which I think it's the easiest to
explain<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.230> actually<00:00:49.590> start<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.010> your

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
explain this to actually start with your

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.119 
explain this to actually start with your
tool<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> inside<00:00:51.390> out<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.739> going

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
tool on the inside out and you're going

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.139 
tool on the inside out and you're going
to<00:00:53.210> literally<00:00:54.320> drape<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.730> completely<00:00:56.730> over

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
to literally drape it completely over

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.889 
to literally drape it completely over
one<00:00:57.420> shoulder<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.340> so<00:00:59.340> your<00:00:59.520> one<00:01:00.480> arm<00:01:00.690> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
one shoulder and so your one arm is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
one shoulder and so your one arm is
hanging<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.559> that's<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
hanging out and that's actually the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.850 
hanging out and that's actually the
place<00:01:03.300> where<00:01:04.080> you're<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> want<00:01:04.650> your

of the fabric the edge the bottom edge
of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.220> tube<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:18.200> uncovering<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.470> arm

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
of the tube that's uncovering the arm

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.700 
of the tube that's uncovering the arm
you're<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.880> lift<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.320> starts

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
you're going to lift it up so it starts

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.550 
you're going to lift it up so it starts
to<00:01:22.860> create<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.460> see<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:24.119> cross<00:01:24.900> over

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
to create you see that little cross over

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.499 
to create you see that little cross over
there<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.310> bring<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.610> edge<00:01:27.150> up

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
there you're going to bring that edge up

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.490 
there you're going to bring that edge up
over<00:01:27.960> your<00:01:28.170> opposite<00:01:28.710> shoulder<00:01:29.840> like<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.170> so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
over your opposite shoulder like this so

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410 
over your opposite shoulder like this so
now<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:32.189> really<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:32.820> wrap<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.299> it's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
now it's really like your wrap but it's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.710 
now it's really like your wrap but it's
going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.810> criss<00:01:34.079> cross<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.619> back<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.720> what

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
going to criss cross it back and what

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.990 
going to criss cross it back and what
you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.409> grab<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.770> belt<00:01:38.220> any<00:01:38.549> type<00:01:38.850> of

a<00:01:39.119> belt<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:41.210> thread<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.450> through<00:01:43.399> like

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
a belt and just thread it through like

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.960 
a belt and just thread it through like
this<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.829> then<00:01:46.829> whether<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.430> buckle<00:01:47.820> your

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
this and then whether you buckle your

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.880 
this and then whether you buckle your
belt<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.570> tie<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:48.990> belt<00:01:49.170> whatever<00:01:49.680> you

belt or you tie your belt whatever you
do<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.490> then<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.570> creates<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.200> great<00:01:52.649> nice

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
do and then it creates this great nice

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.959 
do and then it creates this great nice
almost<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.750> gravy<00:01:55.110> top<00:01:55.560> look<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.820> has

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
almost like a gravy top look and it has

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:57.649 
almost like a gravy top look and it has
a<00:01:57.000> sleeve

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
a sleeve

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.950 
a sleeve
so<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.380> crisscross<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> back<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
so it's crisscross to the back and the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.440 
so it's crisscross to the back and the
reason<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.560> started<00:02:01.829> inside<00:02:02.340> out<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.939> because

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
reason we started inside out is because

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.290 
reason we started inside out is because
when<00:02:03.840> you're<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.140> to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
when you're going to

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.940 
when you're going to
bring<00:02:04.420> this<00:02:04.630> back<00:02:04.930> up<00:02:05.350> you're<00:02:05.470> not<00:02:05.680> going<00:02:05.860> to

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
bring this back up you're not going to

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.090 
bring this back up you're not going to
expose<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.490> tab<00:02:06.760> so<00:02:07.690> or<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.260> seam<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.070> that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
expose the tab so or the seam so that

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.950 
expose the tab so or the seam so that
seems<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.550> be<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.790> best<00:02:09.940> way<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.690> then<00:02:10.840> you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
seems to be the best way and then you

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.160 
seems to be the best way and then you
can<00:02:11.140> just<00:02:11.320> have<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.590> like<00:02:11.740> this<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.810> it's<00:02:13.810> kind

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
can just have it like this and it's kind

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.210 
can just have it like this and it's kind
of<00:02:14.260> great<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.500> mean<00:02:14.590> there's<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.950> lot<00:02:15.100> of

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
of great I mean there's a lot of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.770 
of great I mean there's a lot of
different<00:02:15.460> ways<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.580> get<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.240> this<00:02:16.420> but<00:02:16.720> I
