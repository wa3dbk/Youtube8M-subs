00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.299
 We prefer big supporters 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.069
 the equality because of how may 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.469
 eg every two months sometimes a game 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.120
 play and then I bring once 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.190
 in half a year so the editorial times gone 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.859
 that is no problem at all and the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.960
 Ghost a guy has maier รถ 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.140
 of course there is still missing the female 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.150
 score then it is on me this pure 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.220
 to open the sharpest cuts and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.240
 it's hard, it's very heavy 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.240
 the nominated ones please 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.820
 evelin grandprix as the first female 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.800
 main character in the assassin's creed 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.570
 Of course , Evelin deserves a lot 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.030
 special attention 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.470
 half french half slaves girls but 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.870
 in the best circles of society 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.330
 she grew up between her parents 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.270
 role as rich lady serfs and 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.790
 evening offender and he dangerous as theirs 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:00.570
 male colleagues but twice as sexy 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.949
 so commander shepard makes some fun 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.390
 logically, commander shepard 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.800
 also usually the female 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.710
 main characters are not missing finally 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.170
 the feminine variant embodies the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.030
 same person as the male version 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.580
 of course, they are the same for them 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.950
 characteristics also woman shepherd is 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.680
 also the hardest leader of the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.340
 toughest guys in the universe so to speak 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:30.220
 angela merkel of space only 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:32.860
 somehow different yes also jill valentine 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.110
 follows the common video game trend 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.960
 towards the latex butt in front of the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.179
 camera but that alone is not the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.700
 reason why we have nominated them the 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.310
 Government agent and former elite 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.369
 Police officer has been an icon for 18 years 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.590
 for horrorfans and if you like the zombie 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.259
 and monster have been so outrageously sexy 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.070
 as in resident evil revelations 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:03.040
 We are even better off 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:05.229
 do not mind july and another one 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.360
 zombie hunter, however, wants to come 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.429
 valentine opposite juliet starling 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.620
 lollipop chainsaw just too stuffy 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.600
 no wonder after all is the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.579
 sweet cheerleader with the big one 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.380
 chainsaw the protagonist in one 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:21.730
 game of cult developer suda 51 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.650
 you can generally get up there 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.519
 crazy design and crazy 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.980
 happy ideas 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.110
 in this case that means undead with 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.480
 Beat the pompons and the sawed off 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.670
 head of the friend on the belt wear quasi 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.140
 the zombie schoolgirl report too 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.209
 play lightning defensive amazon 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.130
 with exaggerated nippon sex appeal 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.020
 belong to final fantasy vii the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.700
 curry powder on the platform 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.890
 The list is correspondingly long 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.860
 female protagonist in square enix 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.950
 roleplaying epic yet lightning out of the 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.940
 13 part and the update 13 2 stands out 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.490
 the mass 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.840
 whether male or female none of them 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.910
 Heroes colleagues can do it with her 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.920
 when it comes to willpower or 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.200
 easy to kick in the butt goes 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.360
 on the other hand, it is already more typical for series production 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.890
 her appearance as a slender 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.600
 anime fighting machine 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:17.140
 but who wants to be pictured with such 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.820
 already difficult to make difficult 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.380
 difficult to be honest as on 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.540
 ordinary is ultimately crucial 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.790
 I 've got all of them I 've got 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.830
 all of you only then is the pokemon motto 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.150
 for a sense of life 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.520
 I can handle this bad thing 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.080
 figurines what we the rebels participate yes me 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.430
 also remember time on time 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.590
 jill valentine as simple as a 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.140
 polygonal club was the too 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.910
 playstation 1 times so let's say 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.360
 you have to think that very well what 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.040
 one has also seen its advantages 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.660
 who at that time do me on the place 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.400
 is as well brought I believe there 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.720
 many gamers are very enthusiastic 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.130
 even if it is from today's perspective long ago 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.190
 just my god rain bit ugly 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.930
 a robot is because the new lara the 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.660
 next year is not this year 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.470
 is nominated because not released yet 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.060
 is guaranteed nominated but of course 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.880
 So I think that's a bit 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.320
 blind nomination is the winner 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.750
 By the way, next year we have 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.450
 now already determined no it 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.950
 Of course, it's pretty enjoyable anyway 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.380
 that this indeed say so many 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.910
 Female characters make their appearance 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.160
 there was a time there was 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.370
 no video game at all worldwide 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.900
 lie and then the games became the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.120
 had a female character immediately 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.120
 somehow as a girl then plays 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.440
 I declare somehow so far 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.240
 very glad that we are now too 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.530
 top-class titles have to be right 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.200
 cool characters so in juliet starling 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.480
 even if the game is now somehow 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.400
 not easy to play the best 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.810
 A solid cost has just one 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.090
 really horny character you 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.890
 Of course, you want to keep watching this 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.630
 I already fit over wonderfully 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.310
 just exaggerates just like you do 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.870
 It desires gorgeous whole course expiration 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.310
 tip duel if you have the choice 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.020
 rather male or female figures 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.250
 indeed male because yes me 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.849
 as a woman of course I prefer a man 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:05.330
 looks at that is so how it came so the 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.860
 Their men think it is great but there are 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.330
 I always have the feeling the people the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.800
 I prefer to play men I can say 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.270
 rather identify with man if 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.620
 You say woman then he says exactly what 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.690
 you just said i prefer to watch 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.319
 30 hours in the woman on the butt 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.819
 as a man 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.690
 that is very funny and that is 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.639
 always that the two standard 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.720
 Reason that you have in the mass effect 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.699
 for example, later is now like that 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.870
 excited about the category as well 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.280
 just my sharpened cuts each 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.289
 commander shepard in it 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.789
 I have the male I 'm sorry 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:32.199
 it just does not suit me 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.669
 does anyone save the universe, so to speak 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:38.389
 my wife just saw me up 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.949
 the head and became 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.020
 no i know i am actually him 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.900
 because of this identification believe 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.940
 I come that he really choose 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.400
 you can but I have nothing against 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.319
 jukic set out now I think come 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.969
 quite a few of them currently limited that 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.590
 last praise because we have one for you 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:58.460
 not shown yet and that is here 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.009
 constructed which is a front of the tomahawk 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.060
 It's not really metal now 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.949
 Of course , first of all I am missing 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.680
 can also short times to fold the box 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.560
 we also have the logo or nice 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.280
 burnt on this wooden box and 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.020
 nevertheless very high quality processed 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.669
 but probably just with it 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.800
 not and the weapons law must fall 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.810
 we also raffle it out of plastic 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.599
