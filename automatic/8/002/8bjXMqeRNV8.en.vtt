 hello personal commerce and flÃ¡vio responds 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.080
 your place to ask questions on the internet 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.060
 I'm Lucas now I'm here with 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.680
 leonardo was submergiu carlos silva 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.390
 the production and edition of this 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.910
 video we will answer questions 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.010
 lucas fraga de oliveira he wants to know 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.680
 why the amoled screens suffer the effect 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.780
 Berlin and how much the display to the screens 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.160
 with quantum dots suffer from this same 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.469
 problem 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.809
 So is longevity the problem pro 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.699
 boy said yes a problem about 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.190
 other materials does not mean that 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.179
 to launch a cell phone in a year's time 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.909
 an employee 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:47.370
 calm is not that serious but it's a 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.339
 thing that happens because it is led like 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.359
 it is a diode that emits light when 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:57.329
 passes voltage on it is a tremendous throne 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.159
 and I felt that in the case of a decent home 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.429
 materials made by the 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.620
 nature of them does not age faster 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.990
 As you go through it 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.380
 the current has existence of the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.420
 energy and is picking up is quantum point 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.450
 does not suffer the same issue that is a 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.490
 very different thing although although it is 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.820
 have similar results 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.189
 led to be flexible capital is the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.030
 Its essential structure is quite different. 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.820
 it is based on size crystals in 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.960
 copco is very small and these 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.140
 crystals not so has neither 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.579
 because they followed degrading yes 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.619
 and if you want more details about the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.030
 the screens of 11 points quantum a 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.670
 people already talked about them 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.960
 there on the video on the screen the lg g 4 is the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.829
 the first smartphone to use this 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.409
 technology 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.020
 there is one thing that also comes maybe if 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.420
 interest in killing that is the oleds they 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.090
 each of them has a specific color of the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.939
 different material and colors age 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.609
 different times dying blue 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.100
 then the act the blue pixels will die 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.869
 before on the meshed screens and on the screens 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.660
 with 11 quantum points this does not 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.490
 this happens in a certain and another thing 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.040
 which is interesting to note is also that 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.730
 such longevity of your TVs product with 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.440
 amoled screens are not so interesting 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.150
 precisely because of this problem yes yes 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.459
 so the tvs that are leaving now 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.290
 currently with quantum dots 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.580
 it is more suitable for you than 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.909
 wants to stay with your athletic 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.769
 new TV for 157 years do not know is 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.720
 which is the most common and keep is something more 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.560
 with a tv a tokyo exchange cycle 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.450
 much longer than you see in a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.489
 smartphone but anyway the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.019
 smartphones have many pixels to carry 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.849
 they ended up seeing both 5 and if they go 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.340
 end up dying over time that is 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.319
 unavoidable but since it has so many pixels and 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.540
 will not notice so much in general 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.549
 maybe taking care here for a long time 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.859
 if you notice that it is the maximum brightness of it goes 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.480
 decreasing but signed note 5 for 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.950
 example a word will not appear 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.829
 But it does not mean that it goes 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.810
 happen but it's the general good of the screen goes 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.250
 end up decreasing over time yes no 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.790
 will happen as it happened on the screen 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.280
 nintendo ds there and it's all had a way 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.410
 a red dot on your screen sometimes 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.430
 well, right? 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.829
 so I hope we have 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.030
 answered your question lucas and even 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.030
 next staff and more
