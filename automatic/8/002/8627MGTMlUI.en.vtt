00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.720 

so<00:00:30.650> we're<00:00:30.769> gonna<00:00:30.890> talk<00:00:31.189> about<00:00:31.250> energy

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
so we're gonna talk about energy

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.310 
so we're gonna talk about energy
medicine<00:00:32.450> for<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.170> eyes<00:00:35.320> energetically

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
medicine for the eyes energetically

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.069 
medicine for the eyes energetically
every<00:00:37.280> Meridian<00:00:37.730> in<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.940> body<00:00:38.180> actually<00:00:38.540> goes

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
every Meridian in the body actually goes

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.830 
every Meridian in the body actually goes
through<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.470> eyes<00:00:39.829> in<00:00:40.430> some<00:00:40.940> way<00:00:41.120> directly<00:00:41.690> or

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
through the eyes in some way directly or

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.930 
through the eyes in some way directly or
indirectly<00:00:42.140> but<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.129> ones<00:00:43.340> we<00:00:43.520> work<00:00:43.760> with

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
indirectly but the ones we work with

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.700 
indirectly but the ones we work with
with<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.300> most<00:00:44.540> that<00:00:44.750> have<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.050> most<00:00:45.199> direct

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
with the most that have the most direct

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.819 
with the most that have the most direct
influence<00:00:46.400> are<00:00:47.530> liver<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:49.550> kidney<00:00:50.449> and

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
influence are liver and kidney and

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.130 
influence are liver and kidney and
stomach<00:00:53.260> liver<00:00:54.260> kidney<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.190> stomach<00:00:56.140> let's

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
stomach liver kidney and stomach let's

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.329 
stomach liver kidney and stomach let's
see<00:00:57.290> what<00:00:57.440> else<00:00:57.589> we<00:00:57.739> can<00:00:57.890> do<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.190> would<00:00:58.309> be

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
see what else we can do that would be

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.100 
see what else we can do that would be
great<00:00:58.610> for<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.879> eyes<00:00:59.000> so<00:00:59.329> you<00:00:59.720> see<00:00:59.930> when

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
great for the eyes so you see when

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.450 
great for the eyes so you see when
you're<00:01:00.230> doing<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:00.500> daily<00:01:00.800> energy<00:01:00.890> routine<00:01:01.430> a

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
you're doing the daily energy routine a

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.150 
you're doing the daily energy routine a
lot<00:01:01.789> of<00:01:01.910> things<00:01:02.090> you're<00:01:02.270> doing<00:01:02.480> are<00:01:03.160> also

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
lot of things you're doing are also

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.680 
lot of things you're doing are also
going<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.339> be<00:01:04.489> helpful<00:01:04.729> for<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.089> eyes<00:01:05.210> in

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
going to be helpful for the eyes in

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.139 
going to be helpful for the eyes in
addition<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:06.170> other<00:01:06.320> energy<00:01:06.649> systems<00:01:07.190> so

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
addition to other energy systems so

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.350 
addition to other energy systems so
palming<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.869> eyes<00:01:09.550> it's<00:01:10.550> best<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.940> do<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.240> with

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
palming the eyes it's best to do it with

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.050 
palming the eyes it's best to do it with
no<00:01:11.390> glasses<00:01:11.840> on<00:01:12.289> obviously<00:01:12.880> bring<00:01:13.880> some

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
no glasses on obviously bring some

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.800 
no glasses on obviously bring some
energy<00:01:14.210> into<00:01:14.479> your<00:01:14.630> hands<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:19.539> just<00:01:20.539> take<00:01:20.690> the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
energy into your hands and just take the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.779 
energy into your hands and just take the
palm<00:01:21.080> of<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.410> hand<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.039> it's<00:01:22.220> covering<00:01:22.640> the

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
palm of the hand so it's covering the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.630 
palm of the hand so it's covering the
eye<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.990> base<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.500> palm<00:01:24.710> is<00:01:25.130> right<00:01:25.490> on

eye and the base of the palm is right on
the<00:01:25.759> cheekbone<00:01:26.390> there<00:01:26.630> I<00:01:26.979> like<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.130> cross<00:01:28.340> my

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
the cheekbone there I like to cross my

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.889 
the cheekbone there I like to cross my
little<00:01:28.789> fingers<00:01:29.149> there<00:01:29.390> at<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.720> liver

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899

neurovascular at the hairline and I put

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.690 
neurovascular at the hairline and I put
my<00:01:32.119> thumb's<00:01:32.450> in<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.990> triple<00:01:33.380> warmer<00:01:33.700> temple

oh<00:01:37.930> yeah<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.020> focus<00:01:39.409> on<00:01:39.530> your<00:01:39.619> breathing

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.550 

source<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.670> calm<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.210> relax<00:01:56.600> how's<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.110> feel

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.690 

now<00:02:00.560> another<00:02:00.800> thing<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.190> is<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.430> might<00:02:01.580> not

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
now another thing is is you might not

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.400 
now another thing is is you might not
actually<00:02:01.729> have<00:02:02.060> anything<00:02:02.509> going<00:02:02.990> on<00:02:03.080> with<00:02:03.290> the

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
actually have anything going on with the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.340 
actually have anything going on with the
eyes<00:02:03.640> but<00:02:04.640> you're<00:02:04.820> on<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.000> computer<00:02:05.509> you<00:02:06.229> know

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
eyes but you're on the computer you know

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.740 
eyes but you're on the computer you know
several<00:02:06.890> hours<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.159> day<00:02:07.280> or<00:02:07.940> you're<00:02:08.240> reading

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
several hours a day or you're reading

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.870 
several hours a day or you're reading
several<00:02:09.080> hours<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> day<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.520> it's<00:02:10.640> really

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
several hours a day so it's really

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.820 
several hours a day so it's really
important<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.390> take<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.660> little<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:12.140> break<00:02:12.530> if

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
important to take a little I break if

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.740 
important to take a little I break if
you're<00:02:13.310> doing<00:02:13.580> those<00:02:13.760> two<00:02:14.000> activities<00:02:14.540> for

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
you're doing those two activities for

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.960 
you're doing those two activities for
extended<00:02:15.140> periods<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.470> time<00:02:15.560> take<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.520> little<00:02:16.760> I

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
extended periods of time take a little I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.970 
extended periods of time take a little I
break<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.690> go<00:02:18.140> through<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.530> do<00:02:18.620> some<00:02:18.890> of

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
break and go through and do some of

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.100 
break and go through and do some of
these<00:02:19.100> exercises<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:20.150> get<00:02:20.300> energy<00:02:20.510> juicing

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
these exercises to get energy juicing

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:29.520 
these exercises to get energy juicing
back<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> eyes

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.590 

you
