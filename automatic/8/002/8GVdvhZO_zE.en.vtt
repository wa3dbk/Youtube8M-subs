00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
originally planned to make it like

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
originally planned to make it like
angelic<00:01:00.600> buster<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.980> made<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.489> male

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
angelic buster if they made a male

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.969 
angelic buster if they made a male
version<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.899> would<00:01:04.229> stick<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:04.470> female

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
version of it I would stick with female

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.120 
version of it I would stick with female
because<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:06.119> meant<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.750> female<00:01:07.130> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
because it was meant to be female so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.460 
because it was meant to be female so
that's<00:01:08.490> why<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> made<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> female<00:01:09.470> anyways

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that's why I made it a female anyways

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.609 
that's why I made it a female anyways
