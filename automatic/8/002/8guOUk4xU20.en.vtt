get<00:04:08.830> rid<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.100> those<00:04:09.220> first<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.390> if<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:10.570> see<00:04:10.720> any

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
get rid of those first so if you see any

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.940 
get rid of those first so if you see any
distinct<00:04:11.290> brushstrokes<00:04:11.970> just<00:04:12.970> kind<00:04:13.210> of<00:04:13.950> give

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
distinct brushstrokes just kind of give

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.930 
distinct brushstrokes just kind of give
them<00:04:15.130> a<00:04:15.250> DAB<00:04:15.960> and<00:04:16.960> they'll<00:04:17.140> go<00:04:17.290> away<00:04:17.850> so<00:04:18.850> I'm

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
them a DAB and they'll go away so I'm

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.370 
them a DAB and they'll go away so I'm
just<00:04:19.090> going<00:04:19.210> to<00:04:19.270> kind<00:04:19.480> of<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.660> now<00:04:19.810> just<00:04:20.110> pounce

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
just going to kind of a now just pounce

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.610 
just going to kind of a now just pounce
around<00:04:20.739> with<00:04:21.250> some<00:04:21.400> shot<00:04:21.640> towel<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.660> create

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
around with some shot towel and create

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:52.629 
around with some shot towel and create
some<00:04:24.250> eyes<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.670> lows

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.829 

all<00:04:53.639> right<00:04:53.759> now<00:04:53.999> we<00:04:54.059> have<00:04:54.180> our<00:04:54.300> background

00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:54.839 
all right now we have our background

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.839 
all right now we have our background
texture<00:04:55.169> so<00:04:55.740> I'm<00:04:56.069> just<00:04:56.249> going<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.460> move<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:56.759> to

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
texture so I'm just going to move on to

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.339 
texture so I'm just going to move on to
the<00:04:56.939> next<00:04:57.059> panel<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.629> repeat<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.110> process

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
the next panel and repeat the process

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.799 
the next panel and repeat the process
all<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.800> way<00:04:58.830> around<00:04:59.159> okay<00:04:59.699> so<00:04:59.909> just<00:05:00.569> to<00:05:00.629> get<00:05:00.749> a

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:00.809 
all the way around okay so just to get a

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:03.619 
all the way around okay so just to get a
closer<00:05:01.050> look<00:05:01.199> at<00:05:01.469> what<00:05:01.589> I<00:05:01.620> just<00:05:01.800> did<00:05:02.479> you<00:05:03.479> can

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
closer look at what I just did you can

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.869 
closer look at what I just did you can
see<00:05:03.809> these<00:05:04.020> water<00:05:04.289> streaks<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.129> know<00:05:05.550> this<00:05:05.729> is

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
see these water streaks you know this is

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.219 
see these water streaks you know this is
where<00:05:06.029> it<00:05:06.120> did<00:05:06.240> not<00:05:06.389> belong<00:05:06.689> with<00:05:06.839> a<00:05:06.990> paper

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
where it did not belong with a paper

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.260 
where it did not belong with a paper
towel<00:05:07.529> it's<00:05:07.919> just<00:05:08.129> a<00:05:08.219> dark<00:05:08.490> contrast<00:05:09.059> color

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
towel it's just a dark contrast color

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.659 
towel it's just a dark contrast color
and<00:05:09.509> then<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.409> see<00:05:10.650> how<00:05:10.770> this<00:05:10.919> is<00:05:10.979> white<00:05:11.339> and

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
and then to see how this is white and

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.309 
and then to see how this is white and
it's<00:05:11.789> an<00:05:11.909> embedded<00:05:12.539> it's<00:05:12.870> because<00:05:13.199> the

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
it's an embedded it's because the

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.860 
it's an embedded it's because the
isopropyl<00:05:13.740> alcohol<00:05:14.009> just<00:05:14.430> like<00:05:15.150> froze<00:05:15.719> it

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
isopropyl alcohol just like froze it

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.390 
isopropyl alcohol just like froze it
right<00:05:16.050> there<00:05:16.259> and<00:05:16.499> that's<00:05:16.680> what<00:05:16.889> happens<00:05:17.189> when

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
right there and that's what happens when

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.279 
right there and that's what happens when
you<00:05:18.029> go<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.330> kind<00:05:18.509> of<00:05:18.599> manipulate<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.169> off

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
you go and kind of manipulate it off

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:20.899 
you go and kind of manipulate it off
with<00:05:19.499> a<00:05:19.589> cloth<00:05:19.830> it'll<00:05:20.159> really<00:05:20.309> reveal<00:05:20.699> that

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
with a cloth it'll really reveal that

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.269 
with a cloth it'll really reveal that
and<00:05:21.389> so<00:05:21.749> you<00:05:21.839> can<00:05:21.960> see<00:05:22.050> I<00:05:22.110> just<00:05:22.199> like<00:05:22.740> really

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
and so you can see I just like really

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.829 
and so you can see I just like really
randomly<00:05:23.909> went<00:05:24.089> in<00:05:24.180> there<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.419> just<00:05:24.599> create<00:05:24.779> a

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:24.839 
randomly went in there and just create a

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:27.049 
randomly went in there and just create a
lot<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.080> highs<00:05:25.199> and<00:05:25.229> lows<00:05:25.469> and<00:05:25.889> it<00:05:26.610> wasn't<00:05:26.939> a

00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:27.059 
lot of highs and lows and it wasn't a

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:30.159 
lot of highs and lows and it wasn't a
lot<00:05:27.089> of<00:05:28.159> manipulation<00:05:29.159> on<00:05:29.249> my<00:05:29.370> part<00:05:29.610> I<00:05:29.669> let<00:05:29.879> the

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
lot of manipulation on my part I let the

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.529 
lot of manipulation on my part I let the
isopropyl<00:05:31.169> and<00:05:31.559> the<00:05:31.939> water<00:05:32.939> bottle<00:05:33.300> kind<00:05:33.449> of

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
isopropyl and the water bottle kind of

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.529 
isopropyl and the water bottle kind of
do<00:05:33.629> it<00:05:33.749> for<00:05:34.020> me<00:05:34.169> so<00:05:34.319> it's<00:05:34.770> real<00:05:34.919> fast<00:05:35.479> okay<00:05:36.479> so

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
do it for me so it's real fast okay so

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:37.820 
do it for me so it's real fast okay so
for<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.080> walls<00:05:37.259> we're<00:05:37.409> going<00:05:37.529> to<00:05:37.589> do<00:05:37.680> the

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
for the walls we're going to do the

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.429 
for the walls we're going to do the
exact<00:05:38.069> same<00:05:38.129> process<00:05:38.990> you<00:05:39.990> don't<00:05:40.110> really<00:05:40.319> need

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:40.439 
exact same process you don't really need

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:41.839 
exact same process you don't really need
to<00:05:40.529> worry<00:05:40.649> that<00:05:40.770> much<00:05:40.949> about<00:05:41.219> creating<00:05:41.520> hard

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
to worry that much about creating hard

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.909 
to worry that much about creating hard
lines<00:05:42.089> or<00:05:42.479> getting<00:05:42.809> dry<00:05:42.990> lines<00:05:43.379> lap<00:05:43.649> lines

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
lines or getting dry lines lap lines

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.439 
lines or getting dry lines lap lines
whatever<00:05:44.159> you<00:05:44.370> want<00:05:44.520> to<00:05:44.580> call<00:05:44.759> them<00:05:44.849> just

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
whatever you want to call them just

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:46.579 
whatever you want to call them just

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:46.589 
because this is all going to get covered

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.320 
because this is all going to get covered
with<00:05:46.710> plaster<00:05:47.159> again<00:05:47.430> so<00:05:47.699> just<00:05:47.909> work<00:05:48.120> at<00:05:48.300> a

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
with plaster again so just work at a

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.899 
with plaster again so just work at a
convenience<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.080> not<00:05:49.199> worried<00:05:49.559> about<00:05:49.909> like

keeping a wet edge and walking it

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:53.570 
keeping a wet edge and walking it
because<00:05:52.830> we're<00:05:52.979> going<00:05:53.069> to<00:05:53.129> be<00:05:53.249> able<00:05:53.310> to<00:05:53.399> hide
