 we go to this part of the prayer lights 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.870
 that would be resources and here where they are 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.970
 the topics that are 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.290
 and here we are simply going to click 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.500
 right in a blank space and paste 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.840
 let's see in continue 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.000
 we get a popup window we give 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.970
 fifteen 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.020
 and good compounds can do copied 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:13.570
 they stuck what are the subject ok ok 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.570
 it would only be left to go 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.430
 use let's go to customize 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.920
 After that, what is 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.920
 our subject we are only going to execute 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.930
 because here is 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.930
 I'm going to click to execute it 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.430
 ok and with seeing because this is one of the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.540
 themes 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.230
 this is the modern what it is and what 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.900
 we can call it being windows 8 with 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 color in the windows in the frame a 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.080
 sixth place in the windows 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.019
 the buttons on the corner of the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:00.580
 windows is equal to what would come 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:02.590
 being our windows 8 and good 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.670
 also here we can put the color of 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.340
 window 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.070
 but we can give it to avoid a 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.620
 transparency and well this would already be 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.620
 if we go select a color 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:27.920
 ok or good or else leave it like that 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:30.800
 with the color that good that would be a subject 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.069
 part of what is the pack that brings the 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.120
 three issues this cell this is the world 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.120
 other metro 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.209
 which is white as you can see 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.140
 that looks pretty smart the weather 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.140
 to combine with a 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:56.200
 blas which is to access pretty well 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.200
 composed of will be white 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.640
 and the buttons that are what 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:06.850
 distinguish from 10 windows 7 windows 8 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.450
 good also comes what is the subject in 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.750
 Of course it is this one here that is the 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.460
 glass and we who is with the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.340
 transparency the only thing that would change 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.010
 would be for the buttons 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.190
 and well this is how you are going to deny what 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.470
 is the theme 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.840
 I hope this bus of this video 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.210
 well I'm going to leave the subject 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.470
 with the color that I like the most 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.100
 is this team 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.080
 once it is installed then only 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.230
 I wanted to change the bars this way 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.760
 well I hope you liked this 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.650
