00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.590
 hello I am erika today I bring you a 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.679
 tutorial of three easy hairstyles and 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.990
 simple I almost do not have myself but of 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.349
 Once in a while it's okay to fix a 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.930
 little more for a special occasion and not 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.000
 you want to go as always with the hair 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.090
 I loose something and you want to do something better 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.090
 and for people who almost did not 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:32.100
 have something easy and fast is ideal 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.100
 so we started 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.770
 We apply on all our hair 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.289
 and we combed to remove any moment 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.289
 that we have 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.730
 hairstyle 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.680
 holding on top of 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.370
 our hair with these leagues very 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.370
 little girls 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.690
 we combed loose pigs 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.880
 we take the hair from the tail and the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.890
 we put little by little for the part 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.840
 top of our hairstyle 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.840
 helping us with our fingers 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.950
 we combed 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.400
 and we put some fixative 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.310
 so that our hairstyle lasts longer 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.310
 we fasten with pins 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.440
 so that our hairstyle lasts longer 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.440
 we fasten with pins 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.829
 we let loose a little horse in the 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.829
 front of our hairstyle we comb 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.060
 two 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.610
 leaving the previous hairstyle we make a 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.990
 school from the side of our preference 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.990
 with these small leagues 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.660
 we take a small fact of hair and 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.550
 we make a braid clinic that 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.550
 we will also hold with a league 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.540
 finally we turn with the braid 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.969
 around our tail 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.969
 and fastened with a pin 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.379
 hairstyles 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:04.230
 and ready if it's your preference you can 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:07.830
 add the curl and I will leave it smooth 3 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.340
 with a chair you choose all your hair in 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.340
 a tail 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.600
 in the height that is your preference 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.200
 we separated the hair in two parts before 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.720
 from the tail 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.710
 and we put the rest of the hair down 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.710
 up there 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.449
 we hold with an elite the tips of 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.270
 our hair 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.599
 and so that our tail is like 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.599
 a bomb 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.750
 we finished fastening with pins 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.979
 Use the necessary ones so that your hairstyle 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.979
 last a long time 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.600
 use fixed for these little horses 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.600
 rebels 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.000
 I leave in the front a 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.560
 loose strands as not to be seen 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.560
 the very elaborate hairstyle 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.180
 and ready
