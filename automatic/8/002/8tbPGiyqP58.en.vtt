00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
sample this is actually this sample case

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.130 
sample this is actually this sample case
gets<00:00:29.669> rated<00:00:30.089> all<00:00:30.329> the<00:00:30.509> time<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:31.019> not

prototype the engineer is working on

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.520 
prototype the engineer is working on
today<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.240> it's<00:03:09.390> almost<00:03:09.480> like<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.750> validation

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
today so it's almost like a validation

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.890 
today so it's almost like a validation
tool<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.010> make<00:03:11.160> sure<00:03:11.370> that's<00:03:11.520> really

prototype<00:03:12.900> design<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.650> ready<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.460> go<00:03:14.640> before

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
prototype design is ready to go before

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.150 
prototype design is ready to go before
it<00:03:15.330> goes<00:03:15.510> overseas<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.320> be<00:03:16.350> mass-produced

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
it goes overseas to be mass-produced

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.130 
it goes overseas to be mass-produced
so<00:03:17.520> this<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.850> great<00:03:18.240> for<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.480> engineering

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
so this is great for the engineering

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.890 
so this is great for the engineering

the<00:04:00.709> nice<00:04:00.890> thing<00:04:01.069> about<00:04:01.130> this<00:04:01.459> unit<00:04:01.730> here<00:04:02.209> at

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
the nice thing about this unit here at

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.570 
the nice thing about this unit here at
the<00:04:02.450> approach<00:04:02.660> at<00:04:02.840> 660<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.280> three

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
the approach at 660 the the three

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.809 
the approach at 660 the the three
biggest<00:04:04.849> things<00:04:05.090> we<00:04:05.209> got<00:04:05.360> remember<00:04:05.930> cost

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
biggest things we got remember cost

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.839 
biggest things we got remember cost
full-color<00:04:07.819> and<00:04:08.239> cost<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:09.890> 660<00:04:10.520> is<00:04:10.610> very

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
full-color and cost so the 660 is very

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.479 
full-color and cost so the 660 is very
fast<00:04:11.150> up<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.480> five<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.050> ten<00:04:12.260> times<00:04:12.500> faster<00:04:13.130> than

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
fast up to five to ten times faster than

anything competitive on the market today
the<00:04:15.650> cost<00:04:16.310> assists<00:04:16.940> anywhere<00:04:17.239> from<00:04:17.389> two<00:04:17.690> to

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
the cost assists anywhere from two to

it to the next the next phase of

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.870 
it to the next the next phase of
printing<00:05:12.260> almost<00:05:12.590> like<00:05:12.680> an<00:05:12.800> evolution<00:05:13.670> think

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
printing almost like an evolution think

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.760 
printing almost like an evolution think
of<00:05:14.000> 3d<00:05:14.300> printing<00:05:14.600> as<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.840> next<00:05:15.110> evolution<00:05:15.650> of

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
of 3d printing as the next evolution of

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.530 
of 3d printing as the next evolution of
printing<00:05:16.160> and<00:05:16.370> that's<00:05:16.760> one<00:05:16.970> thing<00:05:17.090> we<00:05:17.210> hope<00:05:17.360> to

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
printing and that's one thing we hope to

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.060 
printing and that's one thing we hope to
bring<00:05:17.660> too<00:05:17.840> graphic<00:05:18.050> to<00:05:18.410> graphics<00:05:18.860> which

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
bring too graphic to graphics which

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.430 
bring too graphic to graphics which
allow<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.480> commercial<00:05:20.480> printers<00:05:20.780> to<00:05:21.230> show

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
allow the commercial printers to show

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.040 
allow the commercial printers to show
them<00:05:21.710> that<00:05:21.830> hey<00:05:22.060> there<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.240> next<00:05:23.600> evolution

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
them that hey there is a next evolution

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:32.730 
them that hey there is a next evolution
of<00:05:24.080> printing<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:24.680> might<00:05:24.980> be<00:05:25.010> in<00:05:25.310> 3d
