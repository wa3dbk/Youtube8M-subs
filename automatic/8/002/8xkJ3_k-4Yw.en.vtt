as<00:02:12.240> you<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.750> see<00:02:12.960> it's<00:02:13.400> dramatically<00:02:14.400> smaller

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
as you can see it's dramatically smaller

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.670 
as you can see it's dramatically smaller
still<00:02:16.200> has<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:17.610> keyboard<00:02:17.910> functionality<00:02:18.810> so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
still has the keyboard functionality so

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.310 
still has the keyboard functionality so
you<00:02:20.130> can<00:02:20.430> still<00:02:20.730> type<00:02:20.970> but<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> keyboard<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.990> a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
lot smaller which obviously goes with

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.190 
lot smaller which obviously goes with
the<00:02:26.100> size<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.520> phone<00:02:26.730> as<00:02:27.450> yet<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.080> not
