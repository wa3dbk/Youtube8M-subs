augmentations<00:03:21.579> or<00:03:21.910> cybernetics<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.660> so

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
augmentations or cybernetics and so

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.979 
augmentations or cybernetics and so
we're<00:03:23.680> at<00:03:23.859> a<00:03:23.890> crossroads<00:03:24.549> again<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:25.450> which<00:03:25.690> we

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
we're at a crossroads again in which we

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.289 
we're at a crossroads again in which we
are<00:03:26.200> learning<00:03:26.950> how<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.370> be<00:03:27.549> more<00:03:27.819> than<00:03:28.060> human

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
are learning how to be more than human

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.210 
are learning how to be more than human
and<00:03:28.690> yet<00:03:29.290> at<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.470> same<00:03:29.560> time<00:03:29.769> we<00:03:30.190> have

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
and yet at the same time we have

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.069 
and yet at the same time we have
elements<00:03:30.640> within<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.239> society<00:03:31.420> who<00:03:31.930> are

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
elements within the society who are

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.500 
elements within the society who are
saying<00:03:32.349> wait<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.769> second<00:03:33.640> we<00:03:33.790> haven't<00:03:34.299> explored

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
saying wait a second we haven't explored

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.809 
saying wait a second we haven't explored
these<00:03:35.200> things<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.950> way<00:03:36.069> we<00:03:36.250> should<00:03:36.280> we<00:03:36.670> don't

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
these things the way we should we don't

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.000 
these things the way we should we don't
know<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.060> psychological<00:03:37.870> effects<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:38.829> don't

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
know the psychological effects we don't

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.530 
know the psychological effects we don't
know<00:03:39.159> all<00:03:39.310> these<00:03:39.489> things<00:03:39.549> should<00:03:40.120> we<00:03:40.359> be

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
know all these things should we be

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.599 
know all these things should we be
playing<00:03:40.840> God<00:03:41.140> so<00:03:41.560> there's<00:03:41.769> a<00:03:41.859> nice<00:03:42.129> parallel

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
playing God so there's a nice parallel

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.479 
playing God so there's a nice parallel
between<00:03:43.560> 20-27<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.769> Renaissance<00:03:45.220> and

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
between 20-27 and the Renaissance and

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.369 
between 20-27 and the Renaissance and
there's<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.060> really<00:03:46.299> cool<00:03:46.480> color<00:03:46.750> scheme<00:03:47.109> can
