00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
it is separate if anyone was wondering I

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.970 
it is separate if anyone was wondering I
actually<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.829> go

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
are going to make now but yeah so the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.770 
are going to make now but yeah so the
name<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.290> ones<00:01:04.500> especially<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.339> taste

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
name of ones especially you can taste

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.120 
name of ones especially you can taste
for<00:01:06.780> me<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.080> least<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.470> could<00:01:07.590> taste<00:01:07.799> really

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
for me at least you could taste really

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.880 
for me at least you could taste really
almost<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> chemical<00:01:09.360> taste<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.080> at

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
almost like a chemical taste and at

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.010 
almost like a chemical taste and at
first<00:01:11.070> i<00:01:11.310> thought<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.570> might<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.869> be

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
first i thought well it might just be

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.390 
first i thought well it might just be
like<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> plastic<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.100> kind<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
like the plastic that you can kind of

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.730 
like the plastic that you can kind of
taste<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:16.259> might<00:01:16.560> have

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
taste in it but and that might have

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
taste in it but and that might have
something<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
something to do with it but with the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.910 
something to do with it but with the
Kerrigan's<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.200> they're<00:01:19.320> plastic<00:01:19.770> too

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
Kerrigan's because they're plastic too

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
Kerrigan's because they're plastic too
so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.280> figured<00:01:20.400> well<00:01:20.759> note<00:01:21.030> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so I just figured well note that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.960 
so I just figured well note that
shouldn't<00:01:22.110> matter<00:01:22.229> because<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.070> know<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
shouldn't matter because you know the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.100 
shouldn't matter because you know the
care<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.390> tasted<00:01:24.720> great<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:26.479> yeah<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
care one tasted great so yeah the the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.920 
care one tasted great so yeah the the
name<00:01:28.710> Bob's<00:01:28.950> especially<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.479> bad<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
name Bob's especially not so bad in the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.740 
name Bob's especially not so bad in the
maxwell<00:01:31.290> house<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.829> still<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
