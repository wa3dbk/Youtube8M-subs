00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.910
 [music] 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.340
 know how they say there well where we are 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.769
 not 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.040
 and in America they say the grass is always greener 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.380
 in another place we are bored in california 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.500
 in the snow because it is snow last 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.130
 we probably dropped out 20 years ago and this 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.750
 there was a big sensation so today we 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.019
 did a white snowy winter at the bar 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.489
 Nikita and we will do white Russian 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:40.019
 white proshin which by the way was invented 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.110
 california 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.140
 maybe someone missed snow then 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.390
 also we take ice cream by the way this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.940
 drink if your girlfriends come to them 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.550
 really like it because it is very 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:03.269
 sweetie and looks very nice and 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.940
 in general, he is so popular that he 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:10.380
 became even popular in other countries as in 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.500
 canada is white canadian even i think 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.750
 there is probably a white Japanese you just still 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.780
 undecided if it is so now I 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.150
 take one part 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.890

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.890

 and one part of the milk you can take too 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:56.050
 the cream will be even tastier but less than nine 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:01.450
 that and now I am step 6 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.640
 and the truth is interesting why here so when 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.520
 you live in one place you want to another 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.440

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.230
 my children go they arrange snow 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.090
 day they start a car that inflates 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.940
 snow and I always think maybe russian 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.430
 it's amazing for people to see what they pay 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.190
 look at the big money for snow now 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.280

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.610
