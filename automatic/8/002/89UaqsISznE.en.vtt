00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
two bars and that's sort of like if you

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.209 
two bars and that's sort of like if you
add<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> bar<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.540> each<00:00:48.660> card<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.110> buyer<00:00:49.290> to<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.890> bar

add a bar of each card a buyer to a bar

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
add a bar of each card a buyer to a bar
a<00:00:50.250> five<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> bar<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.780> could<00:00:52.020> happen<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
a five and a bar one it could happen of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.770 
a five and a bar one it could happen of
entire<00:00:52.860> five<00:00:53.100> chord<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:54.180> if<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.570> saw<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
entire five chord or if you saw a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.900 
entire five chord or if you saw a

progression at two five in one bar and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.670 
progression at two five in one bar and
then<00:00:57.149> winning<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:57.840> by<00:00:58.020> could<00:00:58.230> use<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> over

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
then winning one by could use it over

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.180 
then winning one by could use it over
about<00:00:59.579> Chester<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.120> five<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.600> one<00:01:00.750> bar<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.320 
about Chester to five in one bar so the
lift<00:01:03.770> starts<00:01:04.770> on<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.039> D<00:01:05.160> minor<00:01:05.399> seventh<00:01:05.850> chord<00:01:05.880> I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
lift starts on a D minor seventh chord I

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.050 
lift starts on a D minor seventh chord I
like<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.280> B<00:01:08.280> minor<00:01:08.550> seventh<00:01:11.060> it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
like to use this B minor seventh it

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.039 
like to use this B minor seventh it
starts<00:01:12.420> by<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:14.299> by<00:01:15.299> hitting<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> third<00:01:15.869> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
starts by going by hitting the third of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.240 
starts by going by hitting the third of
this<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.580> card

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
this of this card

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.060 
this of this card
and<00:01:19.340> then<00:01:20.050> it<00:01:21.050> kind<00:01:21.290> of<00:01:21.410> goes<00:01:21.530> up<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.800> pentatonic

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
and then it kind of goes up a pentatonic

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.240 
and then it kind of goes up a pentatonic
scale<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:22.760> because<00:01:22.970> F<00:01:23.390> G<00:01:26.800> that's<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:27.950> first

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
scale so because F G that's the first

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.920 
scale so because F G that's the first
bit<00:01:28.790> of<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.970> big<00:01:29.150> sur<00:01:29.420> F<00:01:30.050> I<00:01:30.590> hit<00:01:31.190> that<00:01:31.340> Accord<00:01:31.930> hit

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
bit of a big sur F I hit that Accord hit

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.730 
bit of a big sur F I hit that Accord hit
G<00:01:33.260> there's<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:33.890> single<00:01:34.220> line<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:34.700> then<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.150> hit

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
G there's a single line and then a hit

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.420 
G there's a single line and then a hit
is<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.979> card<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.580> then<00:01:37.700> C<00:01:38.240> is<00:01:38.510> a<00:01:38.720> card<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.500> then

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
is a card and then C is a card and then

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.290 
is a card and then C is a card and then
it<00:01:40.880> goes<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:45.640> single<00:01:46.640> lines<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:47.030> are<00:01:47.150> bit
