00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.190 

all<00:00:04.640> right<00:00:04.790> we're<00:00:04.940> ready<00:00:04.970> to<00:00:05.210> move<00:00:05.840> on<00:00:06.020> to<00:00:06.109> the

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
all right we're ready to move on to the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.360 
all right we're ready to move on to the
next<00:00:06.319> step<00:00:06.620> and<00:00:06.770> the<00:00:06.859> next<00:00:06.890> step<00:00:07.160> is<00:00:07.189> actually

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
next step and the next step is actually

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.000 
next step and the next step is actually
we<00:00:07.640> got<00:00:07.729> to<00:00:07.849> make<00:00:07.939> a<00:00:08.240> little<00:00:09.200> cover<00:00:09.440> plate<00:00:09.740> but

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
we got to make a little cover plate but

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.209 
we got to make a little cover plate but
before<00:00:10.309> we<00:00:10.400> do<00:00:10.519> that<00:00:10.550> we<00:00:11.330> need<00:00:11.480> to<00:00:11.570> determine

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
before we do that we need to determine

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.489 
before we do that we need to determine
which<00:00:13.219> wires<00:00:13.549> actually<00:00:13.879> feed<00:00:14.809> through<00:00:15.379> the

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:15.499 
which wires actually feed through the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.100 
which wires actually feed through the
firewall<00:00:16.300> and<00:00:17.300> which<00:00:17.510> wires<00:00:17.720> are<00:00:17.930> going<00:00:17.960> to

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
firewall and which wires are going to

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.530 
firewall and which wires are going to
remain<00:00:18.320> inside<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.340> cab<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:20.270> here's<00:00:20.450> the

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
remain inside the cab and here's the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.700 
remain inside the cab and here's the
basic<00:00:20.690> harness<00:00:21.200> there's<00:00:21.350> a<00:00:21.410> few<00:00:21.590> more

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
basic harness there's a few more

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.380 
basic harness there's a few more
components<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.250> this<00:00:22.490> but<00:00:23.450> this<00:00:23.570> is<00:00:23.780> the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
components to this but this is the

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.840 
components to this but this is the
basically<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:27.050> basic<00:00:27.410> harness<00:00:27.770> in<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:28.790> of

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
basically the basic harness in and of

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.120 
basically the basic harness in and of
itself<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.510> we<00:00:30.350> really<00:00:30.590> only<00:00:30.620> have<00:00:30.920> two

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
itself and we really only have two

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.560 
itself and we really only have two
bundles<00:00:31.550> here<00:00:31.780> that<00:00:32.780> will<00:00:32.930> be<00:00:34.450> going<00:00:35.450> through

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
bundles here that will be going through

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.319 
bundles here that will be going through
the<00:00:35.839> firewall<00:00:36.730> into<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.820> engine<00:00:38.059> compartment

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
the firewall into the engine compartment

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.869 
the firewall into the engine compartment
and<00:00:38.890> off<00:00:39.890> to<00:00:40.039> the<00:00:40.129> back<00:00:40.249> of<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:40.460> truck<00:00:40.670> for

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
and off to the back of the truck for

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.729 
and off to the back of the truck for
example<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.359> this<00:00:42.019> bundle<00:00:42.260> right<00:00:42.530> here

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
example this this bundle right here

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.099 
example this this bundle right here
houses<00:00:43.480> you<00:00:44.480> can<00:00:44.600> see<00:00:45.159> left<00:00:46.159> rear<00:00:46.370> turn<00:00:46.640> signal

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
houses you can see left rear turn signal

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.819 
houses you can see left rear turn signal
gas<00:00:48.109> gauge<00:00:48.819> rear<00:00:49.819> running<00:00:50.149> lights<00:00:50.679> stuff<00:00:51.679> like

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
gas gauge rear running lights stuff like

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.739 
gas gauge rear running lights stuff like
that<00:00:52.039> so<00:00:52.249> this<00:00:52.370> is<00:00:52.429> going<00:00:53.089> out<00:00:53.239> to<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.449> back<00:00:53.600> of

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
that so this is going out to the back of

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.130 
that so this is going out to the back of
the<00:00:53.809> truck<00:00:54.050> this<00:00:54.620> bundle<00:00:54.920> right<00:00:55.190> here<00:00:56.140> is

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
the truck this bundle right here is

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.319 
the truck this bundle right here is
basically<00:00:57.710> going<00:00:58.129> under<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.489> hood<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.210> can

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
basically going under the hood you can

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.040 
basically going under the hood you can
see<00:00:59.479> here<00:00:59.749> headlight<00:01:00.710> high<00:01:00.920> beam<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:02.050> down

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
see here headlight high beam and down

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.760 
see here headlight high beam and down
here<00:01:03.409> headlight<00:01:04.159> low<00:01:04.400> beam<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:06.260> ignition

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
here headlight low beam the ignition

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.429 
here headlight low beam the ignition
feed<00:01:07.010> and<00:01:07.689> some<00:01:08.689> other<00:01:08.810> stuff<00:01:09.079> in<00:01:09.170> here<00:01:09.350> like

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
feed and some other stuff in here like

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.600 
feed and some other stuff in here like
that<00:01:09.500> turn<00:01:10.040> signals

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
that turn signals

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.639 
that turn signals
so<00:01:11.329> this<00:01:11.479> basically<00:01:11.780> goes<00:01:12.049> under<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.439> hood

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
so this basically goes under the hood

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.429 
so this basically goes under the hood
and<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.430> front<00:01:13.700> lights<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.719> really<00:01:15.049> these

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
and to the front lights so really these

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.760 
and to the front lights so really these
two<00:01:16.420> bundles<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.479> wires<00:01:17.659> right<00:01:17.960> here<00:01:18.320> about

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
two bundles of wires right here about

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.749 
two bundles of wires right here about
what's<00:01:18.979> going<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.189> be<00:01:19.280> going<00:01:19.520> through<00:01:19.640> the

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
what's going to be going through the

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.550 
what's going to be going through the
firewall<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:20.930> kind<00:01:21.110> of<00:01:21.140> want<00:01:21.289> to<00:01:21.320> pinch

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
firewall and you kind of want to pinch

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.020 
firewall and you kind of want to pinch
these<00:01:21.770> together<00:01:22.899> to<00:01:23.899> get<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.219> an<00:01:25.219> estimate<00:01:25.969> of

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
these together to get a an estimate of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.480 
these together to get a an estimate of
how<00:01:26.090> large<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.110> hole<00:01:27.350> you're<00:01:28.100> gonna<00:01:28.189> need<00:01:28.430> a

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
how large of a hole you're gonna need a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.719 
how large of a hole you're gonna need a
drill<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.030> really<00:01:29.899> what<00:01:30.799> size<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.219> grommet

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
drill and really what size of a grommet

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.969 
drill and really what size of a grommet
that<00:01:31.880> you're<00:01:32.270> going<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.450> need<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.590> had<00:01:33.799> just

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
that you're going to need and I had just

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.170 
that you're going to need and I had just
laying<00:01:34.219> around<00:01:35.170> this<00:01:36.170> PCB<00:01:36.649> grommet<00:01:37.219> which

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
laying around this PCB grommet which

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.330 
laying around this PCB grommet which
just<00:01:38.390> happens<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:38.899> really<00:01:39.829> really<00:01:40.100> close

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
just happens to be really really close

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.590 
just happens to be really really close
to<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.640> size<00:01:40.789> I<00:01:40.939> need<00:01:40.969> it's<00:01:41.270> probably<00:01:41.570> a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
to the size I need it's probably a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.569 
to the size I need it's probably a
little<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.049> large<00:01:42.200> side<00:01:42.530> but<00:01:43.280> these<00:01:43.460> are

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
little on the large side but these are

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.510 
little on the large side but these are
not<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:44.450> only<00:01:44.630> wires<00:01:45.100> that<00:01:46.100> I'm<00:01:46.250> going<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.460> be

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
not the only wires that I'm going to be

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.620 
not the only wires that I'm going to be
running<00:01:46.640> through<00:01:46.880> there<00:01:47.060> if<00:01:47.179> I<00:01:47.270> remember

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
running through there if I remember

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.069 
running through there if I remember
correctly<00:01:48.460> this<00:01:49.460> wiring<00:01:50.329> harness<00:01:50.450> does<00:01:50.929> not

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
correctly this wiring harness does not

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.539 
correctly this wiring harness does not
have<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.710> feed<00:01:52.310> wire<00:01:52.810> for<00:01:53.810> reverse<00:01:54.259> lights<00:01:54.590> so

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
have a feed wire for reverse lights so

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.740 
have a feed wire for reverse lights so
that's<00:01:55.729> something<00:01:55.939> I'm<00:01:56.090> gonna<00:01:56.240> have<00:01:56.329> to<00:01:56.509> make

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
that's something I'm gonna have to make

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.440 
that's something I'm gonna have to make
up<00:01:57.009> and<00:01:58.009> basically<00:01:58.250> what<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:58.759> did<00:01:58.969> before<00:01:59.090> it

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
up and basically what I did before it

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.700 
up and basically what I did before it
I'm<00:01:59.539> gonna<00:01:59.630> do<00:01:59.749> the<00:01:59.869> same<00:01:59.899> thing<00:02:00.049> I<00:02:00.350> have<00:02:00.469> a<00:02:00.530> lot

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
I'm gonna do the same thing I have a lot

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.499 
I'm gonna do the same thing I have a lot
of<00:02:00.740> circuits<00:02:01.219> here<00:02:01.429> that<00:02:02.030> I'm<00:02:02.119> not<00:02:02.299> going<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
of circuits here that I'm not going to

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.919 
of circuits here that I'm not going to
use<00:02:02.780> like<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.829> CB<00:02:04.159> your<00:02:04.850> CB<00:02:05.210> radio<00:02:05.539> cruise

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
use like the CB your CB radio cruise

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.880 
use like the CB your CB radio cruise
control<00:02:06.289> power<00:02:06.530> seats<00:02:07.009> power<00:02:07.999> windows<00:02:08.890> clock

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
control power seats power windows clock

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.240 
control power seats power windows clock
power<00:02:10.610> locks<00:02:11.379> stuff<00:02:12.379> like<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.769> that<00:02:12.980> I'm<00:02:13.069> not

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
power locks stuff like that that I'm not

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.610 
power locks stuff like that that I'm not
my<00:02:14.209> truck<00:02:14.390> doesn't<00:02:14.599> have<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.080> don't<00:02:15.140> intend

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
my truck doesn't have and I don't intend

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.910 
my truck doesn't have and I don't intend
to<00:02:15.680> put<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.040> in<00:02:16.220> there

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
to put that in there

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.360 
to put that in there
so<00:02:17.069> I'll<00:02:17.220> use<00:02:17.400> something<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.030> CB

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
so I'll use something like this CB

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.699 
so I'll use something like this CB
circuit<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:21.569> use<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.080> as<00:02:22.290> my<00:02:22.850> backup<00:02:23.850> lights

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
circuit and use that as my backup lights

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.990 
circuit and use that as my backup lights
circuit<00:02:25.709> I'll<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.340> have<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.580> find<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.750> CB

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
circuit I'll just have to find the CB

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.980 
circuit I'll just have to find the CB
the<00:02:30.000> wire<00:02:30.209> that's<00:02:30.450> labeled<00:02:30.840> CB<00:02:31.170> radio<00:02:31.470> and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
the wire that's labeled CB radio and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.860 
the wire that's labeled CB radio and
plug<00:02:33.990> that<00:02:34.020> in<00:02:34.350> as<00:02:34.530> my<00:02:35.300> rear<00:02:36.300> backup<00:02:36.510> lights

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
plug that in as my rear backup lights

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.330 
plug that in as my rear backup lights
just<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.290> example<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.740> may<00:02:37.860> use<00:02:38.010> something

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
just for example I may use something

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.880 
just for example I may use something
else<00:02:38.459> but<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.540> anyway<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.050> approximately

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
else but so anyway this is approximately

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.940 
else but so anyway this is approximately
all<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.180> wires<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:43.440> are<00:02:43.530> gonna<00:02:43.620> go<00:02:43.770> through

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
all the wires that are gonna go through

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.090 
all the wires that are gonna go through
the<00:02:44.010> firewall<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:45.470> but<00:02:46.470> there<00:02:46.590> will<00:02:46.739> be<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.860> few

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the firewall and but there will be a few

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.750 
the firewall and but there will be a few
more<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.760> got<00:02:48.239> myself<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:49.280> grommet<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
more so I got myself a grommet like I

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.920 
more so I got myself a grommet like I
said<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.060> really<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.860> PCV<00:02:52.860> valve<00:02:53.220> grommet<00:02:54.090> but

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
said it's really a PCV valve grommet but

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.120 
said it's really a PCV valve grommet but
I'm<00:02:55.019> gonna<00:02:55.110> use<00:02:55.290> an<00:02:55.440> estimate<00:02:55.769> as<00:02:55.920> an

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
I'm gonna use an estimate as an

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.860 
I'm gonna use an estimate as an
electrical<00:02:56.519> grommet<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.420> let<00:02:57.540> me<00:02:57.600> go<00:02:57.690> show<00:02:57.840> you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
electrical grommet so let me go show you

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.790 
electrical grommet so let me go show you
the<00:02:58.080> little<00:02:58.200> cover<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.310> we<00:02:59.400> need<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.640> make

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
the little cover that we need to make

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.199 
the little cover that we need to make
all<00:03:01.800> right<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.070> here's<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> hole<00:03:02.610> then<00:03:03.120> we

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
all right this here's the hole then we

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.610 
all right this here's the hole then we
need<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.450> cover<00:03:03.660> up<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.110> I'm<00:03:04.200> gonna<00:03:04.320> come<00:03:04.500> in

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
need to cover up so I'm gonna come in

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.250 
need to cover up so I'm gonna come in
here<00:03:04.890> I've<00:03:05.790> got<00:03:05.850> some<00:03:06.180> flat<00:03:06.390> plate<00:03:06.630> steel<00:03:06.989> I'm

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
here I've got some flat plate steel I'm

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.800 
here I've got some flat plate steel I'm
just<00:03:07.650> gonna<00:03:07.769> come<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.070> here<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.310> make<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> quick

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
just gonna come in here and make a quick

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.550 
just gonna come in here and make a quick
a<00:03:09.830> little<00:03:10.830> cover<00:03:11.130> then<00:03:12.090> I'm<00:03:12.209> gonna<00:03:12.530> use<00:03:13.530> a

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
a little cover then I'm gonna use a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.500 
a little cover then I'm gonna use a
weather<00:03:13.980> stripping<00:03:14.400> adhesive<00:03:14.880> around<00:03:15.269> it

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
weather stripping adhesive around it

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.720 
weather stripping adhesive around it
just<00:03:15.690> make<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.959> seal<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.680> then<00:03:17.400> I'll<00:03:17.489> drill<00:03:17.700> a

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
just make a seal and then I'll drill a

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.780 
just make a seal and then I'll drill a
couple<00:03:17.940> holes<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:19.800> mount<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.310> fuse<00:03:20.580> panel

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
couple holes to mount the fuse panel

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.720 
couple holes to mount the fuse panel
itself<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.660> then<00:03:22.140> one<00:03:22.350> large<00:03:22.560> hole<00:03:22.860> sort<00:03:23.640> of

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
itself and then one large hole sort of

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.870 
itself and then one large hole sort of
in<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.940> centre<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:25.620> run<00:03:25.799> my<00:03:25.950> wires<00:03:26.459> through

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
in the centre to run my wires through

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.940 
in the centre to run my wires through
now<00:03:27.570> actually<00:03:28.280> these<00:03:29.280> two<00:03:29.340> factory<00:03:30.060> holes

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
now actually these two factory holes

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.289 
now actually these two factory holes
work<00:03:32.420> with<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.690> new<00:03:33.920> fuse<00:03:34.920> panel<00:03:35.340> they<00:03:36.000> line

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
work with the new fuse panel they line

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.009 
work with the new fuse panel they line
up<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:37.200> problem<00:03:37.620> is<00:03:37.829> up<00:03:38.760> here<00:03:39.239> on<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> on

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
up the problem is up here on the it on

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.819 
up the problem is up here on the it on
this<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:41.010> corner<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:43.410> fuse<00:03:43.680> panel

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
this on this corner the fuse panel

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.569 
this on this corner the fuse panel
that's<00:03:44.310> where<00:03:44.519> it's<00:03:45.150> either<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.570> turn<00:03:45.750> signal

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
that's where it's either the turn signal

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.550 
that's where it's either the turn signal
relay<00:03:47.579> or<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.420> hazard<00:03:48.600> light<00:03:48.900> relay<00:03:49.320> is

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
relay or the the hazard light relay is

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.380 
relay or the the hazard light relay is
up<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.549> this<00:03:50.670> area<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:52.019> actually<00:03:52.200> contacts

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
up in this area and it actually contacts

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.199 
up in this area and it actually contacts
the<00:03:54.390> little<00:03:54.690> pull<00:03:54.930> cable<00:03:55.910> this<00:03:56.910> little

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
the little pull cable this little

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.750 
the little pull cable this little
bracket<00:03:57.989> here<00:03:58.160> for<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.250> parking<00:03:59.579> brake

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
bracket here for the parking brake

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.500 
bracket here for the parking brake
assembly<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:01.340> unfortunately<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:03.060> not<00:04:03.239> that

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
assembly so unfortunately it's not that

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.949 
assembly so unfortunately it's not that
we<00:04:03.750> really<00:04:03.829> can't<00:04:04.829> use<00:04:05.160> these<00:04:05.640> holes<00:04:06.000> but<00:04:06.900> what

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
we really can't use these holes but what

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.340 
we really can't use these holes but what
we<00:04:07.320> can<00:04:07.530> do<00:04:07.739> is<00:04:08.489> use<00:04:09.390> them<00:04:09.660> as<00:04:09.810> some<00:04:09.930> reference

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
we can do is use them as some reference

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.800 
we can do is use them as some reference
will<00:04:10.980> make<00:04:11.160> our<00:04:11.310> plate<00:04:11.640> we<00:04:12.420> could<00:04:12.600> come<00:04:12.780> over

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
will make our plate we could come over

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.930 
will make our plate we could come over
say<00:04:13.470> an<00:04:13.739> inch<00:04:14.250> drill<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.150> hole<00:04:16.549> directly<00:04:17.549> one

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
say an inch drill a hole directly one

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.509 
say an inch drill a hole directly one
inch<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.750> right<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:19.709> each<00:04:20.100> one<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.340> these

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
inch to the right of each one of these

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.030 
inch to the right of each one of these
holes<00:04:20.850> we'll<00:04:21.720> have<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.930> check

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
holes we'll have to check

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.690 
holes we'll have to check
under<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.550> firewall<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.030> feel<00:04:24.780> anything

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
under the firewall and feel anything

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.820 
under the firewall and feel anything
that<00:04:26.700> would<00:04:26.820> cause<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.030> problem<00:04:27.270> same<00:04:27.870> down

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
that would cause a problem same down

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.920 
that would cause a problem same down
here<00:04:29.010> on<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.160> bottom<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:30.030> what<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.510> can<00:04:30.720> do<00:04:30.810> is

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
here on the bottom so what I can do is

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.650 
here on the bottom so what I can do is
just<00:04:31.250> since<00:04:32.250> we<00:04:32.370> have<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:32.730> these<00:04:33.060> dimensions

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
just since we have this these dimensions

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.230 
just since we have this these dimensions
will<00:04:33.840> just<00:04:33.990> go<00:04:34.170> directly<00:04:35.070> one<00:04:35.370> inched<00:04:35.670> to<00:04:36.120> the

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
will just go directly one inched to the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.800 
will just go directly one inched to the
right

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
right

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.690 
right
drill<00:04:37.770> our<00:04:37.920> holes<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.250> those<00:04:38.400> will<00:04:38.580> be<00:04:38.670> our

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
drill our holes and those will be our

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.240 
drill our holes and those will be our
mounting<00:04:39.150> holes<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:40.350> mount<00:04:40.470> our<00:04:40.650> fuse<00:04:40.920> panel

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
mounting holes to mount our fuse panel

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.150 
mounting holes to mount our fuse panel
in<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:42.090> area<00:04:42.390> so<00:04:42.570> let<00:04:43.530> me<00:04:43.590> go<00:04:43.710> get<00:04:43.860> started

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
in that area so let me go get started

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.450 
in that area so let me go get started
making<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.210> cover<00:04:45.390> plate<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:45.870> then<00:04:46.740> I'll

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
making the cover plate and then I'll

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.120 
making the cover plate and then I'll
shoot<00:04:47.610> some<00:04:47.790> more<00:04:47.820> video
