00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
range training is a complete bitch if

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.670 
range training is a complete bitch if
you<00:02:43.829> can't<00:02:43.859> go<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.430> yaks<00:02:45.139> well<00:02:46.139> I<00:02:46.230> guess<00:02:46.470> it's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
you can't go to yaks well I guess it's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.069 
you can't go to yaks well I guess it's
not<00:02:46.859> like<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.879> can<00:02:48.000> still<00:02:48.209> get<00:02:48.329> a<00:02:48.359> fire<00:02:48.599> Giants

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
not like you can still get a fire Giants

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.690 
not like you can still get a fire Giants
and<00:02:49.200> stuff<00:02:49.409> intezaar<00:02:50.099> but<00:02:50.400> that's<00:02:50.549> really

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
and stuff intezaar but that's really

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.140 
and stuff intezaar but that's really
slow<00:02:51.000> XP<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.659> if<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.319> don't<00:02:52.470> want<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.680> chin

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
slow XP and if you don't want to chin

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.759 
slow XP and if you don't want to chin
the<00:02:54.150> only<00:02:54.359> other<00:02:54.389> like<00:02:54.840> alternatives<00:02:55.590> like

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
rock crabs are like ogres I guess ogres

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.280 
rock crabs are like ogres I guess ogres
