00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
but we just had the sense that he was

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.129 
but we just had the sense that he was
and<00:02:43.019> so<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:44.739> know<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:46.690> United<00:02:46.959> States

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.300 
been suffering from a drought I don't
know<00:02:53.079> if<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.319> will<00:02:53.440> lead<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.650> food<00:02:54.129> shortages

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
know if that will lead to food shortages

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.699 
know if that will lead to food shortages
or<00:02:54.700> not<00:02:54.909> it<00:02:55.239> looks<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:55.569> it's<00:02:55.900> starting<00:02:56.170> to

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
or not it looks like it's starting to

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.190 
or not it looks like it's starting to
get<00:02:56.829> more<00:02:57.519> rain<00:02:57.790> significant<00:02:58.599> amounts<00:02:59.200> of

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
get more rain significant amounts of

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.539 
get more rain significant amounts of
rain<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.739> hopefully<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.159> will<00:03:00.250> help<00:03:00.370> to

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
rain and hopefully that will help to

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.050 
rain and hopefully that will help to
drought<00:03:00.790> situation<00:03:01.389> and<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:02.650> don't<00:03:02.909> share<00:03:03.909> this

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
drought situation and I don't share this

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.149 
drought situation and I don't share this
with<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.659> go<00:03:05.049> about<00:03:05.230> fear<00:03:05.500> mongering<00:03:05.889> or

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
with you to go about fear mongering or

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.000 
with you to go about fear mongering or
causing<00:03:06.940> worry<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.480> speaking<00:03:07.930> doom<00:03:08.139> but<00:03:08.980> i

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
causing worry and speaking doom but i

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.099 
causing worry and speaking doom but i
just<00:03:09.250> want<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.459> share<00:03:09.639> what<00:03:09.819> I've<00:03:09.909> seen<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.480> I

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
just want to share what I've seen and I

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.300 
just want to share what I've seen and I
think<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.440> fits<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.769> with<00:03:11.889> the<00:03:11.920> times<00:03:12.190> that

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
think it fits in with the times that

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.869 
think it fits in with the times that
we're<00:03:12.519> living<00:03:12.609> in<00:03:13.139> times<00:03:14.139> of<00:03:14.379> money<00:03:15.310> shortages

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
we're living in times of money shortages

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.720 
we're living in times of money shortages
and<00:03:16.180> things<00:03:16.660> like<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:18.400> think<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
and things like that and I think the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.159 
and things like that and I think the
Lord<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.120> message<00:03:19.419> in<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.569> is<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.900> Lord<00:03:20.079> is

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
Lord the message in that is the Lord is

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.520 
Lord the message in that is the Lord is
saying<00:03:20.349> take<00:03:20.680> heart<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:22.109> things<00:03:23.109> are<00:03:23.290> rough

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
saying take heart that things are rough
