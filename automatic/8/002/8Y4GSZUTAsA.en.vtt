surgery but in addition to that I do lot

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.090 
surgery but in addition to that I do lot
of<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.450> known<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.750> out<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.229> saline<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the viscosity out because it is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.760 
the viscosity out because it is
basically<00:01:10.229> okay<00:01:10.890> by<00:01:11.220> opting<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.850> repairs<00:01:12.240> and

very few surgeons in fact in the country
and<00:01:28.140> outside<00:01:28.290> through<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:28.979> kind<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.310> surgery

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and outside through this kind of surgery

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.760 
and outside through this kind of surgery
and<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.659> developed<00:01:30.990> interesting<00:01:31.650> this

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and I developed interesting this

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.230 
and I developed interesting this
particular<00:01:32.070> society<00:01:32.490> when<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.909> UK

particular society when I was in UK
because<00:01:33.479> you're<00:01:33.630> got<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> lot<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.079> these

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
because you're got a lot of these

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.140 
because you're got a lot of these
patients<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.799> African<00:01:35.340> reserves<00:01:35.729> and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
awarded it basically means that the risk

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.640 
awarded it basically means that the risk
of<00:02:57.519> surgery<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.910> less<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:59.170> recovery<00:02:59.590> is

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
of surgery is less the recovery is

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.120 
of surgery is less the recovery is
faster<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.640> also<00:03:01.299> it<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> less<00:03:02.620> costly<00:03:02.860> in

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
faster and also it is a less costly in

faster and also it is a less costly in
