other world computing Mac Pro
installation<00:00:45.930> tips<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.420> got<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> packing

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
installation tips and we got a packing

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.889 
installation tips and we got a packing
list<00:00:49.530> which<00:00:50.100> says<00:00:50.430> 2<00:00:50.969> gigabyte<00:00:51.480> Mac<00:00:51.690> Pro

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
list which says 2 gigabyte Mac Pro

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.920 
list which says 2 gigabyte Mac Pro
qualified<00:00:52.379> stick<00:00:53.129> status<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:54.780> what

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
qualified stick status for that's what

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.569 
qualified stick status for that's what
we<00:00:55.079> ordered<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:56.000> here<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.960> they<00:00:57.989> are

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
we ordered and here they here they are

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.799 
we ordered and here they here they are
instead<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.699> pink<00:00:59.940> foam<00:01:00.149> guess<00:01:00.570> I'll<00:01:00.719> be

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
instead of a pink foam guess I'll be

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.070 
instead of a pink foam guess I'll be
right<00:01:00.989> underneath<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:02.780> there's<00:01:03.780> two<00:01:04.049> of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
right underneath there there's two of

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.640 
right underneath there there's two of
them<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> there's<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.610> good<00:01:08.820> stick<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:13.380> good

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
them so there's one good stick to good

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.170 
them so there's one good stick to good
steaks

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.310 

and<00:01:18.180> under<00:01:18.420> another<00:01:18.630> piece<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.930> pink<00:01:19.110> phone

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and under another piece of pink phone

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.780 
and under another piece of pink phone
which<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.680> took<00:01:19.800> out<00:01:20.630> there's<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.840> other<00:01:21.960> two

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
which it took out there's the other two

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.020 
which it took out there's the other two
so<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.880> does<00:01:24.090> make<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:25.110> six<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:29.030> which

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so that does make up for six of which

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.360 
so that does make up for six of which
should<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.360> two<00:01:30.540> gigabyte<00:01:30.870> sticks<00:01:31.190> from<00:01:32.190> other

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
should be two gigabyte sticks from other

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.960 
should be two gigabyte sticks from other
world<00:01:32.610> computing<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:34.250> that'll<00:01:35.250> upgrade<00:01:35.790> my

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
world computing and that'll upgrade my

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.170 
world computing and that'll upgrade my
macpro<00:01:36.480> when<00:01:36.810> i<00:01:36.870> get<00:01:37.050> it<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.440> 10<00:01:38.340> gigabytes<00:01:38.880> of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
macpro when i get it to 10 gigabytes of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.110 
macpro when i get it to 10 gigabytes of
ram<00:01:39.720> which<00:01:40.440> will<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.680> more<00:01:41.490> than<00:01:41.520> i<00:01:41.730> need<00:01:41.760> for

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
ram which will be more than i need for

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.790 
ram which will be more than i need for
anything<00:01:42.300> it'll<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.170> good<00:01:43.260> for<00:01:43.320> video<00:01:43.650> editing

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
anything it'll be good for video editing

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.160 
anything it'll be good for video editing
and<00:01:44.160> stuff<00:01:44.250> run<00:01:45.150> dual<00:01:45.390> monitor<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:45.960> i'll<00:01:46.050> need

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and stuff run dual monitor so i'll need

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.320 
and stuff run dual monitor so i'll need
it<00:01:46.230> but<00:01:46.650> probably<00:01:47.490> won't<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.700> take<00:01:47.910> any<00:01:48.150> meds

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330
