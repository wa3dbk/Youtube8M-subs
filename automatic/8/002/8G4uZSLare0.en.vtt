much the same on the front and over on

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
much the same on the front and over on
this<00:01:36.180> side<00:01:36.240> over<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.680> see<00:01:37.860> some<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
this side over here you can see some of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
this side over here you can see some of
the<00:01:38.250> light<00:01:38.400> starts<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> fall<00:01:39.060> off<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the light starts to fall off because the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
the light starts to fall off because the
windows<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.259> more<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.950> side<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> her<00:01:41.400> so

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
windows are more on this side of her so

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.580 
windows are more on this side of her so
what<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.290> set<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
what I'm going to do is just set the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.980 
what I'm going to do is just set the
meter<00:01:43.799> over<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.670> I'm<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> take<00:01:45.960> a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
meter over here and I'm going to take a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.539 
meter over here and I'm going to take a
reading<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:46.920> giving<00:01:47.220> me<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.369> reading

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
reading and that's giving me a reading

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.020 
reading and that's giving me a reading
of<00:01:47.909> f/4<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.840> 1<00:01:49.140> 500th<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.920> second<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:50.939> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
of f/4 at 1 500th of a second now if I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.580 
of f/4 at 1 500th of a second now if I
were<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.180> meter<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.930> side<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.320> her<00:01:52.439> where

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
were to meter on this side of her where

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.499 
were to meter on this side of her where
there's<00:01:52.770> less<00:01:52.979> light<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:53.909> given<00:01:54.329> me<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
there's less light that's given me a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.950 
there's less light that's given me a
reading<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:55.020> 2.8<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.159> metered<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.729> this

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
reading of 2.8 so if I metered for this

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.240 
reading of 2.8 so if I metered for this
this<00:01:57.960> side<00:01:58.200> over<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.710> would<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> lot

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
this side over here would be a lot

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.789 
this side over here would be a lot
lighter<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.780> because<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> look<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.530> I'm

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
lighter so because of the look that I'm

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.950 
lighter so because of the look that I'm
wanting<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> want<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.850> go<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.329> this

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
wanting to go for I want to go on this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.090 
wanting to go for I want to go on this
side<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.200> her<00:02:04.469> where<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> light<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:04.950> falling

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
side of her where the light is falling

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.760 
side of her where the light is falling
I'll<00:02:05.700> go<00:02:06.119> ahead<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.600> set<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.350> my<00:02:07.500> camera

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
I'll go ahead and set that on my camera

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
I'll go ahead and set that on my camera
and<00:02:07.950> we'll<00:02:08.819> start<00:02:09.060> shooting<00:02:09.119> okay<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.319> I

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
and we'll start shooting okay so like I

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.320 
and we'll start shooting okay so like I
said<00:02:10.500> I'm<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> set<00:02:11.489> my<00:02:11.640> camera<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.030> f/4

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
said I'm going to set my camera to f/4

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.420 
said I'm going to set my camera to f/4
and<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:14.200> meter<00:02:14.440> was<00:02:14.650> telling<00:02:14.950> me<00:02:15.040> one<00:02:15.220> five

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
and the meter was telling me one five

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.980 
and the meter was telling me one five
hundredths<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:15.970> second<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.480> because<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
hundredths of a second and because the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.870 
hundredths of a second and because the
arsy<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.590> maximum<00:02:18.070> shutter<00:02:18.280> speed<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.700> one

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
arsy the maximum shutter speed is one

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.620 
arsy the maximum shutter speed is one
four<00:02:19.120> hundredths

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
four hundredths

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.000 
four hundredths
I'm<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.080> going<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.230> stick<00:02:20.470> with<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.680> it's

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
I'm just going to stick with that it's

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.790 
I'm just going to stick with that it's
not<00:02:21.190> going<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.370> make<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.550> huge<00:02:21.820> difference<00:02:22.060> and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
not going to make a huge difference and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.400 
not going to make a huge difference and
on<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.010> side<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.250> overexposure<00:02:25.120> by<00:02:25.420> 1/100<00:02:26.320> of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
on the side of overexposure by 1/100 of

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.350 
on the side of overexposure by 1/100 of
a<00:02:26.530> second<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.070> it's<00:02:27.850> not<00:02:28.000> going<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.240> make<00:02:28.330> a

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
a second so it's not going to make a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.240 
a second so it's not going to make a
huge<00:02:28.690> difference<00:02:29.110> but<00:02:29.350> I'll<00:02:29.620> at<00:02:29.740> least<00:02:29.800> be<00:02:30.100> on

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
huge difference but I'll at least be on

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.770 
huge difference but I'll at least be on
that<00:02:30.430> side<00:02:30.700> rather<00:02:31.030> than<00:02:31.180> on<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.600> side<00:02:31.630> of

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
that side rather than on the side of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.660 
that side rather than on the side of
underexposure

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
underexposure

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.890 
underexposure
so<00:02:33.670> we'll<00:02:33.850> go<00:02:33.940> ahead<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.180> get<00:02:34.390> started<00:02:34.690> here

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
so we'll go ahead and get started here

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.710 
so we'll go ahead and get started here
