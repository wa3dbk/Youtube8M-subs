and<00:00:37.040> shoot<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.490> then<00:00:38.390> it<00:00:38.630> retrieves<00:00:39.110> the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
and shoot and then it retrieves the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.860 
and shoot and then it retrieves the
image<00:00:39.470> for<00:00:39.710> us<00:00:39.830> however<00:00:40.820> you<00:00:41.030> can<00:00:41.060> create<00:00:41.630> a

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
image for us however you can create a

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.890 
image for us however you can create a
series<00:00:42.260> of<00:00:42.440> commands<00:00:42.950> in<00:00:43.280> advance<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.030> this

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
series of commands in advance and this

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.630 
series of commands in advance and this
series<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.320> commands<00:00:45.560> is<00:00:45.710> called<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.190> script

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
series of commands is called a script

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.340 
series of commands is called a script
then<00:00:47.060> you<00:00:47.180> can<00:00:47.300> save<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.780> script<00:00:47.990> you<00:00:48.200> can

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
then you can save the script you can

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.680 
then you can save the script you can
reuse<00:00:48.470> it<00:00:48.830> later<00:00:48.860> and<00:00:49.400> it<00:00:50.030> just<00:00:50.210> allows<00:00:50.480> you

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
reuse it later and it just allows you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.240 
reuse it later and it just allows you
some<00:00:50.840> additional<00:00:51.050> flexibility<00:00:51.860> with<00:00:52.040> how<00:00:52.190> you

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
some additional flexibility with how you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.000 
some additional flexibility with how you
communicate<00:00:52.880> with<00:00:52.910> your<00:00:53.180> camera<00:00:53.800> so<00:00:54.800> for

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
communicate with your camera so for

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.740 
communicate with your camera so for
example<00:00:55.040> a<00:00:55.520> very<00:00:55.730> basic<00:00:55.910> script<00:00:56.450> would<00:00:56.630> be

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
example a very basic script would be

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.020 
example a very basic script would be
this<00:00:56.990> let's<00:00:57.770> say<00:00:57.950> I<00:00:57.980> want<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:58.370> shoot<00:00:58.700> and

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
this let's say I want to shoot and

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.570 
this let's say I want to shoot and
that's<00:00:59.870> going<00:01:00.080> to<00:01:00.170> shoot<00:01:00.500> with<00:01:00.680> no<00:01:00.890> autofocus

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
that's going to shoot with no autofocus

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.289 
that's going to shoot with no autofocus
and<00:01:02.290> pause<00:01:03.290> let's<00:01:04.040> say<00:01:04.220> for<00:01:04.250> two<00:01:04.640> seconds

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
and pause let's say for two seconds

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.959 
and pause let's say for two seconds
that's<00:01:05.479> in<00:01:05.630> milliseconds<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:06.649> then<00:01:07.520> shoot

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
that's in milliseconds and then shoot

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.679 
that's in milliseconds and then shoot
again<00:01:08.409> all<00:01:09.409> right<00:01:09.799> now<00:01:10.310> what<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.520> shoot<00:01:10.909> it<00:01:11.149> is

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
again all right now what I shoot it is

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.620 
again all right now what I shoot it is
going<00:01:11.899> to<00:01:12.049> use<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:13.130> folders<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.240> file

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
going to use the folders and file

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.559 
going to use the folders and file
settings<00:01:15.109> I<00:01:15.409> have<00:01:15.619> back<00:01:15.979> here<00:01:19.329> when<00:01:20.329> you<00:01:20.420> want

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
settings I have back here when you want

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.270 
settings I have back here when you want
to<00:01:20.659> start<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.049> script<00:01:21.319> is<00:01:21.469> click<00:01:21.770> on<00:01:21.920> start

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
to start the script is click on start

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.899 
to start the script is click on start
and<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:24.560> ship<00:01:24.770> grain<00:01:25.069> shows<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.549> is<00:01:25.700> being

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
and the ship grain shows that is being

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.480 
and the ship grain shows that is being
successful<00:01:26.619> white<00:01:27.619> means<00:01:27.829> that<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:28.310> in

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
successful white means that it's in

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.529 
successful white means that it's in
progress<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.270> here<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.539> took<00:01:29.780> my<00:01:30.049> two<00:01:30.740> images

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.270 

okay<00:01:35.539> let's<00:01:35.749> try<00:01:35.899> some<00:01:36.139> variations<00:01:36.859> now<00:01:37.219> we

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
okay let's try some variations now we

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.179 
okay let's try some variations now we
can<00:01:37.490> also<00:01:37.729> do<00:01:38.119> a<00:01:38.389> loop<00:01:39.109> let's<00:01:39.710> say<00:01:39.829> I<00:01:39.889> wanted<00:01:40.100> to

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
can also do a loop let's say I wanted to

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.010 
can also do a loop let's say I wanted to
capture<00:01:40.399> three<00:01:40.789> images<00:01:41.060> now<00:01:41.539> you<00:01:41.600> could<00:01:41.899> just

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
capture three images now you could just

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.569 
capture three images now you could just
put<00:01:42.259> three<00:01:42.499> shoot<00:01:42.740> commands<00:01:43.189> here<00:01:43.369> but

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
put three shoot commands here but

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.190 
put three shoot commands here but
there's<00:01:43.729> another<00:01:43.939> way<00:01:44.149> we<00:01:44.509> can<00:01:44.689> do<00:01:44.869> it<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.109> I'm

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
there's another way we can do it so I'm

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.469 
there's another way we can do it so I'm
just<00:01:45.319> going<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.499> remove<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.579> pause<00:01:46.939> and

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
just going to remove this pause and

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.230 
just going to remove this pause and
remove<00:01:47.719> the<00:01:47.929> shoot<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:48.530> bring<00:01:49.399> up<00:01:49.549> repeat

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
remove the shoot and bring up repeat

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.330 
remove the shoot and bring up repeat
until<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:50.719> to<00:01:50.869> repeat<00:01:51.280> three<00:01:52.280> times<00:01:54.280> now<00:01:55.280> two

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
until it to repeat three times now two

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.340 
until it to repeat three times now two
commands<00:01:55.969> were<00:01:56.149> added<00:01:56.509> here<00:01:56.749> this<00:01:56.959> one<00:01:57.170> and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
commands were added here this one and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.649 
commands were added here this one and
this<00:01:57.619> one<00:01:57.679> these<00:01:58.039> are<00:01:58.100> paired<00:01:58.549> you<00:01:58.909> repeat<00:01:59.359> and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
this one these are paired you repeat and

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.859 
this one these are paired you repeat and
then<00:01:59.779> you<00:02:00.709> go<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.549> repeat<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.209> we<00:02:02.630> need<00:02:02.779> to

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
then you go to the repeat so we need to

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.660 
then you go to the repeat so we need to
put<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.200> meat<00:02:03.469> of<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:03.740> loop<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.369> between

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
put the meat of the loop in between

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.120 
put the meat of the loop in between
these<00:02:05.119> two<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:06.109> I'm<00:02:06.259> going<00:02:06.439> to<00:02:06.529> move<00:02:06.709> this<00:02:06.859> down

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
these two so I'm going to move this down

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.249 
these two so I'm going to move this down
now<00:02:07.459> when<00:02:08.330> i<00:02:08.360> start<00:02:08.629> the<00:02:08.659> script<00:02:08.989> it's<00:02:09.140> going

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
now when i start the script it's going

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.749 
now when i start the script it's going
to<00:02:09.319> take<00:02:09.470> three<00:02:09.619> shots<00:02:09.920> let's<00:02:10.220> give<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.580> try

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
to take three shots let's give it a try

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.440 
to take three shots let's give it a try
out

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.600 

there's<00:02:17.450> our<00:02:17.720> three<00:02:18.050> now<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:19.190> include

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
there's our three now you can include

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.430 
there's our three now you can include
other<00:02:19.940> commands<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.599> here<00:02:20.840> if<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.110> wanted

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
other commands in here if you wanted

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.559 
other commands in here if you wanted
that<00:02:21.590> pause<00:02:21.830> in<00:02:22.129> here<00:02:22.489> you<00:02:22.970> can<00:02:23.150> do<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.360> as

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
that pause in here you can do that as

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.140 
that pause in here you can do that as
well<00:02:23.709> I'll<00:02:24.709> just<00:02:24.980> put<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.250> paws<00:02:25.430> up<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.819> here

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
well I'll just put the paws up in here

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:41.530 
well I'll just put the paws up in here
and<00:02:26.300> let's<00:02:26.780> try<00:02:27.019> again<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.970> use<00:02:41.209> for<00:02:41.420> this

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
and let's try again so I use for this

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.770 
and let's try again so I use for this
would<00:02:41.870> be<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.440> do<00:02:42.980> time-lapse<00:02:43.489> photography

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
would be to do time-lapse photography

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.000 
would be to do time-lapse photography
although<00:02:44.780> we<00:02:45.019> do<00:02:45.170> have<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.500> intervalometer

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
although we do have the intervalometer

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.009 
although we do have the intervalometer
here<00:02:46.430> which<00:02:46.700> has<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:47.000> bit<00:02:47.269> more<00:02:47.390> flexibility

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
here which has a bit more flexibility

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.930 
here which has a bit more flexibility
than<00:02:48.110> this<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:49.610> know<00:02:49.700> if<00:02:49.790> you're

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
than this and you know if you're

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.120 
than this and you know if you're
bracketing<00:02:50.450> for<00:02:50.780> capturing<00:02:51.170> images<00:02:51.319> for<00:02:51.980> an

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
bracketing for capturing images for an

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.069 
bracketing for capturing images for an
HDR<00:02:52.549> you<00:02:53.209> can<00:02:53.360> use<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.599> bracketing

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
HDR you can use the bracketing

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.319 
HDR you can use the bracketing
functionality<00:02:54.650> as<00:02:54.709> well<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.269> really

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
functionality as well and so it's really

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.870 
functionality as well and so it's really
up<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.720> how<00:02:57.049> you<00:02:57.079> prefer<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.500> use<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.920> you

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
up to you how you prefer to use it you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.030 
up to you how you prefer to use it you
could<00:02:59.030> save<00:02:59.329> this<00:02:59.599> for<00:03:00.110> later<00:03:00.170> used<00:03:00.709> I'm<00:03:00.890> just

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
could save this for later used I'm just

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.800 
could save this for later used I'm just
going<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.220> call<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.430> test<00:03:02.120> one<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:04.810> next

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
going to call this test one the next

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.729 
going to call this test one the next
time<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.590> load<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:07.099> profile<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:08.739> script

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
time you load this profile this script

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.440 
time you load this profile this script
will<00:03:09.920> also<00:03:10.280> load<00:03:12.610> now<00:03:13.610> we<00:03:13.670> can<00:03:13.910> do<00:03:14.120> some<00:03:14.329> other

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
will also load now we can do some other

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.789 
will also load now we can do some other
things<00:03:14.569> with<00:03:14.930> these<00:03:15.049> scripts<00:03:15.349> of<00:03:15.500> one<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.709> the

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
things with these scripts of one of the

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.309 
things with these scripts of one of the
unique<00:03:16.370> things<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.540> we<00:03:17.840> can<00:03:18.019> send

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
unique things is that we can send

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.039 
unique things is that we can send
information<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.980> an<00:03:19.220> external<00:03:19.549> program<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.900> it

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
information to an external program so it

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.199 
information to an external program so it
could<00:03:21.260> be<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:22.069> are<00:03:22.220> taking<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.819> series<00:03:23.180> of

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
could be that you are taking a series of

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.360 
could be that you are taking a series of
shots<00:03:23.569> maybe<00:03:24.410> you're<00:03:24.590> doing<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.829> focus<00:03:25.190> stock

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
shots maybe you're doing a focus stock

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.729 
shots maybe you're doing a focus stock
except<00:03:25.850> you<00:03:25.940> have<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.090> focus<00:03:26.510> stack<00:03:26.780> rig<00:03:27.200> where

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
except you have a focus stack rig where

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.259 
except you have a focus stack rig where
you<00:03:27.829> have<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.040> focus<00:03:28.459> rail<00:03:28.639> that's<00:03:28.850> controlled

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
you have a focus rail that's controlled

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.000 
you have a focus rail that's controlled
by<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:29.480> stepper<00:03:29.959> motor<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.650> stepper

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
by a stepper motor and that stepper

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.539 
by a stepper motor and that stepper
motor<00:03:31.220> is<00:03:31.400> connected<00:03:31.720> maybe<00:03:32.720> by<00:03:32.989> USB<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:34.519> a

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
motor is connected maybe by USB to a

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.150 
motor is connected maybe by USB to a
program<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.389> you<00:03:35.510> have<00:03:35.720> written<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.889> all<00:03:37.010> you

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
program that you have written so all you

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.430 
program that you have written so all you
need<00:03:37.250> control<00:03:37.639> my<00:03:37.730> nikon<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.239> do<00:03:38.389> is<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:39.230> tell

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
need control my nikon to do is to tell

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.220 
need control my nikon to do is to tell
the<00:03:39.470> camera<00:03:39.769> to<00:03:40.190> capture<00:03:40.579> an<00:03:40.850> image<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.420> to

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
the camera to capture an image and to

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.069 
the camera to capture an image and to
command<00:03:42.709> your<00:03:43.120> program<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.420> move<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.870> stepper

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
command your program to move the stepper

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.809 
command your program to move the stepper
motor<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.500> bit<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.100> can<00:03:46.190> move<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.609> focus

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
motor a bit so you can move the focus

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.629 
motor a bit so you can move the focus
let's<00:03:47.810> see<00:03:47.989> how<00:03:48.139> we<00:03:48.200> do<00:03:48.500> that<00:03:48.650> i'm<00:03:49.220> just<00:03:49.400> going

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
let's see how we do that i'm just going

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:57.910 
let's see how we do that i'm just going
to<00:03:49.670> get<00:03:49.819> rid<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.090> these<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:56.230> i'm<00:03:57.230> going<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.650> put

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
to get rid of these and i'm going to put

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.559 
to get rid of these and i'm going to put
in<00:03:58.099> a<00:03:58.389> loop<00:03:59.389> i<00:04:00.609> will<00:04:01.609> just<00:04:01.700> leave<00:04:01.940> that<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.299> for

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
in a loop i will just leave that to for

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.360 
in a loop i will just leave that to for
now<00:04:03.790> i'll<00:04:04.790> put<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.120> a<00:04:05.209> shoot

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
now i'll put in a shoot

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.559 
now i'll put in a shoot
and<00:04:08.719> now<00:04:09.719> I<00:04:09.750> also<00:04:10.500> add<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.159> command<00:04:11.519> send<00:04:11.939> UDP

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
and now I also add the command send UDP

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.869 
and now I also add the command send UDP
packet<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.230> here<00:04:13.530> we<00:04:13.680> send<00:04:13.950> some<00:04:14.189> data<00:04:14.430> and

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
packet and here we send some data and

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.120 
packet and here we send some data and
let's<00:04:15.629> say<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.810> wanted<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.350> do<00:04:16.500> this<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.859> wanted

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
let's say I wanted to do this I wanted

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.939 
let's say I wanted to do this I wanted
to<00:04:17.220> send<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.729> string<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.359> data<00:04:18.600> move<00:04:19.049> one<00:04:19.680> you

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
to send this string of data move one you

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.770 
to send this string of data move one you
can<00:04:20.100> put<00:04:20.220> whatever<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:20.579> like<00:04:20.729> in<00:04:20.910> there<00:04:21.120> to

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
can put whatever you like in there to

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.680 
can put whatever you like in there to
this<00:04:22.049> address<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.919> this<00:04:23.340> port<00:04:23.699> using<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.240> UDP

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
this address and this port using the UDP

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.529 
this address and this port using the UDP
network<00:04:25.350> protocol<00:04:25.860> so<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.520> your<00:04:26.639> program<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
network protocol so in your program you

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.240 
network protocol so in your program you
would<00:04:27.630> basically<00:04:27.810> set<00:04:28.530> up<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.740> listener<00:04:29.070> to

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
would basically set up a listener to

this it knows that it should move the

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.680 
this it knows that it should move the

now<00:04:37.590> when<00:04:37.919> this<00:04:38.160> information<00:04:38.759> is<00:04:38.880> sent

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
now when this information is sent

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.540 
now when this information is sent
control<00:04:39.840> my<00:04:39.930> Nikon<00:04:40.320> will<00:04:40.560> not<00:04:40.740> wait<00:04:40.979> for<00:04:41.220> your

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
control my Nikon will not wait for your

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.159 
control my Nikon will not wait for your
program<00:04:41.759> to<00:04:42.180> do<00:04:42.330> something<00:04:42.660> its<00:04:42.810> is<00:04:42.960> going<00:04:43.110> to

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
program to do something its is going to

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.200 
program to do something its is going to
send<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.710> continue<00:04:44.160> on<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:44.940> if<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.180> takes

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
send it and continue on so if it takes

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.300 
send it and continue on so if it takes
several<00:04:45.630> seconds<00:04:46.080> for<00:04:46.289> your<00:04:46.590> program<00:04:46.949> to

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
several seconds for your program to

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.950 
several seconds for your program to
respond<00:04:47.759> and<00:04:48.000> do<00:04:48.180> something<00:04:48.539> you<00:04:48.660> need<00:04:48.840> to

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
respond and do something you need to

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.439 
respond and do something you need to
build<00:04:49.110> in<00:04:49.320> a<00:04:49.410> delay<00:04:49.710> here<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.729> I'll<00:04:50.880> move<00:04:51.210> this

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
build in a delay here so I'll move this

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.170 
build in a delay here so I'll move this
up<00:04:51.690> so<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:52.680> inside<00:04:53.099> our<00:04:53.280> loops<00:04:53.520> we<00:04:53.759> take<00:04:54.000> our

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
up so it's inside our loops we take our

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.390 
up so it's inside our loops we take our
shot<00:04:54.419> we<00:04:55.259> send<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.590> information<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:56.160> your

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
shot we send the information to your

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.700 
shot we send the information to your
program<00:04:56.639> to<00:04:57.060> move<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.449> focus<00:04:57.630> rail<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.229> then

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
program to move the focus rail and then

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.680 
program to move the focus rail and then
I'll<00:04:58.919> tell<00:04:59.160> it<00:04:59.310> again<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.789> pause<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.539> let's

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
I'll tell it again to pause and let's

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.120 
I'll tell it again to pause and let's
say<00:05:00.930> will<00:05:01.470> tell<00:05:01.650> us<00:05:01.680> pause<00:05:01.949> two<00:05:02.190> seconds<00:05:02.699> and

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
say will tell us pause two seconds and

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.360 
say will tell us pause two seconds and
there<00:05:05.130> we<00:05:05.250> go<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:05.610> let's<00:05:05.729> give<00:05:05.940> this<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.300> try

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
there we go so let's give this a try

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.990 
there we go so let's give this a try
well<00:05:08.370> start<00:05:08.729> it<00:05:10.009> it<00:05:11.009> sends<00:05:11.430> information<00:05:11.580> to

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
well start it it sends information to

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.629 
well start it it sends information to
move<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.300> rail<00:05:12.770> pauses<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:13.949> now<00:05:14.370> it<00:05:14.520> is

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
move the rail pauses and now it is

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.420 
move the rail pauses and now it is
repeats<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.590> that's<00:05:16.590> it<00:05:16.830> that's<00:05:17.010> how<00:05:17.220> you<00:05:17.280> use

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
repeats and that's it that's how you use

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.960 
repeats and that's it that's how you use
scripts<00:05:17.820> within<00:05:18.419> control<00:05:18.720> my<00:05:18.900> Nikon<00:05:19.970> happy

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
scripts within control my Nikon happy

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:29.220 
scripts within control my Nikon happy
tethering

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.290
