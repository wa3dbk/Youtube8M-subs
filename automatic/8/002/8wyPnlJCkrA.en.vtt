00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.850
 even friends of the landscape im 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.280
 Welcome back to a city hall 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.500
 book presentation yes now stands for you 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.070
 I found a way I would like it 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.770
 because he thinks that because of this 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.930
 Tractor as a vehicle for the ls not 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.420
 it is absolutely necessary for machines 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.980
 but rather take your time 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.900
 distribute a bit of fun 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.689
 to explore the web and other stuff 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.520
 has a john deere oldtimer 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.149
 tractor the shop image bishop data are 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.910
 very exciting and indeed they announce us 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.210
 that this john deere model a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.370
 mind you 18 ps i have a whole 18 ps 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.829
 white sounds a lot is little 50 euro 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.449
 have maintenance costs as around 6800 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.760
 euro for this collectible is almost 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.199
 really a shame you can 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.940
 let it pass properly, which is nice 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.500
 is the old tower dialogoge on it 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.829
 and such a nice picture is me 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.110
 say that fits quite well fmc vintage is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.630
 here probably the mother you have to 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.990
 say the textures are absolute 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.549
 acceptable for reasonable 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.420
 the stature fits we have detailed 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.740
 tire 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.580
 We also find a great one 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.049
 tires does not look bad 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.150
 as well the whole basic model she 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.610
 really acceptable from there sits the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.189
 seat shell the steering linkage here still 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.299
 extended made easy 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.590
 I do not know from the year of construction 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.220
 Part is definitely one 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.220
 long time ago 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.180
 enough is talked say we test that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.890
 whole part was i want i have got here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.189
 no four-wheel drive or differential lock 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.189
 and now please listen to the sound people 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.420
 the sound is really fun or 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.939
 you really have to say the sound is 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.180
 really successful 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.670
 In addition, if you are here angels 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.479
 that means we can both here 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.540
 change tires and then we have that 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.829
 Part with opaque rims also looks 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.899
 so I have to say 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.310
 while here is also a drum 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:11.620
 turns the slower 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.600
 No, no, the drum always turns 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.030
 For a long time the engine is running that too 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.770
 not bad to know as I said 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.740
 somehow it has to be so dark here 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.910
 human management in any case 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.690
 I would not have the tire marks 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.540
 they really thought that a lot 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.130
 work well when we look here 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.390
 they are awesome 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.040
 pasted glued on first I say 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.750
 Glued on are made super 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.110
 good minimal steering movement is relative 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.610
 quiet or ruhnke is that it is not so 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.330
 beautiful from full you do not notice 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.180
 but here it is generally 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.239
 I want to give the mod manufacturer around 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.470
 also the rating as a fan word 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.510
 to be understood in the interior 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.540
 The rims are not very cool from what 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.170
 also funny is the driver disappears 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.820
 if you get up close enough, it's exciting 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.290
 thing feather of once on ghost hand 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.470
 but you have to say that the person is here 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.570
 sits great and also by the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.320
 Steering yes the arms fit perfectly 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.610
 So they did it very well 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.470
 maximum speed 15 km h so here 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.930
 I do not agree with a speed record 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.860
 on order but I guess here are 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.510
 really four stars not too little though 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.720
 one also quickly turns the stops 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.519
 drum yes you are also mothers 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.200
 front there are many lamella exhaust 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.489
 not to mention the ones too 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.720
 headlights work the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.660
 headlights work 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:51.060
 lok error free yes the question must 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.170
 we already lie now 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.610
 but I knew how error-free 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.320
 can also be bad again 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.470
 read it out and I was too fast again 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.010
 and not cleared from the lok they make 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.010
 just like that 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.610
 so now just buy me the part 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.420
 Let's see if it's free 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.420
 is or not 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.459
 ok fast because i would like you too 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.900
 show a lot 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.910
 carsten bÃ¼hrer that means we have 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.200
 a few wings that is a pity and that 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.660
 reading friends sorry is not true 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.250
 error-free is no longer indicated 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.760
 if we buy him that's a pity 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.900
 In any case, I believe it faultless 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.550
 what do you want such a place without 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.140
 function too much wrong 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.240
 honestly if you want to have mistakes now 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.730
 I am very surprised the lights 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.530
 so horny from 4 places on the ford 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.780
 I would like to say thanks for watching 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.470
 I'm out I was in the bus home makes it 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.470
 good bye
