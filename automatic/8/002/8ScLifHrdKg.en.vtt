puncture the pillow that you could go

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.820 
puncture the pillow that you could go
ahead<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.390> repair<00:01:58.840> it's<00:01:59.050> very<00:01:59.230> easy<00:01:59.470> at<00:01:59.680> this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
ahead and repair it's very easy at this

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.200 
ahead and repair it's very easy at this
point<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.310> go<00:02:00.430> ahead<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.670> just<00:02:00.760> put<00:02:00.910> a<00:02:00.940> drop<00:02:01.180> of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
point to go ahead and just put a drop of

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.210 
point to go ahead and just put a drop of
glue<00:02:01.390> on<00:02:01.660> it<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:01.810> you're<00:02:02.290> totally<00:02:02.470> set<00:02:02.770> sealed

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
glue on it and you're totally set sealed

glue on it and you're totally set sealed
that<00:02:03.970> probably<00:02:04.720> won't<00:02:04.870> ever<00:02:05.110> happen<00:02:05.320> but<00:02:05.650> just

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
that probably won't ever happen but just

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.730 
that probably won't ever happen but just
so<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:05.980> know<00:02:06.040> how<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.250> get<00:02:06.400> access<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.820> it<00:02:07.740> go

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
so you know how to get access to it go

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.190 
so you know how to get access to it go
ahead<00:02:08.770> back<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.940> actual<00:02:10.240> pillow<00:02:10.479> topper

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
and the actual case here you go ahead

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.480 
and the actual case here you go ahead
and<00:02:13.570> take<00:02:13.660> this<00:02:13.900> wash<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.070> sink

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
out of the pillow just like that then

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.570 
out of the pillow just like that then
you're<00:02:38.740> going<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.890> take<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.220> whole<00:02:39.370> air

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.300 
back into the pillow case all tucked
away<00:02:47.170> now<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.500> want<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.709> make<00:02:47.860> sure<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:48.130> this

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
away now you want to make sure that this

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.870 
away now you want to make sure that this
square<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.970> velcro<00:02:49.690> gets<00:02:49.989> aligned<00:02:50.440> up<00:02:50.880> right

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
this very often you can probably do a

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.940 
this very often you can probably do a
neater<00:03:04.930> job<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.350> I've<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.590> done<00:03:05.769> there
