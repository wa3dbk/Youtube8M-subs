he's wearing some kingly robes he's got
the<00:00:17.220> purple<00:00:17.670> royal<00:00:18.600> robes<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.439> he<00:00:20.220> looks<00:00:20.490> like

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the purple royal robes on he looks like

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.890 
the purple royal robes on he looks like
he's<00:00:20.850> pretty<00:00:21.060> dirty<00:00:22.070> now<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
he's pretty dirty now I like I like the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.589 
he's pretty dirty now I like I like the
idea<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> wizard<00:00:25.920> level<00:00:26.310> 6<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.880> think<00:00:27.090> they're

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
idea of a wizard level 6 I think they're

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.000 
idea of a wizard level 6 I think they're
actually<00:00:27.750> really<00:00:28.289> good<00:00:28.439> as<00:00:28.619> they<00:00:28.800> are<00:00:28.830> right

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
actually really good as they are right

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.600 
actually really good as they are right
now<00:00:29.660> but<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:31.619> make<00:00:31.769> him<00:00:31.890> even<00:00:32.009> stronger<00:00:32.430> I

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
now but to make him even stronger I

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.190 
now but to make him even stronger I
think<00:00:32.669> that's<00:00:33.030> probably<00:00:33.180> what<00:00:33.719> they're<00:00:33.899> doing

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
think that's probably what they're doing

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.139 
think that's probably what they're doing
they're<00:00:34.350> gonna<00:00:34.440> make<00:00:35.130> him<00:00:35.309> adapt<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.940> this

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
they're gonna make him adapt to this

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.479 
they're gonna make him adapt to this
fire<00:00:36.660> theme<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.590> see<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.309> looks

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
fire theme that they have see it looks

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.700 
fire theme that they have see it looks
like<00:00:38.670> he's<00:00:38.820> shooting<00:00:39.149> out<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> fireball<00:00:39.899> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
like he's shooting out a fireball so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.139 
like he's shooting out a fireball so
maybe<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.730> might<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:42.000> his<00:00:42.120> last

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
maybe that's that might be his last

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.860 
maybe that's that might be his last
upgrade<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.230> fit<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> fire<00:00:43.800> theme<00:00:44.420> but<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
upgrade to fit the fire theme but you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.440 
upgrade to fit the fire theme but you
could<00:00:46.020> definitely<00:00:46.260> expect<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:47.910> he's<00:00:48.120> if

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
could definitely expect that if he's if

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
could definitely expect that if he's if
he's<00:00:48.809> getting<00:00:49.020> upgraded<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.280> level

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
he's getting upgraded like that to level

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.090 
he's getting upgraded like that to level
6<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.870> wizard<00:00:52.110> towers<00:00:52.620> must<00:00:52.890> be

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
6 then the wizard towers must be

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.220 
6 then the wizard towers must be
upgraded<00:00:53.550> too<00:00:53.699> because<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.870> look<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
upgraded too because if you look at the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.040 
upgraded too because if you look at the
archer<00:00:55.590> towers<00:00:55.980> they've<00:00:56.910> been<00:00:57.180> upgraded<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
archer towers they've been upgraded and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.069 
archer towers they've been upgraded and
they<00:00:58.350> resembled<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.250> character<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.510> level<00:01:00.809> 6

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
they resembled the character the level 6

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.619 
they resembled the character the level 6
archers<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.920> I'm<00:01:02.730> pretty<00:01:03.059> sure<00:01:03.329> they're<00:01:03.539> gonna

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
archers so I'm pretty sure they're gonna

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.960 
archers so I'm pretty sure they're gonna
do<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> same<00:01:04.019> thing<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.830> him<00:01:05.100> we're<00:01:05.880> gonna

do the same thing with him we're gonna

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
do the same thing with him we're gonna
have<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.450> an<00:01:06.630> upgrade<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> wizard
