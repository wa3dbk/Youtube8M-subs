00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.819
 all if not for the moment not comment on the supplements 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.869
 so it will no longer be necessary for you to show us today 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.480
 armed and dangerous been released on parole one can think of formulating 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 folder because I think you will understand 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 but we must change the name of the top each time the ground earlier in 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 part by part 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.040
 it is also this role of the bce on his bench 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.140
 so we come to light by showing that the shooting phase in these sites 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.110
 that is, free style 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.780
 he was 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.500
 duration 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.440
 this article 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.300
 for the art title 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.710
 celine 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.360
 after 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.360
 nothing 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.290
 m 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.299
 that's why veolia is doing good 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.299
 Why 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.460
 Before leaving 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.030
 new jersey for this burglary 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.600
 jean-claude we showed ourselves shooting phases 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.720
 better since the retirement of gentleman among the right answers 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.620
 this moment 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.550
 so he buys and eat well this 2006 comeback because it is 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.379
 so for the next I think we make the record as high as possible in 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.209
 tactical terms 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.120
 m 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.120
 Let's go 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.999
 at the 38th 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:39.669
 shortly after his 2009 season 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.669
 when as always for me it's impossible 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.469
 because if I am 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.719
 after people in a boom 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.689
 however today there are many who say that geographical identity 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.689
 benoît xvi world by receiving 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:01.340
 why the new york stock market sunday 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.109
 he is a leader 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.109
 cemetery it was before I found it not bad 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.429
 waxman 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.449
 for a suite the streets 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.449
 the fast enough 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.720
 so there it will not increase the exposure anymore 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.800
 the moment vehemently oppose the second social mission 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.760
 the weight what I find very positive 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.259
 5 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.259
 m 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.369
 this is the moment to release on parole 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.699
 the site must not last super happy 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:02.420
 the president 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.469
 it really started to be born 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:07.559
 the presence head in front of the pilot phase 2 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:11.840
 the peloton is finishing his studies at over 15 minutes I can do he is 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:12.969
 also more 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.299
 the two members of my party with its source europe 1 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.499
 so thank you all for having advanced to deprive 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.439
 Bouzekrini 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.439
 zigouzis m hair 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.259
 and members 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.340
 rights reserved why why 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.550
 that is more tenable 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.770
 Why 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.229
 we are happy for him to rest 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.050
 yesterday 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.050
 excluding postage 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.009
 before continuing 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.860
 so we're going to pursue it for how it's going 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.270
 I am before his admission all the surfaces not made laugh 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.270
 the silence over the p staff 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.870
 so I also said thank you all for watching my other video 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.849
 if montréal is the first mission of the game the race with the whip and nice 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.539
 all the same last April 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.590
 in as many and whispers the anjou horses present 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.449
 158 holidays 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.129
 two years that frankly that's certain 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.669
 I hope that it will continue to proceed to impose itself to spread 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.029
 today inevitably 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.110
 I take off my thing 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.849
 but the more we will have a good mood on the editorial charter of the point I 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.839
 may not be gone wood heating 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:01.789
 except for a few hours 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.189
 Sunday April 3rd 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:06.479
 sacha baron cohen makes appear 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.089
 praised the vine stakes 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:11.089
 these poor people 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.639
 this country 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.639
 then on the chains 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.169
 she tells her humor 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.169
 he jumped into the cold 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.159
 the support as his beautiful 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.259
 4 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:42.259
 gold 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.009
 it's racism 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:49.009
 6 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:56.169
 small sequences 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:59.279
 the small knocks for the complexion but that's another story 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:02.659
 indeed 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:05.830
 while it was believed for her 2 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.930
 it's the poor 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.759
 3 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:13.759
 sports to live and quickly normally 

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:19.499
 still 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.319
 here is the Breton mission 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:32.809
 so as I told you this is going on and how is it doing 

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:35.809
 emma players pretty much the same this minute 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.270
 so I hope that we do not urgently plan do not end up 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.369
 surprising 

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:44.219
 gauthier more serious thing more consistent 

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:47.379
 that is, I will do the after-sales service that was born when 

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:49.309
 even a little longer than saying 

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:51.219
 the val de lys archers 

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:53.429
 ten questions from this field 

00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:55.949
 as well as the use of interrogation 

00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:58.840
 yes really that's where things will start at a tight score I 

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.649
 means 

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:00.749
 common 

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:03.770
