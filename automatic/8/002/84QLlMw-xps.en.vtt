00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
the ocean and we put her on the board as

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.099 
the ocean and we put her on the board as
a<00:03:05.459> joke<00:03:05.700> one<00:03:05.910> day<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.269> she<00:03:06.389> just<00:03:06.569> stood<00:03:06.780> up<00:03:06.840> on
