you can also get like new require fine

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.300 
you can also get like new require fine
how<00:03:23.060> do<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.209> do<00:03:23.330> that<00:03:23.510> pretty<00:03:24.230> easy<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:25.280> just

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
how do you do that pretty easy you just

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.920 
how do you do that pretty easy you just
have<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.790> be<00:03:25.910> anywhere<00:03:26.299> you<00:03:26.420> have<00:03:26.480> your<00:03:26.720> sass

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
recipe Said's I so you slide down easy

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.040 
recipe Said's I so you slide down easy
like<00:04:05.380> slime<00:04:05.860> left<00:04:06.310> like<00:04:06.850> that<00:04:07.090> or<00:04:07.270> slide<00:04:07.690> right

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.080 
doesn't look like this I modify it
through<00:04:14.710> settings<00:04:15.070> that<00:04:15.340> looks<00:04:15.640> like<00:04:15.850> this

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
through settings that looks like this

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.979 
through settings that looks like this
but<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.170> looks<00:04:17.380> something<00:04:17.530> like<00:04:17.710> this<00:04:18.030> no<00:04:19.030> use
