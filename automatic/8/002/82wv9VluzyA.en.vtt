Yvette<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.079> I'd<00:01:58.229> say<00:01:58.409> about<00:01:58.530> 4<00:01:59.250> or<00:01:59.280> 5<00:01:59.430> years<00:01:59.880> ago

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
Yvette so I'd say about 4 or 5 years ago

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.389 
Yvette so I'd say about 4 or 5 years ago
now<00:02:00.740> basically<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.890> looking<00:02:02.219> for

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
now basically I was looking for

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.429 
now basically I was looking for
something<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.270> don't<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.659> animals<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.259> don't

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
something I don't have animals I don't

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.010 
something I don't have animals I don't
have<00:02:04.680> manure<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.299> I've<00:02:06.420> been<00:02:06.540> trying<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> find

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
have manure so I've been trying to find

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020 
have manure so I've been trying to find
cover<00:02:07.350> crops<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.220> fit<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.550> well<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.970> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
cover crops that that fit in well with a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.660 
cover crops that that fit in well with a
fairly<00:02:09.690> intensive<00:02:10.140> vegetable<00:02:10.619> production<00:02:10.890> so

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
fairly intensive vegetable production so

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.450 
fairly intensive vegetable production so
that<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.849> don't<00:02:11.970> wear<00:02:12.090> out

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
that we don't wear out

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.240 
that we don't wear out
I<00:02:12.880> like<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.050> veg<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.680> source<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.100> nitrogen

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
I like the veg for a source of nitrogen

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.680 
I like the veg for a source of nitrogen
because<00:02:15.760> I'm<00:02:15.820> looking<00:02:15.910> for<00:02:16.180> something<00:02:16.480> with<00:02:16.660> a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
because I'm looking for something with a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.170 
because I'm looking for something with a
bit<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.200> time-release<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.340> as<00:02:18.490> opposed

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
bit of a time-release to it as opposed

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.610 
bit of a time-release to it as opposed
to<00:02:19.300> just<00:02:19.450> throwing<00:02:19.660> on<00:02:19.840> urea<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.230> having<00:02:20.500> it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
to just throwing on urea and having it

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.250 
to just throwing on urea and having it
having<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.720> go<00:02:22.720> into<00:02:22.870> solution<00:02:23.170> too<00:02:23.680> quickly<00:02:23.920> I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
having it go into solution too quickly I

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.610 
having it go into solution too quickly I
also<00:02:26.260> use<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:27.010> veg<00:02:27.870> specifically<00:02:28.870> because<00:02:29.110> I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
also use the veg specifically because I

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.650 
also use the veg specifically because I
don't<00:02:29.980> take<00:02:30.190> land<00:02:30.430> out<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.640> production<00:02:30.790> for<00:02:31.570> an

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
don't take land out of production for an

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.080 
don't take land out of production for an
entire<00:02:31.990> growing<00:02:32.440> season<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.550> I'm<00:02:33.670> trying<00:02:34.000> to

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
entire growing season so I'm trying to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.230 
entire growing season so I'm trying to
have<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.870> cover<00:02:35.140> crop<00:02:35.350> on<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.830> land<00:02:36.240> basically

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
have a cover crop on the land basically

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.540 
have a cover crop on the land basically
all<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.960> time<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.410> there's<00:02:38.590> not<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.800> there's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
all the time that there's not a there's

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.800 
all the time that there's not a there's
not<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> cash<00:02:40.000> crop<00:02:40.240> on<00:02:40.480> there

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
not a cash crop on there

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.310

to the acre the 30 pound rate gives a

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.710 
to the acre the 30 pound rate gives a
real<00:02:47.890> nice<00:02:48.100> stand<00:02:48.490> but<00:02:49.030> some<00:02:49.240> years<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.600> veg

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
real nice stand but some years the veg

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.780 
real nice stand but some years the veg
seed<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:50.020> very<00:02:50.080> expensive<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.920> sometimes<00:02:51.700> I

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.580 
seed is very expensive and sometimes I
just<00:02:51.940> economize<00:02:52.420> by<00:02:52.630> cutting<00:02:52.960> back<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.380> rate

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
just economize by cutting back to a rate
