aggressive<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.780> looked<00:02:40.959> like<00:02:41.049> he<00:02:41.350> planned

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
aggressive so it looked like he planned

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.009 
aggressive so it looked like he planned
anything<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.579> think<00:02:42.640> that's<00:02:43.120> why<00:02:43.299> yes<00:02:43.630> he<00:02:43.780> can

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
anything I think that's why yes he can

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.690 
anything I think that's why yes he can
run<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.590> he<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.680> physical<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.400> reason

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
run and he is physical and the reason

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.759 
run and he is physical and the reason
they<00:02:45.790> did<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.090> because<00:02:46.350> Marvin<00:02:47.350> Lewis<00:02:47.560> is

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
they did is because Marvin Lewis is

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.590 
they did is because Marvin Lewis is
thinking<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.430> think<00:02:48.670> coaches<00:02:49.299> every<00:02:49.450> man

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
thinking and I think coaches every man

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.060 
thinking and I think coaches every man
is<00:02:49.690> thinking<00:02:49.810> outside<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.230> box<00:02:50.470> up<00:02:50.680> like<00:02:50.859> look
