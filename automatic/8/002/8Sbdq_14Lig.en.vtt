you guys to find a tough start a little

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.049 
you guys to find a tough start a little
bit<00:00:48.690> differently<00:00:48.989> than<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.320> he<00:00:50.309> was<00:00:50.760> giving

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
bit differently than I do he was giving

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.590 
bit differently than I do he was giving
us<00:00:51.180> some<00:00:51.329> good<00:00:51.480> minutes<00:00:51.680> I<00:00:52.910> just<00:00:53.910> want<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.270> see

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
us some good minutes I just want to see

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.260 
us some good minutes I just want to see
him<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.039> thought<00:00:56.640> when<00:00:56.879> he<00:00:56.910> was

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
him and I do I thought when he was

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.569 
him and I do I thought when he was
suspended<00:00:57.930> that's<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.469> kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.309> went<00:00:59.460> off

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
suspended that's when kind of went off

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.889 
suspended that's when kind of went off
the<00:00:59.789> rails<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.210> little<00:01:00.239> bit<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.690> him<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.870> think

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the rails a little bit with him I think

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.170 
the rails a little bit with him I think
he<00:01:01.140> lost<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:01.559> confidence<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.820> took<00:01:03.030> him

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
he lost a little confidence it took him

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.490 
he lost a little confidence it took him
a<00:01:03.239> little<00:01:03.359> bit<00:01:03.539> longer<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.140> his<00:01:04.260> timing

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
a little bit longer to get his timing

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.000 
a little bit longer to get his timing
back<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:05.159> he<00:01:05.549> he<00:01:05.970> wanted<00:01:06.450> when<00:01:06.570> he<00:01:06.630> came<00:01:06.900> back

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
back then he he wanted when he came back

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.700 
back then he he wanted when he came back
and<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.580> think<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:08.939> built<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.689> him<00:01:09.869> he

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
and I think it just built up on him he

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.940 
and I think it just built up on him he
still<00:01:10.979> did<00:01:11.159> some<00:01:11.340> good<00:01:11.490> things<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:12.030> us<00:01:12.950> we

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
still did some good things for us we

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.649 
still did some good things for us we
want<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> try<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.760> him<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:14.970> situations

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
want to try to get him in situations

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.080 
want to try to get him in situations
especially<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.799> long<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.340> he's<00:01:17.460> been<00:01:17.640> out<00:01:17.790> into

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
especially as long as he's been out into

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.780 
especially as long as he's been out into
areas<00:01:18.420> where<00:01:18.450> he<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.869> succeed<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.580> him

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
areas where he can succeed and get him

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.300 
areas where he can succeed and get him
straight<00:01:21.090> mentally<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.710> hopefully

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
straight mentally and and hopefully

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.560 
straight mentally and and hopefully
it'll<00:01:23.460> grow<00:01:23.610> from<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:23.939> they<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.450> get

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it'll grow from there they like to get

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.190 
it'll grow from there they like to get
them<00:01:24.659> back<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:25.140> garish<00:01:26.689> I'm<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.900> sure<00:01:28.080> if

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
