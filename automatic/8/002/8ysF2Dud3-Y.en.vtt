00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.200 
baseline and nadal's balls were falling
short<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> they<00:02:02.009> were<00:02:02.100> kicking<00:02:02.399> up<00:02:02.490> high<00:02:02.670> well

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.700 
at 64 that's right in sir dueling's
wheelhouse<00:02:06.030> that's<00:02:06.479> exactly<00:02:06.960> where<00:02:07.229> he<00:02:07.380> wants

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
wheelhouse that's exactly where he wants

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.309 
wheelhouse that's exactly where he wants
it<00:02:07.770> that's<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.069> batting<00:02:08.550> practice<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.209> him

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
it that's like batting practice for him

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.250 
it that's like batting practice for him
so<00:02:10.319> he<00:02:10.709> was<00:02:11.459> hitting<00:02:12.300> his<00:02:12.450> flat<00:02:12.720> balls<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
so he was hitting his flat balls and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.820 
so he was hitting his flat balls and
because<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> balls

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
because the balls

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.410 
because the balls
I<00:02:13.860> over<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.130> net<00:02:14.370> he<00:02:14.820> doesn't<00:02:15.120> need<00:02:15.180> as<00:02:15.330> much

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
I over the net he doesn't need as much

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.900 
I over the net he doesn't need as much
topspin<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.320> get<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> ball<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.490> drop<00:02:17.670> down

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
topspin to get the ball to drop down

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.790 
topspin to get the ball to drop down
into<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.270> court<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:18.840> he<00:02:18.990> really<00:02:19.440> could<00:02:19.650> go

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
into the court so he really could go

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.470 
into the court so he really could go
after<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.310> ball<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.060> saw<00:02:21.240> that's

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
down the line it's not a great shot so

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.199 
down the line it's not a great shot so
now<00:03:33.870> Nadal<00:03:34.290> has<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:35.010> cross-court<00:03:35.970> backhand

that he can either hit for a winner or

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.370 
that he can either hit for a winner or
he<00:03:38.640> can<00:03:38.730> hit<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:38.940> take<00:03:39.269> complete<00:03:39.690> control<00:03:39.930> of

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
he can hit to take complete control of

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.160 
he can hit to take complete control of
the<00:03:40.470> point<00:03:41.190> but<00:03:42.030> instead<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:42.360> doing<00:03:42.480> either<00:03:42.810> he

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
the point but instead of doing either he

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.440 
the point but instead of doing either he
dumps<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.680> shot<00:03:43.980> in<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.370> net<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.269> just

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
dumps that shot in the net and I just

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.850 
dumps that shot in the net and I just
thought<00:03:45.540> when<00:03:45.959> was<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.140> last<00:03:46.260> time<00:03:46.410> you

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
thought when was the last time you

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.160 
thought when was the last time you
remember<00:03:47.010> an<00:03:47.670> adult<00:03:48.060> missing<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.600> shot<00:03:48.840> like

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
remember an adult missing a shot like

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.500 
remember an adult missing a shot like
that<00:03:49.230> normally<00:03:50.160> you<00:03:50.250> expect<00:03:50.580> him<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:51.480> make

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
that normally you expect him to make

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.560 
that normally you expect him to make
that<00:03:51.690> 10<00:03:52.590> out<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.769> 10<00:03:53.010> times<00:03:53.340> but<00:03:53.730> he<00:03:53.880> missed<00:03:54.390> it

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
that 10 out of 10 times but he missed it

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.360 
that 10 out of 10 times but he missed it
and<00:03:54.750> again<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.650> just<00:03:55.830> said<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.070> me<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.250> know

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
and again that just said to me you know

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.479 
and again that just said to me you know
this<00:03:56.610> guy<00:03:56.790> just<00:03:57.450> doesn't<00:03:57.750> have<00:03:58.170> his<00:03:58.350> a-game<00:03:58.620> so

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
this guy just doesn't have his a-game so

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.130 
this guy just doesn't have his a-game so
the<00:03:59.670> match<00:03:59.820> really<00:04:00.180> wasn't<00:04:00.480> more<00:04:00.600> complicated

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
the match really wasn't more complicated

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.110 
the match really wasn't more complicated
than<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.440> following<00:04:01.890> three<00:04:02.100> things<00:04:02.340> first

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
than the following three things first

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.470

winning the next three sets pulling it
out<00:05:07.320> in<00:05:07.560> five<00:05:08.330> well<00:05:09.680> you<00:05:10.680> could<00:05:10.800> argue<00:05:11.010> that

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
out in five well you could argue that

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.850

Federer<00:05:12.450> has<00:05:12.510> an<00:05:12.900> enormous<00:05:13.260> amount<00:05:13.770> of

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
Federer has an enormous amount of

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.370 
Federer has an enormous amount of
pressure<00:05:14.070> on<00:05:14.490> his<00:05:14.700> shoulders<00:05:15.180> now<00:05:15.930> more<00:05:16.320> than

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
pressure on his shoulders now more than

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.410 
pressure on his shoulders now more than
many<00:05:17.160> of<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.340> past<00:05:17.610> tournaments<00:05:18.090> he's<00:05:18.180> played

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
many of the past tournaments he's played

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.990 
many of the past tournaments he's played
even<00:05:18.690> in<00:05:18.780> Grand<00:05:19.050> Slams<00:05:19.440> because<00:05:19.980> if<00:05:20.250> he<00:05:20.790> wins

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
even in Grand Slams because if he wins

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.150 
even in Grand Slams because if he wins
the<00:05:21.150> French<00:05:21.390> Open<00:05:21.570> now<00:05:21.900> he's<00:05:22.620> probably<00:05:22.890> gonna

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
the French Open now he's probably gonna

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160 
the French Open now he's probably gonna
be<00:05:23.310> crowned<00:05:23.640> the<00:05:23.910> greatest<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.480> all<00:05:24.600> time<00:05:24.840> the

be crowned the greatest of all time the

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.210 
be crowned the greatest of all time the
goat<00:05:25.500> but<00:05:26.460> if<00:05:26.550> he<00:05:26.670> loses<00:05:27.050> he<00:05:28.050> becomes<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.830> guy

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
goat but if he loses he becomes the guy

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.550 
goat but if he loses he becomes the guy
who<00:05:29.280> couldn't<00:05:29.820> step<00:05:30.270> up<00:05:30.510> in<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:31.290> pressure

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
who couldn't step up in the pressure

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.600 
who couldn't step up in the pressure
situation<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:33.200> take<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.440> mantle<00:05:34.740> as<00:05:35.190> the

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
situation and take that mantle as the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.190 
situation and take that mantle as the
greatest<00:05:35.850> player<00:05:36.150> of<00:05:36.180> all<00:05:36.570> time<00:05:36.600> so<00:05:37.020> that's

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
greatest player of all time so that's

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.800 
greatest player of all time so that's
that's<00:05:37.350> a<00:05:37.530> that's<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:38.010> pretty<00:05:38.850> tall<00:05:39.180> order<00:05:39.240> at

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
that's a that's a pretty tall order at

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.290 
that's a that's a pretty tall order at
least<00:05:40.020> pressure-wise<00:05:41.060> expectations<00:05:42.060> wise

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
least pressure-wise expectations wise

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.290 
least pressure-wise expectations wise
and<00:05:42.720> you<00:05:43.710> could<00:05:43.860> see<00:05:44.100> his<00:05:44.580> play<00:05:44.820> was<00:05:44.970> a<00:05:45.060> little

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
and you could see his play was a little

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.580 
and you could see his play was a little
bit<00:05:45.420> inconsistent<00:05:45.900> maybe<00:05:46.230> he<00:05:46.410> was<00:05:46.560> thinking

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
bit inconsistent maybe he was thinking

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.420 
bit inconsistent maybe he was thinking
about<00:05:46.980> that<00:05:47.160> when<00:05:47.940> he<00:05:48.150> was<00:05:48.390> playing<00:05:48.630> Haas<00:05:49.430> but

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
about that when he was playing Haas but

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.760 
about that when he was playing Haas but
he<00:05:50.490> has<00:05:50.640> been<00:05:50.850> inconsistent<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:52.170> entire

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
he has been inconsistent the entire

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.980 
he has been inconsistent the entire
tournament<00:05:53.180> so<00:05:54.180> it'll<00:05:54.510> be<00:05:54.540> interesting<00:05:54.630> to

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
tournament so it'll be interesting to

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.650 
tournament so it'll be interesting to
watch<00:05:55.140> you<00:05:55.290> play<00:05:55.320> small<00:05:55.710> fee<00:05:56.010> tomorrow

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
watch you play small fee tomorrow

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.240 
watch you play small fee tomorrow
Federer<00:05:57.660> should<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.320> my<00:05:58.500> opinion<00:05:58.860> Federer

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
Federer should in my opinion Federer

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.770 
Federer should in my opinion Federer
should<00:05:59.430> win<00:05:59.610> this<00:05:59.730> tournament<00:06:00.000> unless<00:06:00.570> he

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
should win this tournament unless he

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.600 
should win this tournament unless he
lets<00:06:00.930> his<00:06:01.140> head<00:06:01.320> get<00:06:01.500> in<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.740> way<00:06:01.890> because

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
lets his head get in the way because

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.080 
lets his head get in the way because
there's<00:06:03.120> not<00:06:03.270> really<00:06:03.600> a<00:06:03.720> guy<00:06:04.020> that<00:06:05.090> threatens

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
there's not really a guy that threatens

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.450 
there's not really a guy that threatens
him<00:06:06.420> if<00:06:06.690> Federer<00:06:07.590> was<00:06:07.680> playing<00:06:07.920> his<00:06:08.040> best<00:06:08.190> and

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
him if Federer was playing his best and

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.770 
him if Federer was playing his best and
the<00:06:08.550> other<00:06:08.730> guys<00:06:08.880> playing<00:06:09.180> his<00:06:09.300> best<00:06:09.420> Federer

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
the other guys playing his best Federer

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.840 
the other guys playing his best Federer
should<00:06:09.960> win<00:06:10.140> pretty<00:06:10.770> much<00:06:10.920> ten<00:06:11.370> times<00:06:11.580> out<00:06:11.820> of

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
should win pretty much ten times out of

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.120 
should win pretty much ten times out of
ten<00:06:12.090> so<00:06:12.720> this<00:06:12.990> is<00:06:13.020> now<00:06:13.230> federer's<00:06:13.710> tournament

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
ten so this is now federer's tournament

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.710 
ten so this is now federer's tournament
to<00:06:14.220> lose<00:06:14.400> it<00:06:14.550> will<00:06:14.640> be<00:06:14.700> real<00:06:14.970> interesting<00:06:15.570> to

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
to lose it will be real interesting to

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.200 
to lose it will be real interesting to
watch<00:06:15.900> a<00:06:16.290> lot<00:06:16.980> of<00:06:17.040> pressure<00:06:17.370> on<00:06:17.490> his<00:06:17.730> shoulders

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
watch a lot of pressure on his shoulders

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.910 
watch a lot of pressure on his shoulders
but<00:06:18.420> I'm<00:06:18.540> really<00:06:18.780> looking<00:06:19.140> forward<00:06:19.170> to<00:06:19.740> the

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
but I'm really looking forward to the

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.320 
but I'm really looking forward to the
rest<00:06:20.100> of<00:06:20.250> this<00:06:20.340> week<00:06:20.580> and<00:06:20.820> then<00:06:20.970> into<00:06:21.240> the

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
rest of this week and then into the

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.260
