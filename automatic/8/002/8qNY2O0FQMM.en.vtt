00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.290
 Hello everyone, simple Alexander 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.179
 lead project risk view and with us 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.670
 dmitry dmitry 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.220
 works in google and he has with him 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.630
 secret development we are nothing here 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 do not advertise 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.109
 not trying to promote anyone not 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.689
 tell a startup and just show 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.640
 and interesting ideas for predators and I 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.750
 I think that many who have heard about the topic 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.230
 oculus rift 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.020
 here and here we have another how 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.739
 concept more precisely, the concept is the same but different 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.540
 performance 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.280
 if it's not difficult for you and tell 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 please show it on the product 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.010
 you with a product called cardboard 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.449
 something like oculus rift 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 generally much cheaper and much easier 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.809
 which is inserted into some piece 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.640
 cardboard 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.680
 development is a secret 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.710
 all the information is completely up to this complicated 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.940
 product can be found in google by food 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.390
 According to google cardboard 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.610
 and how it works works very simply 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.400
 it means there is a phone 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.320
 the screen is divided into 2 parts 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.170
 image is shown for left for 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.170
 the right eye of the carton itself is two 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.509
 the lenses themselves which are probably the most 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.409
 complex component in this is all 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.330
 closes 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.670
 we get virtual 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.390
 reality is impression in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.939
 principle 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.630
 exactly the same what about here 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.770
 among but this is probably still a little bit 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.340
 simpler but very similar, that is, if as 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.290
 would be very affordable how much does it cost well i don't 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.270
 I know at all whether it is to sell them 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.270
 sell a third-party company that is all 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.720
 how would specifications in the heart of the drawings pdf 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.180
 Kimani us available on google and but 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.670
 Many, as it were, skillful people already take this 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.369
 how to sell this at $ 25 30 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.140
 all, that is, you put your phone 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.650
 download and the joke and the name 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.200
 apple kumho 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.090
 icook is called cardboard for playstore and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.430
 it works but as I understand it only on 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.750
 Android because playstore then under android 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.510
 he has dives on him 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.370
 alternative people 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.010
 alternative when coughing and who 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.540
 Does this at all some 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.760
 separate unit or just was 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.580
 the idea was thrown out 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.380
 some two people from google pskov 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.810
 all in paris is like all interest 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.520
 the project and actually from that moment on 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.990
 here is the beginning for the first time it showed on 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.270
 google ate at the end of june a month ago wow 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.850
 and actually now it's all like 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.000
 actively developing that is essentially it 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.430
 we are at the forefront of technology and technology 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.740
 generally available and actually possible for 25 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.300
 dollars thanks google to this with 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.590
 more accessible because all 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.140
 rushed to do such things 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.180
 and what is already interesting let's say what 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.680
 applications that you can already see and 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.900
 run there is one official 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 the app sticks in a cardboard in it like 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.950
 there would be several different damage there street 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.430
 view YouTube virtual virtual world with 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.019
 virtual mouse in that spirit when I 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.360
 was on the presentation about the font 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.330
 showed all sorts of shooters there showed 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.690
 virtual 3d house that is such here 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.180
 there is nothing well in duckweed hardly 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.250
 that is, but in principle the technology is so 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.080
 you can also keep the sensors going to 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.690
 legs to your hands and go there for a walk 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.870
 virtual some room well, no one 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.000
 doesn't limit anyone to do anything 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.280
 This idea is that as if this all 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.290
 there are phones assembled from cardboard this 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.680
 body is very easy to take and something 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.870
 get and where to order lenses in 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.080
 Internet, that is, you can really take 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.580
 there cardboard tool and there you can yes yes yes 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.780
 yes yes yes yes you can buy a separate lens 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.760
 you can buy everything else 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.710
 You can do the whole lens there yourself 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.900
 not sure how to do it but 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.920
 listen well the whole project is completely windows 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.800
 actually everything is open 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.890
 well, and besides the main 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.390
 tiled corr board is still under 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.890
 the ultimate who work just you 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.940
 could of course have this web page 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.820
 which people lived like draws such 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.440
 time cool thank you hear something else 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.480
 interesting want to add on this 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.820
 product can be follow your ideas 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.410
 there yes, I probably told the whole 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.770
 everything else is probably on the site 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.870
 can be viewed without access problems 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.640
 find very give all who watched 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.560
 everybody really likes the last time you 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.220
 showed him a week ago nasty graph 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.510
 a project that means you can do something 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.700
 have 20 percent of the time you can 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.560
 dedicate to a project that interests you 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.560
 we can start something principle yourself 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.030
 do and how sometimes from these projects 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.700
 it turns out something interesting by brand 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.890
 lw as 20 or even mail as 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.510
 20 percent project a lot 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.270
 such famous products they started 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.820
 from corr board this is like the last york 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.860
 that is, google and there is a real 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.660
 Such a chip that 20 percent of the worker 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.850
 you can devote time to development 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.650
 its some kind of project so well in 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.430
 principle yes if you really want something 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.980
 this and this here appeared as 20 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.930
 project percentage the project did not sink the French 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:21.110
 google google from paris office 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:24.830
 good at 11 percent but he is like 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:29.000
 floor 3 would be three -dimensional rendering i'm not 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.030
 I know with them I am cruel cruel 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.950
 sister affect this conference 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.520
 on the booth there is generally up to a hundred total 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:40.690
 program conferences on schedule this 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.979
 as there is generally Denmark and I even 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.240
 conference itself not found treasure 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.220
 nowhere else I only 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:52.680
 that is, there is actually rented 3d 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:06:02.520
 graphics let's click on the button which 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:05.259
 right the other side down and up to 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:14.349
 the last studs to taste and how 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:16.720
 this can be closer to everything 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.509
 drop dead simple and now filled 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.849
 the phone is even better than by the way here 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.180
 for some reason, many people say this about the first 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:26.919
 here pixy I killed various sexifications 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.880
 well actually just in the first one in the rat 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:35.009
 in those there excel then you can see the second hall here 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:38.469
 the screen is just better like a phone but 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.949
 cool super listen thank you very much for 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:43.090
 information we will carry to the masses here I am 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:45.009
 really awesome product 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.830
 thank you guys from google for that 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:52.020
 make technology accessible to people 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.020
 always please everyone bye
