you just kind of have that point
understand<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> gravity<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.200> question

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
understand the gravity of the question

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.560 
understand the gravity of the question
and<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.310> start<00:01:29.549> analyzing<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.390> life

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
here is to put a bit more gravity and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.319 
here is to put a bit more gravity and
seriousness<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.950> question<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.729> example

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
seriousness in this question for example

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.969 
seriousness in this question for example
if<00:01:45.420> somebody<00:01:45.689> were<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.899> join<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> live<00:01:46.530> stream

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
if somebody were to join the live stream

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.069 
if somebody were to join the live stream
where<00:01:47.280> I'm<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> giggly<00:01:48.360> mood<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.750> trying<00:01:48.960> to

ocean of jelly that bounces the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.679 
ocean of jelly that bounces the
hippopotamus<00:02:05.369> back<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> airplane<00:02:06.479> that

he<00:02:06.780> jumped<00:02:06.990> off<00:02:07.140> from<00:02:07.409> that's<00:02:07.920> what<00:02:08.429> makes<00:02:08.670> me

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
he jumped off from that's what makes me
