00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:11.379
 very good guys how are you this is the 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.449
 pd first video about since 2015 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.570
 there are going to be several news 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:19.690
 but this time it 's about a 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.380
 wish list or things we want that 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.810
 be in the next fish 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.720
 to start let's talk about the rain 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.060
 and the snow 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.540
 we want it to be there that you see that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.540
 It's raining and snowing but in addition to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.850
 this that affects the ball and the field 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.980
 of game not just look 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.610
 graphically rain or snow 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.879
 another thing is the law of advantage that 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.079
 Arrange the referees since we 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.719
 Hello 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.059
 or the machine when giving a strong kick 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.519
 well, it correctly gives the law of 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.570
 advantage if you keep having the ball 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:05.770
 but at the end it nothing happens no 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.789
 there is a warning that I should do 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.460
 continuing with the list we have the editor 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.340
 of stadiums it would be important that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.789
 came back as he was in 2012 and in the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 2013 since there are very few now 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.630
 true in this version 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.520
 we would like to have them for our 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.310
 favorite teams of the league 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.820
 and have the most similar possible 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.820
 an important thing that was even 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.110
 in the fish 2009 it seems to me is the dynamic 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.299
 of changes we want it not to be so 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.490
 tedious or rather so hard to 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.000
 select the strategy and see what 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.149
 player let's change do all those 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.070
 steps but simply hit a button 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:59.380
 either to select and choose the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.689
 ilas player of the alignment and 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.350
 select the one of the replacement so 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.360
 simple would be a very important point that 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.080
 konami must fix 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.840
 in addition to the goalkeeper animations a 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.480
 example where too many are missing 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.250
 animations or at least 5 more s in the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.500
 hand to hand 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.120
 is a goalie always beat for a 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.030
 side or if thrown never clogged 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.570
 truth is always very difficult that the 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.620
 goalkeeper looks or looks good in such 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.560
 situation so it's an important thing 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.900
 that we must also take into account for 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.959
 the next version 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.260
 Also, go back to the face editor 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:51.530
 but with the import of an image 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.379
 as well as those of konami with a texture 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.079
 of the face to import and so the 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:01.040
 like it will be better than changing it in the 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:03.950
 parameters in in the internal editor 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.730
 we would also like to see more schedules 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.400
 matches even here see three in 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.730
 this version we have two afternoon and evening 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.950
 who will see the middle one sunset will 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.349
 not just day and night but a 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.540
 sunset and that of course will be noticed 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:24.280
 in the stadium that you see there the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.660
 difference between schedules 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.270
 Y 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.470
 something important to add are the 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.890
 shots should improve it now come out if not 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:40.050
 very fast but not effective we need 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:43.660
 that are similar to the 2013 alps 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.830
 can take that model and implement it 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.400
 in the fish 2015 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.700
 an important thing for me is the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.710
 selection of uniform for goalkeepers if 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.390
 well we choose the uniforms 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.420
 for the players so that they do not 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.870
 appear during the match but already 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.480
 being in this we noticed that it 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.690
 they seem too much of the players already 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.560
 sometimes we get confused or just do not 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.980
 It looks good during the game and it's something 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.769
 what should konami take into account already 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.530
 there were past ones, and this must 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.660
 back to the next 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.330
 the comments should also be 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.500
 adjusted there must be much more 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.050
 comments about statistics or 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.560
 players talk about them so 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.650
 less since if we notice we put ourselves to 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.400
 investigate a little are the same 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:46.850
 Comments ideas from previous fish 15 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.210
 at least so it is already necessary that 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:54.590
 more comments are adjusted or added 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.930
 or stories to the next fish for now 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.570
 this is all I'm not going to talk about 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.270
 improvement of the league master since that is 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.360
 another important topic would take another video 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.520
 but if you have something that you would like 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.780
 see in the next one you can leave it here in 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.169
 the comments 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.620
 so that konami see that the fans 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.230
 they need other things and can take them 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.790
 into account for the next version 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.210
 this is all guys see you in the 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.210
 next
