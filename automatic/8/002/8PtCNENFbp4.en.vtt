 call to find out if they are doing your 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.240
 good pc I will say this by point it 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.940
 They have to check personal files that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.710
 people that are having people 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.510
 which is being created are two 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.850
 those pinches options to not crack 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.769
 in any just look for information from 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.140
 adventure without being detected you do not have 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.970
 a lot to worry about crater your 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 goal is to destroy information and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.079
 destroy operating systems without reason 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.390
 some revenge on that kind of thing 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.399
 you must act fast signals to be 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.700
 sure that they are doing you not only 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.079
 the pc if you lose important files 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.450
 often in some kind of music 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.640
 photos documents or certain messages from 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.590
 email appear as life 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.629
 makes sure of barbados and changes the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.730
 configurations in your equipment for cinemas 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.860
 where you have sources of information 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.230
 significant funds as stores 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.670
 blisters social networks bookmarks 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.480
 social 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.480
 different 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.200
 then to work for you but the same with 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 all your options are sometimes disabled 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.800
 the most important 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.020
 download some registry cleaner 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.570
 to make your PC faster and more functional 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.360
 and analyze your pc with this have a good 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.010
 analysis sometimes takes a few are paid 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.930
 others do not choose the one you can most 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.120
 access you must also have a 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.430
 visible imac to be changing your and 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.860
 while you browse the internet and change 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.810
 you and through you with you as you say of the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.760
 melaka ad you put types of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.040
 frequent attacks the main one is the 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.140
 devil and when they connect to your pc with 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.090
 just know tweet if the one that is you 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.070
 attacking your level will be very easy 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.560
 get rid of it simply with having 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.130
 an antivirus like cardboard odst smart 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.380
 security 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.570
 but good another type of attacks by 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.880
 remote control devices I know that 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.680
 It can be done in two ways by making a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.870
 file goes fast from this kind of 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.730
 install it personally on your pc in 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.680
 somewhere hidden are sometimes in 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.410
 formats that easily pass in the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.480
 point plus point mp3 etcetera you have to 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.610
 dismiss it quickly with an analysis of 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.530
 type and erase the second type is very 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.540
 similar when by means 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.400
 of the same but this one would have to be 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.340
 always connected so better two 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.590
 devices safely the program 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.410
 which analyzes these go insert them to the pc 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.060
 recommended if it was never exposed 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.400
 may the device that gives access 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.440
 remote is in a virtual drive the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.540
 team you can add or remove units 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.580
 virtual with many programs seeks the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.620
 more similar not be difficult 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.720
 ready you know you are being seen in 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.940
 This time he showed how to know if they are 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.130
 creating had some options to grow 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.019
 then load with the information of 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.820
 Expected comment while city 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.820
