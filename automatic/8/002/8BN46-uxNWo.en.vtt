easily for us we used the combination of
we<00:03:12.629> actually<00:03:12.989> didn't<00:03:13.609> exactly<00:03:14.609> use<00:03:14.909> a<00:03:15.480> direct

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.979 
combination if it was my opinion I would
say<00:03:20.040> use<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.340> water<00:03:20.549> dragon<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.510> energy

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
say use the water dragon and the energy

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.879 
say use the water dragon and the energy
dragon<00:03:22.440> if<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.620> want<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.889> get<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.099> dragon

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
but in the combination we actually use

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.970 
but in the combination we actually use
something<00:03:27.780> else<00:03:28.019> we're<00:03:28.319> actually<00:03:28.530> looking

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.589 
so that's what I have to go by I mean I
can't<00:04:00.659> breathe<00:04:00.959> again<00:04:01.199> all<00:04:01.949> right<00:04:02.040> up<00:04:02.310> next

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
can't breathe again all right up next

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.550 
can't breathe again all right up next
hatching<00:04:03.599> time<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:03.810> think<00:04:03.989> we<00:04:04.199> should<00:04:04.379> take<00:04:04.500> a

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
hatching time I think we should take a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.960 
hatching time I think we should take a
look<00:04:04.799> at<00:04:04.949> the<00:04:05.069> hatch<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.579> think<00:04:05.879> the

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
look at the hatch and I think the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.270 
look at the hatch and I think the
hatching<00:04:06.389> time<00:04:06.599> is<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.139> time<00:04:07.379> it<00:04:07.680> might<00:04:07.859> be<00:04:08.129> or

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
hatching time is the time it might be or

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.879 
hatching time is the time it might be or
but<00:04:08.549> it's<00:04:09.000> 9<00:04:09.299> hours<00:04:09.659> and<00:04:09.900> 3<00:04:10.290> minutes<00:04:10.319> I<00:04:10.739> don't

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
but it's 9 hours and 3 minutes I don't

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.379 
but it's 9 hours and 3 minutes I don't
get<00:04:11.099> how<00:04:11.280> where<00:04:11.459> did<00:04:11.549> they<00:04:11.609> get<00:04:11.819> these<00:04:12.090> things

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
get how where did they get these things

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.750 
get how where did they get these things
nine<00:04:12.840> hours<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.530> three<00:04:13.859> minutes<00:04:13.889> usually

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
nine hours and three minutes usually

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.379 
nine hours and three minutes usually
it's<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.479> most<00:04:15.659> likely<00:04:16.109> like<00:04:16.320> hey<00:04:18.109> you<00:04:19.109> know

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
it's the most likely like hey you know

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.600 
it's the most likely like hey you know
four<00:04:21.389> hours<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.900> 59<00:04:22.169> minutes<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.680> 59<00:04:23.010> seconds

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
four hours and 59 minutes and 59 seconds

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.580 
four hours and 59 minutes and 59 seconds
but<00:04:23.760> nine<00:04:24.330> hour<00:04:24.539> and<00:04:24.750> three<00:04:24.990> minutes<00:04:25.020> is

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
but nine hour and three minutes is

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.110 
but nine hour and three minutes is
