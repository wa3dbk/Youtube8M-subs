00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.519
 tie to 2 between valencia and espanyol in 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.250
 the match of the 21st day of the league 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.230
 bbv all goals came in the 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.779
 first part and that is that the party started 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.850
 frantic with this detail with this 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.250
 Sergio García's heel that enabled 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.050
 to Córdoba for the Colombian to mark 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.920
 in the first approximation of Spanish 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.920
 one minute two 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.199
 we have repeated that wonderful heel 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.350
 of Sergio Garcia who signed a match 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.809
 excellent for the 0 to 1 of córdoba 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.699
 the Valencian reaction would arrive very 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.129
 I would soon arrive almost immediately 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.800
 with this inside pass from ever banega 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.420
 ending paco alcácer 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.430
 Espanyol footballers asked 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.370
 out of play at the possibility of 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.449
 jonas touch the ball before the 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.449
 auction of paco alcácer 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.020
 we see it again here there is no outside the 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.810
 game because it's clearly enabled 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.370
 the torrent footballer but here in 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.010
 if Jonas came to play the 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.110
 ball yes that would have position 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.800
 anti-regulation of the young attacker 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.800
 valencianista 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.140
 in this corner kick it would come 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.610
 2 to 1 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.800
 went up the valencià with jonas goal 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.710
 the Brazilian played 100 matches 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.110
 bind all with the picture shirt 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.110
 Che and not celebrate with a new goal 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.810
 it seemed that the game would go two to one 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.149
 at rest but just before passing 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.880
 by changing rooms I would have the possibility 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.409
 of espanyol to tie before this 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.390
 top of head of colotto that enters 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.390
 saved and jonas take out under sticks 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.780
 opportunity for valencia in this 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.590
 soft finish of paco alcácer el pase 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.590
 it was from piatti 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.359
 and more of the pit boys and with this 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.099
 launch full of dani's intention 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.459
 even that is about to surprise 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.459
 box 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.540
 and now if the action that would end 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.130
 translating into the new tie of the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.320
 espanyol in 2 to 2 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.350
 jeremy matthieu gets ahead 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.020
 jhon córdoba and fernández borbalán indicates 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.050
 penalty 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.370
 the repetition leaves no doubt about 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.900
 that kick out of jeremy mathieu 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.890
 Sergio García executes that puts her in the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.890
 angle in the square 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.670
 images of the second part with a 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.320
 Spanish that came out very well convinced of 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.300
 steal in the middle of the field and go out to 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.890
 kickback the first consideration 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.620
 after the break has it sergio garcía 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.750
 in a play in which the players 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.800
 of valencia claimed a hand in the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.800
 control of the captain of espanyol 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.230
 he also had possibilities 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.230
 Valencia 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.209
 in actions like this at the beginning it 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.760
 claim possible hand back the center 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.680
 from the left and in the continuation 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.220
 again a penalty is demanded by the hand of 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.220
 sources 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.420
 I could not believe the local fans after 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.070
 the center of joao pereira intercepted 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.250
 with the arm the former footballer of 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.250
 Cordova 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.480
 talking about Cordoba Cordoba was 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.660
 the player of espanyol who was more 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.060
 about 2 to 3 on this ride from 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.810
 the midfield defined too much 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.060
 crossed 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.500
 córdoba that would end up being replaced 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.500
 by álex fernández 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.489
 they also entered the final minutes 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.009
 raúl rodríguez and víctor álvarez for 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.110
 strengthen the defensive system of the real 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.610
 sports club espanyol in the 'valencia 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.229
 there were also changes one of them the one of 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.970
 michelle by banega el ex del levante 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.310
 was very close to dialing with this 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.199
 cross shot were also incorporated 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.030
 to the match men like dorlan pabón al 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.300
 final draw between Valencia and Valencia 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.300
 Spanish
