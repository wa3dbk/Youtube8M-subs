00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.399 
the dark matte pink and literally put
that<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.450> outer<00:01:39.659> corner<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> eye

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that in that outer corner of the eye

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
that in that outer corner of the eye
just<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.430> creates<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> little<00:01:42.030> bit<00:01:42.150> pro

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
just so it creates a little bit pro

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.380 
just so it creates a little bit pro
gradient<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.960> also<00:01:43.200> underneath<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.390> blend

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
gradient and also underneath and blend

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.810 
gradient and also underneath and blend
it<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.049> that's<00:01:46.439> pretty<00:01:46.829> much<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> entire<00:01:47.369> look

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it so that's pretty much the entire look

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.639 
it so that's pretty much the entire look
I'm<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.420> going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.570> take<00:01:48.689> strange<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.470> well

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
I'm just going to take strange as well

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.950 
I'm just going to take strange as well
and<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.490> put<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> inner<00:01:51.090> corner<00:01:51.450> but

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and to put that on the inner corner but

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.410 
and to put that on the inner corner but
it's<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.220> easy<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.820> look<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.210> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
it's so so easy to do this look and I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.999 
it's so so easy to do this look and I
think<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.810> looks<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.259> pretty<00:01:55.290> attached<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.829> my

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
think it looks so pretty attached to my

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.200 
think it looks so pretty attached to my
favorite<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> three<00:01:56.549> i'm<00:01:56.880> showing<00:01:57.149> you

like<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.840> quick

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.140 

this<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.500> I'm<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.100> take<00:02:05.250> burn<00:02:05.610> out<00:02:05.880> and

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
this one I'm going to take burn out and

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.330 
this one I'm going to take burn out and
just<00:02:06.240> brush<00:02:06.450> out<00:02:06.690> all<00:02:06.900> over<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.440> lid<00:02:07.620> I<00:02:07.890> also

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
think I put bars on top of it but some

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.310 
think I put bars on top of it but some
reason<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:11.460> not<00:02:11.640> recorded<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.630> then<00:02:13.200> I'm

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
reason that's not recorded and then I'm

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.110 
reason that's not recorded and then I'm
going<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.470> take<00:02:13.590> liar<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.580> put<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:14.880> on

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
going to take liar and just put that on

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.690 
going to take liar and just put that on
sort<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.420> outer<00:02:15.570> third<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.530> eye<00:02:16.560> I'm<00:02:17.400> just

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.040 
sort the outer third of the eye I'm just
really<00:02:17.910> annoying<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.210> camera<00:02:18.510> doesn't<00:02:18.720> quite

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
really annoying the camera doesn't quite

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.840
