week's ask Li this week's question comes
from<00:00:10.590> Joel<00:00:11.070> duck<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.670> Indiana<00:00:12.290> Lee<00:00:13.290> I'm<00:00:13.469> trying

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
from Joel duck in Indiana Lee I'm trying

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.650 
from Joel duck in Indiana Lee I'm trying
to<00:00:13.830> figure<00:00:13.980> out<00:00:14.190> how<00:00:14.370> much<00:00:14.519> protein<00:00:15.030> carbs<00:00:15.540> and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
to figure out how much protein carbs and

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.900 
to figure out how much protein carbs and
fat<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:15.990> should<00:00:16.379> eat<00:00:16.529> I've<00:00:17.100> been<00:00:17.340> told<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.820> it

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
fat I should eat I've been told that it

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.090 
fat I should eat I've been told that it
should<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.300> based<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.660> my<00:00:18.840> body<00:00:19.080> weight<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:20.039> I

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
should be based on my body weight but I

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.099 
should be based on my body weight but I
was<00:00:20.279> wondering<00:00:20.640> if<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.240> my<00:00:21.539> total<00:00:21.990> body

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
was wondering if this is my total body

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.839 
was wondering if this is my total body
weight<00:00:22.410> or<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:23.789> lean<00:00:24.240> body<00:00:24.840> mass<00:00:24.960> weight

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
weight or just my lean body mass weight

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.609 
weight or just my lean body mass weight
okay<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> calculate<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> number<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.960> grams<00:00:28.050> of

okay to calculate the number of grams of
protein<00:00:29.099> carbs<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.910> fat<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.510> need<00:00:30.689> for

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
protein carbs and fat you need for

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.340 
protein carbs and fat you need for
energy<00:00:31.170> expenditure<00:00:32.210> recovery<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.540> building

energy expenditure recovery and building
muscle<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.980> should<00:00:35.219> use<00:00:35.399> your<00:00:35.430> body<00:00:36.000> weight

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
muscle you should use your body weight

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.690

as<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.780> benchmark<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.559> reason<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
as the benchmark the reason for this is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.430 
as the benchmark the reason for this is
that<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.120> much<00:00:39.600> easier<00:00:39.629> than<00:00:40.230> trying

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that it's just much easier than trying

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.069 
that it's just much easier than trying
to<00:00:40.590> calculate<00:00:40.829> lean<00:00:41.370> body<00:00:41.610> mass<00:00:41.730> first<00:00:42.270> not<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
to calculate lean body mass first not to

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.350 
to calculate lean body mass first not to
mention<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> commonly<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.610> rules<00:00:45.090> of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
mention that the commonly use rules of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.660 
mention that the commonly use rules of
thumb<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:45.660> based<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.289> body<00:00:46.469> weight<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:47.640> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
thumb are based on body weight what I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.459 
thumb are based on body weight what I
recommend<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.600> gram<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.020> high-quality

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
recommend is one gram of high-quality

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.310 
recommend is one gram of high-quality
