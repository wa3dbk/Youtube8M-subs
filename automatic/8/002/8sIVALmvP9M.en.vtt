Kartik

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.740 
Kartik
he'd<00:02:02.219> do<00:02:02.340> stuff<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.270> wasn't<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
he'd do stuff like that it wasn't a

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.670 
he'd do stuff like that it wasn't a
smart<00:02:04.140> move<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.649> was<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> only<00:02:05.310> move<00:02:05.549> because

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
smart move it was the only move because

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.770 
smart move it was the only move because
Kansas<00:02:07.680> took<00:02:08.190> us<00:02:08.369> out<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.610> our<00:02:08.879> offense<00:02:09.209> we

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
Kansas took us out of our offense we

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.639 
Kansas took us out of our offense we

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
couldn't do anything

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.750 
couldn't do anything
so<00:02:11.569> we<00:02:12.569> were<00:02:12.720> forced<00:02:13.049> to<00:02:13.230> do<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.470> other<00:02:14.220> coaches

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so we were forced to do it other coaches

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.850

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
bad about but then I stopped we still

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.050 
bad about but then I stopped we still
got<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.890> see<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.070> hide<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.280> BYU<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.940> that

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
got to see the hide and BYU and that

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.270 
got to see the hide and BYU and that
kind<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.390> heat<00:02:39.840> kind<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.170> wondering<00:02:40.560> why<00:02:41.220> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
kind of heat kind of wondering why the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160 
kind of heat kind of wondering why the
practice<00:02:41.580> talking<00:02:41.970> about<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.480> but<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.840> think

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
practice talking about it but I think

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.510 
practice talking about it but I think
that<00:02:43.410> put<00:02:43.530> us<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.830> road<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.130> made<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> move

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
that put us on the road and made a move

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.160 
that put us on the road and made a move

back<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.620> table<00:02:46.920> maybe<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.220> was<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.430> lesson

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
back with table maybe I was the lesson

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.310 
back with table maybe I was the lesson
for<00:02:48.060> us<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:48.330> we<00:02:48.450> came<00:02:48.630> back<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.930> practice

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320

for us because we came back to practice
and<00:02:49.470> worked<00:02:49.620> hard<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:50.340> make<00:02:50.520> sure<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.910> know<00:02:51.000> it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
and worked hard to make sure you know it

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.760 
and worked hard to make sure you know it
wouldn't<00:02:51.210> be<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.360> coast<00:02:51.660> game<00:02:51.900> like<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.320> with<00:02:52.740> a

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
wouldn't be a coast game like it with a

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.230 
wouldn't be a coast game like it with a

when<00:02:59.040> they<00:02:59.130> won<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.460> all

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
when they won it all

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.000 
when they won it all
they<00:03:00.180> went<00:03:00.360> through<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.660> Midwest<00:03:01.110> along<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
they went through the Midwest along the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.850 
they went through the Midwest along the
way<00:03:02.160> they<00:03:02.340> beat<00:03:02.520> Kansas<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.150> Cincinnati

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
way they beat Kansas and Cincinnati

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.700 
way they beat Kansas and Cincinnati
Cincinnati<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:05.250> UTEP's<00:03:05.670> next<00:03:06.030> opponent<00:03:09.710> I

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
Cincinnati is UTEP's next opponent I

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.450 
Cincinnati is UTEP's next opponent I
think<00:03:11.990> good<00:03:12.990> defense<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.620> good<00:03:13.770> rebound<00:03:14.220> and

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
think good defense and good rebound and

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.880 
think good defense and good rebound and
we'll<00:03:14.550> overcome<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.240> fake<00:03:15.390> we<00:03:15.780> just<00:03:15.960> don't<00:03:16.140> we

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
we'll overcome and fake we just don't we

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
keep going system at it we know they

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.850 
keep going system at it we know they
have<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:20.970> great<00:03:21.450> guard<00:03:21.720> they<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.530> come<00:03:22.680> in

with<00:03:23.010> two<00:03:23.040> more<00:03:23.310> guards<00:03:23.820> they'll<00:03:24.030> running

with two more guards they'll running
team<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.840> will<00:03:25.320> probably<00:03:25.530> slow<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.890> pace

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
team it will probably slow the pace
