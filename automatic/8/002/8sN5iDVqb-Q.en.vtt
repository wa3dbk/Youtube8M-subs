00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.420
 hello this is maxim happy 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.600
 I want to show you work 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.449
 devices antibuks e-trac right now 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.019
 specifically got into ice captivity on 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.480
 the car 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:33.010
 here we have snow and ice under snow 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.100
 accordingly this configuration 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.380
 it will help us for the show through 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.090
 in all its glory as there is 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.650
 metal spikes which are especially 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:51.490
 effective on ice 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:54.640
 now check on the coil or bad so 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.480
 we get a small bag from the trunk 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.500
 the place does not take much 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.710
 accordingly, now let's see 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:13.150
 how easy can you assemble from 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:15.700
 these crayfish pancake so attention that I 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.360
 tuned spikes in a certain way here 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 there is a great opportunity to customize 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.610
 the length of the spikes on the first track I made them 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.340
 less so that through is easily delayed 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.370
 under the wheel she took subsequent lines 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.830
 their length 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.030
 everything can be adjusted so easy 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.030
 fit in the tape 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:58.280
 we put 3 tracks 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:02:02.210
 under the right wheel the left wheel can and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.539
 more that is if not like u 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.630
 me now it is a longer strip 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:13.160
 obstacles let's say so you can put and 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:17.420
 6 trucks or if you take 2 drops and two 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:25.930
 tapes of 6 crayfish it depends on 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:28.930
 conditions here also collected tape 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.930
 we fold 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.190
 so well, let 's check with god how much 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.040
 easy 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.390
 costs will help get out of the icy 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:51.830
 captivity so I do not strain 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:59.120
 easy to press the gas and see 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.120
 went easy and at ease 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:16.860
 so let's see what we have there is everything in 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:19.370
 okay yes okay tape whole spikes 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.370
 are whole 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:31.019
 shake them see they are flexible that is 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.459
 any shape i can we 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.760
 there is a stone here 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:41.750
 or the relief is uneven which is enough 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:45.989
 convenient but as you can see this is the device 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.090
 antibuks zetra which allowed me without 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.319
 outside help get out here 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:56.010
 such ice captivity and it is very 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:00.920
 great because carry such 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:04.410
 small and useful device in the trunk 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.670
 it means giving yourself confidence 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.889
 confidence that in case 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.319
 something on the road can happen you 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.859
 you can always without help 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:21.139
 easy to get out of a difficult situation thanks 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.139
