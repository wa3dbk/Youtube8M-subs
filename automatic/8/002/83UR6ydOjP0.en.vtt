I<00:01:59.549> get<00:01:59.850> into<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.119> thing<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.720> going<00:02:00.840> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
I get into the thing I'm just going to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.749 
I get into the thing I'm just going to
say<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.140> looks<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.649> hybrid<00:02:01.920> between<00:02:02.549> a

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
say it looks like a hybrid between a

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.920 
say it looks like a hybrid between a
model<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.750> game<00:02:03.899> has<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> model<00:02:04.439> fare<00:02:04.680> movement

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
model for game has a model fare movement

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.680 
model for game has a model fare movement

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
guns play style it has a battlefield

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.720 
guns play style it has a battlefield
like<00:02:10.170> destructible<00:02:10.890> environment<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.519> map

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
like destructible environment the map

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.900 
like destructible environment the map
settings<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.870> has<00:02:13.019> a<00:02:13.050> Treyarch<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:14.250> black

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
settings and it has a Treyarch a black

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.690 
settings and it has a Treyarch a black
ops<00:02:15.060> 2<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.569> black<00:02:15.870> ops<00:02:16.050> 3<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.349> like<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> point<00:02:17.459> like

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
ops 2 a black ops 3 of like a point like

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.729 
ops 2 a black ops 3 of like a point like
the<00:02:17.970> how<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.420> select<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.900> classes<00:02:19.170> like

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
the how you select the classes like

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.460 
the how you select the classes like
point<00:02:20.099> 10<00:02:20.280> system<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:21.030> stuff<00:02:21.630> like<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.080> so

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
point 10 system and stuff like that so

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.140 
point 10 system and stuff like that so
it<00:02:22.620> looks<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> hybrid<00:02:23.130> between<00:02:23.519> three

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
it looks like a hybrid between three

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.500 
it looks like a hybrid between three
games<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.769> it<00:02:25.769> hopefully<00:02:26.160> works<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.910> my

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
games so it hopefully works and my

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.789 
games so it hopefully works and my
opinion<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.959> think<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.350> going<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.560> be<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
opinion I think this is going to be the

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.680 
opinion I think this is going to be the
card<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.280> either<00:02:29.489> breaks<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.239> call<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.660> duty

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
card that either breaks the call of duty

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.259 
card that either breaks the call of duty
franchise<00:02:31.080> or<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.950> makes<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.549> so<00:02:32.910> people<00:02:33.060> have

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
franchise or a makes it so people have

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.550 
franchise or a makes it so people have
been<00:02:33.390> saying<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:33.750> been<00:02:34.019> dead<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> while

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
been saying it's been dead for a while

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.530 
been saying it's been dead for a while
but<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.130> don't<00:02:35.340> think<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> think<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.390> it

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
but I don't think so I think this is it

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.640 
but I don't think so I think this is it
if<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:36.750> been<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.049> same<00:02:37.230> as<00:02:37.410> these<00:02:37.470> other

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
if it's been the same as these other

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.530 
if it's been the same as these other
quads<00:02:37.950> then<00:02:38.519> it's<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:38.940> got<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> flop<00:02:39.420> and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
quads then it's it's got a flop and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.759 
quads then it's it's got a flop and
people<00:02:39.780> are<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.080> start<00:02:40.319> losing<00:02:40.470> hope<00:02:40.680> in

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
people are going to start losing hope in

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.350 
people are going to start losing hope in
the<00:02:40.890> game<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.730> franchise<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.269> the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
the game and the franchise and the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.259 
the game and the franchise and the
people<00:02:42.599> behind<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.470> developer<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
people behind the developer and the the

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.370 
people behind the developer and the the
developing<00:02:45.690> screen<00:02:45.930> really<00:02:46.230> not<00:02:46.349> a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
developing screen really not a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.009 
developing screen really not a
comfortable<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:47.400> yeah<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:48.239> could<00:02:48.510> fail<00:02:48.720> but

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
comfortable but yeah it could fail but

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.360 
comfortable but yeah it could fail but
you<00:02:49.080> then<00:02:49.290> again<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.590> could<00:02:49.769> be<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.950> really<00:02:50.190> good

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
you then again it could be a really good

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.539 
you then again it could be a really good
game<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.000> we're<00:02:51.269> just<00:02:51.299> gonna<00:02:51.510> have<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.750> wait

sleight-of-hand part maybe it got
renamed<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.500> sim<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.829> just<00:03:11.040> couldn't<00:03:11.489> find

renamed the sim if I just couldn't find
it<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.180> that's<00:03:12.810> cuz<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.019> wasn't<00:03:13.140> in<00:03:13.319> there<00:03:13.470> and

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
really pissed a pack but I don't think

really pissed a pack but I don't think
they<00:03:59.489> will<00:03:59.639> be<00:03:59.700> joking<00:04:00.120> or<00:04:00.209> because<00:04:00.389> they<00:04:00.540> have

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
they will be joking or because they have

dog people saying is gonna be

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.069 
dog people saying is gonna be
overpowered<00:04:14.730> but<00:04:14.849> I<00:04:15.030> don't<00:04:15.299> think<00:04:15.450> so<00:04:15.569> if<00:04:15.719> you

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
overpowered but I don't think so if you

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.990 
overpowered but I don't think so if you
look<00:04:16.259> at<00:04:16.410> how<00:04:16.709> easy<00:04:16.949> is<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.160> kill<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.459> dog<00:04:17.729> in

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
look at how easy is to kill a dog in

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.930 
look at how easy is to kill a dog in
black<00:04:18.690> ops<00:04:18.870> 2<00:04:18.959> then<00:04:19.620> you're<00:04:20.280> just<00:04:20.400> eating<00:04:20.729> with

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
black ops 2 then you're just eating with

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.870 
black ops 2 then you're just eating with
one<00:04:21.150> dog<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:22.259> time<00:04:22.320> in<00:04:22.710> cod<00:04:22.919> ghosts<00:04:23.190> so<00:04:23.610> it

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
one dog this time in cod ghosts so it

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.029 
one dog this time in cod ghosts so it
won't<00:04:24.090> be<00:04:24.210> such<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.570> big<00:04:24.750> deal<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:25.590> box<00:04:25.860> one

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
won't be such a big deal it box one

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.980 
won't be such a big deal it box one
another<00:04:26.250> he's<00:04:26.400> near<00:04:26.639> so<00:04:27.000> it's<00:04:27.509> like<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.690> radar

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
another he's near so it's like a radar

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.800 
another he's near so it's like a radar
but<00:04:28.680> then<00:04:28.860> again<00:04:28.979> if<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.389> they're<00:04:30.570> gonna<00:04:30.660> be

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
but then again if it's they're gonna be

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.600 
but then again if it's they're gonna be
so<00:04:30.990> easy<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.320> kill<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:31.889> I<00:04:31.949> wouldn't<00:04:32.190> go<00:04:32.460> as<00:04:32.490> far

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
so easy to kill so I wouldn't go as far

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.219 
so easy to kill so I wouldn't go as far
as<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.479> say<00:04:33.630> it's<00:04:34.020> going<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.229> be<00:04:34.289> overpowered

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
as to say it's going to be overpowered

the destructible environment theme I

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.560 
the destructible environment theme I
mean<00:04:39.000> it's<00:04:39.150> okay<00:04:40.130> I've<00:04:41.130> never<00:04:41.669> really<00:04:42.090> been<00:04:42.509> a

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
mean it's okay I've never really been a

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.330 
mean it's okay I've never really been a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
fan of destructible environment I just

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.499 
fan of destructible environment I just
preferred<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.759> the<00:04:44.910> way<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.150> is<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.389> map

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
preferred it the way it is the map

preferred it the way it is the map
design<00:04:45.720> I<00:04:47.509> just<00:04:48.509> don't<00:04:48.660> think<00:04:48.840> it'll<00:04:48.960> work<00:04:49.199> as

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
design I just don't think it'll work as

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.379

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
when I first played it and it is the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.779 
when I first played it and it is the
destructible<00:04:58.440> environment<00:04:59.220> mean<00:04:59.430> it<00:04:59.610> works

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
destructible environment mean it works

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.510 
destructible environment mean it works
pretty<00:05:00.000> well<00:05:00.120> but<00:05:00.300> in<00:05:01.289> DC<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.039> maps<00:05:02.250> they

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
pretty well but in DC the maps they

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.249 
pretty well but in DC the maps they
aren't<00:05:02.729> that<00:05:02.880> big<00:05:03.180> that<00:05:03.509> they're<00:05:03.930> smaller

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
aren't that big that they're smaller

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.560 
aren't that big that they're smaller
that's<00:05:05.190> why<00:05:05.340> such<00:05:05.550> a<00:05:05.580> fast-paced<00:05:06.030> game<00:05:06.419> is

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
that's why such a fast-paced game is

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.300 
that's why such a fast-paced game is
partly<00:05:06.840> why<00:05:07.050> people<00:05:07.320> switch<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.070> call<00:05:08.190> of

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
partly why people switch the call of

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.249 
partly why people switch the call of
duty<00:05:08.610> instead<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:08.909> battlefield<00:05:09.419> that's<00:05:10.080> why<00:05:10.229> I

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
duty instead of battlefield that's why I

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.050 
duty instead of battlefield that's why I
still<00:05:10.620> code<00:05:11.070> instead<00:05:11.340> of<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.580> battlefield

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
still code instead of the battlefield

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.149 
still code instead of the battlefield
and<00:05:12.300> if<00:05:13.050> they<00:05:13.110> do<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.380> switching<00:05:13.650> thing<00:05:13.919> it's

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
and if they do the switching thing it's

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.930 
and if they do the switching thing it's
not<00:05:14.340> gonna<00:05:14.460> work

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
not gonna work

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.749 
not gonna work
well<00:05:15.539> you<00:05:15.659> guys<00:05:15.780> that's<00:05:16.289> my<00:05:16.490> math<00:05:17.490> that's<00:05:17.639> my

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
well you guys that's my math that's my

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.270 
well you guys that's my math that's my
