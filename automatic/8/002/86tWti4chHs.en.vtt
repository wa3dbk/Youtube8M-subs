00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.059
 without doing any trick or anything strange 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.820
 Well, I'm going to show you two ways 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.589
 get this this van one is 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.930
 doing a mission that as you can see is a 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.710
 mission created by rosstat that is called 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.690
 go to the head and I'll leave it in the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.690
 description the link the social club 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.850
 to download it damaged jsa and be a 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.040
 your game those who do not have it jce 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.020
 so good is as simple as 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.670
 we have to go here and start the mission 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.439
 we started killing and there if you see is the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.230
 mint grace form we need help 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.290
 of a friend 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.140
 and we have to pass this mission but 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.090
 yes one has to take the van 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 and another has to follow the mission that is 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.530
 take that truck the house of martÃ­n and 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.200
 I'm not mistaken so good 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.780
 that we are the ones that we want to be the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.400
 good van, we'll lend you a hand 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.340
 to our friend since the mission is not 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.050
 that is the easiest so nothing 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.130
 we will have to chase our 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.290
 friend and take the bad guys off and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.180
 good to say to you then that we have to 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.970
 do it between two and the one that is going to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.020
 get the van because it is the one that has 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.820
 what to try not to die 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.580
 well I 'm telling you that in a moment that 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.150
 As you can see, there is only one life 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.650
 without one of the two he is left without lives 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.420
 Well, as you can see there is a bush once here 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.850
 and I'm out of life if I had died 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.940
 I for one more time would have to 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.380
 repeat the mission again, if not 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.450
 we need our friend to finish the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.940
 mission and we be in the form of 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.060
 is mounted at that time is good 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.010
 the other way that I'm going to teach you about 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.450
 get in this vehicle is with the sat 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.950
 editor worth 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.140
 with sabadito it is true that yes 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.560
 you can edit the colors of the tires and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.720
 the rest 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.940
 in this way, you can only 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.010
 get the mission the mission lose the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.349
 van as you have as is 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.030
 and not only can you do great things like that 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.290
 that nothing once we finish the mission we 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.480
 we go to free mode and as you see 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.220
 we appear already with the mental form in the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.200
 Book mode well then we can 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.690

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.610

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.250

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.569
 look for it and have a very 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.940
 interesting as all these vehicles 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.950
 that I bring to you and it is that good apart from 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.050
 that the garage the insurance can be 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.209
 put without any problem like 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.840
 a normal vehicle is that at the time of 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.150

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.840

 authentic burrada by this van 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.480

 sell lady I leave it to your liking 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.810
 the truth is that I do not know if the one that 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.890
 we would do in the mission would also give us 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.900
 that money that I have not tried 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.660
