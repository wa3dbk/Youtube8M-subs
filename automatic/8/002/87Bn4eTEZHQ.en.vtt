00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.110 
early so debated about veganism mainly
felt<00:03:47.110> like<00:03:47.290> three<00:03:47.709> months<00:03:47.980> ago<00:03:48.100> so<00:03:48.550> not<00:03:48.970> that

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
felt like three months ago so not that

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.510 
felt like three months ago so not that
long<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.930> yeah<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:51.340> next<00:03:51.490> question<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.480> from

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
long and yeah the next question is from

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.320 
long and yeah the next question is from
Maria<00:03:55.200> JPEG<00:03:56.200> I<00:03:56.500> think<00:03:57.160> that's<00:03:57.370> how<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.150> say<00:03:58.300> it

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
Maria JPEG I think that's how you say it

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.480 
Maria JPEG I think that's how you say it
and<00:03:58.600> she<00:03:58.690> said<00:03:59.440> what<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.709> your<00:03:59.830> dream<00:04:00.220> career

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
and she said what is your dream career

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.580 
and she said what is your dream career
my<00:04:01.209> dream<00:04:01.540> career<00:04:01.720> would<00:04:02.110> have<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.470> be

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
my dream career would have to be

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.670 
my dream career would have to be
something<00:04:02.920> involving<00:04:03.820> veganism<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.810> social

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
something involving veganism and social

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.680 
something involving veganism and social
media<00:04:05.800> and<00:04:06.160> hopefully<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:06.910> might<00:04:07.330> turn<00:04:07.630> into

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
media and hopefully this might turn into

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.900 
media and hopefully this might turn into
something<00:04:08.050> like<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.890> swimming<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.610> I'm

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
ethical environmental health or animal

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.920 
ethical environmental health or animal
cruelty<00:04:44.979> reasons<00:04:45.580> or<00:04:45.700> beliefs<00:04:46.000> even<00:04:46.330> vegan

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
cruelty reasons or beliefs even vegan

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.780 
cruelty reasons or beliefs even vegan
for<00:04:47.229> all<00:04:47.410> of<00:04:47.560> those<00:04:47.710> reasons<00:04:47.979> which<00:04:48.430> really<00:04:48.669> I

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
for all of those reasons which really I

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.430 
for all of those reasons which really I
looked<00:04:49.120> into<00:04:49.270> everything<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:50.320> took

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
looked into everything and took

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.550 
looked into everything and took
everything<00:04:50.770> into<00:04:51.040> consideration<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:52.560> yeah

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
everything into consideration and yeah

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.920 
everything into consideration and yeah
probably<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.580> main<00:04:54.820> one<00:04:55.060> would<00:04:55.300> be<00:04:55.479> animal

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
probably the main one would be animal

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.870 
probably the main one would be animal
cruelty<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:56.680> do<00:04:56.770> not<00:04:57.100> agree<00:04:57.340> with<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:57.669> I<00:04:57.820> do

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
cruelty I do not agree with that I do

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.490 
cruelty I do not agree with that I do
not<00:04:58.090> want<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.330> take<00:04:58.419> part<00:04:58.690> in<00:04:58.930> that<00:04:59.050> that<00:04:59.260> is

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
not want to take part in that that is

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.610 
not want to take part in that that is
disgusting<00:05:00.430> and<00:05:00.729> so<00:05:01.600> I<00:05:01.630> felt<00:05:02.020> really<00:05:02.140> strongly

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
disgusting and so I felt really strongly

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.770 
disgusting and so I felt really strongly
about<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:02.979> even<00:05:03.580> before<00:05:03.760> I<00:05:03.970> was<00:05:04.150> vegan<00:05:04.419> but<00:05:04.750> I

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
about that even before I was vegan but I

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.600 
about that even before I was vegan but I
didn't<00:05:05.110> really<00:05:05.380> make<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.800> connection<00:05:05.950> that

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
didn't really make the connection that

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.030 
didn't really make the connection that
I'm<00:05:06.790> actually<00:05:07.000> contributing<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:08.200> it<00:05:08.320> but<00:05:08.620> now

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040
