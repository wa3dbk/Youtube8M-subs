00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.589
 it's called the curse of the pharaohs 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.840
 a revenge against the adventurers 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.650
 daring to desecrate the tombs to the sacred of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.570
 pyramids 1699 a Polish ship 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.190
 carrying two mummies is haunted by 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.400
 spectral visions wipes of 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.080
 violent storms 1803 four members 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.619
 an expedition enters the pyramid 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.210
 from khephren and never come out of it 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.130
 1922 the tomb of Tutankhamun is 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.140
 open and a series of atrocious deaths 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.510
 falls on the team responsible for 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.550
 excavation during the 91 years that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.790
 followed no other grave was 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.320
 desecrated until today one of 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.239
 producers 4 with us on the movie 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 scott silver had seen a report at the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.350
 telly about an American archaeologist who 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.870
 had this idea on seeing another 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.540
 reportage was precisely about how the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.620
 nasa the satellites of nasa 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.790
 radiograph the March soil to see 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.530
 if they had structures that 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.420
 exist lcd but why not the same 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.890
 thing on earth why instead of going 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 scratch with toothbrushes in the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
 desert has gone dig up treasure 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.010
 why do not we turn the satellites 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.810
 why do not we do some kind of 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.299
 radiography like that of the desert in 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.380
 egypt to see if there are any structures 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.640
 just found himself in the sand they 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.220
 did that they actually discovered a 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.439
 city and from that idea there is 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.360
 born the concept of pyramids and if 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.610
 just a group of archaeologists had 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.860
 the same resorted to the same 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.939
 technique and discover a pyramid more 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.310
 great than all those we know 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.439
 buried in the Egyptian sands and at 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.990
 when they will be able to enter 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.280
 this pyramid the Arab Spring of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.810
 events that follow the prat hours to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.979
 provokes a reaction from the authorities 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.560
 Egyptian women who asks them to leave 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.549
 the territory and obviously had in 24 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.380
 hours to pack up but do not go 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.220
 not leave without obviously going to see what 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.220
 case the interest of this pyramid 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.510
 the script we received was 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.260
 fully written like crazy all ages 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.629
 I must admit that it is not 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.180
 necessarily the genre but kind of movies 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.219
 favorite is not and especially for a 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.810
 first realization there was some 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.310
 a little frustrating thing to keep a 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.549
 only point of view and stay in one 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.159
 in a very rigorous schema very 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.409
 structured in addition to that we had 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.480
 the ambition to make a decor when 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:40.230
 even pretty important is to see some 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.510
 creatures so the idea of making the movie 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.069
 entirely with a moving camera 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.019
 in every way to try to avoid 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.150
 to show anything it was 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.609
 especially because I had what I had 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.030
 want to do next 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.439
 the story is talking about finally postponing 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.659
 two journalists and who come with 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.650
 their camera filmed this this pyramid 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.109
 which I found interesting 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.699
 start the movie with their points of 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:07.409
 view to better get home faster 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:07.919
 in action with them and but enough 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.709
 quickly 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:12.359
 I wanted to precisely 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.810
 go beyond this point of view for 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.909
 to be like we say with the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.310
 characters entirely and not just 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.109
 behind a camera there is this way 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.909
 of camera carried a little bit 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.389
 documentary I think it's more 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.439
 this proximity of the characters who 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.060
 speak more to people in this 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.060
 generation will say youtube 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.290
 that's where people actually sound 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.079
 spend their days watching 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.449
 video clips of their neighbors or that the 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:43.290
 skateboarder where I do not know who did so 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:44.759
 so it's a freedom format 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.379
 narrative that is much stronger 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:48.150
 today that it was before 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.769
 but it's a style that would hold 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.949
 belongs to our time and I think 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.120
 that the younger generations have some 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.430
 part is something that their 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.699
 speak even though the rules of the fund's 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.909
 footage brings them can finally let 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:06.299
 it's this process I think talk to them and 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.849
 me when I discovered this script 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.900
 I really saw a movie that 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.120
 I would have loved to see in the room 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.290
 at 12-13 years later it's not going to be 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.290
 hide it's actually it's also 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.090
 a way somewhere to make some 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.580
 savings also in the budget of 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.860
 turn faster we shot the film in 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.350
 less than 29 days so there is a lot 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.509
 of action there is a lot of 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.100
 things so here's this process there we 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.160
 still allows to have some 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.460
 freedom and not to clutter one goes 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.190
 to say of a crane a traveling and 2 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.550
 implementations that took 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.680
 hours 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.530
 that's what it allows me his father ted to have 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.130
 this mind a little commandos and taken 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.130
 on the spot
