going<00:00:00.149> to<00:00:00.240> talk<00:00:00.450> about<00:00:00.690> the<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.410> finer<00:00:01.709> points

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
going to talk about the the finer points

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.900 
going to talk about the the finer points
of<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.909> double<00:00:03.270> spay<00:00:04.069> which<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.279> caste<00:00:05.670> that

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
of a double spay which is a caste that

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.799 
of a double spay which is a caste that
you'll<00:00:06.210> use<00:00:06.540> whenever<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.230> wind<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.740> blowing

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
you'll use whenever the wind is blowing

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.980 
you'll use whenever the wind is blowing
downstream<00:00:10.370> or<00:00:11.370> if<00:00:11.790> there's<00:00:12.269> no<00:00:12.480> wind<00:00:12.690> and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
downstream or if there's no wind and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.870 
downstream or if there's no wind and
maybe<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.650> have<00:00:13.830> an<00:00:13.920> obstacle<00:00:14.250> over<00:00:14.610> your

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
maybe you have an obstacle over your

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.930 
maybe you have an obstacle over your
upstream<00:00:15.360> shoulder<00:00:16.039> and<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.130> double<00:00:17.430> Spade<00:00:17.640> be

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
upstream shoulder and a double Spade be

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.080 
upstream shoulder and a double Spade be
an<00:00:18.029> appropriate<00:00:18.390> cast<00:00:19.460> an<00:00:20.460> easy<00:00:20.640> way<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
an appropriate cast an easy way to

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.380 
an appropriate cast an easy way to
remember<00:00:22.460> when<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.609> would<00:00:23.730> use<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> double

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
remember when you would use a double

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.000 
remember when you would use a double
spay<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.900> if<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.650> wind<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.980> blowing<00:00:26.039> down

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
spay is if the wind is blowing down

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.790 
spay is if the wind is blowing down
stream<00:00:29.010> then<00:00:29.490> you're<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.849> want<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.240> down

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
stream then you're going to want a down

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.370 
stream then you're going to want a down
stream<00:00:31.800> anchor<00:00:32.250> there's<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.420> double<00:00:33.809> space

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
stream anchor there's your double space

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.790 
stream anchor there's your double space
so<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.739> line<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.309> DS<00:00:35.989> downwind<00:00:36.989> down

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
so you line up the DS downwind down

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.200 
so you line up the DS downwind down
anchor<00:00:38.280> double<00:00:39.270> spay<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.770> upwind<00:00:41.280> then

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
anchor double spay if it's upwind then

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
anchor double spay if it's upwind then
watch<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.450> other<00:00:42.809> video<00:00:43.020> snap<00:00:43.920> teeth

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
watch that other video snap teeth

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.720 
watch that other video snap teeth
because<00:00:44.969> that's<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.300> upwind<00:00:46.280> shot<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
because that's your upwind shot so that

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.540 
because that's your upwind shot so that
you're<00:00:47.879> safe<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.600> by<00:00:48.960> safe<00:00:49.289> meaning<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:50.370> don't

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
you're safe and by safe meaning we don't

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.029 
you're safe and by safe meaning we don't
want<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:50.879> hit<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> fly<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.039> when

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
want to get hit with the fly and when

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.740 
want to get hit with the fly and when
the<00:00:53.129> wind<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.520> out<00:00:53.640> blowing<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.510> the

the wind is out blowing it's the
opponent<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.399> don't<00:00:56.579> want<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> wind<00:00:57.239> to

opponent and we don't want the wind to

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.189 
opponent and we don't want the wind to
help<00:00:58.050> blow<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> fly<00:00:59.129> into<00:00:59.579> us<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.870> anchor

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
help blow the fly into us the anchor

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.340 
help blow the fly into us the anchor

got<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> rod<00:01:39.150> high<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.720> my<00:01:39.900> left<00:01:40.200> hand<00:01:40.439> my

got the rod high in my left hand my

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.969 
got the rod high in my left hand my
downstream<00:01:41.400> hand<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:43.049> first<00:01:43.380> step<00:01:43.740> is

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
downstream hand and this first step is

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.210 
downstream hand and this first step is
merely<00:01:45.049> lifting<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.549> flopping<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:48.119> rod<00:01:48.360> just

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
merely lifting and flopping the rod just

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.609 
merely lifting and flopping the rod just
like<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> windshield<00:01:50.700> wiper<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> car<00:01:51.930> here<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
like a windshield wiper on a car here it

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.109 
like a windshield wiper on a car here it
is<00:01:52.740> again<00:01:53.040> I've<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.520> lift<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.590> flop<00:01:55.790> my<00:01:56.790> arms

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
is again I've just lift and flop my arms

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.810 
is again I've just lift and flop my arms
are<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:57.530> crossing<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.430> flop

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
are actually crossing to get that flop

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.870 
are actually crossing to get that flop
that<00:02:00.149> lazy<00:02:00.509> flop<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.439> put<00:02:01.619> any<00:02:01.829> power<00:02:02.159> that

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that lazy flop if I put any power that

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.520 
that lazy flop if I put any power that
anchor<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> go<00:02:03.570> flying<00:02:03.930> upstream

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
anchor is going to go flying upstream

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.749 
anchor is going to go flying upstream
and<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.829> don't<00:02:05.070> want<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.399> up<00:02:05.490> there

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
and I don't want it up there

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.270 
and I don't want it up there
I<00:02:05.909> wanted<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> rods<00:02:06.930> length<00:02:07.290> away<00:02:07.469> down<00:02:07.829> string

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I wanted to rods length away down string

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.220 
I wanted to rods length away down string
so<00:02:08.970> again<00:02:09.300> lift<00:02:10.940> flop<00:02:11.970> there's<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.840> anchor

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
so again lift flop there's the anchor

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.880 
so again lift flop there's the anchor
the<00:02:13.349> end<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.620> my

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the end of my

the end of my
mine<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.780> anchor<00:02:16.200> stroke<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:17.180> our

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
mine that is the anchor stroke of our
