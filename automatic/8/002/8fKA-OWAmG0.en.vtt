actually got like a perfect even number
amount<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.280> parts<00:01:17.520> actually<00:01:17.759> earned<00:01:18.180> five

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
amount of parts actually earned five

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.520 
amount of parts actually earned five
thousand<00:01:19.439> scrap<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.189> got<00:01:21.080> 100<00:01:22.080> parts<00:01:22.380> from

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
thousand scrap and I got 100 parts from

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.929 
thousand scrap and I got 100 parts from
it<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.159> kind<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.490> perfect

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it so that's kind of like a perfect

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.399 
it so that's kind of like a perfect
example<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.630> how<00:01:24.750> many<00:01:24.900> parts<00:01:25.229> or

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
example of you know how many parts or

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.620 
example of you know how many parts or
how<00:01:25.770> many<00:01:25.830> scrap<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.490> converted<00:01:27.030> into<00:01:27.150> parts

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
how many scrap is converted into parts

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810 
how many scrap is converted into parts
so<00:01:27.810> every<00:01:28.380> single<00:01:28.710> 50<00:01:29.100> scrap<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.700> earn

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
so every single 50 scrap that you earn

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.399 
so every single 50 scrap that you earn
in<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> game<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> little<00:01:30.689> green

the<00:01:35.130> difference<00:01:35.430> between<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.790> scraps<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the difference between the scraps and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.420 
the difference between the scraps and
the<00:01:36.329> parts<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:37.950> that's<00:01:38.070> actually<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the parts and I think that's actually a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.770 
the parts and I think that's actually a
pretty<00:01:38.460> fair<00:01:38.850> conversion<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.540> worried

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
pretty fair conversion I was worried

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.060 
pretty fair conversion I was worried
there<00:01:39.930> was<00:01:40.049> gonna<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.350> lot<00:01:40.500> more<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> lot

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
there was gonna be a lot more or a lot

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.440 
there was gonna be a lot more or a lot
less<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.579> after<00:01:41.820> actually<00:01:42.060> crunching<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
less but after actually crunching the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.760 
less but after actually crunching the
numbers<00:01:42.479> myself<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.140> felt<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.649> pretty

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
numbers myself I felt that it was pretty

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.200 
numbers myself I felt that it was pretty
even<00:01:44.100> ok<00:01:44.369> guys<00:01:44.549> now<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.790> we've<00:01:45.030> already

reviver number three gives you a bonus

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.190 
reviver number three gives you a bonus
of<00:02:38.440> fifty<00:02:38.710> scrap<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.270> while<00:02:40.570> running<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.050> you

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
of fifty scrap so while running it you

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.260 
of fifty scrap so while running it you
get<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.380> hundred<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:41.830> fifty<00:02:42.190> scrap<00:02:42.580> /<00:02:42.970> he'll

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
get a hundred and fifty scrap / he'll

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.930 
get a hundred and fifty scrap / he'll
which<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.570> equates<00:02:43.990> to<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.920> know<00:02:45.040> three<00:02:45.490> parts

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
which is equates to you know three parts

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.610 
which is equates to you know three parts
and<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.240> think<00:02:46.480> that's<00:02:46.630> actually<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.050> lot<00:02:47.260> better

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
and I think that's actually a lot better

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.110 
and I think that's actually a lot better
you<00:02:48.250> know<00:02:48.340> because<00:02:48.550> then<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.760> don't<00:02:48.790> have<00:02:49.000> to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
you know because then you don't have to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880 
you know because then you don't have to
worry<00:02:49.270> about<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.450> extra<00:02:49.780> 25<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.560> know<00:02:50.680> I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
worry about that extra 25 and you know I

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.260 
worry about that extra 25 and you know I
think<00:02:51.160> only<00:02:51.460> a<00:02:51.520> kill<00:02:51.820> gives<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.240> a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
think only a kill gives you like a

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.240 
think only a kill gives you like a
hundred<00:02:52.480> scrap<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.170> its<00:02:53.530> equivalent<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.160> know

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
hundred scrap so its equivalent you know

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.830 
hundred scrap so its equivalent you know
it's<00:02:54.400> almost<00:02:54.550> like<00:02:54.790> getting<00:02:55.210> a<00:02:55.390> free<00:02:55.540> extra

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
it's almost like getting a free extra

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.540 
it's almost like getting a free extra
part<00:02:56.050> every<00:02:56.230> single<00:02:56.470> revive<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:57.040> think<00:02:57.430> that's

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
part every single revive I think that's

personally<00:05:52.430> I<00:05:52.669> think<00:05:52.699> it's<00:05:52.969> pretty<00:05:53.060> worth<00:05:53.240> it

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
personally I think it's pretty worth it

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:54.730 
personally I think it's pretty worth it
you<00:05:53.570> know<00:05:53.599> you<00:05:54.110> just<00:05:54.169> get<00:05:54.349> to<00:05:54.409> give<00:05:54.530> a<00:05:54.560> free

you know you just get to give a free

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.950 
you know you just get to give a free

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
gift to someone most of the time I found

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.529 
gift to someone most of the time I found
that<00:05:57.409> its<00:05:57.590> bombs<00:05:57.860> um<00:05:58.190> I've<00:05:58.759> only<00:05:59.060> received

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
that its bombs um I've only received

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:00.999 
that its bombs um I've only received
like<00:05:59.719> to<00:05:59.870> mall<00:06:00.080> tiles<00:06:00.319> but<00:06:00.469> I<00:06:00.530> received<00:06:00.800> like

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 
like to mall tiles but I received like

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.790 
like to mall tiles but I received like
12<00:06:01.880> bombs<00:06:02.240> and<00:06:02.539> like<00:06:02.719> three<00:06:03.169> smoke<00:06:03.469> grenades

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
12 bombs and like three smoke grenades

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.309 
12 bombs and like three smoke grenades
so<00:06:04.460> I<00:06:04.490> think<00:06:04.610> you<00:06:04.880> know<00:06:04.909> you<00:06:05.060> get<00:06:05.300> maltose<00:06:06.169> or

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
so I think you know you get maltose or

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.749 
so I think you know you get maltose or
less<00:06:06.620> and<00:06:06.889> I<00:06:06.979> think<00:06:07.190> that's<00:06:07.310> fine<00:06:07.550> because

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
less and I think that's fine because

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.300 
less and I think that's fine because
multi-star<00:06:08.330> pretty<00:06:08.479> overpowered<00:06:08.719> so<00:06:09.530> I<00:06:09.860> think

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
multi-star pretty overpowered so I think

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.469 
multi-star pretty overpowered so I think
it's<00:06:10.400> pretty<00:06:10.520> beneficial<00:06:10.729> how<00:06:11.210> about<00:06:11.360> your
