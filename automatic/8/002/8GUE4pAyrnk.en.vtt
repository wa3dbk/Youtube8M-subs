00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.940 
but uh yeah alright next clip alright I
actually<00:04:15.600> decided<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.140> show<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.350> guys<00:04:16.620> how<00:04:16.920> to

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
actually decided to show you guys how to

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.259 
actually decided to show you guys how to
do<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.190> alright<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.730> can<00:04:17.820> see<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.060> black

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
do it alright so you can see this black

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.800 
do it alright so you can see this black
piece<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:19.590> know<00:04:19.680> drop<00:04:19.890> it<00:04:20.040> into<00:04:20.160> place

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
piece you know drop it into place

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.360 
piece you know drop it into place
then<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> found<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.140> easiest<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.590> keep<00:04:23.250> this

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
then I found it easiest to keep this

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.440 
then I found it easiest to keep this
upside<00:04:23.670> down<00:04:23.700> because<00:04:24.000> if<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.180> tip<00:04:24.420> it

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
upside down because if you tip it

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.090 
upside down because if you tip it
sometimes<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.110> black<00:04:25.260> piece<00:04:25.470> falls<00:04:25.680> out<00:04:25.890> so

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
sometimes the black piece falls out so

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.720 
sometimes the black piece falls out so
you're<00:04:27.000> going<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.150> hold<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.510> like<00:04:28.350> this

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
you're going to hold it like this

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.970 
you're going to hold it like this
there's<00:04:29.730> a<00:04:29.820> little<00:04:30.060> extra<00:04:30.530> flap<00:04:31.530> here<00:04:31.800> you

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
there's a little extra flap here you

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.670

have<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.160> find<00:04:32.310> where<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.610> goes<00:04:32.820> it<00:04:33.090> goes

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
have to find where that goes it goes

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.170 
have to find where that goes it goes
right<00:04:34.680> here<00:04:35.220> in<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:35.880> little<00:04:36.500> weird<00:04:37.500> cutout
