00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
four-wheel drives and it's been a good

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.450 
four-wheel drives and it's been a good
year<00:01:20.259> it's<00:01:20.560> part<00:01:20.770> of<00:01:20.830> australia's<00:01:21.100> best<00:01:21.340> cars

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.520 

but<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.880> most<00:01:28.119> objective<00:01:28.530> care

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
but is the most objective care

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.499 
but is the most objective care
assessment<00:01:29.979> program<00:01:30.340> in<00:01:30.490> australia<00:01:30.910> and<00:01:31.330> i

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
assessment program in australia and i

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.570 
assessment program in australia and i
think<00:01:31.810> one<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.770> things<00:01:32.800> that<00:01:33.009> makes<00:01:33.399> it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
think one of the things that makes it

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.490 
think one of the things that makes it
stand<00:01:33.789> out<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.539> amount<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.960> objective

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
stand out is the amount of objective

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.710 
stand out is the amount of objective
material<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.190> we<00:01:36.280> collect<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:37.330> data<00:01:37.479> we

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
material that we collect the data we

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.530 
material that we collect the data we
collect<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.140> actually<00:01:38.500> get<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.830> scores<00:01:39.540> we're

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
collect to actually get the scores we're

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.749 
collect to actually get the scores we're
crunching<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.080> numbers<00:01:41.110> pretty<00:01:41.740> hard<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.430> we

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
crunching the numbers pretty hard and we

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.310 
crunching the numbers pretty hard and we
want<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.090> numbers<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.570> be<00:01:43.689> right<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.110> it's<00:01:44.229> a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
want the numbers to be right and it's a

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.289 
want the numbers to be right and it's a
democratic<00:01:44.950> process<00:01:45.460> where<00:01:45.729> we<00:01:45.850> actually

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
democratic process where we actually

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.929 
democratic process where we actually
voting<00:01:47.020> so<00:01:47.229> it's<00:01:47.380> not<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.770> matter<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.280> only<00:01:48.580> one
