section nipple 8 the knot here just so

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.550 
section nipple 8 the knot here just so
you've<00:03:10.850> got<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.150> loops<00:03:11.390> roughly<00:03:12.230> around<00:03:12.320> the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
you've got the loops roughly around the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.830 
you've got the loops roughly around the
same<00:03:12.829> size<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.970> can<00:03:14.209> take<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.480> bit<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.750> practice

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
same size it can take a bit of practice

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.160 
same size it can take a bit of practice
but<00:03:15.470> just<00:03:15.680> tease<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.220> knot<00:03:16.400> down<00:03:16.640> and

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
but just tease the knot down and

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.960 
but just tease the knot down and
remember<00:03:18.170> before<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.799> tighten<00:03:19.250> down<00:03:19.280> always

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
remember before you tighten down always

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.640 
remember before you tighten down always
moisten<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.750> not<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:26.480> two<00:03:26.690> loops<00:03:26.930> roughly

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
moisten the not the two loops roughly

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.680 
moisten the not the two loops roughly
the<00:03:27.769> same<00:03:27.950> size<00:03:28.280> now<00:03:28.940> gives<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.450> hinge

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
the same size now gives you the hinge

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.490 
the same size now gives you the hinge
and<00:03:30.579> just<00:03:31.579> tighten<00:03:32.030> up<00:03:32.150> using<00:03:32.690> your<00:03:33.200> puller

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
and just tighten up using your puller

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.400 
and just tighten up using your puller
tool

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.589 

now<00:03:40.410> trim<00:03:40.950> your<00:03:41.099> tag<00:03:41.340> end<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.819> you'll<00:03:42.269> be<00:03:42.390> left

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
now trim your tag end and you'll be left

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:54.860 
now trim your tag end and you'll be left
with<00:03:42.989> two<00:03:43.290> loops<00:03:43.849> which<00:03:44.849> form<00:03:45.209> your<00:03:45.599> hinge<00:03:53.870> as

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
with two loops which form your hinge as

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.289 
with two loops which form your hinge as
you<00:03:55.140> can<00:03:55.319> see<00:03:55.530> before<00:03:55.890> two<00:03:56.459> loops<00:03:56.730> which<00:03:57.030> give

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
you can see before two loops which give

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.119 
you can see before two loops which give
you<00:03:57.480> your<00:03:57.810> hinge<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.379> this<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.739> what<00:03:58.890> makes

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
you your hinge and this is what makes

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.250 
you your hinge and this is what makes
this<00:03:59.310> rig<00:03:59.580> so<00:03:59.849> effective<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.660> movement<00:04:01.140> on

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
this rig so effective the movement on

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.789 
this rig so effective the movement on
these<00:04:01.769> two<00:04:02.040> loops<00:04:02.390> now<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.780> next<00:04:04.080> step<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.470> to

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
these two loops now the next step is to

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.339 
these two loops now the next step is to
attach<00:04:05.040> your<00:04:05.549> swivel<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.090> for<00:04:06.900> this<00:04:07.049> we're

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
attach your swivel and for this we're

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.400 
attach your swivel and for this we're
going<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.500> use<00:04:07.560> another<00:04:08.160> overhand<00:04:08.700> knot<00:04:09.410> again

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
going to use another overhand knot again

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.589 
going to use another overhand knot again
leave<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.069> big<00:04:11.400> tag<00:04:11.700> end<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.060> just<00:04:12.269> makes<00:04:12.480> life

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
leave a big tag end it just makes life

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.879 
leave a big tag end it just makes life
easier<00:04:13.640> simple<00:04:14.640> overhand<00:04:15.540> knot<00:04:15.810> past<00:04:16.709> the

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
easier simple overhand knot past the

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.409 
easier simple overhand knot past the
swivel<00:04:17.280> back<00:04:17.549> through<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.030> loop<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:20.269> at<00:04:21.269> this

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
swivel back through the loop and at this

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.750 
swivel back through the loop and at this
stage<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:22.650> need<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:23.040> moisten<00:04:23.310> your<00:04:23.520> knot

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
stage you need to moisten your knot

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.300 
stage you need to moisten your knot
again<00:04:24.240> with<00:04:24.870> all<00:04:25.110> knots<00:04:25.410> on<00:04:25.620> these<00:04:25.800> Totti<00:04:26.100> hook

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
again with all knots on these Totti hook

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.550 
again with all knots on these Totti hook
links<00:04:26.729> you<00:04:27.360> just<00:04:27.570> must<00:04:27.810> make<00:04:28.050> sure<00:04:28.080> they're

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
links you just must make sure they're

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.590 
links you just must make sure they're
nice<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:28.770> moist

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.230 

once<00:04:33.600> you've<00:04:33.810> teased<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.260> knot<00:04:34.410> down<00:04:35.240> trim

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
once you've teased the knot down trim

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.960 
once you've teased the knot down trim
your<00:04:36.360> tag<00:04:36.600> end<00:04:36.780> again<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:37.620> use<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.729> read

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
your tag end again and use to read

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.060 
your tag end again and use to read
pillars<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.539> either<00:04:40.139> end<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.650> loop<00:04:40.830> of

pillars on either end of the loop of
your<00:04:41.100> boom<00:04:41.400> section<00:04:41.940> just<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.600> pull<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:43.020> tight

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
your boom section just to pull it tight

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.290 
your boom section just to pull it tight
not<00:04:43.740> too<00:04:43.770> much<00:04:44.190> but<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:44.550> enough<00:04:44.910> to

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
not too much but just enough to

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.660 
not too much but just enough to
straighten<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.780> hooklink<00:04:45.930> out

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.910 

this<00:04:50.390> shoddy<00:04:50.630> material<00:04:51.170> really<00:04:51.500> does

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
this shoddy material really does

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.710 
this shoddy material really does
straighten<00:04:52.370> out<00:04:52.490> just<00:04:52.790> under<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:53.330> little<00:04:53.570> bit

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
straighten out just under a little bit

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.430 

now<00:05:07.760> you've<00:05:07.940> got<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.300> rig<00:05:08.450> itself<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:09.290> next

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
now you've got the rig itself the next

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.010 
now you've got the rig itself the next
stage<00:05:09.800> is<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.130> tie<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.520> bait<00:05:10.820> on<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.630> do<00:05:11.810> this
