00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
describing as a sort of religious

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.029 
describing as a sort of religious
experience<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.170> don't<00:00:22.320> know<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.619> was

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
experience I don't know if it I was

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.160 
experience I don't know if it I was
quite<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.490> sort<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:23.970> all<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.390> very<00:00:25.109> very

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
quite that sort of in all but very very

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.500 
quite that sort of in all but very very
enjoyable<00:00:25.640> very<00:00:26.640> different<00:00:26.910> from<00:00:26.970> called<00:00:27.210> GC

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
enjoyable very different from called GC

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.599 
enjoyable very different from called GC
I<00:00:27.539> think<00:00:27.750> that's<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> main<00:00:28.500> vibe<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.099> people

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
I think that's the main vibe that people

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.710 
I think that's the main vibe that people
have<00:00:29.730> been<00:00:29.820> getting<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.150> they<00:00:30.269> come<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.570> play

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
have been getting as they come and play

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.820 
have been getting as they come and play
it<00:00:30.810> because<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.990> lot<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.199> people<00:00:31.260> are<00:00:31.470> expecting

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
it because a lot of people are expecting

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.220 
it because a lot of people are expecting
it<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.009> modern<00:00:32.700> warfare<00:00:32.880> 2<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.840> giant

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it to be modern warfare 2 but with giant

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.630 
it to be modern warfare 2 but with giant
robots<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.739> actually<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.460> lot<00:00:35.610> more

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
robots and actually it's a lot more

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220 
robots and actually it's a lot more
complex<00:00:36.090> than<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.360> really<00:00:36.960> enjoyed<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
complex than that really enjoyed the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
complex than that really enjoyed the
smart<00:00:37.469> pistol<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.010> think<00:00:38.190> if<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.879> complain

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
smart pistol I think if you complain

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.700 
smart pistol I think if you complain
about<00:00:39.270> campus<00:00:39.899> normally<00:00:40.290> you're<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
about campus normally you're going to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.930 
about campus normally you're going to
have<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> nightmare<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.399> these<00:00:41.550> guys<00:00:41.700> because

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
have a nightmare with these guys because

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.430 
have a nightmare with these guys because
I<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.300> spending<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.600> lot<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> time<00:00:42.840> inside<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
I was spending a lot of time inside the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.990 
I was spending a lot of time inside the
building<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> advantages<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.879> being

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
building one of the advantages to being

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.880 
building one of the advantages to being
a<00:00:45.090> pilot<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.870> go<00:00:45.989> inside<00:00:46.110> buildings

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
a pilot is you can go inside buildings

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.670 
a pilot is you can go inside buildings
where<00:00:47.100> Dyson<00:00:48.030> Titans<00:00:48.390> can't<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> was

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
where Dyson Titans can't and so I was

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
where Dyson Titans can't and so I was
hiding<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.039> building<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.520> kind<00:00:50.640> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
hiding in the building and just kind of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.889 
hiding in the building and just kind of
popping<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.149> each<00:00:51.239> we're<00:00:51.449> known<00:00:51.600> seeing

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
popping out in each we're known seeing

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.299 
popping out in each we're known seeing
if<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:52.260> getting<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> lock<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.860> something<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
if I was getting a lock on something and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.040 
if I was getting a lock on something and
then<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.059> was<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> swinging<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
then if I was kind of swinging the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.869 
then if I was kind of swinging the
pistol<00:00:55.350> round<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.620> then<00:00:55.680> nailing<00:00:56.100> them<00:00:56.340> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
pistol round and then nailing them so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.639 
pistol round and then nailing them so
that<00:00:56.910> was<00:00:57.120> really<00:00:57.149> good<00:00:57.570> fun<00:00:57.750> I'd<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.440> like

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that was really good fun I'd really like

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.400 
that was really good fun I'd really like
the<00:00:58.800> change<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.489> scale<00:00:59.960> between<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.320> from

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the change in scale between going from

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
the change in scale between going from
being<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.739> pilot<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.280> being<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> Titan<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.059> level

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
being a pilot to being a Titan the level

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
being a pilot to being a Titan the level
kind<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.719> almost<00:01:04.140> changes<00:01:04.799> completely

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
kind of almost changes completely

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.380 
kind of almost changes completely
because<00:01:05.460> you're<00:01:05.610> much<00:01:05.790> bigger<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.299> you're

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
because you're much bigger and you're

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.060 
because you're much bigger and you're
much<00:01:06.570> sort<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.200> less<00:01:07.380> able<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.830> sneak<00:01:08.010> through

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
much sort of less able to sneak through

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.890 
much sort of less able to sneak through
smaller<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.060> valley<00:01:09.240> ways<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> things<00:01:09.780> like

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
smaller so valley ways and things like

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.780 
smaller so valley ways and things like
that<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.500> was<00:01:10.890> struggling<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.430> bit<00:01:11.640> with

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
that I was struggling a little bit with

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.520 
that I was struggling a little bit with
the<00:01:11.880> freerunning<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.600> enjoying<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.320> when<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the freerunning but enjoying it when I

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.140 
the freerunning but enjoying it when I
when<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:14.369> because<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> feels

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
when I got it right because it feels

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.399 
when I got it right because it feels
really<00:01:15.479> really<00:01:15.630> good<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.170> run<00:01:16.290> up

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
really really good if you kind of run up

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
really really good if you kind of run up
a<00:01:16.500> wall<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.860> bounced<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> another<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
a wall and bounced to another one and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.940 
a wall and bounced to another one and
stuff<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.570> probably<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.470> same<00:01:19.830> as

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
stuff it's probably not the same as

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.560 
stuff it's probably not the same as
mirrors<00:01:20.220> edge<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.670> kind<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.970> more<00:01:21.150> safer<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
mirrors edge it's kind of a more safer I

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.460 
mirrors edge it's kind of a more safer I
take<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.960> jetpacks<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.470> stuff

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.720 

yeah<00:01:29.470> for<00:01:29.620> me<00:01:29.740> like<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.100> navigation<00:01:30.610> as<00:01:30.700> a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
yeah for me like the navigation as a

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.670 
yeah for me like the navigation as a
pilot<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.240> one<00:01:31.390> of<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.870> big<00:01:32.020> draws<00:01:32.260> being

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
pilot is one of the the big draws being

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.930 
pilot is one of the the big draws being
able<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:32.920> double<00:01:33.070> drum<00:01:33.370> being<00:01:33.550> able<00:01:33.730> to<00:01:33.790> wall

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
able to double drum being able to wall

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.090 
able to double drum being able to wall
run<00:01:34.150> it's<00:01:34.600> kind<00:01:35.320> of<00:01:35.350> like<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:35.800> say<00:01:35.950> it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
run it's kind of like you say it

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.290 
run it's kind of like you say it
introduces<00:01:36.550> a<00:01:36.640> whole<00:01:36.790> new<00:01:36.940> level<00:01:37.090> of

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
introduces a whole new level of

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.580 
introduces a whole new level of
verticality<00:01:37.900> that<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.260> don't<00:01:38.410> have<00:01:38.530> in

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
verticality that you don't have in

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.920 
verticality that you don't have in
something<00:01:38.920> like<00:01:38.980> modern<00:01:39.250> warfare<00:01:39.690> so<00:01:40.690> that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
something like modern warfare so that

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.050 
something like modern warfare so that
was<00:01:41.080> great<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.350> just<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.950> everything<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:42.970> do

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
was great and just the everything to do

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.430 
was great and just the everything to do
with<00:01:43.240> having<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.510> Titan<00:01:43.840> it's<00:01:44.050> brilliant

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
with having a Titan it's brilliant

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.780 
with having a Titan it's brilliant
calling<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.830> tightening<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:45.370> awesome<00:01:45.670> because

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
calling a tightening is awesome because

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.520 
calling a tightening is awesome because
they<00:01:45.910> come<00:01:46.090> rocketing<00:01:46.330> out<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.750> sky<00:01:46.930> getting

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
they come rocketing out the sky getting

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.320 
they come rocketing out the sky getting
in<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.680> Titan<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:48.130> amazing<00:01:49.060> because<00:01:49.150> the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
in the Titan is amazing because the

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.910 
in the Titan is amazing because the
screens<00:01:49.660> come<00:01:49.900> online<00:01:50.110> sequentially<00:01:50.740> so

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
screens come online sequentially so

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.620 
screens come online sequentially so
you're<00:01:51.070> kind<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.280> fills<00:01:51.880> in<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.330> vision

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
you're kind of fills in the vision

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.030 
you're kind of fills in the vision
around<00:01:52.990> you<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.230> then<00:01:53.350> ejecting<00:01:53.800> out<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:54.010> a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
around you and then ejecting out of a

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.470 
around you and then ejecting out of a
Titan<00:01:54.370> is<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.520> think<00:01:54.700> one<00:01:55.180> of<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.330> most

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
Titan is I think one of the most

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.820 
Titan is I think one of the most
exciting<00:01:55.720> things<00:01:56.050> I've<00:01:56.350> ever<00:01:56.470> done<00:01:56.620> in<00:01:56.800> a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
exciting things I've ever done in a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.350 
exciting things I've ever done in a
video<00:01:57.040> game<00:01:57.070> as<00:01:57.310> i<00:01:57.400> said<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:57.910> Germany<00:01:58.240> just

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
video game as i said in Germany just

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.790 
video game as i said in Germany just
ejecting<00:01:58.840> out<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.080> then<00:01:59.170> if<00:01:59.260> you<00:01:59.350> can<00:01:59.470> land<00:01:59.650> on

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
ejecting out and then if you can land on

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.770 
ejecting out and then if you can land on
another<00:01:59.860> Titan<00:02:00.369> take<00:02:00.580> him<00:02:00.790> out<00:02:00.940> there<00:02:01.570> I've

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
another Titan take him out there I've

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.390 
another Titan take him out there I've
never<00:02:02.290> felt<00:02:02.500> like<00:02:02.680> such<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.860> badass<00:02:03.100> this

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
never felt like such a badass this

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:18.390 
never felt like such a badass this
amazing

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.710 

what<00:02:19.400> did<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:19.580> think<00:02:19.700> about<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.420> balance

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
what did you think about the the balance

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.600 
what did you think about the the balance
between<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.530> pilots<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.190> titans<00:02:22.549> you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
between the pilots and the titans you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.559 
between the pilots and the titans you
think<00:02:22.760> they've<00:02:22.849> hit<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.090> right<00:02:23.180> level<00:02:23.420> I

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
think they've hit the right level I

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.600 
think they've hit the right level I
think<00:02:23.750> works<00:02:24.049> pretty<00:02:24.200> well<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:25.370> really

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
think works pretty well it's really

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.369 
think works pretty well it's really
difficult<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.480> assumed<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.049> just<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.319> able

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
difficult to I assumed you just be able

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.330 
difficult to I assumed you just be able
to<00:02:27.470> charge<00:02:27.650> around<00:02:27.769> on<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.980> tight<00:02:28.129> and<00:02:28.250> just

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
to charge around on a tight and just

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.670 
to charge around on a tight and just
stomp<00:02:28.640> all<00:02:28.790> over<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.290> pilots<00:02:30.290> but<00:02:30.440> actually

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
stomp all over the pilots but actually

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
stomp all over the pilots but actually
because<00:02:30.890> they're<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.129> I<00:02:31.159> John<00:02:31.430> because

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
because they're so I John because

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.190 
because they're so I John because
they've<00:02:31.849> got<00:02:32.000> more<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.540> run<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.840> level

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
they've got more of the run of the level

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.920 
they've got more of the run of the level
as<00:02:33.319> it<00:02:33.739> were<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.730> does<00:02:34.940> feel<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.780> know

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
as it were it does feel like you know

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.110 
as it were it does feel like you know
you<00:02:36.709> can<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.129> can<00:02:37.280> turn<00:02:37.700> around<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.940> corner

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
you can you can turn around the corner

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.089 
you can you can turn around the corner
and<00:02:38.209> see<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.390> Titan<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:38.930> not<00:02:39.140> immediately<00:02:39.799> feel

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
and see a Titan and not immediately feel

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.930 
and see a Titan and not immediately feel
like<00:02:40.250> you're<00:02:40.370> going<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:40.580> be<00:02:40.640> obliterated

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
like you're going to be obliterated

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.789 
like you're going to be obliterated
obviously<00:02:41.569> if<00:02:41.660> there<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.959> heavy<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.709> know

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
obviously if there is a heavy you know

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.770 
obviously if there is a heavy you know
high<00:02:42.950> explosives<00:02:43.489> Titan<00:02:43.849> firing<00:02:44.420> those<00:02:44.510> like

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
high explosives Titan firing those like

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.259 
high explosives Titan firing those like
sort<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.709> spiraling<00:02:46.489> rockets<00:02:46.849> at<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.090> then

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
sort of spiraling rockets at you then

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.369 
sort of spiraling rockets at you then
you<00:02:47.390> are<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.540> some<00:02:47.840> trouble<00:02:48.019> but<00:02:48.319> there's

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
you are in some trouble but there's

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.350 
you are in some trouble but there's
always<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.769> place<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.430> duck<00:02:49.700> into<00:02:49.730> or<00:02:50.150> like<00:02:50.299> a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
always a place to duck into or like a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360 
always a place to duck into or like a
you<00:02:50.690> know<00:02:50.720> building<00:02:51.110> or<00:02:51.379> or<00:02:51.620> something<00:02:52.280> like

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
you know building or or something like

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.430 
you know building or or something like
that<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.060> felt<00:02:53.690> like<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.870> was<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.140> was<00:02:54.260> kind

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
that so I felt like it was it was kind

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.839 
that so I felt like it was it was kind
of<00:02:54.470> balance<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:54.920> do<00:02:55.069> a<00:02:55.099> melee<00:02:55.340> kill<00:02:55.610> with<00:02:55.819> a

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
of balance and do a melee kill with a

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.910 
of balance and do a melee kill with a
titan<00:02:56.209> on<00:02:56.329> a<00:02:56.359> on<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.959> human<00:02:57.260> that's<00:02:57.590> pretty<00:02:57.709> good

there's<00:03:08.359> a<00:03:08.420> real<00:03:08.540> sense<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.840> weight<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.260> them

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
there's a real sense of weight to them

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.140 
there's a real sense of weight to them
in<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.620> real<00:03:09.769> sense<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:10.099> kind<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.459> like<00:03:10.640> they

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
in a real sense of kind of like they

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.630 
in a real sense of kind of like they
don't<00:03:11.329> they<00:03:11.510> feel<00:03:11.959> restrictive<00:03:12.739> which<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.519> I

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
don't they feel restrictive which is I

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.490 
don't they feel restrictive which is I
think<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.540> great<00:03:14.810> benefit<00:03:15.349> that

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
think the the the great benefit that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.589 
think the the the great benefit that
that<00:03:15.709> thing<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:16.099> change<00:03:16.849> in<00:03:17.000> scale<00:03:17.209> means<00:03:17.420> that

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
that thing of change in scale means that

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.150 
that thing of change in scale means that
they<00:03:17.870> still<00:03:18.109> feel<00:03:18.260> agile<00:03:18.620> but<00:03:18.769> just<00:03:19.010> on<00:03:19.099> a

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
they still feel agile but just on a

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.180 
they still feel agile but just on a
larger<00:03:19.609> scale<00:03:20.049> sorry<00:03:21.049> there's<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.709> double<00:03:21.980> jump

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
larger scale sorry there's a double jump

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.220 
larger scale sorry there's a double jump
move<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.639> the<00:03:23.359> time<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.569> was<00:03:23.810> easy<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.109> do

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
move that the time I was easy to do

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.809 
move that the time I was easy to do
weights<00:03:24.410> or<00:03:24.590> dashes<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.280> side<00:03:25.459> he'll<00:03:25.700> do

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
weights or dashes to the side he'll do

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.159 
weights or dashes to the side he'll do
like<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> quick<00:03:26.150> dash<00:03:26.389> left<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:26.870> right<00:03:26.989> which

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
like a quick dash left and right which

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.420 
like a quick dash left and right which
is<00:03:27.200> really<00:03:27.410> good<00:03:27.560> for<00:03:27.680> avoiding<00:03:28.069> by<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> heavy

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
is really good for avoiding by a heavy

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.610 
is really good for avoiding by a heavy
weapon<00:03:28.579> Titan<00:03:29.060> yeah<00:03:29.480> there<00:03:29.630> I<00:03:29.660> i<00:03:29.989> assume<00:03:30.500> there

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
weapon Titan yeah there I i assume there

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.960 
weapon Titan yeah there I i assume there
was<00:03:30.680> just<00:03:30.859> one<00:03:30.950> sort<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.340> type<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.669> Titan<00:03:31.880> with

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
was just one sort of type of Titan with

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.400 
was just one sort of type of Titan with
maybe<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.239> few<00:03:32.419> load<00:03:32.599> actions<00:03:33.049> but<00:03:33.169> actually

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
maybe a few load actions but actually

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.539 
maybe a few load actions but actually
they've<00:03:33.500> got<00:03:33.650> different<00:03:33.769> classes<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.519> things

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
they've got different classes and things

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.860 
they've got different classes and things
like<00:03:34.849> I<00:03:35.060> was<00:03:35.269> playing<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.510> lot<00:03:35.660> with<00:03:35.690> the
