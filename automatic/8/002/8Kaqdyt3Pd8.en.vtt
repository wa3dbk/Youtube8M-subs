 I retired from the activity 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.170
 because now I have a certain age I am 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.510

 we bring out the fish the fish 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.370
 of civitavecchia that is wonderful e 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.110
 unfortunately it was almost all exported 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.720
 we are now also looking into 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.630
 collaboration with the cooperative of 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.130
 fishermen and managed by a group of 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.500
 ladies that are phenomenal 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.840
 let's try to set the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.270
 work on a raise first of all for 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.980
 the old dishes of the kitchen 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.810
 traditional civitavecchiese like the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.500
 old fish soup old woman 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.210
 fish soup the stuffed mussels that don't 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.260
 they are more made than they were tied with 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.480
 a particular thread but a plate 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.370
 exceptional tries to re - evaluate 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:24.410
 in particular we try to evaluate 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:26.660
 what is the blue fish I am 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.450
 Nearby my great friend Gianni Bono 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.870
 that a very young chef with great 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.060
 prospects for the future and today is 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.160
 come here to perform this mine 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.010
 recipe my reworking of 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.040
 this recipe that 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.159
 the recipe is composed precisely in a 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.780
 fish mosaic I called mosaic 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.230
 fish a revisitation of a 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.569
 old troop in a little key 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.290
 different as performance then we start 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.030
 exhausting the fish until it grows with 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.159
 the bones with the third certain evening 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.640
 we supply from fish to comics with various 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.510
 aromas where we squeeze quite then a 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.930
 part we do 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.700
 garlic oil bottom we put of 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.079
 past tomato the soul cheer with 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.180
 fresh oregano and this is the news 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.269
 because if possible religions have 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.370
 facebook from a very special roma 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.160
 with a little chilli pepper 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.889
 because there is just pain or pepper if 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.169
 one prefers to stretch it with 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.360
 fish cartoon let's shrink it 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.639
 at a right consistency and here 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.100
 we suspend the part with two panels 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.800
 several hunt the cylinders first 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.639
 and then the mussels because they don't have to be 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.060
 open evening with 1.21 different yes then yes 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:52.139
 they should name in the consistency 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.139
 of meat open the doors to we do 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:59.010
 instead a nice background and oil and garlic 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:02.490
 chilli and here we insert we do 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:06.690
 flavor lightly insert the 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.729
 thermolabile fish poultry because not 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.970
 I read the ingredients but this thing 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.199
 a squid is made with squid with 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.040
 octopus 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.060
 then if they listen to us more gaminella 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.490
 it means at the end 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:25.879
 with imperials it would still be 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:29.539
 comes in this prepared bottom comes to 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:35.479
 then check the gurnard last 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:37.539
 and the redfish and in fact change 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.490
 flavor with fish stock 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.650
 prepared feelings is done 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.840
 season not overcooked 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.840
 cooked as in the right way because 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.280
 then the point with the outside 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.889
 it is good to let it flavor 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.750
 in the meantime apart on the plate 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.729
 slightly concave we prepare 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.310
 that infection a lot of presentation 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:02.850
 simple as the recipe, however, possible 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.740
 nice enough way we do a 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.150
 bottom of that tomato sauce 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.240
 just a bed of with the sauce of 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.360
 wonderful tomato parades 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.640
 Flavored point the fresh oregano 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.480
 this fund then we have the first 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:21.480
 milan and then the scorpion fish fillets e 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.870
 gurnard the Russian prawn one 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.630
 sprinkled with fresh parsley over the 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.640
 mussels and clams obviously shops 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:33.600
 with clams with their bottom of 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.910
 cooking to how much the first part of the 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.820
 fish to quit growing under the odds 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.330
 rules inserted into this in this 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.120
 compound that makes all the flavor 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.340
 then the composition is the same 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.370
 then destroyed there is first to give 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.050
 a setting with the Milan and then with the 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.270
 fish fillets the billboard at 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.180
 headphones noise to start a great one 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.910
 fresh parsley sprinkled on top 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.460
 wholemeal bread croutons around why 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.440
 milano too particular is served 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.770
 in this manner is this 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.410
 the chef's fashion is the fish mosaic 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.640
 to use my friend John bono that me 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.030
 chased him in the manner of one 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.030
 imperfect
