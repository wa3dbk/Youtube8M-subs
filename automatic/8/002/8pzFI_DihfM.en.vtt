00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.200 
treat
these<00:01:46.890> they've<00:01:47.220> never<00:01:47.399> had<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.850> found<00:01:47.970> them<00:01:48.149> in

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
these they've never had we found them in

these they've never had we found them in
the<00:01:48.299> cupboard<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.750> were<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:48.990> through

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the cupboard and we were going through

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.460 
the cupboard and we were going through
and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.590 

I<00:01:52.500> guess<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.460> recruit<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.060> life<00:01:54.210> never

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
I guess I just recruit for life never

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.410 
I guess I just recruit for life never
had<00:01:54.870> any<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.260> before<00:01:55.640> just<00:01:56.640> dried<00:01:56.940> goji

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
had any of this before just dried goji

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.050 
had any of this before just dried goji
berries<00:01:57.780> no<00:01:58.620> preservatives<00:01:59.340> laden<00:01:59.730> she'll<00:01:59.910> go

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
berries no preservatives laden she'll go

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.990 
berries no preservatives laden she'll go
in<00:02:00.330> on<00:02:00.690> our<00:02:01.020> antioxidants<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.040> yeah<00:02:02.730> so<00:02:02.880> they

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
in on our antioxidants and yeah so they

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.310 
in on our antioxidants and yeah so they
probably<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.570> many<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.840> those<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.230> I

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
probably get many of those because I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.450 
probably get many of those because I
still<00:02:04.620> don't<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:04.890> how<00:02:05.010> good<00:02:05.160> they<00:02:05.340> are<00:02:05.370> for

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
still don't know how good they are for

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.480 
still don't know how good they are for
them<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.600> they'd<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:06.900> like<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.050> treat<00:02:07.490> he'll

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
them but they'd be like a treat he'll

especially when it's got the dried fruit

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.510 
especially when it's got the dried fruit
because<00:02:42.959> they<00:02:43.260> love<00:02:43.470> drag<00:02:43.709> fruit<00:02:43.980> they

usually don't actually eat the music and
just<00:02:46.530> eat<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.830> dried<00:02:47.040> fruit<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:47.550> dried<00:02:48.240> fruit

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
just eat the dried fruit but dried fruit

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.170 
just eat the dried fruit but dried fruit
is<00:02:48.840> really<00:02:49.230> expensive<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:50.490> we<00:02:50.610> can<00:02:50.790> find<00:02:50.970> so

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
is really expensive that we can find so

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.400 
is really expensive that we can find so
we<00:02:51.390> don't<00:02:52.140> buy<00:02:52.500> them<00:02:52.740> just<00:02:53.160> plain<00:02:53.370> dried<00:02:53.580> fruit

we don't buy them just plain dried fruit

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.460 
we don't buy them just plain dried fruit
these<00:02:55.410> are<00:02:55.620> Cheerios<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.640> think<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.360> they<00:02:58.320> also

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470

these are Cheerios I think and they also
get<00:02:58.800> these<00:02:59.040> as<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> kind<00:02:59.880> of<00:03:00.000> treat<00:03:00.270> in<00:03:00.450> their

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630
