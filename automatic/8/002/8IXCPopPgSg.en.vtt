00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
suggest you leave them at home because a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.819 
suggest you leave them at home because a
car<00:00:38.700> ID<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.329> very<00:00:39.660> stressful<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> rabbit

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
car ID can be very stressful on a rabbit

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.069 
car ID can be very stressful on a rabbit
and<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.579> actually<00:00:42.059> stop<00:00:42.300> eating<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
and they can actually stop eating and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.150 
and they can actually stop eating and
they<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:43.950> into<00:00:44.899> GI<00:00:45.899> statuses<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:48.980> they<00:00:49.980> can

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
they can go into GI statuses or they can

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.700 
they can go into GI statuses or they can
get<00:00:50.280> dehydrated<00:00:50.780> heat<00:00:51.780> stroke<00:00:52.110> anything<00:00:52.590> like

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
get dehydrated heat stroke anything like

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.090 
get dehydrated heat stroke anything like
that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.439 
that
so<00:00:54.860> taking<00:00:55.860> car<00:00:56.670> rides<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.180> very

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
so taking car rides can be very

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.330 
so taking car rides can be very
stressful<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.989> rabbits<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:59.070> you're<00:00:59.250> not

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
but if your rabbit is an only rabbit

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.600 
but if your rabbit is an only rabbit
like<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.240> don't<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> bonded<00:01:16.110> pair<00:01:16.140> or<00:01:16.740> if

like you don't have a bonded pair or if

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
like you don't have a bonded pair or if
you<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.880> no<00:01:18.150> other<00:01:18.330> animals<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> house

you<00:02:32.160> leave<00:02:32.569> so<00:02:33.569> when<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.049> get<00:02:34.230> there<00:02:34.410> you

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
you leave so when you get there you

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.300 
you leave so when you get there you
won't<00:02:34.739> run<00:02:34.890> into<00:02:34.950> any<00:02:35.310> trouble

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
won't run into any trouble

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.920 
won't run into any trouble
also<00:02:38.310> oh<00:02:39.769> sorry<00:02:40.769> I'm<00:02:40.950> betting<00:02:41.280> Lulu<00:02:41.640> anyway<00:02:42.569> um

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
also oh sorry I'm betting Lulu anyway um

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.390 
also oh sorry I'm betting Lulu anyway um
so<00:02:46.940> also<00:02:47.940> when<00:02:48.420> bringing<00:02:48.690> them<00:02:48.959> with<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.400> it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
so also when bringing them with you it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.729 
so also when bringing them with you it
could<00:02:50.579> be<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> good<00:02:50.910> idea<00:02:51.000> because<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:52.019> can<00:02:52.349> you

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
could be a good idea because you can you

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.099 
could be a good idea because you can you
can<00:02:52.980> be<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.250> one<00:02:53.430> who<00:02:53.819> can<00:02:54.150> watch<00:02:54.359> them<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
can be the one who can watch them and

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.630 
can be the one who can watch them and
make<00:02:55.170> sure<00:02:55.470> they're<00:02:55.829> behaving<00:02:56.190> normally

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
make sure they're behaving normally

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.759 
make sure they're behaving normally
eating<00:02:57.510> normally<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.290> all<00:02:58.379> that<00:02:58.530> stuff

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
eating normally and all that stuff

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.640 
eating normally and all that stuff
because<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.940> know<00:02:59.970> their<00:03:00.329> behavior<00:03:00.900> behavior

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
because you know their behavior behavior

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.410 
because you know their behavior behavior
and<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.310> know<00:03:02.459> how<00:03:02.579> much<00:03:02.790> they<00:03:02.970> eat<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.359> drink

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
and you know how much they eat and drink

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.670 
and you know how much they eat and drink
so<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.319> will<00:03:04.859> be<00:03:05.010> able<00:03:05.129> to<00:03:05.250> recognize

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
so you will be able to recognize

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.030 
so you will be able to recognize
illnesses<00:03:07.680> easier<00:03:08.250> than<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> pet<00:03:08.760> sitter<00:03:08.970> would

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
illnesses easier than a pet sitter would

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.589 
illnesses easier than a pet sitter would
so<00:03:11.720> that's<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.930> good<00:03:13.819> reason<00:03:14.819> why<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.299> could

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
so that's a good reason why you could

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.400 
so that's a good reason why you could
take<00:03:15.780> them<00:03:15.930> with<00:03:16.079> you<00:03:16.819> I<00:03:17.819> know<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.840> have<00:03:19.109> taken

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
take them with you I know I have taken

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.039

my<00:03:19.680> rabbits<00:03:20.130> before<00:03:20.870> I've<00:03:21.870> taken<00:03:22.169> mine<00:03:22.639> like

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
my rabbits before I've taken mine like

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
places before only for a few days but

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.800 
places before only for a few days but
I've<00:03:28.500> only<00:03:28.620> done<00:03:28.889> it<00:03:28.950> like<00:03:29.160> twice<00:03:29.540> once<00:03:30.540> was

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
I've only done it like twice once was

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.229 
I've only done it like twice once was
because<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.230> was<00:03:31.620> bonding<00:03:32.160> them<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.639> when

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
because I was bonding them and when

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.990 
because I was bonding them and when
bonding<00:03:33.630> rabbits<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.459> take<00:03:35.489> them<00:03:35.880> in

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
bonding rabbits and and you take them in

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.240 
bonding rabbits and and you take them in
the<00:03:36.030> car<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.660> gives<00:03:37.560> them<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.829> little<00:03:38.099> bit<00:03:38.220> of

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
the car it gives them a little bit of

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.870 
the car it gives them a little bit of
stress<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:40.739> two<00:03:40.950> rabbits<00:03:41.370> tend<00:03:41.730> to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
stress so that the two rabbits tend to

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.300 
stress so that the two rabbits tend to
cuddle<00:03:42.269> towards<00:03:42.599> each<00:03:42.720> other<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:43.829> helps

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
cuddle towards each other so that helps

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.440 
cuddle towards each other so that helps
bond<00:03:44.549> them<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.349> second<00:03:46.349> time<00:03:46.530> was<00:03:46.919> I<00:03:47.450> didn't
