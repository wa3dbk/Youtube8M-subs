I<00:00:52.160> don't<00:00:52.280> look<00:00:52.489> at<00:00:52.640> my<00:00:52.760> splits<00:00:53.150> as<00:00:53.270> I<00:00:53.360> do<00:00:53.420> the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
I don't look at my splits as I do the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.140 
I don't look at my splits as I do the
first<00:00:53.809> couple<00:00:54.050> reps<00:00:54.380> at<00:00:55.370> least<00:00:55.550> 400<00:00:55.970> meter

first couple reps at least 400 meter
splits<00:00:56.390> I<00:00:56.480> just<00:00:56.629> look<00:00:57.110> at<00:00:57.230> it<00:00:57.379> tap<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.650> at<00:00:57.830> the

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
splits I just look at it tap it at the

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.090 
splits I just look at it tap it at the
end<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.580> kilometer<00:00:59.210> split<00:00:59.540> and<00:00:59.690> I<00:01:00.500> kind<00:01:01.040> of

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
end of the kilometer split and I kind of

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.979 
end of the kilometer split and I kind of
go<00:01:01.190> by<00:01:01.309> feeling<00:01:01.580> that<00:01:01.850> way<00:01:02.000> but<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:02.300> is<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:02.629> look

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
go by feeling that way but it is I look

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.090 
go by feeling that way but it is I look
at<00:01:03.080> my<00:01:03.199> heart<00:01:03.379> rate<00:01:03.500> as<00:01:03.650> well<00:01:03.830> and<00:01:03.980> it's

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
at my heart rate as well and it's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.410 
at my heart rate as well and it's
definitely<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.550> be<00:01:04.640> over<00:01:04.790> 90<00:01:05.030> percent

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
definitely to be over 90 percent

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.750 
definitely to be over 90 percent
probably<00:01:06.200> maximum<00:01:06.620> heart<00:01:06.800> rate<00:01:06.830> not<00:01:07.520> quite

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
probably maximum heart rate not quite

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.399 
probably maximum heart rate not quite
touching<00:01:07.910> on<00:01:08.180> 5k<00:01:08.510> or<00:01:08.540> 10k<00:01:08.630> pace<00:01:09.050> because<00:01:09.290> it's

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
touching on 5k or 10k pace because it's

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.930 
touching on 5k or 10k pace because it's
too<00:01:09.560> hard<00:01:09.740> for<00:01:09.890> me<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.070> do<00:01:10.190> at<00:01:10.280> altitude<00:01:10.730> and

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
too hard for me to do at altitude and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.450 
too hard for me to do at altitude and
the<00:01:11.420> stiffness<00:01:11.840> in<00:01:11.960> my<00:01:12.080> legs<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:12.530> is<00:01:13.070> still

of the lung getting heart rate up
inducing<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.150> little<00:01:29.360> bit<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.540> lactic<00:01:29.840> acid<00:01:30.230> and

mainly just working on that leg turnover

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.490 
mainly just working on that leg turnover
because<00:01:32.360> that's<00:01:32.600> what<00:01:32.720> really<00:01:32.840> hurt<00:01:33.080> me<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.260> LA

enough<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:35.630> see<00:01:36.350> what<00:01:36.470> kind<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.650> split<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.070> we

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
enough so see what kind of split so we

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.130 
enough so see what kind of split so we
could<00:01:37.370> run<00:01:37.460> today<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.810> see<00:01:38.810> what<00:01:38.930> kind<00:01:39.080> of

pain<00:01:39.680> there<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.180> here<00:01:41.180> we<00:01:41.240> go<00:01:41.420> rep<00:01:42.140> one

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.219

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
3:01 it's a pretty fast if i dial back a

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.110 
3:01 it's a pretty fast if i dial back a
little<00:02:06.470> bit<00:02:07.060> but<00:02:08.060> uh<00:02:08.470> not<00:02:09.470> too<00:02:09.679> crazy<00:02:10.120> there's

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
definitely a pain on these I think in

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.839 
definitely a pain on these I think in
the<00:02:13.700> video<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.959> don't<00:02:15.080> see<00:02:15.519> maybe<00:02:16.519> how<00:02:16.700> much

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
the video you don't see maybe how much

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.000 
the video you don't see maybe how much
I'm<00:02:17.000> struggling<00:02:17.360> but<00:02:17.780> it's<00:02:18.680> always<00:02:18.830> this

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
I'm struggling but it's always this

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.170 
I'm struggling but it's always this
internal<00:02:19.400> struggle<00:02:19.430> with<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:19.910> mental

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
internal struggle with the mental

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.420 
internal struggle with the mental
discipline<00:02:20.599> to<00:02:20.860> run<00:02:21.860> these<00:02:22.010> reps<00:02:22.250> at<00:02:22.400> a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
discipline to run these reps at a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.300 
discipline to run these reps at a
high-end<00:02:22.610> pace<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.269> I<00:02:23.510> fail<00:02:24.410> more<00:02:24.739> with<00:02:25.220> my

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
high-end pace and I fail more with my

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.340 
high-end pace and I fail more with my
leg<00:02:25.489> muscles<00:02:25.640> rather<00:02:26.090> than<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.989> heart<00:02:27.170> lungs

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
leg muscles rather than the heart lungs

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.800 
leg muscles rather than the heart lungs
are<00:02:27.500> off<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.680> bat<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:28.209> keep<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.330> rolling<00:02:29.630> with

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
are off the bat but keep it rolling with

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:44.040 
are off the bat but keep it rolling with
a<00:02:30.010> two<00:02:31.010> minute<00:02:31.130> recovery<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.450> go<00:02:32.569> again

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.460 

2069

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
3:01 again who a little too quick

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.420 
3:01 again who a little too quick
go<00:02:55.030> on<00:02:55.150> accumulate<00:02:55.540> too<00:02:55.660> much<00:02:55.780> black<00:02:56.170> date

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
go on accumulate too much black date

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.540 
go on accumulate too much black date
like<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.670> said<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:59.470> it's<00:02:59.769> good<00:02:59.950> good<00:03:00.160> leg

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
like I said but it's good good leg

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.110 
like I said but it's good good leg
turnover

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
turnover

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.860 
turnover
 you<00:03:01.930> be<00:03:02.019> gone<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.700> it's<00:03:03.819> not<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.000> 500<00:03:04.420> store

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
 you be gone so it's not a 500 store

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.300 
 you be gone so it's not a 500 store
maybe<00:03:05.110> hopefully<00:03:05.650> even<00:03:05.980> pissed

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.760 

yeah

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.570 

take<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:21.550> through<00:03:22.550> it<00:03:22.610> one<00:03:22.760> again<00:03:24.070> that's<00:03:25.070> good

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
take it through it one again that's good

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.650 
take it through it one again that's good
felt<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.510> little<00:03:26.600> easier<00:03:27.130> but<00:03:28.130> uh<00:03:28.390> but<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.420> can't

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
felt a little easier but uh but I can't

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.110 
felt a little easier but uh but I can't
sustain<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:30.280> nobody<00:03:31.280> okay<00:03:31.490> if<00:03:31.580> I'm<00:03:31.670> close<00:03:31.910> at

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
sustain it nobody okay if I'm close at

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:45.180 
sustain it nobody okay if I'm close at
least<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.160> keep<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.250> going<00:03:34.490> three<00:03:34.670> down

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.619

Oh three foot supposed to be slower so
so<00:04:23.130> we're<00:04:23.250> covering<00:04:23.400> uh<00:04:23.750> gonna<00:04:24.750> deliberately

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
so we're covering uh gonna deliberately

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.230 
so we're covering uh gonna deliberately
run<00:04:25.470> these<00:04:25.590> next<00:04:25.860> two<00:04:26.010> more<00:04:26.430> relaxed<00:04:26.910> oh<00:04:27.000> boy

run these next two more relaxed oh boy
my<00:04:28.050> form<00:04:28.320> was<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.740> was<00:04:29.040> straining<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.520> bit<00:04:29.700> on

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
my form was I was straining a bit on

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.909 
my form was I was straining a bit on
those<00:04:30.150> no<00:04:31.020> one<00:04:31.050> involved<00:04:31.350> too<00:04:31.560> much<00:04:31.680> lactic

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
those no one involved too much lactic

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.920 
those no one involved too much lactic
acid<00:04:32.280> put<00:04:32.400> myself<00:04:32.520> in<00:04:32.790> a<00:04:32.850> hole<00:04:32.880> harder<00:04:33.840> and

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
acid put myself in a hole harder and

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.200 
acid put myself in a hole harder and
faster<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.260> not<00:04:34.290> always<00:04:34.530> better<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:35.210> getting

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
faster is not always better so getting

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.150 
faster is not always better so getting
in<00:04:36.300> speed<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.600> need<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.169> now<00:04:37.950> if<00:04:38.010> these<00:04:38.100> are

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
in speed I need so now if these are

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.230 
in speed I need so now if these are
three<00:04:38.430> or<00:04:38.490> three<00:04:38.550> three<00:04:38.760> or<00:04:38.850> four<00:04:39.030> it's<00:04:39.120> going

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
three or three three or four it's going

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:50.530 
three or three three or four it's going
to<00:04:39.300> be<00:04:39.389> okay<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:42.710> can<00:04:43.710> feel<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.010> lactate

ha throughout - so my heart rate it's

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.770 
ha throughout - so my heart rate it's
only<00:04:56.910> 173<00:04:57.810> but<00:04:58.040> feels<00:04:59.040> way<00:04:59.220> harder<00:04:59.550> so<00:05:00.450> muscles

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
only 173 but feels way harder so muscles

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.800 
only 173 but feels way harder so muscles
are<00:05:00.900> tired<00:05:02.330> good<00:05:03.330> more<00:05:04.280> alright<00:05:05.280> so<00:05:05.750> got<00:05:06.750> to

are tired good more alright so got to
keep<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.110> controlled<00:05:08.060> definitely<00:05:09.060> hurt<00:05:09.240> and

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
keep it controlled definitely hurt and

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.260 
keep it controlled definitely hurt and
feeling<00:05:10.350> some<00:05:10.500> lactate<00:05:10.919> lactic<00:05:11.550> acid<00:05:11.910> forming

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
feeling some lactate lactic acid forming

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.170 
feeling some lactate lactic acid forming
in<00:05:12.870> my<00:05:12.930> arms<00:05:13.320> even<00:05:13.530> we<00:05:14.430> got<00:05:14.580> to<00:05:14.700> keep<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:14.910> form

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
in my arms even we got to keep the form

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.600 
in my arms even we got to keep the form
together<00:05:15.590> keep<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.710> turnover<00:05:17.160> up<00:05:17.280> that's

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
together keep the turnover up that's

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.760 
together keep the turnover up that's
important<00:05:18.060> but<00:05:18.180> plenty<00:05:19.080> fast<00:05:19.290> it's<00:05:19.620> been

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
important but plenty fast it's been

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.219 
important but plenty fast it's been
plenty<00:05:20.040> fast<00:05:20.190> already<00:05:20.669> so<00:05:20.880> here<00:05:21.660> we<00:05:21.780> go<00:05:21.900> second

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
plenty fast already so here we go second

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:33.390 
plenty fast already so here we go second
last<00:05:22.410> stroke<00:05:23.600> beautiful<00:05:24.600> day

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
three one that you're supposed to take

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:46.589 
three one that you're supposed to take
it<00:05:38.330> down<00:05:38.659> a<00:05:38.689> notch

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.520 

one<00:05:47.599> more<00:05:49.240> what<00:05:50.240> happened<00:05:50.689> in<00:05:50.810> it<00:05:50.960> taking<00:05:51.379> it

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
one more what happened in it taking it

one more what happened in it taking it
easy

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159

easy
yeah<00:05:52.490> I<00:05:52.879> thought<00:05:53.750> I<00:05:53.810> was<00:05:54.020> slowing<00:05:54.379> down<00:05:54.530> but<00:05:54.860> I

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
yeah I thought I was slowing down but I

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.020 
yeah I thought I was slowing down but I
definitely<00:05:56.180> feel<00:05:56.509> myself<00:05:56.780> tying<00:05:57.229> up<00:05:57.439> a<00:05:57.560> bit<00:05:57.740> so

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
definitely feel myself tying up a bit so

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.309 
definitely feel myself tying up a bit so
we'll<00:05:59.030> see<00:05:59.409> more<00:06:00.409> the<00:06:00.560> same<00:06:00.770> in<00:06:00.889> the<00:06:00.979> last<00:06:01.159> one

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
we'll see more the same in the last one

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.179 
we'll see more the same in the last one
got<00:06:03.319> to<00:06:03.439> keep<00:06:03.560> good<00:06:03.710> for<00:06:03.979> him<00:06:04.069> that's

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:04.189 
got to keep good for him that's

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.390 
got to keep good for him that's
important<00:06:04.610> thing<00:06:05.229> when<00:06:06.229> sage<00:06:06.590> does<00:06:06.979> not<00:06:07.219> for
