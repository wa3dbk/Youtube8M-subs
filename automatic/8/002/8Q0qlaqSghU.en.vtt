00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.650

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.800

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.680
 declared winner beenox la 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.900
 owner Novoli Chandler revealed 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.880
 that his ugliness and is due to the fact 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.769
 that when he was just a puppy he was 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.670
 victim of burn-up abuse 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:35.670
 every part of the body 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:47.680
 here are some words stolen from the speech of 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:50.640
 pinus thanks is ok but thanks 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.040
 sorry yes i know 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.470
 it is not the maximum as the beginning of a 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.440
 speech but you want to do us 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.010
 I what I think I say then 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.750
 don't expect obvious words from me 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.350
 type I want to dedicate this award is the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.430
 my agent I have to my mother and others 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.890
 candidates also really ugly to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.800
 poor in africa or those next to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.020
 we are there too so it's pretty for 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.330
 spend take advantage and glory 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.789
 of the moment to focus on 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.100
 my inability but if we are honest about e 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.440
 when you win it is beautiful 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.960
 okay but that's not all good 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.509
 that you see and then in my case the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.860
 literal sense 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.710
 certainly some will argue that 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.860
 the physical aspect is not all there is 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.580
 they are other qualities like here 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.789
 let's be clear right away it's not my case 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.310
 hence the above excuses the fact is 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:57.210
 that besides being ugly I don't know 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.850
 do nothing I said to me now now 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.650
 I feel better and I'm not capable of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.350
 bring back the stick or a ball then 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.780
 so it is useless for you to withdraw there 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.489
 now gives the hand not 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.730
 kneel down waiting for the miracle 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.519
 peppe then my back hurts 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.709
 and I do festi anyone even 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.959
 my mistress and if I don't do who I am 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.540
 feeds because the captain redo them to you 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.760
 that I don't know you, never wags his tail 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.570
 never ever even when I'm happy 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.420
 especially in that case I am alone 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.060
 emotionally reserved speaking 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.670
 then why don't you grit your teeth 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.810
 when when anger is healthy and but 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.720
 this that does not mean that not 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.330
 rode me don't run cats of any kind 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.630
 what else to not in the bathroom and not only 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.440
 minute 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.450
 ok i only talk when something really comes from 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.840
 say and just that whenever that 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.500
 a terrible doubt happens inside 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.550
 itself but we are sure that whoever is me 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.130
 front 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.140
 is really listening and so I bite 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.810
 the tongue a moment before issuing a 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.650
 breath read me as well as the taciturn 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:16.120
 distrustful of the aching tongue 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.730
 thanks for the prize, however, forgive me 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.910
 if I can't do anything about it myself 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.910
 I grieve 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.799
 I am very proud of my own 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.069
 incapacity I would never know how to hurt 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.470
 to any creature on earth 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.930
 torturing her with inhuman cruelty 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.950
 in this man will always be better than 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.950
 me or incredibly uglier
