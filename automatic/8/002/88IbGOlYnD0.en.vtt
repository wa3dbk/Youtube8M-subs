your<00:01:00.300> squad<00:01:00.809> yeah<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.949> about

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
your squad yeah I think it's just about

your squad yeah I think it's just about
remaining<00:01:02.699> positive<00:01:03.470> you<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:05.010> as<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
remaining positive you know I think as I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
remaining positive you know I think as I
said<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.060> showed<00:01:06.810> true<00:01:07.170> fighting<00:01:07.619> spirit<00:01:08.010> at

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
said we showed true fighting spirit at

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.830 
said we showed true fighting spirit at
the<00:01:08.189> end<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.549> think<00:01:08.580> we've<00:01:08.880> both<00:01:09.090> games<00:01:09.479> we've

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the end I think we've both games we've

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.980 
the end I think we've both games we've
showed<00:01:10.350> real<00:01:10.770> spirit<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> come<00:01:11.520> back

unfortunate<00:01:12.990> against<00:01:13.229> Spain<00:01:13.760> but<00:01:14.760> certainly

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
unfortunate against Spain but certainly

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.100 
unfortunate against Spain but certainly

against Russia in the 92nd plus minute
and<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.590> shows<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> lot<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.100> character<00:01:20.640> we

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.370 
build-up into this tournament has been
exceptional<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.060> England<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.540> think<00:01:46.200> so

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
exceptional for England I think so

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.539 
exceptional for England I think so
certainly<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> last<00:01:47.159> couple<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.490> years

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
certainly in the last couple of years

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.219 
certainly in the last couple of years
we've<00:01:47.759> done<00:01:48.060> we've<00:01:48.360> done<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.869> well<00:01:49.170> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
we've done we've done really well I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.149 
we've done we've done really well I
think<00:01:50.119> we've<00:01:51.119> sent<00:01:51.360> our<00:01:51.659> mark<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.470> women's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
think we've sent our mark on on women's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.700 
think we've sent our mark on on women's
football<00:01:53.399> globally<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.290> include<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
football globally if you include the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.260 
football globally if you include the
Olympics<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.460> all<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> games<00:01:57.030> before

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that we haven't lost and it's just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.959

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
we do well hopefully we'll get the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.449 
we do well hopefully we'll get the
result<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.940> hopefully<00:03:25.299> we'll<00:03:25.480> stay<00:03:25.750> if<00:03:26.019> not

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
result and hopefully we'll stay if not

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.830 
result and hopefully we'll stay if not
we're<00:03:27.459> going<00:03:27.639> home<00:03:27.819> but<00:03:28.000> i<00:03:28.060> must<00:03:28.510> say<00:03:28.660> one

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
we're going home but i must say one

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.420 
we're going home but i must say one
thing<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:29.170> won't<00:03:29.290> be<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:29.920> hasn't<00:03:30.310> been

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
thing it won't be and it hasn't been

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.400 
thing it won't be and it hasn't been
because<00:03:30.609> of<00:03:30.819> lack<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.480> effort<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:32.139> think

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
because of lack of effort I think

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.470 
because of lack of effort I think
everybody's<00:03:32.889> given<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.790> hundred<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.269> ten

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
everybody's given a hundred and ten

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.270 
everybody's given a hundred and ten
percent<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.200> think<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.560> proved<00:03:35.829> that<00:03:36.010> gets

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
percent I think it proved that gets

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.890 
percent I think it proved that gets
Russia<00:03:36.549> in<00:03:36.819> the<00:03:36.849> line<00:03:37.090> minutes<00:03:37.480> proved<00:03:37.780> it

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
Russia in the line minutes proved it

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.410 
Russia in the line minutes proved it
against<00:03:38.139> Spain<00:03:39.069> we<00:03:39.609> just<00:03:39.819> know<00:03:40.000> we're<00:03:40.209> not

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
against Spain we just know we're not

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.990 
against Spain we just know we're not
playing<00:03:40.989> our<00:03:41.139> best<00:03:41.170> football<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.099> France

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
playing our best football and France

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.250

have<00:03:43.150> been<00:03:43.480> playing<00:03:43.720> well<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.019> routine

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
have been playing well the routine

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.539 
have been playing well the routine
you're<00:03:44.410> very<00:03:44.620> familiar<00:03:44.769> with<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.430> always

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
you're very familiar with and you always

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.400

have very very close games against what

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.990 
have very very close games against what
do<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:47.560> think<00:03:47.739> about<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:48.010> fronts<00:03:48.250> team<00:03:48.400> as

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
do you think about the fronts team as

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.330 
do you think about the fronts team as
you<00:03:49.180> said<00:03:49.389> very<00:03:49.690> good<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.019> think<00:03:50.200> they're<00:03:50.650> you

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
you said very good I think they're you

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.640 
you said very good I think they're you
know<00:03:52.269> they<00:03:52.540> back<00:03:52.750> themselves<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.349> go<00:03:53.440> all<00:03:53.620> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
know they back themselves to go all the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.990 
know they back themselves to go all the
way<00:03:53.739> don't<00:03:54.040> they<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:54.579> they're<00:03:54.790> high<00:03:54.970> on

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
way don't they so they're high on

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.569 
way don't they so they're high on
confidence<00:03:55.380> they've<00:03:56.380> already<00:03:56.530> got<00:03:57.280> out<00:03:57.430> of

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
confidence they've already got out of

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.009 
confidence they've already got out of
the<00:03:57.639> group<00:03:57.849> I<00:03:58.120> don't<00:03:58.359> think<00:03:58.630> that's<00:03:58.810> going<00:03:58.959> to

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
the group I don't think that's going to

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.690 
the group I don't think that's going to
have<00:03:59.169> any<00:03:59.410> bearing<00:03:59.769> on<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.160> way<00:04:00.280> they<00:04:00.430> play

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
have any bearing on the way they play
