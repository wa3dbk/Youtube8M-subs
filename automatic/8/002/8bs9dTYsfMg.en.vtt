00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.089 
so yes now I'm not one to normally
straight<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:30.810> hair<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.050> usually<00:00:31.529> always<00:00:31.679> style

straight my hair I usually always style
my<00:00:32.279> hair<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.329> way<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.110> naturally

my hair just the way that it naturally
goes<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.570> figured<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.469> maybe<00:00:37.620> there's<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

straightening your hair that is

straightening your hair that is
important<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.170> think<00:00:49.230> before<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.460> attempt<00:00:51.949> as

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
important I think before you attempt as

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.799 
important I think before you attempt as
most<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> probably<00:00:53.520> already<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:54.239> heat

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
most of you probably already know heat

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
most of you probably already know heat
in<00:00:55.110> general<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.800> not<00:00:55.829> very<00:00:56.250> good<00:00:56.430> through<00:00:56.640> here

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
in general is not very good through here

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
in general is not very good through here
there<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.390> things<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> kind

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
there are things that you can do to kind

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.369 
there are things that you can do to kind
of<00:00:58.500> balance<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.250> badness<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> he<00:00:59.969> does

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
of balance out the badness that he does

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.470 
of balance out the badness that he does
with<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.739> good<00:01:01.980> things<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.309> hair<00:01:02.640> oils<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
with with good things like hair oils a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.539 
with with good things like hair oils a
good<00:01:03.930> shampoo<00:01:04.350> always<00:01:05.040> using<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.369> heat

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
good shampoo always using a heat

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.260 
good shampoo always using a heat
protectant

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
protectant

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.090 
protectant
so<00:01:06.570> these<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.470> basics<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.950> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
so these are all the basics that you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.460 
so these are all the basics that you
really<00:01:08.850> should<00:01:09.060> apply<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.689> when<00:01:10.170> you're<00:01:10.290> using

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
really should apply to when you're using

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.100 
really should apply to when you're using
a<00:01:10.799> straightener<00:01:11.250> because<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.299> blow-dryer<00:01:12.960> is

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
a straightener because a blow-dryer is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
a straightener because a blow-dryer is
one<00:01:13.320> thing<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> straightener<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
one thing but a straightener is like a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.510 
one thing but a straightener is like a
whole<00:01:14.939> nother<00:01:15.090> level<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.780> heat<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:17.460> be

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
whole nother level of heat that can be

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
whole nother level of heat that can be
really<00:01:17.820> damaging<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.780> take<00:01:19.020> care

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
really damaging if you don't take care

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800 
really damaging if you don't take care
of<00:01:19.229> your<00:01:19.350> hair<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.100> me<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.369> must<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> always

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
of your hair so for me a must is always

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.050 
of your hair so for me a must is always
using<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.500> heat<00:01:22.710> protectant<00:01:23.250> before

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
using a heat protectant before

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.550 
using a heat protectant before
straightening<00:01:24.750> your<00:01:24.900> hair<00:01:24.960> when<00:01:25.470> you're

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
straightening your hair when you're

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
straightening your hair when you're
using<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.920> blow-dryer<00:01:26.100> you're<00:01:26.580> blowing<00:01:26.970> hot

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
using a blow-dryer you're blowing hot

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.630 
using a blow-dryer you're blowing hot
air<00:01:27.270> into<00:01:27.960> your<00:01:28.110> hair<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:29.100> like

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
air into your hair and it's not like

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
air into your hair and it's not like
direct<00:01:30.030> contact<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:30.990> also<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.500> hot

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
direct contact and it's also not as hot

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.440 
direct contact and it's also not as hot
but<00:01:32.009> when<00:01:32.250> you're<00:01:32.369> using<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.790> straightener

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
but when you're using a straightener

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450 
but when you're using a straightener
this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.860> I've<00:01:34.979> got<00:01:35.130> pretty

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
this is the one that I've got pretty

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.190 
this is the one that I've got pretty
cool<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> green<00:01:36.420> when<00:01:36.780> you're<00:01:36.869> using<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
cool I like a green when you're using a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.760 
cool I like a green when you're using a
straight<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:39.380> when<00:01:40.380> you're<00:01:40.439> using<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
straight in there when you're using a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.380 
straight in there when you're using a
straightener<00:01:41.130> you're<00:01:41.340> directly<00:01:42.090> applying

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
straightener you're directly applying

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.910 
straightener you're directly applying
the<00:01:42.570> heat<00:01:42.720> from<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> straightener<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.770> your

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the heat from the straightener to your

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.510 
the heat from the straightener to your
hair<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.360> closer<00:01:45.600> contact<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
hair so it's a lot closer contact and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.550 
hair so it's a lot closer contact and
and<00:01:47.000> also<00:01:47.150> it's<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.420> lot<00:01:47.450> hotter<00:01:47.810> for<00:01:48.229> example

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
and also it's a lot hotter for example

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.390 
and also it's a lot hotter for example
this<00:01:48.680> one<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.159> believe<00:01:49.820> is<00:01:50.090> either<00:01:50.350> 425<00:01:51.350> or<00:01:51.619> 450

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
this one I believe is either 425 or 450

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.530 
this one I believe is either 425 or 450
degrees<00:01:52.729> Fahrenheit<00:01:53.080> which<00:01:54.080> is<00:01:54.710> pretty<00:01:55.280> hard

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
degrees Fahrenheit which is pretty hard

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.850 
degrees Fahrenheit which is pretty hard
another<00:01:56.990> thing<00:01:57.200> when<00:01:57.350> you're<00:01:57.500> straightening

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
another thing when you're straightening

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.320 
another thing when you're straightening
your<00:01:58.159> hair<00:01:58.270> it's<00:01:59.270> better<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.869> go<00:02:00.080> slow<00:02:00.409> enough

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
your hair it's better to go slow enough

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.300 
your hair it's better to go slow enough
so<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.390> only<00:02:02.630> have<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:03.080> do<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.470> motion<00:02:03.710> once

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
so you only have to do the motion once

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.639 
so you only have to do the motion once
or<00:02:04.490> twice<00:02:04.700> rather<00:02:05.210> than<00:02:05.450> quickly<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.229> having

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
or twice rather than quickly and having

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.199 
or twice rather than quickly and having
to<00:02:06.770> repeatedly<00:02:07.310> straighten<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.000> same

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
to repeatedly straighten the same

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.669 
to repeatedly straighten the same
section<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.810> hair<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:09.170> forget<00:02:09.530> what<00:02:09.649> my

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.880 
straightener I'll follow it kind of
using<00:03:48.880> my<00:03:48.910> comb<00:03:49.270> as<00:03:49.540> leverage<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.590> then<00:03:50.740> my

straightening once you reach the fringe
area<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.300> might<00:04:10.450> be<00:04:10.570> easier<00:04:10.840> just<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.080> use<00:04:11.170> your

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260

gonna<00:04:14.230> mess<00:04:14.800> around<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:15.130> see<00:04:15.280> what<00:04:15.430> works<00:04:15.580> best

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
like making it completely straight

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.700

because<00:04:40.990> then<00:04:41.140> it<00:04:41.260> just<00:04:41.410> doesn't<00:04:41.650> look

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
because then it just doesn't look

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.330 
because then it just doesn't look
