 so they are perfect for the party 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.340
 the preparation time and the time of 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.290
 combined cooking approximately 30 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.700
 minutes and then the time for the 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.740
 decoration is going to be about 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.759
 10 to 15 minutes I hope this video 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.759
 like it, let's start 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.840
 you will find the list of ingredients in 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.850
 the description of this video and also 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.309
 you will find it in my blog where 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.230
 can print the full recipe 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.170
 let's start preheat the oven to 180 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.300
 degrees centigrade are 350 degrees 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.430
 fahrenheit let's combine the flour 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.470
 with cinnamon salt the powder for 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.720
 bake and baking soda and 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.190
 also the cocoa powder stir well 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.550
 until everything is well mixed and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.110
 reserve this for a moment now in 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.240
 an electric mixer we are going to mix 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.399
 butter with brown sugar and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.530
 the eggs we are going to add the eggs 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.270
 one at a time and mixing each egg by 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.580
 about 30 seconds before adding the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.660
 next as the last egg is left 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 well mixed with the ingredients 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.170
 then we will add the extract 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.050
 of vanilla and we will also add 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.440
 the applesauce as you can see I'm 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.240
 beating everything at medium speed to 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.009
 this recipe we do not need to that the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 butter is creamy only 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.259
 we want to mix everything together so why 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.350
 that I'm adding to ingredient after 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.390
 ingredient without mixing much we are going to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.060
 mix this for about 40 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.350
 seconds or a minute so everything is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.090
 well combined 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.580
 how can you see the mixture of 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.470
 liquid is somewhat foggy because it does not 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.390
 We beat the butter a lot but I do not know 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.979
 worry like that should stay like this is 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.380
 perfectly for making brownies 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.420
 for the next step we are not going to 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 use the blender now on the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.180
 butter mixture let's sift 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.430
 the mixture of flour and cocoa 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.050
 and with a spatula we are going to stir for 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.300
 everything is well incorporated in a 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.190
 soft dough be careful not to mix 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.900
 others just want to incorporate the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.030
 liquid ingredients to the ingredients 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.069
 unmixed dry but others 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.080
 since the ingredients are combined 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.880
 now let's oil and flour 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.610
 our mold 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.620
 I am using a mold of 17.5 x 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.840
 28 centimeters but can use a 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.120
 larger mold so that the brownies 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.770
 do not keep them that big because the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.590
 mold is prepared now empty in the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.330
 mix the brownies in the mold and with 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.280
 the spatula smooth on the surface 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.260
 so that they are even and now if 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.750
 let's join the brownies to 180 degrees 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.640
 centigrade for about 20 or 25 minutes or 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.620
 until they are well cooked not the 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.200
 The brownies are more than usual 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.360
 they are ready in 20 minutes they will know that 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.370
 the brownies are ready when 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.980
 insert a toothpick in the center and this 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.540
 come out with a little bit of bread and 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.160
 since the brownies are ready they are going to 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.950
 let them cool completely to 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.780
 can decorate them here I have the brownie 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.400
 already cold as you can see and cut it by 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.530
 half also to make the brownies 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.140
 and then I'm going to cut each half in 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.510
 thirds so that I stay in rectangles 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.580
 to decorate the brownies I'm also 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.860
 using semi-sweet chocolate I'm 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.799
 using approximately one third of 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.450
 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.310
 and I'm going to melt them alone 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.920
 I'm going to put them in the microwave 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.569
 30 seconds after 30 seconds the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.760
 I'm going to stir a little bit and I'm going to 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.430
 put again in the microwave by others 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.739
 30 seconds and so on until 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.720
 that are well melted I'm also 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.510
 using these chocolate skeletons 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.000
 white to make the skeletons I bought 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.700
 a mold in michaels that cost me 99 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.410
 cents and brought the holes for the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.480
 skeleton and only rett and a 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.310
 little chocolate and empty it in the 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.410
 mold and then refrigerate them so that 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.989
 they remain solid and afterwards they are 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.849
 ready now I'm going to cut a little bit of the 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.160
 outline of the brownies only a 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.780
 little bit of the outline and then I'm going to 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.920
 crumble this so that I stay 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.989
 crumbs 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.489
 the crumbs are for decoration I'm going 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.190
 to use as if they were a little 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.870
 earth and now I'm going to decorate them here 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.459
 I already have melted chocolate now 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.140
 with a small knife or with a 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.730
 spoon let's smear the chocolate 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.190
 melted on the surface of the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.139
 brownies only on the surface and 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.940
 it's just a little bit is a layer 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.280
 thin chocolate 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.010
 chocolate will only help us 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.660
 keep the crumbs attached to the brownie 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.420
 and it will also help us to make the 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.160
 skeleton does not move from the place after 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.660
 to add the melted chocolate now 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.000
 we're going to decorate them with the skeletons 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.530
 of white chocolate can add the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.570
 white chocolate like you want 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.250
 they want to give the effect as if the 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.410
 skeleton was trying to get away 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.060
 from the grave so be creative and 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.370
 add so many little bones of chocolate 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.169
 as you want and after this 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.969
 let's color the brownie crumbs 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.500
 about the skeletons about 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.510
 cupcakes 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.700
 you can add as much crumb as you 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.770
 they believe necessary as I tell them 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.110
 crumbs of bread will give the effect that it is 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.390
 land as if it were the land that 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.330
 skeletons are digging to be able 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.460
 get out of the grave to make it fast 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.030
 I'm just using these 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.030
 chocolate cookies 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.770
 and I'm also going to smear the surface 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.750
 of the cookie with a little bit of 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.580
 chocolate only a little bit of 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.580
 chocolate to soften the surface 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.040
 and after this I'm going to write something 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.040
 about the quick on the cookie and 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.160
 I'm just putting r &amp; b that this is 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.529
 sad in English and rest in peace in 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.299
 Spanish 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.129
 you can write what you 

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:38.779
 they want they can put a name or they can 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.139
 put a cross or some flowers what 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:44.149
 you want to be creative then 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.129
 The tombstone was also decorated 

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:48.289
 brownie is already decorated now we are going 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.879
 to join and for the tombstone to adhere 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.740
 we're going to add the brownie 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:54.509
 a little more chocolate 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.849
 we are only going to add a little 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.860
 of chocolate at the bottom of the 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.229
 cookie and let's put the tombstone together 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.389
 the grave or let's put the cookie together 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.590
 the brownie and we're going to press a 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.300
 little bit so it's stuck 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.800
 and that's it, that 's how they are 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.050
 our graves as you can see are given 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.210
 super nice and also that the brownies 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.010
 they are delicious indeed 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.900
