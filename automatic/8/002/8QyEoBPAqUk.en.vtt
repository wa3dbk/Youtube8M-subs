00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.129
 or plans will do a demonstration here see a payment 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.040
 lm customer who is there in São Paulo is a friend of mine and he is also paying 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.629
 on a real credit card 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.299
 all covered up 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.260
 everything Jorge is going there is a new break she nor the usual machine, that is 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:23.859
 the locator 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.860
 that the shopkeeper has 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.560
 each tenant who has access to the criminal 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.070
 and now they will put the cell phone 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.270
 that Roberto would pass me at the top surrounds piracicaba 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.810
 he is already a customer of the department 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.480
 and already have your card already linked so you will not need me to pass the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.360
 number of the card with the prototypes as it works 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.040
 with the bruising of the roberto wing we will see 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.579
 k 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.579
 OK 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.410
 is that this team and I remember who will spend here a real and five cents 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.480
 his new card 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.210
 obviously he has to agree with this is not because there is a routine of 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.300
 safety 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.430
 How can they come here? 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.530
 the method has one in the total parent account that has even installed to do 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.500
 this payment 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.870
 I could have chosen to have this option of having everything paid such pietá and 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.009
 taking the prepaid account well, but will not stand still until you fall 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.300
 which is so I'll stop here with a stack art here the system already shows that 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.360
 in installments list seen on the wheel 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.870
 already seen there is a person chooses here said that the process that the shopkeeper is 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.950
 making 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.950
 and now I'm going to continue 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 now the authorizer will process tico here 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.670
 now he's asking me to lkien 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.320
 mottaki that appears the name of eliene has a time limit of two minutes for the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.540
 jump who is not 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.540
 now I'm going to request the Basque technician 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.760
 arrived in a room 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.590
 You can talk 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.890
 ok 87 min 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.659
 to 11 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.439
 huh 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:23.129
 Well if I messed up she told me she's got three tries for the right day, right? 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.239
 As you still have the deadline you can avoid taking a test so you have realized that the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.919
 Last 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.179
 and I will finish 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.539
 né looks only the system also informing that the valid tournament 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.989
 really what I have done because at the end of it is 11 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.640
 detail that in what we are seeing now is only valid for this 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:42.559
 transaction 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:47.180
 so it's a very interesting security process here because the 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:52.309
 buyer will have to confirm neck visited who always changes he is 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:56.229
 generated by the system then neither seller and buyer does not know injured - 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:57.089
 to walk 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:59.989
 now I'll finish here 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.049
 the cet-rio has now 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.749
 Now yes 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.149
 now transaction confirmed here appears 11 20 what is a number from 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.990
 transaction 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.429
 however by grandson 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:14.429
 poor who received the message now the open sky 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.609
 ens 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.609
 ok with the new song community 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:26.379
 any program then there are leading a dark transaction 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.719
 not know now do not know how establishments also have a 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.139
 discipline you can click here 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.989
 and will shelter 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.379
 out will open that receipt you may have printed that receipt by the other 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.969
 the codex signing this forum of leaders and of course né 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:51.099
 massera internally he already signed this voucher passing tolkien the 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.939
 notice tutuca individual efe it was of only in the transaction né is a process 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.790
 intensive and prey for trying to win 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.099
 good now the disappearance of five cents here on your card bill 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.529
 What's going to happen in 30 days? 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.549
 and now he does not have that payment 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.489
 this is a reaction to complaints are very simple and quick how the 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.029
 total parent for customers already registered 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.249
 if the client is not yet registered I will make a quick demonstration 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.609
 fifth 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.060

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.279
