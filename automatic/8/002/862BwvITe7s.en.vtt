tested we know that and obviously that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.370 
tested we know that and obviously that
give<00:01:53.369> us<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> good<00:01:53.670> indication<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:54.450> what<00:01:55.259> we

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
give us a good indication of what we

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.870 
give us a good indication of what we
need<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.680> work<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:56.009> our<00:01:56.070> where<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.520> need<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.850> be

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
need to work on our where we need to be

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.280 
need to work on our where we need to be

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
on the defensive side of the game

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.510 
on the defensive side of the game
because<00:01:58.409> obviously<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.009> games<00:01:59.219> we've<00:01:59.490> played

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
bad thing but you just want to see how

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.580 
bad thing but you just want to see how
we<00:02:05.670> cope<00:02:06.000> defensively<00:02:06.899> with<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.259> formation

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
we cope defensively with a formation

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.710 
we cope defensively with a formation
with<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> shape<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.000> philosophies<00:02:09.690> that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
with a shape with the philosophies that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.210 
with a shape with the philosophies that
are<00:02:09.989> masking<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> plays<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:10.920> we're

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
are masking of the plays that we're

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.040 
are masking of the plays that we're
doing<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> training<00:02:11.730> ground<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.239> I've<00:02:12.900> no

doing on the training ground and I've no

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.910 
doing on the training ground and I've no
doubt<00:02:13.260> we'll<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.590> that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
doubt we'll get that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.170 
doubt we'll get that
mara<00:02:14.069> night<00:02:14.220> how<00:02:14.670> much<00:02:14.849> do<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.000> know<00:02:15.150> about

the month of gaming expecting yeah well
they've<00:02:17.819> changed<00:02:18.030> about<00:02:18.360> we<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.599> Claude

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
they've changed about we know Claude

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.390 
they've changed about we know Claude
Makelele<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.830> manager<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
Makelele is the the manager and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.130 
Makelele is the the manager and
obviously<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.090> type<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.330> player<00:02:21.630> II<00:02:21.660> was<00:02:21.959> one

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
obviously the type of player II was one

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.990 
obviously the type of player II was one
of<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.319> best<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.220> maybe<00:02:23.459> an<00:02:23.730> eye<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:23.849> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
of the best so maybe an eye on a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.699 
of the best so maybe an eye on a
defensive<00:02:24.599> side<00:02:24.780> with<00:02:25.110> certainly<00:02:25.500> when<00:02:25.620> they

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
defensive side with certainly when they

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.870 
defensive side with certainly when they
haven't<00:02:25.950> got<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.190> ball<00:02:26.340> i'm<00:02:26.459> pretty<00:02:26.670> sure

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
haven't got the ball i'm pretty sure

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.449 
haven't got the ball i'm pretty sure
Claude<00:02:27.870> won't<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.290> his<00:02:28.410> team<00:02:29.099> bombing

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
Claude won't have his team bombing

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.740 
Claude won't have his team bombing
forward<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:29.970> leaving<00:02:30.090> one<00:02:30.390> at<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.569> back

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
forward and leaving one at the back

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.830 
forward and leaving one at the back
because<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.470> was<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.739> type<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:31.950> player<00:02:32.250> he<00:02:32.280> was

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
because it was the type of player he was

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.780 
because it was the type of player he was
but<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.020> strong<00:02:34.650> side<00:02:34.890> they<00:02:35.160> did<00:02:35.459> well<00:02:35.640> last

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
but the strong side they did well last

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.330 
but the strong side they did well last
year<00:02:36.380> did<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> premier<00:02:37.950> league<00:02:37.980> team

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
year did it the premier league team

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.190 
year did it the premier league team
effectively<00:02:38.970> equivalent<00:02:39.630> should<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.870> say<00:02:40.050> in

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
effectively equivalent should I say in

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.080 
effectively equivalent should I say in
their<00:02:40.530> division<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.190> they're<00:02:41.730> going<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.970> be<00:02:42.060> a

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
their division so they're going to be a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.900 
their division so they're going to be a
good<00:02:42.269> good<00:02:42.600> strong<00:02:42.870> outfit<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:44.489> travel

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
good good strong outfit and we travel

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.460 
good good strong outfit and we travel
off<00:02:45.000> about<00:02:45.239> an<00:02:45.360> hour<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.660> half<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.110> get<00:02:46.230> to

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
off about an hour and a half to get to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.199 
off about an hour and a half to get to
the<00:02:46.920> grab<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.280> ground<00:02:47.489> which<00:02:47.640> again<00:02:47.880> will<00:02:48.000> be

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
the grab the ground which again will be

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.210 
the grab the ground which again will be
different<00:02:49.170> experience<00:02:49.890> because<00:02:49.950> obviously

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
different experience because obviously

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.470 
different experience because obviously
