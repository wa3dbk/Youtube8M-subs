you<00:02:08.259> know<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.619> subtle<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.489> that<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:10.360> also<00:02:10.750> is

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
you know the subtle is that that also is

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.320 
you know the subtle is that that also is
just<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:11.260> radical<00:02:11.890> shift<00:02:11.920> in<00:02:12.400> terms<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:13.000> how<00:02:13.269> you

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
just a radical shift in terms of how you
