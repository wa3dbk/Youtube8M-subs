00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.849 
with a draw play so I'm letting the CPU
call<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.990> plays<00:01:41.200> here<00:01:41.439> because<00:01:41.679> it<00:01:41.770> just

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:41.859 
call the plays here because it just

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:42.959 
call the plays here because it just
makes<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.189> game<00:01:42.310> go<00:01:42.460> by<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.670> little<00:01:42.880> bit

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
makes the game go by a little bit

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.429 
makes the game go by a little bit
quicker<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.569> it<00:01:43.659> makes<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.899> little<00:01:43.990> bit<00:01:44.170> harder

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
quicker and it makes a little bit harder

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.989 
quicker and it makes a little bit harder

flat to Trent Richardson and he gets

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.760

close<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.650> first<00:03:24.890> down<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.300> see<00:03:26.510> those

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
close to a first down so you see those

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.990 
close to a first down so you see those
safety<00:03:27.770> moving<00:03:28.070> over<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.490> oh<00:03:28.580> they're<00:03:28.910> gonna

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
safety moving over and oh they're gonna

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.880 
safety moving over and oh they're gonna
re<00:03:29.300> switch<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.870> up<00:03:29.960> but<00:03:30.350> I<00:03:30.380> thought<00:03:30.710> they're

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
re switch it up but I thought they're

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.930 
re switch it up but I thought they're
running<00:03:31.040> with<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.160> cornerback<00:03:31.520> blitz<00:03:31.790> they

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
running with the cornerback blitz they

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.550 
running with the cornerback blitz they
do<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:32.390> we<00:03:32.480> go<00:03:32.600> with<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.840> halfback<00:03:33.260> draw<00:03:33.500> to

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
do so we go with the halfback draw to

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.870 
do so we go with the halfback draw to
Trent<00:03:33.890> Richardson<00:03:34.250> he<00:03:34.310> goes<00:03:34.460> right<00:03:34.670> up<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
Trent Richardson he goes right up the

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.760 
Trent Richardson he goes right up the
gut<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:35.810> have<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.050> read<00:03:36.170> those<00:03:36.350> safeties
