00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.490
 most of youtube has ever had more 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.349
 once in the field with you I am going to show 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.690
 this model that told him that he is well 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.820
 famous in Brazil was one of the first in 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.039
 visits to get here in Brazil the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.570
 to land in Brazil and conquer 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.550
 millions of fans 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.109
 a lot of people have a lot of people looking for 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.810
 a lot of people think it's beautiful, a lot of people think 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:35.399
 ugly and is a very traditional model in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:40.050
 visit is unlikely and it is 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.300
 an 808 template that personal line 808 is 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.969
 newest undefeated models 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.370
 this watch it is very much like the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:55.289
 2007 line 410 75 76 is the difference of it 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.800
 for 0 74 is that it uses 6 4 it is all in 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.050
 gold both of the Basel drawing 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.809
 in this case and in black his too 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.910
 gold but I have overcome the same clock 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.790
 same part does not differentiate at all 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.780
 the unbeaten inscription on the side also 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.910
 you have there with you can see em is the same 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.250
 thing made of locking the same thing 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.640
 the back cover that in this watch here 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.490
 It is golden but in the 10 74 in my old 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.610
 she can also find silver 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.210
 but the same spelling does not change 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.510
 in nothing 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.060
 this is another Swiss component such as 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.920
 people can see that 12 a little 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:45.150
 Swiss component but his machine 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:49.560
 it is not not Swiss and lots of information 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.200
 on the website then it 's paper I know this model 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.940
 that the Japanese brand is good with 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.830
 Swiss components that their components 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.390
 person component components are all 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.150
 the homes 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.730
 all the material of the watch case of the 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.690
 the teller friend box are the 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.119
 components 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:11.070
 the machine is the difference is that you can 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.190
 come with the machine that Swiss component 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.280
 or Japanese can come with the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.000
 swiss opponents 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.160
 and the box already pondered the Japanese machine 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.910
 so the clock here is very beautiful 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.390
 his spelling a very beautiful tide does not 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.160
 is a yellow of the same clock 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.000
 I know if nobody imagines to realize it 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.610
 does not use 074 the internal dial tone 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.170
 which is exactly the same tone as the golden 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.270
 of the watch strap 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.050
 here it is human but it has 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.920
 yellow but more deflected and still has 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.500
 very cute 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.600
 note that he has a little place on the date 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.030
 realizing that he has something for the date 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.790
 on replica models do not have it personal 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.300
 be aware that this comes from 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.580
 unbeaten Christians on the side 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.870
 the county of leiria in two shades 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:09.790
 note that to streaks the stars 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:15.330
 sides are brighter than the bracelet 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.330
 It's more but the cutest time in the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.810
 clock 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.799
 the proof person who did not have 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.269
 protection and you can see it, right? 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.120
 invicta the model prodrive down here 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:50.010
 in the bottom footer in note that the name 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:04:01.739
 of the model 800 681 christ of the monitor 4.8 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:04:08.019
 height of it is uniform on the clock 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:09.970
 next time on the replica watch is this 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.100
 part that holds the house on the bracelet this 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.660
 part of it here is a separate block 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.269
 in separate block 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.549
 in this original model this block only 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.109
 set with the bracelet latch I learned 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.230
 here in this position 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.150
 in the replica model this block here is 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.450
 along with the box what if it is only 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.030
 from this part here to the bracelet then 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.370
 note that on replica models 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.860
 if you move this here you will see that 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.740
 this part that is fixed is not mobile 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.570
 understood 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.090
 note to whoever underneath that part 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.090
 that it is let loose through it too 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.400
 Here's what the planet is also through 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.180
 of the business then that part that looses itself 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.830
 the replica model that portion that is fixed 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.690
 only a lock on the bracelet that 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.550
 Lock her in the box 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.220
 Okay, so watch out for it. 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.840
 respect to the camille nuno all replicas 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.490
 this is who wants to buy replicas 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.600
 knowing that rule has no problem 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.400
 none 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.410
 there will be no news of the event is the 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.630
 in view of the weight of this watch. 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.990
 staff weighing 1 310 grams per 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.510
 Operation 310 grams 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.760
 the staff then this is it there is 808 model 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:27.280
 which is the same model that same box 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:30.130
 the size of the 007 4074 he has 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.810
 components and machines 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.080
 this case here it has a component 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.870
 the Japanese machine but the clock 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.640
 it's the same watch the same quality 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.200
 good personal components are 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.710
 influence as I said earlier 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:49.000
 only influence the accuracy of the machine 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:51.340
 so is the the Japanese machine she brings 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.430
 a little more in the year than a brand 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.660
 Switzerland 23 minutes longer 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.130
 It's good but the quality of the 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.000
 invicta is the same both Swiss and 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.150
 japanese 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.950
 the material is of very good quality tÃ¡ 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.490
 well it's better than staying for 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.490
 you watch 800 thousand of avoid is okay 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.610

 the data can be through youtube channel 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.590
