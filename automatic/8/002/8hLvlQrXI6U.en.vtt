they work so first we're going to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.780 
they work so first we're going to
explore<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.810> couple<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.560> different<00:02:18.040> movements

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
explore a couple of different movements

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.760 
explore a couple of different movements
and<00:02:19.290> by<00:02:20.290> understand<00:02:20.950> if<00:02:21.099> we<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.490> understand

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
and by understand if we can understand

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.370 
and by understand if we can understand
one<00:02:23.770> movement<00:02:24.400> if<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.760> can<00:02:25.209> understand<00:02:26.050> and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
one movement if you can understand and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.550 
one movement if you can understand and
master<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.940> movement<00:02:28.599> then<00:02:28.990> you've<00:02:29.170> mastered

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
master one movement then you've mastered

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
information you can take this learning

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.420 
information you can take this learning
and<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.310> can<00:02:36.490> apply<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.569> every<00:02:37.990> movement

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
and you can apply it to every movement

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
and you can apply it to every movement
but<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.490> must<00:02:39.910> really<00:02:40.950> understand<00:02:41.950> fully<00:02:42.490> how

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
but you must really understand fully how

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.009 
but you must really understand fully how
to<00:02:43.510> do<00:02:43.959> Tai<00:02:44.230> Chi<00:02:44.500> with<00:02:44.739> one<00:02:45.670> movement<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.870> we're

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
to do Tai Chi with one movement so we're

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.120 
to do Tai Chi with one movement so we're
going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.319> start<00:02:47.620> off<00:02:47.829> with

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
going to start off with

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.030 
going to start off with
are<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.790> most<00:02:49.000> basic<00:02:49.420> movement<00:02:50.410> ward-off

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
are the most basic movement ward-off

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.190 
are the most basic movement ward-off
left<00:02:51.520> one<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.270> most<00:02:52.450> basic<00:02:52.690> energy

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
left one of the most basic energy

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.040 
left one of the most basic energy
movements<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.340> Taiji<00:02:54.700> we'll<00:02:55.510> look<00:02:55.720> at<00:02:55.900> this

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
movements of Taiji we'll look at this

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.170 
movements of Taiji we'll look at this
and<00:02:56.260> explore<00:02:56.710> this<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.190> then<00:02:57.760> we'll<00:02:57.910> look<00:02:58.030> at

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
and explore this and then we'll look at

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.850 
and explore this and then we'll look at
another<00:02:58.510> movement<00:02:58.840> that's<00:02:59.170> sort<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.680> little

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
another movement that's sort of a little

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.760 
another movement that's sort of a little
bit<00:03:00.070> different<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:00.970> then<00:03:01.750> given<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.260> time<00:03:02.500> we

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
bit different and then given the time we

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.700 
bit different and then given the time we
can<00:03:02.950> possibly<00:03:03.570> even<00:03:04.570> glance<00:03:05.230> at<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.470> third

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
can possibly even glance at a third

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.610 
can possibly even glance at a third
movement<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:10.780> all<00:03:11.110> based

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
movement so the this this is all based

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.600 
movement so the this this is all based
on<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.850> idea<00:03:13.030> Tai<00:03:13.960> Chi<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.410> based<00:03:14.800> on<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.250> idea

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
on the idea Tai Chi is based on the idea

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.560 
on the idea Tai Chi is based on the idea
that<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:18.220> form<00:03:19.230> follows<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.740> function<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
that the form follows the function the

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.920 
that the form follows the function the
form<00:03:22.960> follows<00:03:23.710> the<00:03:23.920> function<00:03:24.490> the<00:03:25.180> form<00:03:25.720> is

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
form follows the function the form is

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
the the the application the function

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.010 
the the the application the function
does<00:03:51.370> not<00:03:51.550> follow<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:52.030> form<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.660> form<00:03:52.840> is

does not follow the form the form is

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.170 
does not follow the form the form is
created<00:03:53.500> out<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.710> function<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.460> must<00:03:54.940> keep

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
created out of function so you must keep

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.000 
created out of function so you must keep
that<00:03:55.420> in<00:03:55.570> mind<00:03:55.750> that's<00:03:55.930> very<00:03:56.110> very<00:03:56.350> important

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
that in mind that's very very important

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.010 
that in mind that's very very important
yeah<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:59.020> let<00:03:59.260> me<00:03:59.410> demonstrate<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:01.540> basic

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
yeah so let me demonstrate the basic

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.110 
yeah so let me demonstrate the basic
movement<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.590> we're<00:04:02.740> going<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.040> do<00:04:03.460> first

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
movement that we're going to do first

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.480 
movement that we're going to do first
this<00:04:04.390> ward<00:04:04.750> off<00:04:04.930> left<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:07.690> have<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:09.280> have

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
this ward off left we have we have

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.300 
this ward off left we have we have
principles<00:04:10.240> upon<00:04:10.720> which<00:04:10.780> Tai<00:04:11.320> Chi<00:04:11.560> is<00:04:11.740> based

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
principles upon which Tai Chi is based

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.660 
principles upon which Tai Chi is based
these<00:04:13.060> principles<00:04:13.780> are<00:04:14.280> keeping<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.400> head

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
these principles are keeping the head

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.550 
these principles are keeping the head
upright<00:04:16.239> central<00:04:16.900> keeping<00:04:17.440> a<00:04:17.530> balanced

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
upright central keeping a balanced

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.010 
upright central keeping a balanced
relaxation<00:04:21.030> all<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.360> these<00:04:22.540> are<00:04:22.750> going<00:04:22.870> to

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
relaxation all of these are going to

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.740 
relaxation all of these are going to
apply<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:24.010> every<00:04:24.160> movement<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.330> that's<00:04:25.420> very

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
apply to every movement and that's very

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.020 
apply to every movement and that's very
very<00:04:25.930> important<00:04:26.590> so<00:04:27.220> in<00:04:27.790> in<00:04:28.360> ward<00:04:28.780> off<00:04:29.020> left

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.910 

so<00:04:34.030> here's<00:04:34.270> commencement<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.440> get<00:04:35.620> myself

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
so here's commencement so it get myself

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.570 
so here's commencement so it get myself
here<00:04:36.430> organized<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:40.960> if<00:04:41.050> we<00:04:41.170> just<00:04:41.410> look<00:04:41.830> at<00:04:41.860> the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
here organized so if we just look at the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.010 
here organized so if we just look at the
form<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.920> basic<00:04:45.550> form<00:04:45.970> of<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:46.660> movement

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
form the basic form of this movement

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:59.890 
form the basic form of this movement
that<00:04:47.260> we're<00:04:47.470> going<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.770> look<00:04:48.100> at

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.620 

we<00:05:00.900> want<00:05:01.170> to<00:05:01.290> make<00:05:01.500> sure<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:02.250> as<00:05:02.630> this

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
we want to make sure that as this

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.590 
we want to make sure that as this
movement<00:05:04.290> is<00:05:04.530> being<00:05:04.860> practiced<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:06.180> body<00:05:06.450> is

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
movement is being practiced the body is

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.930 
movement is being practiced the body is
upright<00:05:07.230> without<00:05:07.560> leaning<00:05:07.950> it's<00:05:08.310> easy<00:05:08.670> to

you keep upright and straight when

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.800 
you keep upright and straight when
stepping<00:05:30.930> it's<00:05:31.530> very<00:05:31.890> important<00:05:32.670> to<00:05:33.180> keep<00:05:33.450> the

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
stepping it's very important to keep the

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.450 
stepping it's very important to keep the
energy<00:05:34.020> in<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.370> weighted<00:05:36.270> leg<00:05:37.130> don't<00:05:38.130> it's

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
energy in the weighted leg don't it's

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.870 
energy in the weighted leg don't it's
very<00:05:38.730> easy<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.180> just<00:05:39.900> do<00:05:40.410> a<00:05:40.680> normal<00:05:41.430> kind<00:05:41.670> of

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
very easy to just do a normal kind of

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.570 
very easy to just do a normal kind of
step<00:05:42.210> with<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.840> body<00:05:43.170> just<00:05:43.620> stepping<00:05:44.460> ahead

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
step with the body just stepping ahead

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.510 
step with the body just stepping ahead
we<00:05:45.240> don't<00:05:45.480> want<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:45.780> do<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.170> when<00:05:46.980> you<00:05:47.190> step

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
we don't want to do that when you step

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.890 
we don't want to do that when you step
in<00:05:47.730> Taiji<00:05:48.410> you<00:05:49.410> always<00:05:50.070> connect<00:05:50.940> your<00:05:51.570> route

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
in Taiji you always connect your route

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.700 
in Taiji you always connect your route
which<00:05:52.380> is<00:05:52.410> the<00:05:52.800> heel<00:05:53.100> in<00:05:53.280> this<00:05:53.430> case<00:05:54.140> then<00:05:55.140> the

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
which is the heel in this case then the

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.460 
which is the heel in this case then the
movement<00:05:56.040> is<00:05:57.830> completed<00:05:58.880> we<00:05:59.880> don't<00:06:00.150> mean<00:06:00.570> we

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
movement is completed we don't mean we

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.000 
movement is completed we don't mean we
don't<00:06:01.760> overextend<00:06:03.020> we<00:06:04.020> stay<00:06:04.350> within<00:06:04.620> our

a<00:06:15.270> flowing<00:06:15.840> easy<00:06:16.770> sort<00:06:17.460> of<00:06:17.520> like<00:06:17.640> a<00:06:17.670> river<00:06:18.030> that

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
a flowing easy sort of like a river that

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.540 
a flowing easy sort of like a river that
flows<00:06:20.330> constantly<00:06:21.330> and<00:06:21.570> easily<00:06:22.560> okay<00:06:23.190> this<00:06:23.400> is
