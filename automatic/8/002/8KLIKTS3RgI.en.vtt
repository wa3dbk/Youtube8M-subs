00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
which i thought would make me have like

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.269 
which i thought would make me have like
better<00:00:25.230> luck<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:25.680> apparently<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.130> wasn't

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
better luck but apparently it wasn't

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.790 
better luck but apparently it wasn't
twice<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.789> luck<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.090> time<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:28.170> happen<00:00:28.769> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
twice the luck this time and I happen to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
twice the luck this time and I happen to
get<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.220> lot<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.519> cards<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.090> had<00:00:30.300> silver<00:00:30.660> cards

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
get a lot of cards that had silver cards

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.450

cards<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.030> didn't<00:00:33.180> really

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
cards in it so I didn't really

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.240 
cards in it so I didn't really
understand<00:00:33.660> exactly<00:00:33.899> why<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.160> on

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
understand exactly why that was going on
it<00:00:36.059> was<00:00:36.149> kind<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.390> disheartening<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:37.110> i

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
it was kind of disheartening because i

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.660 
it was kind of disheartening because i
was<00:00:37.829> hoping<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> get<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.340> least<00:00:38.370> something
