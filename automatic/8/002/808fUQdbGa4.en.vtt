00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.180
 Hello dear friends with you frs 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.209
 den wound house cheek and my rubric master 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.039
 and as you understand today there will be a master 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.520
 on Matilda 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.400
 the beginning of the battle I'm in the steppe top card open 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.000
 wide you need to immediately choose a direction 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.770
 and I decide to play the role of a trap and go to 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.850
 stone to push there and 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.190
 ok, we take it through the fund 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.500
 double speed 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.210
 as the speed of Matilda does not allow 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.829
 enjoy fast driving 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.660
 but my plans to go on a stone are interrupted 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.180
 enemy rush in the middle that handy 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.329
 no wonder at low levels 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:00.489
 I'm starting to shoot at all who I am 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:05.950
 noticed fly the Chinese lied this 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:08.200
 broaches well yes look the whole map 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.830
 red they went altogether a lot 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.510
 patient market shoot out 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.350
 Matilda's rate of fire awesome 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:21.460
 therefore, without light, the arta is calm now 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:26.490
 then the exhaust accuracy allows the following 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.610
 goals did not expect it check to be honest 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.220
 interchanges 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.430
 the value of the battle strap everything goes according to 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.930
 the center of such a mini rush I make out all 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:42.210
 I see three more in the center 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:47.620
 tank and I plan them on the sly 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.320
 sit in the meantime our allies 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:55.470
 too stretched along the base took 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.470
 defensive positions and waiting 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:04.880
 here is lit t82 su-76 I will 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.980
 we will bring there therefore quickly 1 1 and minus 2 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.030
 still 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.340
 illuminated by enemy Matilda by 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.180
 centered but on the left you me 2lt 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.120
 and do you notice 76 they kill and i 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.970
 come back a little bit to 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:26.470
 shoot off at the following stones tank 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:29.360
 20 they get to see farther Germans 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.030
 turn around your forehead as karma is with me 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.950
 memory and forehead stronger and starting to get 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.540
 buns from on my father arrives 26 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.130
 punches not a German I think everything now 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.380
 I will be surrounded and will begin to disassemble but not 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.710
 everything is so simple guys matilda is such 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.500
 tank that drown can take a hit i 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.780
 Already told everyone the review that the tank is like 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.750
 baby at his level here again and 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.690
 it turns out 26 and making a decision 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.080
 quickly under the rock so not so much 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.660
 receive from art she can throw here 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.750
 but not so easy and do it and here 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:15.270
 remember this is 20 i'm taking a shower and not from him 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:17.310
 now shoot back goat property 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.540
 in this case you need to focus the salt then 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.860
 there is not to waste your time 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.510
 effectively shoot one and the same 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.410
 same tank 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.230
 to remove the trunks just not taking 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.400
 solution to remove the first and beer 20 since 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:39.690
 he leaned out paying attention to others 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:46.190
 not yet taken 20 and now the next 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:48.900
 phase 3 c I look around at n for three 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.010
 to make sure he doesn't shoot 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.720
 I get a bunch of failures 38 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.180
 and disassemble it 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.270
 meanwhile bypasses me for every 3 and 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:07.620
 41kb although in without damage it even got 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:14.610
 calmly removed 92 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.300
 xn I still resist against to 20 of 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.020
 38 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.989
 she for three and yes and the art of throwing out and 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:24.050
 I survived and there is still enough hepe 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.240
 noticed in the bushes stood su-26 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:33.170
 put in there some spank of hope for 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:36.000
 something that'll get notice of the enemy and the 38 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:41.580
 calm will build 441 meter 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.630
 no problem i got it 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.840
 Enemy 3 Tanchik and here's and Stuart gets 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.010

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.660
 opportunities for the ninth frag 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.000
 promod how faster 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.000
 because a little bit boring here 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.060
 left 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:14.270
 6 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:18.980
 which I shot back I'm already going 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:22.130
 in the center of the enemy base and here it is 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:27.950
 shines I make a shot and and and 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.400

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.639
 wall 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.969
 stripe master of wars 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.280
 You see, and what I said if 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:41.599
 matilda tope she can get very 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.729
 a lot of damage is more accurate than hits not all 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:48.370
 punch and the more she has such a side 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:52.430
 with screens and gusli good at taking damage 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.169
 you can bend down on a tank 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.090
 frags 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.629
 there would be a desire to still try to press 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.409
 her medal for 14 kills 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:06.229
