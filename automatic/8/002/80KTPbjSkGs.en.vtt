man I mean it all really depends on how
what<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.700> assume<00:01:57.210> will<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.479> his<00:01:57.780> attempted

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
what I assume will be his attempted

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.230 
what I assume will be his attempted
break-in<00:01:58.770> goes<00:01:58.979> he<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> corona<00:01:59.729> boosting<00:02:00.119> out

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
break-in goes he is corona boosting out

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.300 
break-in goes he is corona boosting out

I think it's remains to be seen if we're

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
going to reach that point as we have

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.089 
going to reach that point as we have

going to have to worry about at least
for<00:03:14.379> a<00:03:14.409> little<00:03:14.709> while<00:03:14.829> of<00:03:15.220> course<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.989> know<00:03:17.109> if

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
for a little while of course you know if

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.020 
for a little while of course you know if
MC<00:03:17.680> wanted<00:03:17.949> to<00:03:18.069> he<00:03:18.519> could<00:03:18.549> throw<00:03:18.879> down<00:03:19.000> a

MC wanted to he could throw down a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.849 
MC wanted to he could throw down a
second<00:03:19.419> gas<00:03:19.599> get<00:03:19.900> some<00:03:20.049> DTS<00:03:20.410> here<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.739> little

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
second gas get some DTS here in a little

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:21.839 
second gas get some DTS here in a little
while<00:03:20.949> but<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.280> would<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.489> would<00:03:21.549> take<00:03:21.819> a

while but that would that would take a

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.550 
while but that would that would take a

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
while and I'm not really sure that he'd

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.289 
while and I'm not really sure that he'd
