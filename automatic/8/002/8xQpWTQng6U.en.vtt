also<00:04:47.780> been<00:04:48.050> questioned<00:04:48.919> about<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:50.090> this<00:04:50.300> as

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
also been questioned about is this as

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.779 
also been questioned about is this as
powerful<00:04:50.870> as<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.110> ps3<00:04:51.770> I<00:04:51.979> think<00:04:52.430> we've<00:04:52.580> seen

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
powerful as the ps3 I think we've seen

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.399 
powerful as the ps3 I think we've seen
some<00:04:52.970> demos<00:04:53.330> that<00:04:53.360> kind<00:04:53.870> of<00:04:53.960> hinted<00:04:54.259> at<00:04:54.380> that

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
some demos that kind of hinted at that

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.649 
some demos that kind of hinted at that
so<00:04:55.130> what<00:04:55.400> can<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:55.550> tell<00:04:55.759> us<00:04:55.820> about<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.330> actual

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
so what can you tell us about the actual

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.749 
so what can you tell us about the actual
the<00:04:57.289> graphical<00:04:57.740> muscle<00:04:58.009> of<00:04:58.070> this<00:04:58.220> machine<00:04:58.580> how

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
the graphical muscle of this machine how

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.370 
the graphical muscle of this machine how
comparable<00:04:59.210> is<00:04:59.360> it<00:04:59.479> to<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.659> PlayStation<00:05:00.169> 3

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
comparable is it to the PlayStation 3

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.310 
comparable is it to the PlayStation 3
well<00:05:00.979> this<00:05:01.310> is<00:05:01.340> definitely<00:05:01.639> closer<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.840> ps3

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
well this is definitely closer to ps3

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.060 
well this is definitely closer to ps3
you<00:05:03.860> know<00:05:04.039> when<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:04.340> compare<00:05:04.789> PSP<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:06.620> you

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
you know when you compare PSP to you

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.439 
you know when you compare PSP to you
know<00:05:07.449> ps3<00:05:08.449> so<00:05:08.960> we<00:05:09.470> are<00:05:09.650> very<00:05:09.800> excited<00:05:10.430> that<00:05:10.970> and

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
know ps3 so we are very excited that and

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.140 
know ps3 so we are very excited that and
also<00:05:11.930> we<00:05:12.229> developed<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.580> know<00:05:13.699> features

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.779 
also we developed the you know features
and<00:05:14.449> development<00:05:15.050> tools<00:05:15.380> so<00:05:16.159> that<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.639> real

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
and development tools so that the real

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.300 
and development tools so that the real
pals<00:05:17.030> can<00:05:17.330> use<00:05:17.720> their<00:05:18.139> you<00:05:18.560> know<00:05:18.650> asset<00:05:19.130> and

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
pals can use their you know asset and

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.779 
pals can use their you know asset and

your techniques in programming efforts

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.320 
your techniques in programming efforts
on<00:05:23.030> ps3<00:05:23.389> to<00:05:23.870> be<00:05:23.990> able<00:05:24.139> too<00:05:24.500> easy<00:05:24.770> move<00:05:25.370> over<00:05:25.610> to

on ps3 to be able too easy move over to

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.439 
on ps3 to be able too easy move over to
NGP<00:05:26.960> so<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.860> know<00:05:28.009> its<00:05:28.130> design<00:05:28.639> as<00:05:29.000> very

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
NGP so you know its design as very

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.600 
NGP so you know its design as very
developer<00:05:30.050> friendly<00:05:30.409> you<00:05:31.039> know<00:05:31.070> when<00:05:31.340> you<00:05:31.490> are

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
developer friendly you know when you are

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
developing games on NGP

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.199 
developing games on NGP
would<00:05:35.999> be<00:05:36.209> very<00:05:36.509> very<00:05:36.839> easy<00:05:37.289> now<00:05:38.249> the<00:05:38.699> other

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:39.209 
would be very very easy now the other

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:40.189 
would be very very easy now the other
thing<00:05:39.300> we've<00:05:39.539> seen<00:05:39.569> is<00:05:39.869> that<00:05:39.899> the

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
thing we've seen is that the

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.629 
thing we've seen is that the
connectivity<00:05:40.860> of<00:05:40.919> device<00:05:41.219> is<00:05:41.399> going<00:05:41.580> to

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
connectivity of device is going to

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.389 
connectivity of device is going to
happen<00:05:41.999> and<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.419> games<00:05:42.659> especially<00:05:43.309> can<00:05:44.309> we

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:44.399 
happen and the games especially can we

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.730 
happen and the games especially can we
expect<00:05:44.759> now<00:05:44.939> to<00:05:44.999> have<00:05:45.270> kind<00:05:45.569> of<00:05:45.629> our<00:05:45.779> PSN<00:05:46.559> ID

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740
