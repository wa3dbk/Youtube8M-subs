00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.370
 Nine people I am the substance is coming 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.080
 a new video on malta today goes 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.639
 It's up to Battlefield 4 news that 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.320
 Gameplay Men's reason is from the ritchie 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.420
 as a thank you could be up to his 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.279
 grandchildren projects three montage click with 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.600
 So he comes in until the views come in 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.300
 and finally the alarm crackles 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.099
 quite normal for the pictures at the end thank you 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.529
 a down for life with it a bit 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.119
 helped out and we are very good for 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.579
 the very expensive ones that I say that I am 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.899
 to use these pictures often 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.309
 For the first time, more weapons should go than 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.140
 the ones we see at gamescom 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.270
 could at the gamescom bars clubs pro 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 category new weapons so new 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.390
 managed rifles 99 storm rifles and it 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.680
 should give more than like that there 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.510
 We still have to see this 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.760
 battle pickups weapons scene will still be there 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.739
 give a few more keep per 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.390
 category will be there somewhere 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.550
 So there are more guns for those 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.649
 now on mp 7 have hoped mp 5 m 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.809
 tapas never what will maybe theirs 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.329
 wish here still fulfilled then it should 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 to launch battlefield 14 maps 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.170
 Battlefield 3 has up to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.850
 launch new maps the question is whether 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.010
 to these ten also the four of 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.720
 counting makers corn ingen or old 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.420
 the four are extra extra 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 So 14 maps are still the question 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.710
 then it should spend as fast as it does 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.689
 Maps maps with open areas and which 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.490
 a little closer and has which one for 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.110
 dogfights want big 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.330
 offer variety in the maps 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.509
 then there are seven game modes too 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.939
 start and quickly conquering team 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.320
 deathmatch squad deathmatch interviews 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.740
 that it's new mode I do not know yet 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.500
 what a modus operation is and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.840
 then we can focus on one 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.729
 Titanic mode may hope so 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.020
 There is no confirmation at the main thinks 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.970
 about it so about a similar 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.040
 Variant the fir motors existed in 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.630
 battlefield 21 42 that was one 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.759
 What's up in the air ? 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.170
 You had to stop a sign that must if 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.430
 we could destroy that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.899
 destroying things from the inside 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.399
 this is probably similar here 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.750
 with an aircraft carrier that out 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.149
 we run since there are none 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.890
 flying titans things but the idea 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.259
 be there because you can implement it 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.119
 could hope with aircraft carriers 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.370
 on it was really a great 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.240
 ingenious mode as well they talk about 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.460
 there's that 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.010
 She keeps the technology so much better 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.420
 As a world like 33 she should never be that darling 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.970
 means as much as I am around the corner 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.680
 still give or if you me 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.810
 it will always lie down with the opponent 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.850
 a bit later they want to appear 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.470
 So server side and knows you are 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.570
 have something improved than Battlefield 3 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.220
 that's what I heard 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.080
 probably not the case but good she yes 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.130
 another two months maybe in the end yes 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.410
 but still pretty good 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.910
 Let us now come to commander mode 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.710
 commander now apparently has one 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.090
 minimum struggled to have all incoming 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.220
 to be allowed that is if the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.570
 will probably be read first player 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.750
 can not play any commands because 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.490
 he can now understand the rank 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.070
 and then there's this great job from 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.440
 timo it's just so what's there area 22 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.200
 players from lok are such a caste red 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.240
 crate and there was ammo between 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.610
 inside or similar and here it is 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.940
 stop can be repaired 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.100
 can cure one can amitate one 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.300
 everything and you should go there again 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.620
 his class can change that is 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.350
 I can during the match if I am 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.840
 then somewhere can find this box 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.000
 I riken from the pioneering move to 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.980
 example, the spectator mode was yes 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.330
 also in comparison to e3 clearly 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.100
 I've developed the livestream 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.080
 but very blatant on the first days 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.930
 follow now left and right to 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.790
 such as Show from scott has of 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.590
 she has them again for both teams 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.830
 A team is blue in color 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.960
 the other team is so golden you can 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.400
 To call that and to do it all is one 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.710
 bit more fluid you can do such a few 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.180
 whether one can show one there or last 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.800
 the deactivation one can of course 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.420
 freecom and everything 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.010
 that looks pretty good up to now 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.500
 to have spectator mode 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.310
 but you still know the battle recorder 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.110
 Nothing 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.450
 Maybe it can be that again 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.740
 it does not come back again 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.630
 Actually, there was battlefield too 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.820
 3 was used very little one can 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.830
 great thing is this thing for the pc player 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.510
 he keeps his 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.440
 power and so things can select there 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.660
 you can call something 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.070
 there are already 2 worldwide what to do 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.350
 For example, if you did that there 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.120
 I think the top left has appeared 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.620
 in the chateau still came and sound 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.370
 One was staying huskies all the time 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.370
 candidacies 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.770
 Which four should that be up again? 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.540
 left then nwz on diving accident time 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.890
 own ammo needs to see how 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.950
 they do the technology in there 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.740
 the nearness are indicated in the 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.230
 then you can order from the spotlight 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.790
 get songs now directly and times 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.280
 See how it finally happens 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.720
 We also have grenades 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.250
 a few more than now before 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.540
 I think that was two weeks 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.900
 could find out 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.520
 there's so normal m27 grenade there are 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.020
 it's the v 40 mini grenade 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.120
 probably several that was there 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.950
 it also in meldorf at eurofighter that 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.960
 there the provider or so is called the 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.340
 These are very small grenades 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.230
 or you throw a few more 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.630
 drive and the bang also good 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.090
 then there is the ergo impact grenade the 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.300
 explodes directly at the contact 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.460
 flashback 's a smoke small brand 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.110
 grenade and there is such a hemp empty 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.970
 that is of course so obvious 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.410
 so beautiful dark areas you had to 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.990
 example in the house you can partially 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.300
 remove the electricity and that is dark 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.850
 Do not throw traders and then be considered 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.460
 bit brighter I can do similar things 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.800
 mark for similar people if the thing 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.090
 I also do not know how to dazzle 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.010
 and then we have a lot more 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.050
 knife I believe in the end but 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.550
 all the same cologne so no knife 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.310
 smb and somehow area faster 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.200
 better hurt me take this 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.940
 all the same and there you can enter now 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.920
 Do not just choose a few pairs that way 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.350
 a carpet katar beside but must 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.850
 ultimately not so important then 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.130
 have now finally in the 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.770
 per corner storm gameplays new vehicles 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.560
 can see how stop the jet then 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.790
 we could transport illegal 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.400
 sometimes a bit see also brother 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.420
 in everything and in the transport things 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.740
 you can not say anything in matters yes 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.980
 adaptation what can you do only yes 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.660
 umben beiersdorf is not one 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.360
 can absorb so a bit at 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.250
 the livestreams water was so on though 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.140
 you could see something at skatspiel 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.400
 what the so can the there the standard 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.050
 We also minigun in battlefield 3 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.030
 or we take so 25 mm 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.410
 cannon that have splash damage 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.330
 of course shoot a bit slower 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.860
 but just did as I said take the 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.450
 even if misses shoots why when 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.950
 heli, for example, when something like that 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.080
 something similar had failed 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.540
 but they still hurt because it has 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.090
 until the playoff the match then does 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.160
 we have the tigers or laser 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.230
 guided fair the course normal 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.430
 Rockets we have like his javelin 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.320
 in their judgment also the no means 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.070
 Battlefield 3 means vehicles 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.930
 give 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.360
 the ground vehicles or just too 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.860
 Aircraft when the blazer is highlighted 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.610
 and other things have been the lasers 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.660
 been marked 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:53.270
 as a defense measure currently fire extinguishers 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.980
 flairs and ecm semmer and at the 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.000
 upgrades have something new this horny 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.860
 quieter 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.630
 it makes you a bit 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.190
 you can maneuver better then you can 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.350
 get a bit faster in the hedi 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.470
 turn and everything has the jet as well 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:10.250
 close environment scan bmw the self and
