00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.950 

definitely<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.639> 64<00:04:38.180> version<00:04:38.360> folks<00:04:38.750> it's

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
definitely in the 64 version folks it's

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.980 
definitely in the 64 version folks it's
definitely<00:04:39.289> a<00:04:39.320> lot<00:04:39.500> harder<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:40.630> perform<00:04:41.630> these

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
definitely a lot harder to perform these

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.719 
definitely a lot harder to perform these
these<00:04:42.470> combos<00:04:43.810> my<00:04:44.810> suggestion<00:04:45.710> my<00:04:45.919> reason<00:04:46.520> for

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
these combos my suggestion my reason for

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.450 
these combos my suggestion my reason for
it<00:04:46.849> is<00:04:47.229> I'm<00:04:48.229> just<00:04:48.289> gonna<00:04:48.560> say<00:04:48.830> it<00:04:49.009> has<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.310> do

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
it is I'm just gonna say it has to do

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.129 
it is I'm just gonna say it has to do
with<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.910> with<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.300> big-ass<00:04:50.539> controller

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
with the with the big-ass controller

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.790 
with the with the big-ass controller
that<00:04:51.380> we're<00:04:51.530> playing<00:04:51.800> with<00:04:53.169> it's<00:04:54.169> not<00:04:54.320> as<00:04:54.500> easy

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
that we're playing with it's not as easy

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.770 
that we're playing with it's not as easy
to<00:04:58.419> perform<00:04:59.419> moves<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:02.330> it<00:05:02.419> makes<00:05:02.570> you<00:05:02.660> wonder

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
to perform moves and it makes you wonder

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:11.670 
to perform moves and it makes you wonder
how<00:05:03.050> we<00:05:03.110> did<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.410> before

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.680 

unfortunately<00:05:12.680> his<00:05:12.920> head<00:05:13.490> pop<00:05:13.730> fatality<00:05:14.570> and

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
unfortunately his head pop fatality and

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.540 
unfortunately his head pop fatality and
this<00:05:14.810> doesn't<00:05:15.140> work<00:05:18.130> unless<00:05:19.130> it's<00:05:19.460> a

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
this doesn't work unless it's a

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.380 
this doesn't work unless it's a
different<00:05:20.000> combination<00:05:20.510> of<00:05:20.960> buttons<00:05:21.320> but<00:05:21.680> I

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
different combination of buttons but I

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.240 
different combination of buttons but I
always<00:05:23.390> thought<00:05:23.570> it<00:05:23.630> was<00:05:23.750> uh

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
always thought it was uh

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.900 
always thought it was uh
run<00:05:25.250> block<00:05:25.430> black<00:05:25.610> high<00:05:25.790> kick<00:05:27.070> anyway<00:05:28.070> let's

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
run block black high kick anyway let's

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.320 
run block black high kick anyway let's
continue<00:05:30.640> so<00:05:31.640> now<00:05:31.760> we're<00:05:31.970> gonna<00:05:32.060> choose

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
continue so now we're gonna choose

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.990 
continue so now we're gonna choose
