alright very simple stuff now let's say
that<00:01:45.049> I<00:01:45.110> want<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.409> play<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.619> back<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.670> like<00:01:46.909> this

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
that I want to play it back to like this

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.880 
that I want to play it back to like this
but<00:01:47.300> I<00:01:47.360> really<00:01:47.630> don't<00:01:47.810> like<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.200> repetition<00:01:48.680> I

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
but I really don't like the repetition I

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.740 
but I really don't like the repetition I
would<00:01:49.220> like<00:01:49.340> something<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.760> bit<00:01:49.880> different<00:01:49.940> I

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
would like something a bit different I

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.899 
would like something a bit different I
would<00:01:51.259> like<00:01:51.320> maybe<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.800> change<00:01:52.070> one<00:01:52.430> core<00:01:52.700> for

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
would like maybe to change one core for

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.090 
would like maybe to change one core for
the<00:01:53.030> next<00:01:53.330> or<00:01:53.509> something<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.229> well<00:01:54.800> the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
the next or something like that well the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.249 
the next or something like that well the
problem<00:01:55.550> is<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.180> blues<00:01:56.390> especially

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
problem is that the blues especially

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.469 
problem is that the blues especially
this<00:01:57.409> is<00:01:57.530> kind<00:01:57.680> of<00:01:57.710> more<00:01:58.009> of<00:01:58.360> course<00:01:59.360> it

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
this is kind of more of course it

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.030 
this is kind of more of course it
doesn't<00:01:59.899> sound<00:02:00.170> very<00:02:00.229> good<00:02:00.320> but<00:02:00.470> it's<00:02:00.800> it's

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
doesn't sound very good but it's it's

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.800 
doesn't sound very good but it's it's
kind<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:01.430> jay-z<00:02:01.759> kind<00:02:02.210> of<00:02:02.330> blues<00:02:02.509> because

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.420 
and we can't take too many liberties
with<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.080> okay<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.590> one<00:02:12.920> idea<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.310> to

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
with it okay so one idea is to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.190 
with it okay so one idea is to
substitute<00:02:13.640> one<00:02:14.120> chord<00:02:14.390> for<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.570> next<00:02:14.840> but

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
substitute one chord for the next but

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.470 
substitute one chord for the next but
still<00:02:15.410> keeping<00:02:15.769> you<00:02:16.760> know<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:16.970> whole<00:02:17.150> general

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
still keeping you know the whole general

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.290 
still keeping you know the whole general
idea<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.620> progression<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.970> now<00:02:20.150> i'm<00:02:20.269> going

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
idea of the progression so now i'm going

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.000 
idea of the progression so now i'm going
to<00:02:20.480> play<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:21.080> same<00:02:21.290> progression<00:02:21.440> but<00:02:21.860> i'm

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
to play the same progression but i'm

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.800 
to play the same progression but i'm
going<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.160> change<00:02:22.400> one<00:02:22.730> chord<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.480> fourth

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
going to change one chord the fourth

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.449 
going to change one chord the fourth
quarter<00:02:24.050> which<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.350> f<00:02:24.560> i'm<00:02:25.070> going<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.310> play<00:02:25.430> for

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
quarter which is f i'm going to play for

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.850 
quarter which is f i'm going to play for
i'm<00:02:25.940> going<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.180> change<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.570> with<00:02:26.870> another<00:02:27.560> cord

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
i'm going to change it with another cord

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:45.130 
i'm going to change it with another cord
and<00:02:28.040> see<00:02:28.519> how<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.760> sounds<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:44.750> sounds<00:02:45.110> really

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
and see how it sounds it sounds really

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.680 
and see how it sounds it sounds really
good<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.620> mean<00:02:45.769> you<00:02:46.280> know<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.239> there<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.480> very

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
good I mean you know it is there a very

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.630 
good I mean you know it is there a very
simple<00:02:47.959> corporation<00:02:48.470> but<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:49.070> court<00:02:49.370> does<00:02:49.519> it

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
simple corporation but the court does it

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.240 
simple corporation but the court does it
sound<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:50.239> sounds<00:02:50.390> all<00:02:50.570> right<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:51.980> it's

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
sound it sounds all right and if it's

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.390 
sound it sounds all right and if it's
but<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.239> is<00:02:53.360> some<00:02:53.540> quite<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.900> same<00:02:54.079> as<00:02:54.110> f<00:02:54.470> of

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.770 

course<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.519> doesn't<00:02:58.700> otherwise<00:02:59.239> what<00:02:59.630> with

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
course it doesn't otherwise what with

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.860 
course it doesn't otherwise what with
the<00:02:59.870> point<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.140> making<00:03:00.260> this<00:03:00.500> video<00:03:00.650> right<00:03:01.340> so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
the point of making this video right so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.270 
the point of making this video right so
it<00:03:02.870> sounds<00:03:03.230> different<00:03:03.320> it's<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.250> different

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
it sounds different it's a different

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.870 
it sounds different it's a different
board<00:03:04.930> but<00:03:05.930> if<00:03:06.079> it<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:07.070> let's<00:03:07.250> see<00:03:07.430> what<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:07.610> play

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
board but if it so let's see what I play

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.229 
board but if it so let's see what I play
I<00:03:08.230> substituted<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.650> F<00:03:10.010> major<00:03:10.220> chord<00:03:10.430> which<00:03:11.120> is

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
I substituted the F major chord which is

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.819 
I substituted the F major chord which is
formed<00:03:12.100> with<00:03:13.100> these<00:03:13.250> notes<00:03:13.459> F<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.870> C<00:03:15.440> these

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
formed with these notes F a and C these

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.350 
formed with these notes F a and C these
three<00:03:16.040> notes<00:03:16.220> make<00:03:16.579> up<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.910> F<00:03:17.030> major<00:03:17.209> chord

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
three notes make up the F major chord

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.870 
three notes make up the F major chord
and<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.230> change<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.860> exchange<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.400> with<00:03:19.579> the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
and I change it and exchange it with the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.599 
and I change it and exchange it with the
D<00:03:20.540> minor<00:03:20.750> 7th<00:03:21.170> chord<00:03:21.200> now<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.739> minor<00:03:22.040> 7th<00:03:22.489> is

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
D minor 7th chord now the minor 7th is

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.680 
D minor 7th chord now the minor 7th is
formed<00:03:22.970> with<00:03:23.120> D<00:03:23.359> F<00:03:24.459> a/c<00:03:25.459> now<00:03:25.730> if<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:26.510> write

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
formed with D F a/c now if you write

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.000 
formed with D F a/c now if you write
this<00:03:26.810> down<00:03:26.959> on<00:03:27.079> a<00:03:27.140> piece<00:03:27.230> of<00:03:27.290> paper<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.799> see

this down on a piece of paper you see

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.280 
this down on a piece of paper you see

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
tense note in the key of C major it's

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.020 
tense note in the key of C major it's
not<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.390> know<00:03:38.420> exactly<00:03:39.489> restful<00:03:40.489> but<00:03:40.790> it's

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
not you know exactly restful but it's

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.630 
not you know exactly restful but it's
not<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.540> bee<00:03:42.109> or<00:03:42.140> knife<00:03:42.530> those<00:03:43.070> create<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.400> lot<00:03:43.549> of

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
not a bee or knife those create a lot of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.370 
not a bee or knife those create a lot of
tension<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.420> it's<00:03:44.540> not<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.720> transparent<00:03:45.290> you

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
tension so it's not a transparent you

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.530 
tension so it's not a transparent you
can<00:03:45.410> play<00:03:45.890> this<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:47.000> know<00:03:47.120> he's<00:03:47.329> not<00:03:47.480> a

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
can play this and you know he's not a

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.950 
can play this and you know he's not a
problem<00:03:47.870> at<00:03:47.959> all<00:03:48.049> but<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:48.889> Sun<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.100> different

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
problem at all but the Sun is different

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.070 
problem at all but the Sun is different
and<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:50.290> if<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.440> take<00:03:50.590> one<00:03:50.830> chord<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.460> then<00:03:52.080> in

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
and so if you take one chord and then in

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.140 
and so if you take one chord and then in
any<00:03:53.230> chord<00:03:53.470> progression<00:03:53.830> you<00:03:53.920> have<00:03:54.100> as<00:03:54.880> long

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
any chord progression you have as long

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.140 
any chord progression you have as long
as<00:03:55.360> you're<00:03:56.230> playing<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:56.590> right<00:03:56.770> the<00:03:57.640> second

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
as you're playing it right the second

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.450 
as you're playing it right the second
chord<00:03:58.480> all<00:03:59.320> right<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.710> second<00:04:00.070> quarter<00:04:00.340> in

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
chord all right the second quarter in

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.760 
chord all right the second quarter in
this<00:04:00.550> case<00:04:00.730> is<00:04:00.850> d<00:04:01.000> minor<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:02.050> seventh<00:04:02.440> version

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
this case is d minor the seventh version

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.280 
this case is d minor the seventh version
of<00:04:02.890> it<00:04:03.010> d<00:04:03.400> minor<00:04:03.670> seventh<00:04:04.180> can<00:04:04.840> perfectly

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
of it d minor seventh can perfectly

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.520 
of it d minor seventh can perfectly
substitute<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:06.060> for<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.300> fourth<00:04:07.720> chord<00:04:08.080> in<00:04:08.320> this

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
substitute a for a fourth chord in this

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.070 
substitute a for a fourth chord in this
case<00:04:08.740> f<00:04:08.950> so<00:04:09.340> you're<00:04:09.520> playing<00:04:09.700> C<00:04:09.970> major<00:04:10.120> each

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
case f so you're playing C major each

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.820 
case f so you're playing C major each
time<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:11.470> find<00:04:11.860> an<00:04:11.980> F<00:04:12.130> chord<00:04:12.630> at<00:04:13.630> least<00:04:13.870> almost

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
just be careful the fact that you can

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.980 
just be careful the fact that you can
substitute<00:04:39.850> a<00:04:40.090> court<00:04:40.300> for<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.570> now<00:04:40.660> that<00:04:40.840> for

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
substitute a court for the now that for

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.320 
substitute a court for the now that for
another<00:04:41.250> doesn't<00:04:42.250> make<00:04:42.400> them<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.790> same<00:04:42.970> chord

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
another doesn't make them the same chord

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.960 
another doesn't make them the same chord
alright<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.230> that's<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.530> fun<00:04:44.830> of<00:04:44.980> substituting

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
alright so that's a fun of substituting

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.910 
alright so that's a fun of substituting
it<00:04:46.600> will<00:04:46.780> sound<00:04:46.960> different<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.590> sometimes

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
it will sound different and sometimes

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.410 
it will sound different and sometimes
depending<00:04:48.550> on<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:48.760> melody<00:04:49.090> you're<00:04:49.180> playing

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
depending on the melody you're playing

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.150 
depending on the melody you're playing
if<00:04:49.930> you're<00:04:50.110> already<00:04:50.200> committed<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.830> melody

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
if you're already committed to a melody

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.310 
if you're already committed to a melody
then<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:52.060> might<00:04:52.210> not<00:04:52.330> like<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.540> result<00:04:52.930> okay

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
then you might not like a result okay

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.020 
then you might not like a result okay
but<00:04:53.500> it's<00:04:53.620> not<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.980> flaw<00:04:54.250> with<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.670> with<00:04:55.000> the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
but it's not a flaw with the with the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.150 
but it's not a flaw with the with the
idea<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.510> idea<00:04:55.540> is<00:04:55.810> sound<00:04:56.350> you<00:04:56.590> can<00:04:56.770> take<00:04:56.950> any

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
idea the idea is sound you can take any

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.850 
idea the idea is sound you can take any
chord<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:58.110> substitute<00:04:59.110> it<00:04:59.200> for<00:04:59.260> another<00:04:59.560> core

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
chord and substitute it for another core

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.440 
chord and substitute it for another core
that<00:05:00.040> has<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.310> same<00:05:00.520> function<00:05:01.030> when<00:05:01.360> I'm

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
that has the same function when I'm

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.300 
that has the same function when I'm
going<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.690> get<00:05:01.810> into<00:05:01.990> that<00:05:02.020> but<00:05:02.740> for<00:05:02.950> now<00:05:03.100> just

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
going to get into that but for now just

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.000 
going to get into that but for now just
figure<00:05:04.060> out<00:05:04.120> what<00:05:04.480> chords<00:05:04.930> share<00:05:05.170> many<00:05:05.920> of

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
figure out what chords share many of

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.320 
figure out what chords share many of
them<00:05:06.160> notes<00:05:06.370> and<00:05:06.670> you<00:05:06.940> should<00:05:07.090> have<00:05:07.120> no

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
them notes and you should have no

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.210 
them notes and you should have no
problem<00:05:07.360> all<00:05:07.960> right<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.110> try<00:05:08.440> to<00:05:08.500> expand<00:05:08.860> on<00:05:09.040> a

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
problem all right I try to expand on a

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.100 
problem all right I try to expand on a
bit<00:05:09.400> on<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.670> in<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.240> future<00:05:10.390> but<00:05:10.750> for<00:05:10.810> now<00:05:10.990> I

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
bit on this in the future but for now I

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.200 
bit on this in the future but for now I
think<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.620> would<00:05:11.770> be<00:05:11.800> interested<00:05:12.700> if<00:05:12.790> you<00:05:12.910> can

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
think it would be interested if you can

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.610 
think it would be interested if you can
work<00:05:13.330> it<00:05:13.540> out<00:05:13.600> all<00:05:13.870> right<00:05:14.050> I'll<00:05:14.380> see<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:14.590> next
