powered most of the time but we're going
to<00:01:21.270> put<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.509> any<00:01:21.689> way<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.320> enlist<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.610> the

to put in any way and enlist in the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.160 
to put in any way and enlist in the
demonstration<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.360> didn't<00:01:24.600> actually<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
demonstration we didn't actually have a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.380 
demonstration we didn't actually have a
hopper<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.759> actually<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> put

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
hopper here and I actually want to put

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.840 
hopper here and I actually want to put
it<00:01:27.479> back<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:30.380> think<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.710> first<00:01:32.700> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it back because I think that first of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.690 
it back because I think that first of
all<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.950> hoppers<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> try<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.340> suck

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
all the hoppers going to try and suck

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.270 
all the hoppers going to try and suck
the<00:01:35.850> item<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.750> cauldron<00:01:37.590> before

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the item out of the cauldron before

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.310 
the item out of the cauldron before
these<00:01:38.700> get<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> chance<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> grab<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.170> so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
these get a chance to grab it so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
these get a chance to grab it so
hopefully<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:40.860> what's<00:01:41.009> gonna<00:01:41.159> happen<00:01:41.430> so

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
hopefully that's what's gonna happen so

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.580 
hopefully that's what's gonna happen so
what's<00:01:42.299> happening<00:01:42.600> now<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.200> hopper<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
what's happening now is this hopper is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.960 
what's happening now is this hopper is
facing<00:01:43.950> other's<00:01:44.130> chests<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.670> all<00:01:44.820> these

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
facing other's chests and all these

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.910 
facing other's chests and all these
other<00:01:45.119> hoppers<00:01:45.540> are<00:01:45.750> gang<00:01:46.140> together<00:01:46.409> all

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
other hoppers are gang together all

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.620 
other hoppers are gang together all
pointing<00:01:47.340> towards<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:47.939> he<00:01:48.060> drops<00:01:48.420> which

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
pointing towards here so he drops which

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.399 
pointing towards here so he drops which
lean<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.930> here<00:01:49.140> getting<00:01:49.409> up<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.770> chest

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409

alright so we're going to place a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.050 
alright so we're going to place a
redstone<00:01:54.390> block<00:01:55.490> where<00:01:56.490> are<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> redstone

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
redstone block where are you redstone

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
redstone block where are you redstone
block<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.630> go<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.930> redstone<00:01:58.229> block<00:01:58.590> right

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
block here we go a redstone block right

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.359 
block here we go a redstone block right
here<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.820> that's<00:02:00.719> our<00:02:00.990> bottom<00:02:01.500> layer<00:02:01.829> right

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
here and that's our bottom layer right

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.679 
here and that's our bottom layer right
so<00:02:02.610> let's<00:02:02.790> move<00:02:02.909> over<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.360> bit<00:02:03.540> more

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
animal we do this bit and then we'll do

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.740 
animal we do this bit and then we'll do
the<00:02:06.329> next<00:02:06.630> step<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.729> bear<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:08.759> me<00:02:08.879> while<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.179> do

go to place like grandma's in a hopper
going<00:02:46.049> into<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.650> dispenser<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
going into that dispenser so the

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.369 
going into that dispenser so the
chickens<00:02:48.569> are<00:02:48.629> going<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.810> lay<00:02:48.900> eggs<00:02:49.079> through

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
here they're going to hit this dispenser

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.130 
here they're going to hit this dispenser
alright<00:02:51.359> that's<00:02:51.569> good<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:54.140> comparator

to grab the signal and then what do we
do<00:03:01.590> do<00:03:01.890> we<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.370> solid<00:03:02.760> blocks<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.540> see<00:03:04.970> we

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
do do we have a solid blocks that see we

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.690 
do do we have a solid blocks that see we
use<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.120> same<00:03:06.150> color<00:03:06.629> box<00:03:06.870> before<00:03:07.519> they<00:03:08.519> lead

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.849 
use the same color box before they lead
us<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.970> get<00:03:09.090> busted<00:03:09.329> so<00:03:10.019> go<00:03:10.170> one<00:03:10.349> block<00:03:10.500> here

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
us to get busted so go one block here

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:17.240 
us to get busted so go one block here
and<00:03:11.069> then<00:03:11.459> we've<00:03:11.970> got<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:15.590> lock<00:03:16.590> that's<00:03:17.040> it

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
not the time is going to work okay so

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.110 
not the time is going to work okay so
that's<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.129> for<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.280> layer<00:04:05.579> now<00:04:05.819> we<00:04:05.879> need<00:04:05.970> to

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
that's it for that layer now we need to

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.119 
that's it for that layer now we need to
go<00:04:06.359> back<00:04:06.389> and<00:04:06.900> grab<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.410> chest<00:04:07.680> which<00:04:07.829> I<00:04:07.949> just

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
go back and grab that chest which I just

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.960 
go back and grab that chest which I just
got<00:04:08.340> rid<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:10.129> place<00:04:11.129> it<00:04:11.310> down<00:04:11.340> here<00:04:11.819> we're

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
got rid of and place it down here we're

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.640 
got rid of and place it down here we're
going<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.150> build<00:04:12.660> this<00:04:12.780> layer<00:04:13.109> again<00:04:13.260> I<00:04:13.470> might

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
going to build this layer again I might

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.050 
going to build this layer again I might
speed<00:04:13.889> this<00:04:13.980> up<00:04:14.129> because<00:04:14.340> you've<00:04:14.849> already

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
speed this up because you've already

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:41.310 
speed this up because you've already
seen<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.359> two<00:04:15.720> times<00:04:15.930> already

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.540 

alright<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:42.560> now<00:04:42.860> we're<00:04:43.010> ready<00:04:43.100> for<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.370> third

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
alright so now we're ready for the third

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.360 
alright so now we're ready for the third
layer<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:44.060> what<00:04:44.690> we<00:04:44.780> need<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:44.960> do<00:04:45.230> is<00:04:45.530> it's

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
layer and what we need to do is it's

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.830 
layer and what we need to do is it's
basically<00:04:46.520> just<00:04:46.790> placing<00:04:47.210> blocks<00:04:47.420> now<00:04:47.690> so

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
basically just placing blocks now so

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.000 
basically just placing blocks now so
we're<00:04:47.930> going<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.110> play<00:04:48.230> some<00:04:48.290> blocks<00:04:48.680> all<00:04:48.890> the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
we're going to play some blocks all the

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.340 
we're going to play some blocks all the
way<00:04:49.100> along<00:04:49.190> exit<00:04:50.060> for<00:04:50.210> Thea<00:04:50.950> along<00:04:51.950> here<00:04:53.350> here

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
way along exit for Thea along here here

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.070 
way along exit for Thea along here here
and<00:04:54.940> here<00:04:58.240> now<00:04:59.240> it's<00:04:59.420> need<00:04:59.540> to<00:04:59.600> find<00:04:59.780> a<00:04:59.840> sticky

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
and here now it's need to find a sticky

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.370 
and here now it's need to find a sticky
piston<00:05:00.200> weird<00:05:00.740> s<00:05:00.890> to<00:05:01.040> keep<00:05:01.160> busting<00:05:01.520> hello

are<00:05:40.220> still<00:05:40.430> doing<00:05:40.610> this<00:05:40.730> thing<00:05:40.940> over<00:05:41.060> there<00:05:41.240> we

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
are still doing this thing over there we

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
are still doing this thing over there we
had<00:05:42.350> to<00:05:42.470> come<00:05:42.650> on<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:43.070> do<00:05:43.280> this<00:05:44.320> to<00:05:45.320> to<00:05:45.950> switch

had to come on and do this to to switch
up<00:05:46.250> these<00:05:46.460> designs<00:05:46.790> a<00:05:46.910> little<00:05:47.090> bit<00:05:47.240> to<00:05:47.480> to

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
up these designs a little bit to to

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.510 
up these designs a little bit to to
address<00:05:48.530> some<00:05:48.680> of<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:48.830> issues<00:05:48.860> that<00:05:49.100> you<00:05:49.340> guys

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
address some of the issues that you guys

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.080 
address some of the issues that you guys
have<00:05:49.730> had<00:05:50.740> with<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.770> first<00:05:52.100> original<00:05:52.520> 3<00:05:52.730> x<00:05:52.850> 3<00:05:52.880> x

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
have had with the first original 3 x 3 x

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.990 
have had with the first original 3 x 3 x
3<00:05:53.290> yeah<00:05:54.290> so<00:05:54.650> hopefully<00:05:55.220> that<00:05:55.400> some<00:05:55.670> cleared<00:05:55.940> a

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
3 yeah so hopefully that some cleared a

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.330 
3 yeah so hopefully that some cleared a
few<00:05:56.150> things<00:05:56.270> up<00:05:56.450> for<00:05:56.570> you<00:05:56.690> and<00:05:57.220> it's<00:05:58.220> as

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
few things up for you and it's as

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.780 
few things up for you and it's as

example and you've been watching the

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.990 
example and you've been watching the

the<00:06:11.510> duplicate<00:06:12.110> eggs<00:06:12.410> I<00:06:12.650> try<00:06:13.010> to<00:06:13.040> say

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
the duplicate eggs I try to say

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.940 
the duplicate eggs I try to say
typically<00:06:13.760> eggs<00:06:13.880> and<00:06:14.600> whatnot<00:06:15.200> alright<00:06:15.650> so

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
typically eggs and whatnot alright so

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.460 
typically eggs and whatnot alright so
there<00:06:16.310> should<00:06:16.580> be<00:06:16.610> really<00:06:17.390> good<00:06:17.660> it<00:06:18.230> should<00:06:18.380> be

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
there should be really good it should be

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.960 
there should be really good it should be
really<00:06:18.620> good<00:06:18.770> so<00:06:18.980> the<00:06:19.190> only<00:06:19.460> floor<00:06:19.670> this

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
really good so the only floor this

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.880 
really good so the only floor this
design<00:06:20.300> is<00:06:20.330> this<00:06:20.990> particular<00:06:21.230> hopper<00:06:21.770> is

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
design is this particular hopper is

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.750 
design is this particular hopper is
powered<00:06:22.340> and<00:06:23.140> that<00:06:24.140> is<00:06:24.350> not<00:06:24.800> necessarily<00:06:25.610> a

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
powered and that is not necessarily a

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.300 
powered and that is not necessarily a
good<00:06:26.090> thing<00:06:26.470> however<00:06:27.470> effin<00:06:27.860> item<00:06:28.130> does

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
good thing however effin item does

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.950 
good thing however effin item does
manage<00:06:28.640> to<00:06:28.670> find<00:06:29.030> its<00:06:29.150> way<00:06:29.240> on<00:06:29.300> top<00:06:29.540> of<00:06:29.690> here

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
manage to find its way on top of here

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.559 
manage to find its way on top of here
then<00:06:30.320> it<00:06:30.560> will<00:06:30.710> eventually<00:06:30.950> get<00:06:31.250> sucked<00:06:31.550> up

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:32.569 
then it will eventually get sucked up

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:34.929 
then it will eventually get sucked up
okay<00:06:33.349> just<00:06:33.499> quickly<00:06:33.740> i<00:06:33.919> believe<00:06:34.399> that<00:06:34.699> this

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:34.939 
okay just quickly i believe that this

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:37.629 
okay just quickly i believe that this
redstone<00:06:35.869> dust<00:06:36.259> which<00:06:36.770> replaced<00:06:37.129> down<00:06:37.339> here

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
redstone dust which replaced down here
