00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.560
 Michael 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.289
 Hi percent welcome to watch for clinics or Dominik and Porta 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.100
 show you how the Ruhr became 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.179
 CIO de Corse will be able to work properly 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.620
 Andrews first summit ridge cool on whether operation then CIO de Kate and then CIO 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.559
 de Castelbajac prepare a total of seven levels unused 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.420
 For example, the us government could hear the first words 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 I make room in yellow 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.850
 then it's done 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 then you come back in this mode and you can do Gallup 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.490
 I have now taken skulls 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.730
 So select beautiful 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.280
 Artemis village 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.530
 we already had that 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.730
 Miss Dior 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.790
 according to plan she now sees it in the background 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.620
 Immediately before 2 0 you have to challenge your team - and step by step 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.960
 above 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.430
 but so plausible not so nice and that's why I'm doing 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.710
 JÃ¼rgen Black 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.640
 And also Aigner looks a bit weird because of that almost never on the region 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.070
 page 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 so again up in black unclear 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.840
 Kokott still bustling Brussels 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.240
 and shrubbery 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.130
 done again and please 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 third time 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.920
 black 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.030
 smaller 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.520
 up 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.840
 pac-man smaller 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 makes the Weko smaller and buys 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.460
 the c-students are a bit boring and therefore still in the future 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.409
 other corners that are still free 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.610
 Pacult was 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.610
 you can in dinosaurs of Christ or 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.839
 Trophies bring Celtura banker 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.789
 or their quads from things 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.289
 take it now 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.479
 that is you can of course take it too 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.479
 but I take the crown 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.339
 to be found annually 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:28.859
 there she is already 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.859
 Gronemeyer Rechsteiner had to be in the foreground 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.459
 Goal I do not make me a nicer need 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.269
 finally done again 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.309
 and promptly percolate another boat out 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.809
 namely the net 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.809
 Yukos will be 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.719
 grabs the duo call and do something in green 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.669
 done 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.499
 So this is now also a guide how to do how to do that 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.499
 you might have to do it to him 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.939
 Nia Kuenzer 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.939
 and then in bad luck a smiley 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.299
 Runs rest 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.099
 make a small push into the corner and Klaus Duphorn in blue 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.289
 that was it 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.329
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.629
 then suddenly Karl Traub and kidneys have come down and gives us animals 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.819
 Tips on how we can still do what we can for tips 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.419
 can give 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.669
 I like to comment on this and that too simply all with and no comments 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:47.589
 from 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.429
 that's my result 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:53.260
 Petra damage to the door in the encyclical change background though 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
 best felt with Ferber 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:58.079
 Until next time
