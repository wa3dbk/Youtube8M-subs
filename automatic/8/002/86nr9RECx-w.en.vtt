00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.580
The beard is a kind of hair which catches every bad scent first.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.040
It likes to become shaggy, ragged, shaped badly and so on.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.680
That’s why we need a few simple things – 
once in a while we must shave the beard properly,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.220
by someone who knows how to do it,
how to give shape to a beard. 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.340
Wash it every day, and brush it at least two times a day.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.380
This way we increase our skin’s blood flow
and make our beard grow better and faster.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.800
One of the easiest things to do – eating proteins.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.020
Hair, same as the whole body, needs building blocks,
Which comes in the form of proteins.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.760
Another thing – hair oils.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.480
They help the beard to shape  and smell nicely,
keeps the hair smooth and easy to brush,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.440
But it also covers, surrounds the hair, making it resistant to soaking bad smells from the outside.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.240
The beard likes to catch the scents of the kitchen, cigarettes…

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.880
 There are at least two ways of fringing a beard on the neck.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:03.040
One of them is to naturally shade it with scissors from the very bottom,
From the Adam’s apple to the top.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.580
The other way is the one you can see me doing right now, which is the one I like most.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.600
This method makes the beard look clean and tidy.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.720
So I cut the beard evenly, and later recede it with a shavette. It looks great. 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.480
With such a moustache, I cannot cut these endings.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.120
This will make the beard look “Taliban”;
No moustache – just a beard.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.320
The endings, or even the whole moustache stay as they are.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.440
But leaving the whole moustache is not really hygienic, so in most cases the endings stay, in order to connect them to the rest of the beard.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.480
Mark will also receive  The Featherweight,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:22.680
Which will make his hair look fluffy, but well formed and smooth.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.540
Although they will not look slicked, 
since we don’t want them to look slicked
or stick to the head.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.680
The haircut will have a parting, but it’ll be a little more relaxed.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.460
So, after shaving we use the clove-scented, refreshing Lay Right.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.840
We’re having fun here – clove, gingerbread, Christmas eve.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.140
The Beard tonic, which I have mentioned a few times today.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.860
Gentlemen, 
Today we are presenting you a moustache wax.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.840
Great formula, good for shaping.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.260
I don’t know if we’ll be able to curl your moustache a little bit more,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:36.380
Since they may not be long enough,
but only for the special mood of doing that, for the smell, the glitter, the shine,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:43.940
to prevent your moustache from landing in the soup,
and spread nicely to the sides.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.820
We rub it well, as in the case of every pomade, to avoid any lump.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.060
We lay it on the surface, never on the skin.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.260
In general, hair cosmetics should never be laid on the skin.
