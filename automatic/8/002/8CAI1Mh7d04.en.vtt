like a jointer I'm thinning the piece of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.039 
like a jointer I'm thinning the piece of
wood<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.539> getting<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.899> flat<00:01:51.170> edge<00:01:51.380> on<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:53.049> now

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
wood and getting a flat edge on it now

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.719 
wood and getting a flat edge on it now
I'm<00:01:54.200> down<00:01:54.349> to<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.590> file<00:01:54.799> I'm<00:01:54.979> just<00:01:55.189> rounding<00:01:55.610> it

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
I'm down to a file I'm just rounding it

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.600 
I'm down to a file I'm just rounding it
so<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.030> fits<00:01:56.299> into<00:01:56.599> those<00:01:56.750> ends<00:01:57.369> it's<00:01:58.369> got<00:01:58.520> to

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
so it fits into those ends it's got to

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.160 
so it fits into those ends it's got to
be<00:01:58.700> pretty<00:01:58.880> exactly<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.659> length<00:01:59.869> or<00:02:00.049> you're

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
be pretty exactly the length or you're

along the glue joint you'll see a brown
glue<00:02:51.489> instead<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.609> a<00:02:52.700> clear<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.209> if<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.359> don't

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
glue instead of a clear and if I don't

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.180 
glue instead of a clear and if I don't
get<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.870> perfect<00:02:54.319> joint<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:54.739> gonna<00:02:54.980> be<00:02:55.160> a

doesn't take much it's a good fit so I'm

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.559 
doesn't take much it's a good fit so I'm
gonna<00:03:07.310> wrap<00:03:07.609> it<00:03:07.639> with<00:03:07.849> rubber<00:03:08.150> bands

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.089 

I've<00:03:12.569> got<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.050> going<00:03:13.349> this<00:03:13.500> way<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.920> I'm<00:03:13.980> gonna

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
I've got to going this way and I'm gonna

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.830 
I've got to going this way and I'm gonna
get<00:03:14.250> one<00:03:14.430> up<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.730> middle<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:17.450> let<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.599> glue

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
get one up the middle I let that glue

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.869 
get one up the middle I let that glue
dry<00:03:19.110> about<00:03:19.379> two<00:03:19.590> hours<00:03:19.799> sometimes<00:03:20.489> I'd<00:03:20.700> go

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
dry about two hours sometimes I'd go

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.809 
dry about two hours sometimes I'd go
overnight<00:03:21.150> it'll<00:03:21.810> even<00:03:21.959> be<00:03:22.080> harder<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:22.819> two

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
overnight it'll even be harder but two

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.610 
overnight it'll even be harder but two
hours<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.360> slope<00:03:24.720> cure<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.319> started

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
hours on the slope cure and it started

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.130 
hours on the slope cure and it started
to<00:03:25.709> shape<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.549> scraper<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.750> good<00:03:27.930> way<00:03:28.080> to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
to shape on a scraper is a good way to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.470 
to shape on a scraper is a good way to
come<00:03:28.410> close<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.099> wood<00:03:29.310> without<00:03:30.030> touching

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
come close to the wood without touching

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.449 
come close to the wood without touching
the<00:03:30.720> surrounding<00:03:31.230> fingerboard<00:03:31.799> because

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
the surrounding fingerboard because

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.160 
the surrounding fingerboard because
there's<00:03:32.640> got<00:03:32.819> that<00:03:33.000> age<00:03:33.420> on<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:38.930> scotch<00:03:39.930> tape

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
there's got that age on it scotch tape

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.080 
there's got that age on it scotch tape
is<00:03:40.349> two<00:03:40.560> thousandths<00:03:41.099> of<00:03:41.159> an<00:03:41.310> inch<00:03:41.430> thick<00:03:41.849> so

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
is two thousandths of an inch thick so

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.569 
is two thousandths of an inch thick so
that<00:03:43.079> protects<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.829> finish<00:03:44.129> in<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.340> case<00:03:44.549> like

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
that protects the finish in a case like

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.420 
that protects the finish in a case like
this<00:03:45.049> when<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.170> hit<00:03:46.379> that<00:03:46.560> tape<00:03:46.829> you<00:03:46.860> stopped

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.360 

doesn't<00:03:50.430> look<00:03:50.549> bad<00:03:50.760> does<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:52.099> deals<00:03:53.099> with<00:03:53.280> it

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
doesn't look bad does it deals with it

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.020 
doesn't look bad does it deals with it
too

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
too

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.420
