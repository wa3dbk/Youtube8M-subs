00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
writing to the end of the seam there

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.060 
writing to the end of the seam there
there'll<00:04:02.170> be<00:04:02.230> three<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.620> quarter<00:04:02.860> inches

we've<00:04:07.450> got<00:04:07.600> a<00:04:07.630> bit<00:04:07.750> more<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.080> way<00:04:10.500> that's

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
we've got a bit more that way that's

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.600 
we've got a bit more that way that's
four<00:04:11.740> in<00:04:11.800> a<00:04:11.890> quarter

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.349 

you'll<00:04:15.600> be<00:04:15.720> more<00:04:15.870> on<00:04:15.990> that<00:04:16.079> way<00:04:17.329> just<00:04:18.329> make

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
you'll be more on that way just make

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.210 
you'll be more on that way just make
