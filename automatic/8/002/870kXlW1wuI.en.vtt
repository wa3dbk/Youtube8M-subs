what the fab shell is is sort of an

what the fab shell is is sort of an
update<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.170> fitted<00:00:40.890> case<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:41.460> was

update to the fitted case which was

update to the fitted case which was
specs<00:00:42.239> fabric<00:00:43.079> coated<00:00:43.559> plastic<00:00:44.070> shell<00:00:44.309> but

specs fabric coated plastic shell but

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.190 
specs fabric coated plastic shell but
they've<00:00:44.969> made<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.300> more<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.989> cross

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
they've made it more of kind of a cross

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.139 
they've made it more of kind of a cross
between<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.800> fitted<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> candy<00:00:47.760> shell<00:00:47.910> I

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
between the fitted and the candy shell I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.010 
between the fitted and the candy shell I
kind<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:50.059> fabric<00:00:51.059> coated<00:00:51.480> candy

kind of like it to a fabric coated candy
shell<00:00:52.199> case<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.039> kind<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.309> two

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
shell case because you have kind of two

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.819 
shell case because you have kind of two
materials<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:54.149> play<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.050> TPU<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
materials at play here you have TPU and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.979 
materials at play here you have TPU and
then<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> fabric<00:00:56.820> pattern<00:00:57.480> along<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
then you have a fabric pattern along the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.349 
then you have a fabric pattern along the
sides<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> back<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> case

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
sides and the back so here is the case

color of the black iphone but you'll get

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.340 
color of the black iphone but you'll get
the<00:01:32.549> general<00:01:32.850> idea<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.450> Front's<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.140> least

on both the black and the white i have

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
on both the black and the white i have
it's<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> only<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> black<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.659> let's

like<00:03:23.699> I<00:03:23.790> do<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:24.000> candyshell<00:03:24.479> I<00:03:24.750> start<00:03:25.229> with

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
like I do the candyshell I start with

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.500 
like I do the candyshell I start with
the<00:03:25.440> bun<00:03:25.590> side<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.099> I<00:03:26.159> pop<00:03:26.519> them<00:03:26.699> in<00:03:26.909> from<00:03:27.419> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
the bun side and I pop them in from the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.719 
the bun side and I pop them in from the
bottom<00:03:27.689> like<00:03:28.079> so<00:03:28.109> so<00:03:28.949> I've<00:03:29.069> got<00:03:29.220> my<00:03:29.250> white<00:03:29.549> one

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
bottom like so so I've got my white one

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:30.860 
bottom like so so I've got my white one
in<00:03:29.849> there<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.180> there's<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.449> white<00:03:30.629> look

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
in there and there's the white look

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.449 
in there and there's the white look
personally<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.650> think<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.919> white<00:03:32.069> one<00:03:32.220> looks

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
personally I think the white one looks

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.770 
personally I think the white one looks
better<00:03:32.669> with<00:03:32.909> this<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.239> that's<00:03:33.419> why<00:03:33.569> I'm<00:03:33.750> doing

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
better with this so that's why I'm doing

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.289 
better with this so that's why I'm doing
this<00:03:34.079> so<00:03:34.379> now<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.560> can<00:03:34.739> see<00:03:34.949> how<00:03:34.979> both<00:03:35.430> phones

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
this so now you can see how both phones

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.719 
this so now you can see how both phones
both<00:03:36.750> colors<00:03:37.199> look<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.859> case<00:03:38.189> when<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.489> get<00:03:38.639> it

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
both colors look on a case when I get it

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.280 
both colors look on a case when I get it
in<00:03:38.849> and<00:03:39.030> yeah<00:03:39.419> I<00:03:39.449> kind<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.840> think<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.109> white

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
in and yeah I kind of think the white

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.599 
in and yeah I kind of think the white
pops<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.799> little<00:03:40.829> bit<00:03:41.099> more<00:03:41.280> with<00:03:41.459> this

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
pops a little bit more with this

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.699 
pops a little bit more with this
particular<00:03:41.819> color<00:03:42.479> of<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.259> case<00:03:43.439> the<00:03:43.620> other

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
particular color of the case the other

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.469 
particular color of the case the other
two<00:03:43.949> versions<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.639> case<00:03:44.909> which<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.299> showed

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099
