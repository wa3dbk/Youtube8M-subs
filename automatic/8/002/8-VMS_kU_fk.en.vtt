00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
know so again and 00 you get only one

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.059 
know so again and 00 you get only one
address<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.840> I'd<00:02:39.350> know<00:02:39.530> how<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.709> spell<00:02:40.010> it

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
address and I'd know how to spell it

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.610 
address and I'd know how to spell it
don't<00:02:40.790> come<00:02:40.940> at<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.209> time<00:02:41.390> she<00:02:41.660> did<00:02:42.319> English

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
don't come at the time she did English

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.449 
don't come at the time she did English
so<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:44.209> just<00:02:44.390> add<00:02:44.600> not<00:02:45.049> a<00:02:45.080> bit<00:02:45.380> not<00:02:45.920> become<00:02:46.310> out

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
so you just add not a bit not become out

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.000 
so you just add not a bit not become out
it'd<00:02:46.670> make<00:02:46.880> my<00:02:47.060> crash<00:02:47.330> like<00:02:47.930> 1<00:02:48.140> million<00:02:48.410> 1

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
it'd make my crash like 1 million 1

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.570 
it'd make my crash like 1 million 1
