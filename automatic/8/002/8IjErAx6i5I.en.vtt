so<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.850> want<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.000> take<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.299> energy<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
so we want to take that energy and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.749 
so we want to take that energy and
disperse<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.409> out<00:01:31.619> essentially<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.549> will

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
disperse it out essentially this will

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.890 
disperse it out essentially this will
help<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.000> propel<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.570> through<00:01:33.810> your

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
help you propel you through your

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.899 
help you propel you through your
transition<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.189> go<00:01:35.340> from<00:01:35.579> heel<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.759> toe

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
transition as you go from heel to toe

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.640 
transition as you go from heel to toe
you're<00:01:36.479> only<00:01:36.540> aids<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.170> takes<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you're only aids in that takes the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
you're only aids in that takes the
pressure<00:01:37.890> off<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.670> again<00:01:39.000> imagine

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
pressure off really so again imagine

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.780 
pressure off really so again imagine
running<00:01:39.810> from<00:01:40.530> point<00:01:40.740> A<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.829> point<00:01:40.920> B<00:01:41.130> two<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
running from point A to point B two to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.520 
running from point A to point B two to
three<00:01:41.909> times<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.210> natural<00:01:42.630> body<00:01:42.810> weight<00:01:42.990> 150

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
three times your natural body weight 150

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
three times your natural body weight 150
pound<00:01:43.710> man<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.430> would<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.579> 300<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> 450

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
pound man that would be 300 to 450

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.210 
pound man that would be 300 to 450
pounds<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.899> each<00:01:46.049> step<00:01:46.350> well<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.799> body<00:01:47.040> would

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
pounds on each step well your body would

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.010 
pounds on each step well your body would
have<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> take<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.670> impact<00:01:48.149> by<00:01:48.630> doing<00:01:48.930> this

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
have to take that impact by doing this

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.569 
have to take that impact by doing this
it<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.290> saves<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.070> impact<00:01:50.340> from<00:01:50.430> your

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
it really saves the impact from your

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
it really saves the impact from your
body<00:01:50.759> allowing<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.720> more<00:01:51.960> efficient

and<00:01:52.590> your<00:01:52.860> energy<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> be

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and your energy is not going to be

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.670 
and your energy is not going to be
wasted<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.060> simply<00:01:54.360> shock<00:01:54.600> absorption<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.500> was

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
wasted on simply shock absorption it was

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.350 
wasted on simply shock absorption it was
years<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> making<00:01:56.280> really<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.790> mean<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.060> was

footwear everyone has always done energy
absorption<00:02:15.580> but<00:02:16.150> now<00:02:16.300> we're<00:02:16.420> going<00:02:16.569> looking

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
absorption but now we're going looking

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.870 
absorption but now we're going looking
for<00:02:16.900> propulsion<00:02:17.380> based<00:02:17.800> technologies<00:02:18.430> we

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
for propulsion based technologies we

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.550 
for propulsion based technologies we
know<00:02:19.030> as<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.209> runner<00:02:19.510> you're<00:02:20.140> going<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.350> come

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
know as a runner you're going to come

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.080 
know as a runner you're going to come
down<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:20.920> land<00:02:21.100> on<00:02:21.370> your<00:02:21.550> what<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:21.819> call<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
down and land on your what we call the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.910 
down and land on your what we call the
lateral<00:02:22.540> heel<00:02:22.750> you're<00:02:23.290> going<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.500> crash<00:02:23.709> down

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
lateral heel you're going to crash down

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.590 
lateral heel you're going to crash down
here<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.430> then<00:02:24.730> tendency<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.180> roll<00:02:25.450> across

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
here and then tendency is to roll across

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.150 
here and then tendency is to roll across
so<00:02:26.230> what<00:02:26.350> we<00:02:26.410> want<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.590> do<00:02:26.680> is<00:02:26.830> we<00:02:26.920> want<00:02:26.950> to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
so what we want to do is we want to

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.910 
so what we want to do is we want to
soften<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.700> on<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.390> outside<00:02:28.870> but<00:02:29.440> firm<00:02:29.709> this

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
soften it on this outside but firm this

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.350 
soften it on this outside but firm this
up<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.489> what<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.790> call<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.030> medial<00:02:31.330> side

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
up on the what we call the medial side

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.300 
up on the what we call the medial side
or<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.750> inside<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.380> shoe<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:33.069> allow<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.280> to

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
or the inside of the shoe to allow it to

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.610 
or the inside of the shoe to allow it to
be<00:02:33.430> more<00:02:33.580> stable<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.660> when<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:34.900> build<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.380> we

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
be more stable so when we build this we

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.370 
be more stable so when we build this we
build<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.950> outside<00:02:36.520> struts<00:02:37.000> at<00:02:37.569> 22<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.350> a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
build the outside struts at 22 and a

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.479 
build the outside struts at 22 and a
half<00:02:38.410> degree<00:02:38.800> angle<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.130> can<00:02:39.220> actually<00:02:39.340> see

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
half degree angle you can actually see

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.550 
half degree angle you can actually see
it<00:02:39.730> with<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.030> pen<00:02:40.239> all<00:02:41.020> right<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.380> that

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
it with the pen all right so that

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.380 
it with the pen all right so that
essentially<00:02:41.920> relaxes<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.760> side<00:02:43.000> allows<00:02:43.239> it

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
essentially relaxes that side allows it

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.420 
essentially relaxes that side allows it
to<00:02:43.420> compress<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.110> allows<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.800> start<00:02:45.280> to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
to compress and allows you to start to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.449 
to compress and allows you to start to
roll<00:02:45.640> on<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.330> medial<00:02:46.720> side<00:02:46.750> we<00:02:47.590> build<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.040> at

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
roll on the medial side we build it at

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.910 
roll on the medial side we build it at
90<00:02:49.000> degrees<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.690> can<00:02:49.810> actually<00:02:49.930> see<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
90 degrees so you can actually see the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.860 
90 degrees so you can actually see the
technology<00:02:51.459> there<00:02:51.640> at<00:02:51.910> 90<00:02:52.300> degrees<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:52.720> this

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
technology there at 90 degrees so this

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.570
