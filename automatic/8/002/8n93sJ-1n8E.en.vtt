on the way it works in a nutshell is we
have<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.289> base<00:00:58.680> unit<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.219> plugged<00:00:59.370> in

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
have this base unit that's plugged in

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.750 
have this base unit that's plugged in
via<00:00:59.550> USB<00:01:00.260> right<00:01:01.260> into<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.829> control<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
via USB right into the control of the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.789 
via USB right into the control of the
computer<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.570> generates<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.229> weak<00:01:04.409> magnetic

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
computer it generates a weak magnetic

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000 
computer it generates a weak magnetic
field<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.909> used<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.990> position<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
field that we used to get position and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.590 
field that we used to get position and
orientation<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.700> these<00:01:08.850> controllers<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.510> if

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
orientation of these controllers so if

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
orientation of these controllers so if
you<00:01:09.689> take<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> look<00:01:10.130> while<00:01:11.130> we're<00:01:11.280> mailing<00:01:11.490> you

technology that we used is the hyper
response<00:03:44.130> technology<00:03:44.340> from<00:03:44.760> our<00:03:44.970> gaming<00:03:45.209> mice

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
response technology from our gaming mice

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.420 
response technology from our gaming mice
we<00:03:46.079> transfer<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.769> action<00:03:47.130> buttons

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
we transfer that to the action buttons

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.220 
we transfer that to the action buttons
of<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.669> controller<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.660> they're<00:03:48.930> fast

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
of the controller so they're fast

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.470 
of the controller so they're fast
excavation<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.130> they<00:03:51.060> have<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.239> really

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
cliquey feel to them very nice very nice

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.539 
cliquey feel to them very nice very nice
feel<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.900> then<00:03:54.900> we<00:03:55.739> designed<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.130> really<00:03:56.370> cool

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
feel and then we designed it really cool

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.759 
feel and then we designed it really cool
we<00:03:57.060> put<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.269> rubberized<00:03:57.959> finish<00:03:58.200> from<00:03:58.590> our

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769
