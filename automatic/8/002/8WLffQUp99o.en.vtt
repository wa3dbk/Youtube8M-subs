hey<00:00:01.819> hey<00:00:02.120> guys<00:00:02.900> weird<00:00:03.470> because<00:00:04.299> I'm<00:00:05.299> testing

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
hey hey guys weird because I'm testing

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:07.539 
hey hey guys weird because I'm testing
80<00:00:06.110> spotting<00:00:06.680> mechanics<00:00:07.160> of<00:00:07.430> the<00:00:07.520> game

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:07.549 
80 spotting mechanics of the game

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.029 
80 spotting mechanics of the game
because<00:00:08.299> I've<00:00:08.900> looked<00:00:09.200> all<00:00:09.650> over<00:00:09.709> the

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:10.039 
because I've looked all over the

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.470 
because I've looked all over the
internet<00:00:10.339> and<00:00:10.639> I<00:00:10.759> have<00:00:10.879> not<00:00:11.059> been<00:00:11.089> able<00:00:11.329> to

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
internet and I have not been able to

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.419 
internet and I have not been able to
find<00:00:11.749> anywhere<00:00:12.289> where<00:00:12.589> it<00:00:12.679> says<00:00:12.860> exactly<00:00:13.190> how

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
find anywhere where it says exactly how

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.299 
find anywhere where it says exactly how
long<00:00:13.639> you<00:00:13.789> are<00:00:13.820> spotted<00:00:14.440> normally<00:00:15.440> and<00:00:15.619> how

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
long you are spotted normally and how

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.600 
long you are spotted normally and how
long<00:00:16.610> the<00:00:17.390> shadow<00:00:18.110> perk<00:00:18.470> is<00:00:18.830> you<00:00:19.490> know

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
long the shadow perk is you know

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.110 
long the shadow perk is you know
reducing<00:00:20.540> that<00:00:20.630> amount<00:00:21.050> of<00:00:21.260> time<00:00:21.700> so<00:00:22.700> let's

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 
reducing that amount of time so let's

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.970 
reducing that amount of time so let's
just<00:00:23.360> test<00:00:23.510> this<00:00:23.660> I've<00:00:23.900> set<00:00:24.080> up<00:00:24.110> a<00:00:24.380> timer<00:00:24.710> in

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
just test this I've set up a timer in

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.020 
just test this I've set up a timer in
the<00:00:25.130> bottom<00:00:25.490> left<00:00:25.730> hands<00:00:27.340> on<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:28.640> mini-map

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
the bottom left hands on the mini-map

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.529 
the bottom left hands on the mini-map
so<00:00:29.600> you'll<00:00:29.750> see<00:00:29.869> exactly<00:00:30.170> how<00:00:30.560> long<00:00:30.830> he<00:00:31.250> is

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
so you'll see exactly how long he is

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.009 
so you'll see exactly how long he is
spotted<00:00:32.539> and<00:00:32.960> you'll<00:00:33.530> see<00:00:33.739> exactly<00:00:34.129> how<00:00:34.399> long

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
spotted and you'll see exactly how long

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:41.439 
spotted and you'll see exactly how long
his<00:00:36.019> spots<00:00:36.620> mark<00:00:36.920> is<00:00:37.190> still<00:00:37.370> there<00:00:40.179> right<00:00:41.179> so

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
his spots mark is still there right so

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.329 
his spots mark is still there right so
I'm<00:00:41.870> gonna<00:00:42.019> spot<00:00:42.319> him<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.710> look<00:00:42.859> away<00:00:43.010> because

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
I'm gonna spot him and look away because

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.189 
I'm gonna spot him and look away because
if<00:00:43.789> I<00:00:43.999> constantly<00:00:44.300> look<00:00:44.629> at<00:00:44.749> him<00:00:44.870> he's<00:00:45.050> gonna

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
if I constantly look at him he's gonna

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.799 
if I constantly look at him he's gonna
constantly<00:00:45.620> turn<00:00:45.949> up<00:00:46.069> on<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:46.280> camera<00:00:46.579> but<00:00:47.539> I'm

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
constantly turn up on the camera but I'm

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.149 
constantly turn up on the camera but I'm
gonna<00:00:47.960> spot<00:00:48.229> him<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.589> look<00:00:48.710> away<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.100> then

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
gonna spot him and look away and then

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.649 
gonna spot him and look away and then
you'll<00:00:49.429> pay<00:00:49.850> attention<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.359> bottom

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
you'll pay attention to the bottom

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.099 
you'll pay attention to the bottom
left-hand<00:00:50.899> corner<00:00:51.050> of<00:00:51.289> the<00:00:51.409> screen<00:00:51.530> here<00:00:51.769> like

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
left-hand corner of the screen here like

00:00:53.109 --> 00:01:00.849 
left-hand corner of the screen here like
so<00:00:54.370> Ready<00:00:55.370> Set<00:00:58.839> this<00:00:59.839> is<00:00:59.960> without<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.559> shadow

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
so Ready Set this is without the shadow

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.240 
so Ready Set this is without the shadow
perk<00:01:01.190> you'll<00:01:01.639> see<00:01:01.850> he<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:02.329> spotted<00:01:02.539> for<00:01:03.019> about

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
perk you'll see he is spotted for about

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.170 
perk you'll see he is spotted for about
seven<00:01:04.250> seconds<00:01:04.580> exactly<00:01:06.730> if<00:01:07.730> you<00:01:07.850> pay<00:01:08.000> them

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
seven seconds exactly if you pay them

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.790 
seven seconds exactly if you pay them
just<00:01:08.420> wide<00:01:08.540> enough<00:01:08.570> times<00:01:08.930> green<00:01:09.140> bean<00:01:09.290> seed<00:01:09.500> I

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
just wide enough times green bean seed I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.500 
just wide enough times green bean seed I
stopped<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.400> timer<00:01:10.730> at<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.940> eight<00:01:11.060> seconds

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
stopped the timer at the eight seconds

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.470 
stopped the timer at the eight seconds
but<00:01:12.230> if<00:01:12.320> we<00:01:12.470> try<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:12.920> again<00:01:13.010> let's<00:01:13.640> see<00:01:13.850> if<00:01:14.300> we

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
but if we try it again let's see if we

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.140 
but if we try it again let's see if we
spot<00:01:14.720> him<00:01:14.750> again<00:01:15.350> while<00:01:15.530> I'm<00:01:15.680> trying<00:01:16.150> you'll

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
spot him again while I'm trying you'll

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.550 
spot him again while I'm trying you'll
see<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:18.140> timer

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
see the timer

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.280 
see the timer
he<00:01:19.430> basically<00:01:19.940> disappears<00:01:20.510> at<00:01:20.660> seven<00:01:20.930> seconds

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
he basically disappears at seven seconds

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.030 
he basically disappears at seven seconds
like<00:01:22.250> there<00:01:22.790> yeah<00:01:23.360> now<00:01:24.200> he's<00:01:24.410> gonna<00:01:24.530> go<00:01:24.740> and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040

here<00:01:34.160> we<00:01:34.250> are<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.520> he<00:01:35.150> has<00:01:35.360> now<00:01:35.510> turned<00:01:35.630> on<00:01:35.930> the

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
here we are and he has now turned on the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.170 
here we are and he has now turned on the
shadow<00:01:36.230> part<00:01:36.470> didn't<00:01:36.980> you<00:01:37.010> yes<00:01:37.700> yeah<00:01:37.910> okay

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
shadow part didn't you yes yeah okay

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.480 
shadow part didn't you yes yeah okay
let's<00:01:39.140> try<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.320> again<00:01:39.410> I'm<00:01:39.860> gonna<00:01:40.130> do<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.340> same

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
let's try it again I'm gonna do the same

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.590 
let's try it again I'm gonna do the same
procedure<00:01:40.610> pay<00:01:41.030> attention<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.450> bottom

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
procedure pay attention to the bottom

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.330 
procedure pay attention to the bottom
left-hand<00:01:41.870> corner<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.470> pay<00:01:42.800> attention<00:01:42.830> to

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
left-hand corner and pay attention to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.700 
left-hand corner and pay attention to
the<00:01:43.490> mini-map<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.180> timer<00:01:44.450> there<00:01:44.620> so<00:01:45.620> I'm

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
the mini-map and the timer there so I'm

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.510 
the mini-map and the timer there so I'm
going<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:45.890> spot<00:01:46.070> him<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.490> look<00:01:46.580> away<00:01:46.670> like<00:01:51.520> see

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
going to spot him and look away like see

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.040 
going to spot him and look away like see
he<00:01:52.790> disappears<00:01:53.150> out<00:01:53.300> in<00:01:53.420> three<00:01:53.600> seconds<00:01:54.020> now

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
he disappears out in three seconds now

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.460 
he disappears out in three seconds now
and<00:01:55.510> let's<00:01:56.510> try<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:56.810> one<00:01:56.990> more<00:01:57.050> time<00:01:57.140> does

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
and let's try that one more time does

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.270 
and let's try that one more time does
for<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:57.830> know<00:01:57.920> consistency<00:01:59.680> and<00:02:00.680> let's<00:02:01.100> try

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
for you know consistency and let's try

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.710 
for you know consistency and let's try
again<00:02:02.620> look<00:02:03.620> away<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.850> he<00:02:05.270> disappears<00:02:05.630> out

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
again look away and he disappears out

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.859 
again look away and he disappears out
three<00:02:05.960> seconds<00:02:06.409> exactly<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:07.569> basically<00:02:08.569> the

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
three seconds exactly so basically the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.840 
three seconds exactly so basically the
shadow<00:02:09.770> perk<00:02:10.039> cuts<00:02:10.460> down

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
shadow perk cuts down

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.920 
shadow perk cuts down
the<00:02:11.850> amount<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.090> time<00:02:12.270> you're<00:02:12.420> spotted<00:02:12.780> by

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the amount of time you're spotted by

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.690 
the amount of time you're spotted by
five<00:02:13.260> seconds<00:02:13.800> which<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:13.980> actually<00:02:14.220> pretty

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
five seconds which is actually pretty

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.370
