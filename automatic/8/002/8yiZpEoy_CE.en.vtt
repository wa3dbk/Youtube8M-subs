00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello to everyone with you purchased card we 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.660
 today we will learn to use 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.780
 useful features 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.170
 embedded new crown 10 interactive 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.630
 render 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.250
 what is this function this function which 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.010
 allows real- time 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.920
 track changes inside the scene 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.670
 any shader or light already on 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.859
 photorealistic picture photo 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.019
 realistic quality and since this 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.550
 works and how it turns on turns on 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.940
 this is very simple right click on your 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.860
 we further consider the extent and viewport 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.270
 and then activate the function 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.829
 Crown interactive then choose 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.879
 the camera from which we would like to see 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.539
 interactive changes on display and 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:55.250
 do left click on this area 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.660
 after that we see our model but already 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.300
 from intel we are real time that is 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.750
 this is an interactive update you 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.240
 desk with all shaders that is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.110
 materials but not taking into account sources 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.640
 illuminated that is, if I change 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.619
 for example such parameters as power 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.220
 Sveta 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.290
 then I will instantly see a change in my 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.150
 viewport 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.670
 in the form of photorealistic images 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.630
 I can also work with the material 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.630
 for example 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.810
 I am changing the parameters of the material and I see 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.810
 instant change of my scene 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.920
 so here that is i can change up 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.090
 fyuz so as not want i can 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.689
 add reflection 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.990
 if i need it i can mate them 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:10.989
 if that requires a job we can do 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.540
 for example glass and all our changes 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.060
 will be transferred as quickly as possible about 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.280
 choice of course speed rendering 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:26.200
 this case will depend on 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:27.790
 the power of your system here is such 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.200
 my opinion is very interesting and useful 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.940
 function appeared in new q10 crown 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.940
 first official distribution 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.019
 I think for many this user 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.790
 function will simplify such processors in 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.299
 shader settings and light setting 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.519
 inside the scene, well, I hope the lesson was 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.910
 useful for you all thank you for your attention 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.910
 bye everyone
