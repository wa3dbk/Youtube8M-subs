so<00:00:10.469> rich<00:00:10.650> we<00:00:11.130> introduced<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.610> idea<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
so rich we introduced the idea of the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.299 
so rich we introduced the idea of the
exposure<00:00:12.360> triangle<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.139> obviously<00:00:13.530> triangle

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
exposure triangle and obviously triangle

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.670 
exposure triangle and obviously triangle
three<00:00:15.299> points<00:00:15.630> right<00:00:15.690> yeah<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.470> are<00:00:16.560> those

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
three points right yeah what are those

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.370 
three points right yeah what are those
three<00:00:16.920> points<00:00:17.070> well<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:17.910> have<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.600> exposure

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
three points well we have the exposure

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.800 
three points well we have the exposure
and<00:00:19.740> that's<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.400> end<00:00:20.609> goal<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.449> them

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
and that's the end goal of all of them

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.450 
and that's the end goal of all of them
so<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> middle<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> properly<00:00:23.279> exposed

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
so in the middle is a properly exposed

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.400 
so in the middle is a properly exposed
image<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:24.390> side<00:00:24.660> you're<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
image on one side you're going to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.349 
image on one side you're going to
basically<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.130> ISO<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.849> that's<00:00:27.180> going

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
basically have the ISO and that's going

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.349 
basically have the ISO and that's going
to<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.840> overall<00:00:28.580> sensitivity<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
to be the overall sensitivity of the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.030 
to be the overall sensitivity of the
sensor<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> camera<00:00:31.230> now<00:00:31.710> there's<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
sensor in the camera now there's the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.340 
sensor in the camera now there's the
base<00:00:32.250> ISO<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.570> could<00:00:33.719> turn<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.170> or

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
base ISO and you could turn that up or

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.799 
base ISO and you could turn that up or
down<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.800> cameras<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.520> evolved<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.510> went

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
down and as cameras have evolved we went

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.080 
down and as cameras have evolved we went
from<00:00:36.930> having<00:00:37.200> ISO<00:00:37.860> s<00:00:37.920> where<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.489> know<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
from having ISO s where you know one to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.760 
from having ISO s where you know one to
four<00:00:39.300> high<00:00:39.450> was<00:00:39.660> good<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> we're<00:00:40.110> shooting

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
four high was good to we're shooting

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.110 
four high was good to we're shooting
like<00:00:40.890> twelve<00:00:41.190> hundred<00:00:41.370> could<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.640> noiseless

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
like twelve hundred could be noiseless

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
like twelve hundred could be noiseless
these<00:00:42.329> days<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.780> amazing<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.649> mean<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
these days so it's amazing I mean it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.319 
these days so it's amazing I mean it
seemed<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.309> you're<00:00:44.430> absolutely<00:00:44.670> right<00:00:45.120> when

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
seemed that you're absolutely right when

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.090 
seemed that you're absolutely right when
especially<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.050> know<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.590> higher<00:00:46.770> level

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
especially you know at the higher level

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
especially you know at the higher level
and<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.250> trickles<00:00:47.579> down<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:48.030> mean<00:00:48.390> some<00:00:48.690> cameras

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and it trickles down I mean some cameras

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.110 
and it trickles down I mean some cameras
now<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.500> uncommon<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.100> see<00:00:50.309> iso's<00:00:50.879> as

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
now it's not uncommon to see iso's as

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.810 
now it's not uncommon to see iso's as
high<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> thousand<00:00:52.020> twelve<00:00:52.260> hundred<00:00:52.440> even

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
high as a thousand twelve hundred even

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.189 
high as a thousand twelve hundred even
1,600<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.510> means<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.780> those<00:00:54.899> those

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
1,600 and it just means that those those

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.709 
1,600 and it just means that those those
sensors<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:55.949> amazingly<00:00:56.610> sensitive<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.449> light

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
sensors are amazingly sensitive to light

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.020 
sensors are amazingly sensitive to light
and<00:00:57.930> are<00:00:58.710> pretty<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.250> know<00:00:59.370> don't<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> lot

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
and are pretty you know don't have a lot

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.580 
and are pretty you know don't have a lot
of<00:01:00.120> noise<00:01:00.239> there<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.870> you're<00:01:01.140> not<00:01:01.170> gonna<00:01:01.410> have

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
of noise there and you're not gonna have

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.740 
of noise there and you're not gonna have
to<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.219> many<00:01:02.579> lights<00:01:02.879> or<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.539> have

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to have as many lights or you know have

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.390 
to have as many lights or you know have
as<00:01:03.930> many<00:01:04.080> practical<00:01:04.439> things<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:05.040> other<00:01:05.189> words

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
as many practical things in other words

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.800 
as many practical things in other words
they<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.640> see<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> dark<00:01:06.090> kind<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.390> which

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
they can see in the dark kind of which

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.270 
they can see in the dark kind of which
is<00:01:06.840> good<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> other<00:01:08.189> two

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
is good and then we have the other two

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.460 
is good and then we have the other two
sides<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.820> there's<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> actual<00:01:09.540> sensitivity

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
sides so there's the actual sensitivity

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.190 
sides so there's the actual sensitivity
out<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> sensor<00:01:11.600> balanced<00:01:12.600> out<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:12.960> how

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
out of the sensor balanced out with how

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.649 
out of the sensor balanced out with how
much<00:01:13.380> light<00:01:13.860> hits<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.640> sensor<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.270> that's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
much light hits that sensor and that's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.510 
much light hits that sensor and that's
really<00:01:15.960> gonna<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.439> aperture<00:01:17.159> which<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
really gonna be the aperture which is

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.060 
really gonna be the aperture which is
the<00:01:17.700> opening<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.750> camera<00:01:19.080> lens<00:01:19.200> now<00:01:19.409> we

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the opening of the camera lens now we

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.160 
the opening of the camera lens now we
have<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.610> nice<00:01:20.880> prime<00:01:21.509> lens<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.110> camera

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
have a nice prime lens on this camera

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.770 
have a nice prime lens on this camera
it's<00:01:22.619> gonna<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:22.920> down<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.310> an<00:01:23.430> aperture<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.970> 1.8

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it's gonna go down to an aperture of 1.8

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.350 
it's gonna go down to an aperture of 1.8
the<00:01:25.380> smaller<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.040> number<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.400> bigger<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the smaller the number the bigger the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.910 
the smaller the number the bigger the
hole<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.840> that's<00:01:27.990> something<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.680> kind

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
hole and that's something that is kind

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.710 
hole and that's something that is kind
of<00:01:29.070> counterintuitive<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.939> go<00:01:30.180> oh<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.390> wanted

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
of counterintuitive you go oh I wanted

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.240 
of counterintuitive you go oh I wanted
an<00:01:30.840> aperture<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> bigger<00:01:31.860> number<00:01:32.100> because

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
an aperture of a bigger number because

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
an aperture of a bigger number because
write<00:01:32.369> everything<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.970> technology<00:01:33.570> bigger<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
write everything in technology bigger is

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.880 
write everything in technology bigger is
better<00:01:34.140> you're<00:01:34.590> better

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
better you're better

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.469 
better you're better
so<00:01:35.070> why<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> best<00:01:35.640> buy<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.180> best

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
so why it's the best buy it is the best

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.960 
so why it's the best buy it is the best
buy<00:01:36.630> algorithm<00:01:37.049> right<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
buy algorithm right but that's not the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.190 
buy algorithm right but that's not the
case<00:01:39.090> when<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.299> comes<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.630> lenses<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.079> comes

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
case when it comes to lenses and comes

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350 
case when it comes to lenses and comes
to<00:01:40.350> cameras<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> lower<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.549> number<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to cameras that lower that number the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.560 
to cameras that lower that number the
wider<00:01:42.810> are<00:01:43.110> more<00:01:43.860> open<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.790> actual<00:01:45.180> lens<00:01:45.390> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
wider are more open the actual lens is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
wider are more open the actual lens is
going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.229> allow<00:01:46.320> light<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> come<00:01:47.130> into

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
going to be to allow light to come into

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.810 
going to be to allow light to come into
the<00:01:47.460> camera<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.000> other<00:01:48.119> words<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.810> stop<00:01:49.710> of

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
the camera so in other words a stop of

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.929 
the camera so in other words a stop of
1.2<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.149> gonna<00:01:51.299> let<00:01:51.479> more<00:01:51.750> light<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.079> than<00:01:52.470> say

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
1.2 is gonna let more light in than say

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.490 
1.2 is gonna let more light in than say
5.6<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.479> also<00:01:54.630> gonna<00:01:54.899> let<00:01:54.990> more<00:01:55.170> money

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
5.6 and it's also gonna let more money

are<00:02:07.469> typically<00:02:07.890> more<00:02:08.220> expensive<00:02:08.280> because

so just keep that in mind when you're

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.820 
so just keep that in mind when you're
looking<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> lens<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.590> last

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
looking for a lens and the last

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.530 
looking for a lens and the last
component<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.580> going<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.300> overall

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
component is going to be the overall

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.450 
component is going to be the overall
shutter<00:02:19.110> speed<00:02:19.440> now<00:02:19.650> what's<00:02:19.980> happening<00:02:20.340> with

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
shutter speed now what's happening with

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.760 
shutter speed now what's happening with
shutter<00:02:20.700> speed<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.900> ties<00:02:22.230> back<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
shutter speed is it ties back to the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.130 
shutter speed is it ties back to the
days<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.130> film<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.700> essentially<00:02:24.690> what<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.020> do

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
days of film and essentially what you do

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.930 
days of film and essentially what you do
is<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.380> take<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> frame<00:02:25.890> rate<00:02:26.100> multiply<00:02:26.880> it

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
is you take the frame rate multiply it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.150 
is you take the frame rate multiply it
by<00:02:27.090> two<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.390> put<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> 1<00:02:27.990> on<00:02:28.170> top<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:29.010> is

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
by two and put a 1 on top and this is

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.590 
by two and put a 1 on top and this is
going<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.370> give<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> base<00:02:29.940> shutter<00:02:30.270> speed

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
going to give you the base shutter speed

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.840 
going to give you the base shutter speed
so<00:02:30.780> typically<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.710> be<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> forty<00:02:32.400> eighth<00:02:32.550> or<00:02:32.820> a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
so typically it be a forty eighth or a

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.020 
so typically it be a forty eighth or a
fiftieth<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.690> were<00:02:33.780> shooting<00:02:33.990> 24<00:02:34.470> P<00:02:34.710> a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
fiftieth if you were shooting 24 P a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.850 
fiftieth if you were shooting 24 P a
sixtieth<00:02:36.030> if<00:02:36.210> you're<00:02:36.390> shooting<00:02:36.600> at<00:02:36.840> 30<00:02:37.200> but

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
sixtieth if you're shooting at 30 but

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.010 
sixtieth if you're shooting at 30 but
these<00:02:38.190> numbers<00:02:38.430> are<00:02:38.820> gonna<00:02:39.060> vary<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.720> when<00:02:39.900> we

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
these numbers are gonna vary and when we

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.360 
these numbers are gonna vary and when we
go<00:02:40.140> out<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> field<00:02:40.680> later<00:02:41.010> you're<00:02:41.280> gonna

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
go out in the field later you're gonna

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.390 
go out in the field later you're gonna
see<00:02:41.700> how<00:02:41.910> sometimes<00:02:42.210> we<00:02:43.200> cheat<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:43.860> as<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> base

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
see how sometimes we cheat but as a base

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.950 
see how sometimes we cheat but as a base
exposure<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.240> kind<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.540> works<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:45.930> think

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
exposure this kind of works and I think

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.320 
exposure this kind of works and I think
what<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:46.350> should<00:02:46.530> do<00:02:46.710> is<00:02:47.130> properly<00:02:47.790> expose<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
what we should do is properly expose a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.850 
what we should do is properly expose a
shot<00:02:48.660> right<00:02:48.900> now<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.290> sort<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.500> walk<00:02:49.650> people

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
shot right now and sort of walk people

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.310 
shot right now and sort of walk people
through<00:02:50.010> that
