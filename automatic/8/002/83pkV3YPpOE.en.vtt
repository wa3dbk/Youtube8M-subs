00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.869
 Lima Jan

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.499
 by paco chica 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.429
 with two knives 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.829
 a knife 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.360
 for the ari a small blade for 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.349
 take out the tires 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.740
 will be that this case investigating lateral shoot 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.950
 to be able quadratín 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.950
 toni the drive municipality manuel monge 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.590
 the manual is placed 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.020
 I believe that the back of the lake 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.380
 against in the havana where you are 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.310
 the one on the crank 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.310
 feel what more can be given 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.830
 then they try to leave the command 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.860
 with the other spider you 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.020
 we will except this 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.170
 until they have 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.540
 o'keefe and chiappe 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.420
 in the training template 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.140
 wait to stop 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.070
 for those who have to issue and does not cut 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.480
 so I can run to press the state 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.310
 this practice 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.350
 so 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.890
 it's not so bad to put 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890
 by and we put in the assumption 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.960
 the shell 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.260
 josé carlos cistern 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.870
 for this procedure 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.870
 you have the blade here 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.850
 if they do not cut 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.850
 as you can see 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.570
 useful stabbing stones in such a way that no 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.530
 according to the depth a subject in which the entity does not want 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.090
 release this butterfly 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.610
 they spoke until butterfly and they run 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.059
 inwards, go out to the blade for here 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:11.409
 that way 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:16.229
 the cut is included because it is here to shoot for the depth that one wants 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:18.569
 for running 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.499
 the sept arm is raised this plant is lowered the arm 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.409
 and correct being a database 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.399
 3 when I got here the 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.449
 when it arrives what in the end 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.149
 the blade or the arm the blade 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:34.939
 3 that operation is done 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.480
 gets up and runs 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.480
 passion given is that here you start again 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.739
 on the side of the morning 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:43.459
 that's basically
