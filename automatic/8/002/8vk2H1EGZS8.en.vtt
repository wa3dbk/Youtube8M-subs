00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
locked can't twist it see so what they

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.270 
locked can't twist it see so what they
would<00:01:50.140> do<00:01:50.289> is<00:01:50.469> if<00:01:50.619> they<00:01:50.740> were<00:01:50.799> inspecting<00:01:51.189> your

would do is if they were inspecting your
luggage<00:01:51.490> they<00:01:51.579> would<00:01:51.700> stick<00:01:51.850> their<00:01:51.880> key<00:01:52.210> in

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
luggage they would stick their key in

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:59.490 
luggage they would stick their key in
here<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:53.219> then<00:01:54.219> they<00:01:54.310> would<00:01:54.460> turn<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:58.409> self<00:01:59.409> a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
here and then they would turn it self a

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.919 
here and then they would turn it self a
little<00:01:59.710> bobby<00:02:00.429> pin<00:02:00.549> has<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.969> rubber<00:02:01.600> end<00:02:01.840> down

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
little bobby pin has the rubber end down

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.999 
little bobby pin has the rubber end down
here<00:02:02.049> so<00:02:02.380> makes<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.649> hard<00:02:02.829> to<00:02:02.860> stick<00:02:03.069> in<00:02:03.600> but

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
here so makes it hard to stick in but

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.509 
here so makes it hard to stick in but
just<00:02:06.009> stick<00:02:06.159> it<00:02:06.280> in<00:02:06.340> there<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:08.129> there<00:02:09.129> it's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
just stick it in there and there it's

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:15.509 
just stick it in there and there it's
unlocked<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.929> takes<00:02:11.140> me<00:02:11.260> two<00:02:11.530> seconds<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:15.130> I'm

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
unlocked it takes me two seconds so I'm

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.339 
unlocked it takes me two seconds so I'm
not<00:02:15.700> sure<00:02:15.880> if<00:02:15.970> all<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.209> TSA<00:02:16.569> locks<00:02:16.810> are<00:02:17.110> that

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
not sure if all the TSA locks are that

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.990 
not sure if all the TSA locks are that
easy<00:02:19.230> but<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.380> one<00:02:20.560> definitely<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:21.970> I

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
easy but this one definitely is so I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.150 
easy but this one definitely is so I
would<00:02:22.269> not<00:02:22.390> recommend<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.900> lock<00:02:23.200> because

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
would not recommend this lock because

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.440 
would not recommend this lock because
pretty<00:02:24.370> much<00:02:24.549> anybody<00:02:24.790> with<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.090> piece<00:02:25.299> of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
metal and two seconds of their time can

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.670 
metal and two seconds of their time can
get<00:02:28.060> into<00:02:28.239> your<00:02:28.360> luggage<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.019> take<00:02:29.079> whatever
