00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:15.599
 Well 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:18.300
 I want to go back to the table and Lynn fists 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.750
 my name is hello i do by 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.520
 course monitoring torus and a single year 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.559
 like all my questions that gives 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.439
 extorted a stamp to the internet in some way 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:31.110
 useless absolute tutorial 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.270
 this is important but here in these courses in these 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.130
 the staff I understand everything then the star but 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.870
 Now I came to hold nsk because 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.010
 still wants the identity of this just ask 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.070
 it actually seemed to me that I would learn 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.650
 three chords one fight and it will be the top 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.150
 because everything else is already there above 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:55.170
 learn over the years but it turned out I was taking 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.590
 this year I already know how to play 12 kinds 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.200
 brute force and in my 9 kinds of pain and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.720
 chord turns out not 7 like me 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.070
 it seemed to itself then born so 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.310
 everything is great everything is clear there 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.340
 explained and actually well questions 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.740
 nudity for example so ass from in general 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.270
 put all your seats tunic of that song 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.290
 singing did not go to the fungus 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.729
 all complex things are explained in detail 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.590
 that's not even necessary 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.840
 rewind so that if something 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.080
 misunderstood because she chews and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.119
 so everything is simple well, everything is very simple 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.890
 everything's great i'm really excited and i'm 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.720
 happy everyone always think that i have 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.460
 no hearing what for me guitar 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.070
 and now i even hear when my guitar 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.110
 upset just start playing and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.369
 starting to hear something damn it's great 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.920
 I realized I found the difference between 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.939
 classic play on anything and 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.560
 I went to do a compliment 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.439
 classical teachers he is not 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.439
 put your finger back it is terribly uncomfortable 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.790
 that is, we are accompanying ourselves that's what we are 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.220
 so we sing a company and it's just 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.160
 that's great and nobody karaoke at all 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.129
 next to it there was no rhythm compliment 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.769
 There are such chips, I think it's just necessary 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.769
 study on everything about history is awesome 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.629
 from big cities 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.629
 Gandhi 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.650
 but I did not cook at all 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.700
 don't wanna come back this tom got up 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.930
 alien 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.750
 I do not want 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.750
 I only 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.750
 we take 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.440
 what is loneliness 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.900
 as for scientific 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.360
 I teach and new fight searches 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.790
 in fact , everything is very simple 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.650
 clearly cool all this courses 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.600
 Victoria, because she doesn't even have a guitar 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.060
 I can not even imagine without 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.060
 guitars could live so much time and 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.660
 long time did not watch the sky touch 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.639
 incessantly idea 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.439
 but run for the amount and bread 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.439
 something important overlooked
