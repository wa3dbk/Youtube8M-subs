 it paints but it's also a bit 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.680
 complicated eye to the game game game 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.149
 I play mariña as we nailed her acclaimed 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.800
 without a nail they also try to nail 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.269
 explodes goes to see what they have then not 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.579

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.719
 quiet that not with the panic that walks 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.679
 discount two technicians guys okay I'll 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.339
 third and study worth it seems this one 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.870
 tongue of a pokémon uncle this ramp no 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.250
 cojones and manco that I am and on top of floating 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.360
 ee uu and almost and now it would seem that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.010
 it seems because if I think faster 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.450
 has remembered the language is of the pokemon 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.310
 rose that there was a pokémon curtain the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.490
 team rocker he has rojito how he 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.490
 call 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.990
 perfect seconds we go seconds boys 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.490
 It's worth subscribing, I know I had 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.290
 here on day 3 the first one to see 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.640
 in men first so go to your 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.299
 house is that he wants to get involved because 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.030
 you want and point is worth it I'm going 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.420
 second if you have to do to take 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.549
 around here and smoked there is a companion worth 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.020
 x because the car was thrown in that 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.070
 car 22 does not have to be there has 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.909
 that is catching the points because 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 late did not ask for the point to get 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.659
 So far cases it does not matter this 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.969
 it looks like it's quite complete tico 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.140
 It's worth it and I want it to be done 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.140
 there is worth here I do not fall 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 it's not very complicated you like to live my 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.990
 limit is pretty fucked let's go 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.610
 calm you not when panic 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.090
 in addition they are two turns all the feet 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.240
 it's two laps here you have to fall 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.410
 105 more because you can not upload 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.280
 once you fall you accelerate to 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.280
 go ahead to not up here 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.810
 I'm honestly in the trick 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:33.740
 so please do not want to confirm it 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.150
 but I think it has passed by here 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.430
 there is careful care companion take care 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.220
 as a companion several visits has passed 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.590
 it's ok no, it's not happened to us, I think so 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.630
 perfect but the time you have to 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.330
 to do is in the trampita is to take the 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.130
 branch is worth a yes as I do not stop 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.290
 take the ramp that is out there and take 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.940
 the point by the ramp without doing 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.400
 legally I think what is 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.310
 trying I think is I do not want worth 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.830
 OK 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.450
 perfect without cartons there is perfect 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.730
 and now we do not have it we have we have 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.770

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.160
 something and I took flick around here and nailed it 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.890

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.010
 control to complete the first round 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.790

 I have no pressure but of course 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.080
 we do not have to decay the rhythm because in 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.640
 any time you can reach someone 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.769

 around here and we believe the car behind 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:19.359
