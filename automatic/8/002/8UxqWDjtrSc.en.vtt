00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.149 
it's actually more thick than the curl
enhancing<00:02:00.180> smoothie<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.930> also<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.950> more

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
enhancing smoothie and also it's more

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.770 
enhancing smoothie and also it's more
heavy<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.060> hair<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:05.460> would<00:02:06.390> leave<00:02:06.600> your

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
heavy on the hair so it would leave your

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.050 
heavy on the hair so it would leave your
hair<00:02:06.990> really<00:02:07.290> well<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.950> left<00:02:08.310> my<00:02:08.520> hair<00:02:08.759> really

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
hair really well I left my hair really

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.350 
hair really well I left my hair really
greasy<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.250> was<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.580> really<00:02:11.760> stiff<00:02:12.180> like

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
greasy and it was just really stiff like

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.150 
greasy and it was just really stiff like
no<00:02:13.480> blowing<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.050> wind<00:02:14.080> for<00:02:14.380> my<00:02:14.530> fro<00:02:14.800> when<00:02:15.100> I

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
no blowing in the wind for my fro when I

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.730 
no blowing in the wind for my fro when I
use<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.790> stuff<00:02:16.030> it's<00:02:16.840> like<00:02:17.080> really<00:02:17.410> thick

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
use that stuff it's like really thick

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.070 
use that stuff it's like really thick
but<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.610> have<00:02:18.790> dry<00:02:19.060> hair<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.510> guess<00:02:19.750> it's

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
but if you have dry hair I guess it's

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.900 
but if you have dry hair I guess it's
good<00:02:20.470> for<00:02:20.740> your<00:02:20.860> hair<00:02:21.040> because<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.790> would

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
good for your hair because you would

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.240 
good for your hair because you would
know<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.060> your<00:02:22.360> hair<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.630> moisturized<00:02:23.250> now

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
know that your hair is moisturized now

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.030 
know that your hair is moisturized now
with<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.330> curl<00:02:25.510> enhancing<00:02:25.960> smoothie<00:02:26.040> it's

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
with the curl enhancing smoothie it's

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.890 
with the curl enhancing smoothie it's
more<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.940> seem<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.240> it's<00:02:28.390> more<00:02:28.600> water

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
more like it seem like it's more water

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.870 
more like it seem like it's more water
based<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:31.950> think<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.100> moisturizes<00:02:33.760> your

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
based and I think it moisturizes your

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.090 
based and I think it moisturizes your
hair<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.390> do<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.960> sneak<00:02:35.200> attack<00:02:35.320> so

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
hair just do it in a sneak attack so

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.550 
hair just do it in a sneak attack so
that<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.460> don't<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.910> like<00:02:37.840> miss<00:02:38.140> jessie's

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
that you don't know like miss jessie's

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.230 
that you don't know like miss jessie's

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
they'd let you know that your hair is

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.880 
they'd let you know that your hair is
moisturized<00:02:40.630> because<00:02:40.930> every<00:02:41.320> time<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.680> touch

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
really think it has as many natural

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.840 
really think it has as many natural
products<00:03:34.330> as<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:36.160> curl<00:03:36.370> enhancing<00:03:36.790> smoothie

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
products as the curl enhancing smoothie

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.820 
products as the curl enhancing smoothie
but<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.450> are<00:03:37.660> going<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:38.019> pay<00:03:38.140> more<00:03:38.410> for<00:03:38.470> this

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.759 
but you are going to pay more for this
stuff<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:40.209> seems<00:03:40.420> like<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.989> get<00:03:41.140> Bobe<00:03:41.590> so

stuff and it seems like you get Bobe so

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.199 
stuff and it seems like you get Bobe so
you<00:03:41.920> get<00:03:42.070> less<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:43.170> guys<00:03:44.170> can<00:03:44.410> see<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:46.180> I

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
you get less so you guys can see so I

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.240 
you get less so you guys can see so I
would<00:03:46.420> definitely<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.810> would<00:03:46.959> recommend<00:03:47.590> this

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
would definitely I would recommend this

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.250 
would definitely I would recommend this
product<00:03:48.640> for<00:03:49.000> people<00:03:49.120> who<00:03:49.360> are<00:03:49.480> newly<00:03:49.660> natural

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
product for people who are newly natural

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.610 
product for people who are newly natural
because<00:03:51.190> it's<00:03:51.489> cheaper<00:03:52.060> but<00:03:52.840> if<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.140> hate<00:03:53.410> it

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
because it's cheaper but if you hate it

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.020 
because it's cheaper but if you hate it
and<00:03:53.830> if<00:03:53.950> they<00:03:54.070> don't<00:03:54.250> do<00:03:54.370> anything<00:03:54.580> for<00:03:54.760> your

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
and if they don't do anything for your

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.070 
and if they don't do anything for your
hair<00:03:55.269> I<00:03:55.540> guess<00:03:57.090> spend<00:03:58.090> more<00:03:58.239> money<00:03:58.420> on<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.870> baby

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
hair I guess spend more money on a baby

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
would recommend this because it is

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.719 
would recommend this because it is
cheaper<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:20.109> don't<00:04:21.040> know<00:04:21.250> if<00:04:21.370> anybody
