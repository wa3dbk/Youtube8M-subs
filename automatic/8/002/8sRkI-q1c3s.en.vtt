extra d sir it's still G major chord ok

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.700 
extra d sir it's still G major chord ok
because<00:01:03.550> you<00:01:03.760> have<00:01:03.880> a<00:01:03.910> d<00:01:04.259> already<00:01:05.259> here<00:01:05.530> the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
because you have a d already here the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.160 
because you have a d already here the
open<00:01:05.979> D<00:01:06.160> on<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.119> fourth<00:01:07.360> string<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:08.050> you're

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
open D on the fourth string so you're

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.670 
open D on the fourth string so you're
just<00:01:08.290> tossing<00:01:08.740> it<00:01:08.830> an<00:01:08.920> extra<00:01:09.220> heat<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:11.020> think<00:01:11.619> it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
just tossing it an extra heat I think it

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.850 
just tossing it an extra heat I think it
sounds<00:01:11.890> cool<00:01:11.950> so<00:01:12.729> I<00:01:12.759> played<00:01:13.030> G<00:01:13.240> that<00:01:13.420> way<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
sounds cool so I played G that way and

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.690 
sounds cool so I played G that way and
then<00:01:15.550> we're<00:01:15.700> going<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.880> play<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.060> minor

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
then we're going to play a minor

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.850 
then we're going to play a minor
hopefully<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:18.759> know<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.880> minor<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.960> then<00:01:20.590> C

and D major ok those are the basic four

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.310 
and D major ok those are the basic four
chords<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:28.060> like<00:01:28.270> about<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.510> trillion<00:01:28.780> songs<00:01:31.320> to

chords in like about a trillion songs to

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.230 
chords in like about a trillion songs to
exaggerate<00:01:32.770> tiny<00:01:33.040> bit<00:01:33.250> maybe<00:01:33.430> but<00:01:33.729> maybe<00:01:34.090> not

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
exaggerate tiny bit maybe but maybe not

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.440 
exaggerate tiny bit maybe but maybe not
there's<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.870> lot<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.110> g<00:01:35.409> e<00:01:35.650> minor<00:01:36.310> C<00:01:36.820> major<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.240> D

there's a lot of g e minor C major and D

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.180 
there's a lot of g e minor C major and D
major<00:01:37.720> chord<00:01:37.900> there<00:01:38.380> are<00:01:38.500> songs<00:01:38.710> up<00:01:38.950> for<00:01:39.100> it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
major chord there are songs up for it

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.530 
major chord there are songs up for it
tons<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.700> tons<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:41.970> simplest<00:01:42.970> strum<00:01:43.210> pattern

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
tons and tons so simplest strum pattern

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.070 
tons and tons so simplest strum pattern
that<00:01:43.659> I<00:01:43.780> can<00:01:43.810> think<00:01:43.960> of<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:45.840> basically<00:01:46.840> just

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
that I can think of is basically just

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.560 
that I can think of is basically just
one<00:01:47.619> down<00:01:47.830> stroke<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.520> each<00:01:48.820> like<00:01:49.270> if<00:01:49.390> we're

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
one down stroke on each like if we're

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.100 
one down stroke on each like if we're
doing<00:01:49.780> for<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.590> 44<00:01:51.430> timing<00:01:52.360> right<00:01:52.510> so<00:01:52.780> it's<00:01:52.960> like

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
doing for a 44 timing right so it's like

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.219 
doing for a 44 timing right so it's like
one<00:01:53.320> two<00:01:53.650> three<00:01:54.100> four<00:01:54.460> in<00:01:54.939> a<00:01:55.450> bar<00:01:55.659> for<00:01:55.960> be<00:01:56.110> to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
one two three four in a bar for be to

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.000 
one two three four in a bar for be to
the<00:01:56.320> bar<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:58.600> just<00:01:59.290> do<00:01:59.439> a<00:01:59.470> simple<00:01:59.680> down

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
the bar then just do a simple down

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.539 
the bar then just do a simple down
stroke<00:02:00.430> on<00:02:00.700> every<00:02:01.299> beat<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:01.930> like<00:02:02.229> one<00:02:02.830> two

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
stroke on every beat so like one two

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:16.880 
stroke on every beat so like one two
three

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.680 

so<00:02:17.890> all<00:02:18.129> we're<00:02:18.280> doing<00:02:18.489> there<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.030> very<00:02:19.209> basic

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
so all we're doing there it's very basic

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.030 
so all we're doing there it's very basic
right<00:02:24.269> four<00:02:25.269> beats<00:02:25.450> per<00:02:25.630> bar<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:26.110> we're<00:02:26.950> doing

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
right four beats per bar and we're doing

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.690 
right four beats per bar and we're doing
basically<00:02:27.700> one<00:02:28.060> cord<00:02:28.480> /<00:02:28.750> bar<00:02:29.250> okay<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.340> we<00:02:30.519> go

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
basically one cord / bar okay so we go

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.780 
basically one cord / bar okay so we go
one<00:02:31.000> bar<00:02:31.209> on<00:02:31.560> g<00:02:33.060> two<00:02:34.140> three<00:02:35.140> four<00:02:35.920> then<00:02:36.640> we

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
one bar on g two three four then we

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.509 
one bar on g two three four then we
switch<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.060> E<00:02:37.269> minor<00:02:37.769> one<00:02:38.769> two<00:02:39.640> three<00:02:40.560> four<00:02:41.560> we

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
switch to E minor one two three four we

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.250 
switch to E minor one two three four we
switch<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.790> see<00:02:43.239> one<00:02:44.170> two<00:02:45.090> three<00:02:46.090> four<00:02:46.930> and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
switch to see one two three four and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.199 
switch to see one two three four and
then<00:02:47.739> d<00:02:49.470> three<00:02:50.470> more<00:02:51.190> okay<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:51.760> that's<00:02:51.940> that's

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
then d three more okay so that's that's

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.420 
then d three more okay so that's that's
about<00:02:52.480> as<00:02:52.599> basic<00:02:52.750> as<00:02:53.079> as<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:53.799> get<00:02:54.099> unless<00:02:54.310> you

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
about as basic as as you get unless you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.380 
about as basic as as you get unless you
want<00:02:54.579> to<00:02:54.640> go<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:54.870> 11<00:02:55.870> strum<00:02:56.230> per<00:02:56.440> bar<00:02:57.390> just

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
want to go like 11 strum per bar just

even<00:03:01.660> more<00:03:01.690> basic

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.870 

so<00:03:09.150> let<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.690> trick<00:03:09.900> as<00:03:10.310> your<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.760> know

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
so let the trick as your you know

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.190 
so let the trick as your you know
beginner<00:03:12.180> players<00:03:12.450> often<00:03:12.750> have<00:03:13.020> trouble

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
beginner players often have trouble

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.310 
beginner players often have trouble
changing<00:03:13.710> chords<00:03:14.010> right<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:15.080> try<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.110> pick<00:03:16.290> a

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
changing chords right so try to pick a

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.870 
changing chords right so try to pick a
strum<00:03:16.620> pattern<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.010> lets<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.340> get<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
strum pattern that lets you get to the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.420 
strum pattern that lets you get to the
cord<00:03:18.210> you're<00:03:18.720> going<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.530> time<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.280> you're

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
cord you're going to in time so you're

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.940 
cord you're going to in time so you're
not<00:03:20.660> pausing<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.780> song<00:03:21.990> right<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.500> we<00:03:22.800> don't

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
not pausing the song right so we don't

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:33.110 
not pausing the song right so we don't
want<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.100> be<00:03:23.220> doing<00:03:23.400> for<00:03:23.880> instance<00:03:31.880> we<00:03:32.880> want<00:03:33.060> to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
want to be doing for instance we want to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.160 
want to be doing for instance we want to
try<00:03:33.240> to<00:03:33.270> keep<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.660> fluid<00:03:33.930> right<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:38.990> so<00:03:39.990> in

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
try to keep it fluid right so so in

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.020 
try to keep it fluid right so so in
order<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.440> do<00:03:40.710> that<00:03:40.920> perhaps<00:03:41.520> you<00:03:41.700> have<00:03:41.850> to

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
order to do that perhaps you have to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.550 
order to do that perhaps you have to
change<00:03:42.360> your<00:03:42.450> strumming<00:03:42.840> pattern<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.320> little

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
change your strumming pattern a little

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.990 
change your strumming pattern a little
bit<00:03:43.680> or<00:03:43.860> give<00:03:44.010> yourself<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.430> bit<00:03:44.580> of<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.730> break

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
bit or give yourself a bit of a break

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.880 
bit or give yourself a bit of a break
but<00:03:45.240> try<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.510> do<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:45.840> such<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.050> way<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.500> you

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
but try to do it in such a way that you

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.040 
but try to do it in such a way that you
can<00:03:46.980> actually<00:03:47.340> fluidly<00:03:48.120> get<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:48.990> next

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
can actually fluidly get to that next

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.560 
can actually fluidly get to that next
chord<00:03:49.560> right<00:03:49.740> and<00:03:49.890> give<00:03:50.010> yourself<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.550> mean<00:03:50.790> you

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
chord right and give yourself I mean you

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.840 
chord right and give yourself I mean you
know<00:03:51.660> stack<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.050> cards<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.410> your<00:03:52.470> favor<00:03:52.680> and

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
know stack the cards in your favor and

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.130 
know stack the cards in your favor and
give<00:03:53.850> yourself<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.390> time<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.870> need<00:03:55.080> but

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
give yourself the time that you need but

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.160 
give yourself the time that you need but
try<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.620> work<00:03:55.830> on<00:03:56.040> getting<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.460> continuity

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
try to work on getting that continuity

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.790 
try to work on getting that continuity
continuity<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.290> you're<00:03:58.380> playing<00:03:58.500> there

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
continuity and you're playing there

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.440 
continuity and you're playing there
because<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.160> will<00:03:59.250> help<00:03:59.340> bring<00:04:00.210> it<00:04:00.330> together

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
because it will help bring it together

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.900 
because it will help bring it together
on<00:04:00.990> top<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.710> sounds<00:04:02.100> tons<00:04:02.370> better<00:04:02.580> and

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
on top of that it sounds tons better and

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.790 
on top of that it sounds tons better and
of<00:04:03.480> course<00:04:03.720> we<00:04:03.870> all<00:04:03.990> know<00:04:04.020> that<00:04:04.170> if<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.530> doesn't

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
of course we all know that if it doesn't

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.260 
of course we all know that if it doesn't
sound<00:04:04.980> good<00:04:05.100> it's<00:04:05.220> not<00:04:05.400> fun<00:04:05.580> practicing<00:04:06.090> right

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
sound good it's not fun practicing right

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.240 
sound good it's not fun practicing right
so<00:04:06.480> it's<00:04:07.260> good<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.500> sound<00:04:07.830> good<00:04:07.950> when<00:04:08.130> you're

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
so it's good to sound good when you're

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.390 
so it's good to sound good when you're
practicing<00:04:08.400> mmm<00:04:09.920> so<00:04:10.920> how<00:04:11.040> can<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.220> do<00:04:11.370> that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
practicing mmm so how can you do that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:19.160 
practicing mmm so how can you do that
well<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:17.250> could<00:04:17.400> go<00:04:17.520> like<00:04:17.780> strum<00:04:18.780> on<00:04:18.989> the

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
well you could go like strum on the

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.660 
well you could go like strum on the
first<00:04:19.380> three<00:04:19.620> beats<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:20.040> then<00:04:20.130> rest<00:04:20.370> on<00:04:20.580> the

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
first three beats and then rest on the

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.120 
first three beats and then rest on the
fourth<00:04:20.910> be<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:22.680> way<00:04:22.800> you're<00:04:22.950> still

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
fourth be and that way you're still

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.620 
fourth be and that way you're still
keeping<00:04:23.310> within<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.790> four<00:04:24.000> bars<00:04:24.240> but<00:04:24.510> you're

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
keeping within the four bars but you're

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.970 
keeping within the four bars but you're
giving<00:04:24.870> yourself<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:25.290> beat<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.680> get<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.920> the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
giving yourself a beat to get to the

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.570 
giving yourself a beat to get to the
next<00:04:26.040> chord<00:04:26.490> so<00:04:27.360> for<00:04:27.630> instance<00:04:27.690> 1<00:04:28.530> 2<00:04:29.100> 3<00:04:29.460> +<00:04:30.470> 12<00:04:31.580> +

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
next chord so for instance 1 2 3 + 12 +

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.100 
next chord so for instance 1 2 3 + 12 +
and<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.690> on<00:04:33.720> right<00:04:34.080> ok<00:04:35.010> so<00:04:35.070> now<00:04:35.750> going<00:04:36.750> on<00:04:36.900> from

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
and so on right ok so now going on from

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.480 
and so on right ok so now going on from
there<00:04:37.320> how<00:04:37.500> can<00:04:37.680> we<00:04:37.740> make<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:37.920> a<00:04:38.070> little<00:04:38.280> bit

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
there how can we make this a little bit

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:50.680 
there how can we make this a little bit
more<00:04:38.640> interesting

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:05:10.460 

why<00:04:51.690> don't<00:04:51.810> we<00:04:51.870> toss<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.260> in<00:04:52.320> an<00:04:52.410> upstroke<00:05:09.470> so

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
why don't we toss it in an upstroke so

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.680 
why don't we toss it in an upstroke so
good<00:05:10.800> practice<00:05:11.220> doing<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:14.360> as<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:15.540> become

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
good practice doing that as you become

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.780 
good practice doing that as you become
more<00:05:15.960> familiar<00:05:16.020> with<00:05:16.500> that<00:05:16.680> you<00:05:17.520> know<00:05:17.640> that

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
more familiar with that you know that

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.680 
more familiar with that you know that
down<00:05:18.030> up<00:05:18.270> tossing<00:05:18.540> it<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:19.520> on<00:05:20.570> beating<00:05:21.570> on

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
down up tossing it in on beating on

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.120 
down up tossing it in on beating on
rhythm<00:05:21.900> when<00:05:22.440> you're<00:05:22.590> playing<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.040> you<00:05:23.100> can

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
rhythm when you're playing and you can

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.190 
rhythm when you're playing and you can
start<00:05:23.430> adding<00:05:23.640> it<00:05:23.910> more<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:24.660> more<00:05:24.750> and

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
start adding it more and more and

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.430 
start adding it more and more and
wherever<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.650> want<00:05:25.830> interchanging<00:05:26.580> those

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
wherever you want interchanging those

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.720 
wherever you want interchanging those
those<00:05:28.440> things<00:05:28.740> because<00:05:29.010> that's<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.370> basic

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
those things because that's the basic

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.030 
those things because that's the basic
kind<00:05:29.940> of<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.780> basic<00:05:31.110> two<00:05:31.260> things<00:05:31.530> you<00:05:31.710> have<00:05:31.890> to

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
kind of the basic two things you have to

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.890 
kind of the basic two things you have to
work<00:05:32.190> with<00:05:32.220> right<00:05:32.670> is<00:05:32.850> you<00:05:33.570> know<00:05:33.660> a<00:05:33.690> Down

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
work with right is you know a Down
