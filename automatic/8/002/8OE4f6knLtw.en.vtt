00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
know that's pretty much something I

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.999 
know that's pretty much something I
could<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.229> breaking<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.710> rules

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.450 
kind of just hurts my point that being a
woman<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.200> being<00:01:58.440> comfortable<00:01:59.220> with<00:01:59.369> your

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
woman and being comfortable with your

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
woman and being comfortable with your
sexuality<00:01:59.690> it's<00:02:00.690> still<00:02:00.930> really<00:02:01.140> frowned<00:02:01.470> upon

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
sexuality it's still really frowned upon

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.590 
sexuality it's still really frowned upon
in<00:02:01.860> society<00:02:02.369> I'm<00:02:02.729> never<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.360> apologize

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
in society I'm never going to apologize

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.450 
in society I'm never going to apologize
for<00:02:03.870> being<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.409> woman<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.860> am<00:02:04.890> I'm<00:02:05.250> never

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
for being the woman that I am I'm never

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.399 
for being the woman that I am I'm never
going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.760> apologize<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.240> being<00:02:06.600> sexual

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
going to apologize for being sexual

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.199 
going to apologize for being sexual
I<00:02:07.440> have<00:02:07.920> finally<00:02:08.399> reached<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.729> point<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.060> my

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
I have finally reached a point in my

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.460 
I have finally reached a point in my
life<00:02:09.239> where<00:02:09.660> I'm<00:02:09.720> comfortable<00:02:10.019> with<00:02:10.260> my<00:02:10.440> body

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
life where I'm comfortable with my body

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.340 
life where I'm comfortable with my body
and<00:02:11.040> I'm<00:02:11.459> comfortable<00:02:11.730> with<00:02:11.970> my<00:02:12.090> sexuality

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
and I'm comfortable with my sexuality

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.590 
and I'm comfortable with my sexuality
and<00:02:13.350> I'm<00:02:13.920> getting<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.700> lot<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:14.970> criticism<00:02:15.570> for

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and I'm getting a lot of criticism for

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
and I'm getting a lot of criticism for
it<00:02:15.959> but<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.620> think<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.810> my<00:02:18.810> feelings<00:02:19.410> about

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it but I think that my feelings about

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.520 
it but I think that my feelings about
myself<00:02:19.860> can<00:02:20.700> trump<00:02:20.970> all<00:02:21.269> of<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.410> can

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
myself can trump all of that you can

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.590 
myself can trump all of that you can
call<00:02:22.739> me<00:02:22.890> any<00:02:23.580> name<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> book<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.510> it's

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
call me any name in the book and it's

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.570 
call me any name in the book and it's
not<00:02:24.750> going<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.200> affect<00:02:25.500> me<00:02:25.680> because<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.190> know<00:02:26.310> at

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
not going to affect me because I know at

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.100 
not going to affect me because I know at
the<00:02:26.670> end<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.940> day<00:02:27.090> what<00:02:27.750> I've<00:02:27.870> gone

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
the end of the day what I've gone

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.470 
the end of the day what I've gone
through<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.680> where<00:02:28.830> I'm<00:02:28.950> at<00:02:29.100> are<00:02:29.459> two<00:02:29.519> totally

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
through and where I'm at are two totally

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.140 
through and where I'm at are two totally
different<00:02:30.690> places<00:02:31.380> it's<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.310> liberating<00:02:32.610> to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
different places it's so liberating to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.980 
different places it's so liberating to
finally

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
finally

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.050 
finally
myself<00:02:34.170> exactly<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.160> way<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.430> am<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
myself exactly the way that I am the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.050 
myself exactly the way that I am the
Shorty<00:02:36.390> Awards<00:02:36.420> are<00:02:37.080> pretty<00:02:37.380> PG<00:02:37.860> pg-13<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.000> I

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
Shorty Awards are pretty PG pg-13 so I

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.190 
Shorty Awards are pretty PG pg-13 so I
can<00:02:39.240> understand<00:02:39.660> why<00:02:39.750> they<00:02:39.900> wouldn't<00:02:40.050> want

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
can understand why they wouldn't want

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.140 
can understand why they wouldn't want
someone<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.680> me<00:02:40.980> being<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.000> competition

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
someone like me being in the competition

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.570 
someone like me being in the competition
considering<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.260> was<00:02:43.440> third<00:02:43.800> in<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> category

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
considering I was third in the category

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.360 
considering I was third in the category
so<00:02:45.230> if<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.500> would<00:02:46.620> have<00:02:46.710> stayed<00:02:46.950> if<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.250> would

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
so if it would have stayed if I would

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.560 
so if it would have stayed if I would
have<00:02:47.460> seen<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.760> top<00:02:47.940> four<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.210> would<00:02:48.480> have

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
have seen in the top four I would have

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.810 
have seen in the top four I would have
automatically<00:02:49.050> been<00:02:49.110> given<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.950> spot<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.730> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
automatically been given a spot in the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.240 
automatically been given a spot in the
finals<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.390> I'm<00:02:52.290> sure<00:02:52.500> they<00:02:52.650> probably<00:02:52.950> don't

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
finals and I'm sure they probably don't

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.520 
finals and I'm sure they probably don't
want<00:02:53.520> someone<00:02:54.150> who's<00:02:54.510> icon<00:02:55.020> is<00:02:55.230> me<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.470> a
