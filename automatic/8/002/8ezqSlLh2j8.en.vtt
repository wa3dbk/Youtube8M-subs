thing<00:00:34.950> wait<00:00:35.100> wait<00:00:35.250> wait<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.579> gonna<00:00:36.090> be

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
thing wait wait wait is that gonna be

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.299 
thing wait wait wait is that gonna be
the<00:00:36.390> whole<00:00:36.510> segment<00:00:36.870> well<00:00:37.020> that's<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.980> if

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the whole segment well that's like if

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.130 
the whole segment well that's like if
you<00:00:38.610> imagine<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.270> great<00:00:39.510> sound<00:00:39.780> effect

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
you imagine like a great sound effect

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.690 
you imagine like a great sound effect
and<00:00:40.320> then<00:00:40.440> I'll<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> comment<00:00:41.129> after<00:00:41.430> that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and then I'll have a comment after that

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.389 
and then I'll have a comment after that
so<00:00:42.180> my<00:00:42.390> theory<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.350> Brian<00:00:43.890> Hoyer<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.370> a

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
so my theory is that a Brian Hoyer is a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.540 
so my theory is that a Brian Hoyer is a
baller<00:00:44.960> be<00:00:45.960> Manziel<00:00:46.620> clearly<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.309> ready

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
