00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
rebounding and I thought that that's

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.990 
rebounding and I thought that that's
that's<00:00:10.530> what<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:10.920> did<00:00:11.099> today<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.820> did<00:00:11.940> a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
front of us I thought that was a huge

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.560 
front of us I thought that was a huge
key<00:00:17.810> for<00:00:18.810> us<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:20.279> keeping<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> ball<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.480> know

out of the paint and making sure that
when<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> ball<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.510> shot<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.140> did<00:00:25.260> a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
when the ball is shot that we did a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.410 
when the ball is shot that we did a
decent<00:00:25.439> job<00:00:25.650> rebounding<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.220> ball<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.670> you

against<00:00:31.949> Xavier<00:00:32.390> he's<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> freshman<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.140> he's

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
against Xavier he's a freshman but he's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.720 
against Xavier he's a freshman but he's
learning<00:00:34.829> how<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> play<00:00:35.160> his<00:00:35.370> game<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.610> more

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
learning how to play his game and more

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.790 
learning how to play his game and more
confidence<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.270> his<00:00:36.390> game<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.079> he<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.380> big

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
confidence in his game and he was a big

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.100 
confidence in his game and he was a big
big<00:00:37.980> part<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> thought<00:00:39.840> our<00:00:39.930> bench

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
big part of this but I thought our bench

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.020 
big part of this but I thought our bench
came<00:00:40.350> off<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.309> numbers<00:00:41.670> weren't<00:00:41.820> great

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
came off and the numbers weren't great

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.119 
came off and the numbers weren't great
but<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.300> thought<00:00:42.660> they<00:00:42.809> defended<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.980> they

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
but I thought they defended and they

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.619 
but I thought they defended and they
rebounded<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.760> they<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.059> brought<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
rebounded and they and they brought you

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.930 
rebounded and they and they brought you
know<00:00:45.750> something<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.460> game<00:00:47.730> which

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

lot<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.180> flashes<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.720> think<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.079> this<00:04:08.230> point

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
lot of flashes I think to this point

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.180 
lot of flashes I think to this point
that<00:04:08.739> today

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
that today

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.800 
that today
it's<00:04:09.610> his<00:04:09.760> first<00:04:09.970> three<00:04:10.210> shots<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.690> just

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
it's his first three shots and just

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.470 
it's his first three shots and just
really<00:04:10.990> seems<00:04:11.890> just<00:04:12.220> his<00:04:12.610> confidence<00:04:13.390> was

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
really seems just his confidence was

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.720 
really seems just his confidence was
just<00:04:13.870> annoying<00:04:14.770> at<00:04:14.950> that<00:04:15.100> point<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.430> mean<00:04:15.520> is<00:04:15.640> it

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
just annoying at that point I mean is it

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.520 
just annoying at that point I mean is it
something<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.209> kind<00:04:16.510> of<00:04:16.570> maybe<00:04:16.750> thought

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
something that you kind of maybe thought

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.800 
something that you kind of maybe thought

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
that he was always may be capable of
