00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.280 
stripes on the back of his neck and then
here<00:02:57.830> he's<00:02:58.370> got<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.820> big<00:02:59.180> bony<00:02:59.570> plate<00:03:00.080> this

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
here he's got that big bony plate this

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.860 
here he's got that big bony plate this
is<00:03:00.350> what<00:03:00.680> he<00:03:00.770> uses<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.550> attack<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.420> defend

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
is what he uses to attack and defend

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.740 
is what he uses to attack and defend
themselves<00:03:03.320> he's<00:03:03.680> got<00:03:04.000> spikes<00:03:05.000> around<00:03:05.300> here

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
themselves he's got spikes around here

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.979 
themselves he's got spikes around here
the<00:03:05.900> coloring<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:08.090> think<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.390> coloring<00:03:08.870> is

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
the coloring and I think the coloring is

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.220 
the coloring and I think the coloring is
actually<00:03:09.380> pretty<00:03:09.620> good<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:09.950> mean<00:03:10.220> this<00:03:10.430> says<00:03:11.230> it

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
actually pretty good I mean this says it

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.380 
actually pretty good I mean this says it
seems<00:03:12.680> like<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.130> would<00:03:13.190> be<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.400> hard<00:03:13.790> coloring

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
seems like it would be a hard coloring

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.350 
seems like it would be a hard coloring
job<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:14.870> mean<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.800> bled<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.250> little<00:03:16.730> bit<00:03:16.910> into

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
job I mean it bled a little bit into

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.030 
job I mean it bled a little bit into
some<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.720> these<00:03:17.810> spikes<00:03:18.230> here<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:18.829> if<00:03:18.920> you

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040

could<00:03:19.190> see<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.489> mean<00:03:19.640> he's<00:03:19.910> got<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.150> little<00:03:20.510> red

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
could see I mean he's got a little red

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
side you'll move his head but just a

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:02.170 
side you'll move his head but just a
little<00:03:55.370> bit<00:03:56.170> see<00:03:57.170> that<00:03:58.540> not<00:03:59.540> much<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:02.000> the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
little bit see that not much so the

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.479 
little bit see that not much so the
action<00:04:02.600> on<00:04:02.750> this<00:04:02.930> guy<00:04:03.170> is<00:04:03.230> not<00:04:03.620> as<00:04:03.860> good<00:04:04.130> as<00:04:04.459> a

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
action on this guy is not as good as a

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.830 
action on this guy is not as good as a
lot<00:04:04.670> of<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.239> other<00:04:05.390> ones<00:04:05.660> but<00:04:05.870> he<00:04:07.840> looks

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
lot of the other ones but he looks

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.280 
lot of the other ones but he looks
really<00:04:08.989> cool<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.060> that<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.330> guess<00:04:11.660> that<00:04:11.900> sort<00:04:12.170> of

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
really cool so that I guess that sort of

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.580 
really cool so that I guess that sort of
makes<00:04:12.350> up<00:04:12.950> for<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.750> price<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.410> price

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
makes up for it and the price the price

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.690 
makes up for it and the price the price
is<00:04:15.800> not<00:04:16.010> too<00:04:16.220> bad<00:04:16.430> either<00:04:16.669> so<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:22.400> guy's

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
is not too bad either so this guy's

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.760 
is not too bad either so this guy's
