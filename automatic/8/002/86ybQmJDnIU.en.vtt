00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
over to the 2nd fret of the D what's

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
over to the 2nd fret of the D what's
that<00:01:10.860> would<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.670> after<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:14.970> we

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that would be so and after that we

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.310 
that would be so and after that we
played<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.290> little<00:01:16.590> section<00:01:16.770> again<00:01:18.320> before

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320

hitting<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> low<00:01:20.040> E<00:01:20.070> string<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.000> would

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
hitting the low E string so that would

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.520 
hitting the low E string so that would
be

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:34.490 

so<00:01:25.530> slowly<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:32.630> last<00:01:33.630> part<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.080> classic

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
so slowly the last part of this classic

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.219 
so slowly the last part of this classic
riff<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.119> very<00:01:36.119> very<00:01:36.270> similar<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.899> just<00:01:37.110> have

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
riff is very very similar we just have

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.779 
riff is very very similar we just have
the<00:01:39.409> section<00:01:40.409> again<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> open<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.190> first<00:01:41.670> rate

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
the section again the open a first rate

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.149 
the section again the open a first rate
of<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> second<00:01:42.600> fret<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.080> roll<00:01:43.860> over

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
of the a second fret of the a roll over

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.969 
of the a second fret of the a roll over
to<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> 2nd<00:01:44.670> fret<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> D<00:01:45.350> say<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.500> twice

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.200 

there's<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.250> small<00:01:50.460> difference<00:01:50.670> now<00:01:51.060> at

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
there's just a small difference now at

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.690 
there's just a small difference now at
the<00:01:51.299> end<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:52.080> go<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.590> third<00:01:53.159> fret<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the end we go to the third fret of the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.700 
the end we go to the third fret of the
low<00:01:54.119> E<00:01:54.360> string<00:01:54.479> which<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.899> G<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.800> slight

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
low E string which is G do a slight

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
low E string which is G do a slight
slope<00:01:58.710> end<00:01:59.190> there<00:01:59.399> sometimes<00:01:59.819> written<00:02:00.360> in

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
slope end there sometimes written in

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.899 
slope end there sometimes written in
tablatures<00:02:01.350> BSS<00:02:01.830> are<00:02:02.009> been<00:02:02.220> slightly<00:02:02.520> sharp

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
tablatures BSS are been slightly sharp

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.669 
tablatures BSS are been slightly sharp
so<00:02:03.420> let's<00:02:03.630> call<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.869> blue<00:02:04.049> Blues<00:02:04.409> curl<00:02:04.830> and

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
so let's call the blue Blues curl and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.650 
so let's call the blue Blues curl and
then<00:02:07.679> jumping<00:02:08.100> strengthen<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.850> back<00:02:09.420> over

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
then jumping strengthen that back over

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.640 
then jumping strengthen that back over
to<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:11.060> root<00:02:12.060> note<00:02:12.299> on<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.959> 2nd<00:02:13.290> fret<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.500> the
