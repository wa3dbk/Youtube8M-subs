00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello to all welcome surprise it is 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.950
 fast today I'm going to show you 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.630
 how to make a carrot cake 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.910
 easy way and very original go 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.890
 it's gone to carantec 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.100
 we will need a little bit of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.289
 fresh ginger 150 g flour a 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.250
 teaspoon of salt 100 grams 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.410
 oil 100 g sugar brown sugar 2nd 1 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.689
 sachet of baking powder and a sachet 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.260
 vanilla sugar for carrots 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.329
 candied 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.370
 we will need 250 g of carrots 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.390
 grated one tablespoon of vinegar 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.570
 White 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.300
 300 g of orange juice 100 g of sugar and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.300
 without drama back then in my pan 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:56.250
 I put my orange juice and I put my 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:58.879
 we sugar my vanilla stick to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.879
 cut in half 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.880
 my grated carrots 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.020
 never my white vinegar then the 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.350
 white vinegar will help me to fix the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.690
 carrot color to have a 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.110
 carrot although we did well orange 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.790
 so here I mix so you have to count 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.310
 one hour of cooking after boiling 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.960
 and we do not hesitate to add a small 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.690
 little water if we see that it reduces 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.300
 Too much must be avoided to arrive at the state 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:47.160
 of caramel so there we monitor in 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.380
 add a little water it will take 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.480
 do this operation whenever 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.760
 the reduction is important and you have to 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.130
 that in the end we are only 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.990
 with the carrots without the liquid for 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.950
 the moment we are half cooked so it 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.950
 we need to add a little water 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.470
 after one hour of cooking all the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.240
 liquid has evaporated so now 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.260
 I love you on fire and I let it cool 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.260
 In the caserole 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.230
 first step of their recipe i'm going 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.830
 break 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:35.920
 you put two in the bowl I put 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:37.480
 my vanilla sugar my sugar brown sugar and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.209
 there I'm going to whip about a 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.209
 minute to whiten well the mixture is 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:57.549
 so I go to the next step I 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:03:01.030
 put my oil I mix then I 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:08.709
 take my sachet of baking powder and 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:12.120
 I put it directly with Bahrain from 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.599
 the agreement carries a good mix previous 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.599
 and I mix 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:38.700
 now I add - salt and I come 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.700
 rap and a small piece of ginger 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:50.800
 do we move all that to have a 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:53.290
 smooth paste a dish I prepared some 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.030
 small silicone molds so I have them 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.750
 cried for a nice color 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:04.260
 so I start with m just a little 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.260
 pasta part at the bottom of my mold 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:20.620
 then I take a little bit of 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:23.270
 candied carrots and I form a ball 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.830
 that I had directly in the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.830
 mold center of the mold 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.320
 now I put over a little 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.270
 little dough our mold to chase 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.970
 possible air bubbles then he me 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.780
 remains a little bit of carrot and a 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.750
 little bit of dough 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.700
 so I took an individual mussels I 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:54.300
 so go buttered I'm going to put in 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.300
 background of the dough 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.260
 there I remove the vanilla so this 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.210
 vanilla you can then rinse 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.900
 and put a jar with sugar 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.400
 like that you will have vanilla sugar 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:21.850
 I get the carrots 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:26.380
 confit the shape a ball that has 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:29.100
 teeth and from above I put the rest 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.100
 dough 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:48.820
 there we are really pile here I put 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.560
 my oven preheated to 60 degrees on 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.790

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.770
