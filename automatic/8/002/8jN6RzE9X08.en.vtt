00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:17.570
 I liked you today 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.430
 the three products in Dinho stands 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.949
 modeler of curls that all at the moment 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.859
 to take because it will never be in phase 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.320
 of transition in your 9 - I have 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.210
 then you know who you are. 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.380
 passing by has passed 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.930
 knows that dogs do not get so 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:50.460
 how to decide how natural hair is 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:53.899
 more return so fashionable and very good 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.230
 the first time I used the hair was 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.920
 full of effects and set day and he 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.830
 contains collagen and jojoba oil moisturizes 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.689
 then modifies the hair beyond 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:16.229
 model and hydrates also encodes and 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:22.710
 also giving definite to the always beautiful of the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.979
 embelleze very good because he is 31 and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.130
 keep hair hydrated for 24 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.579
 31 hours because he can hit with a 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.950
 cut in the mouth or hair shampoo there you 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.189
 he leaves two minutes left as 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.479
 rinse conditioner can be used 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.390
 as a long hair to get wetsuit is 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.689
 as an event and he highly praises the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.689
 volume 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.909
 the name and it can be used as 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 night treatment 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.369
 He asks you before you sleep, are you there? 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.540
 but the length of the bills stays in 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.030
 all the hair and let him acting that he 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.510
 does not leave hair looking heavy and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.069
 understanding of the griffon killing that is 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.959
 your tonic looks that way the blue whiting 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.569
 is that it is the cross- curled 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.400
 it relies on action and style it your 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.489
 tonic because the elements that 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.950
 I accompanied him with similar ones with 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.100
 fluid from our body so it penetrates 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.420
 more quickly our hair fiber and 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.350
 today I there my hair and I used isotonic 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.230
 because I'm intercalate where a wash 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.069
 to the museum returns to fashion in the other wash 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.980
 always beautiful and in the other I 'm going to vote 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.700
 in whom he also strongly advocates 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.700
 hashish 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.010
 and then these three future modelers 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.739
 using and you want to try 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.560
 And he does glasses for whoever is then. 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.730
 for the three hair fields try study 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.730
 they are very nice 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.980
 They are very good 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.980
 then that's it
