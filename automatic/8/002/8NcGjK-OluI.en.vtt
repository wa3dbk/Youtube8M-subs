00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
going to do this one just because I

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.610

taping<00:03:20.750> all<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:20.989> up<00:03:21.169> so<00:03:21.949> I<00:03:22.280> might<00:03:22.639> just<00:03:22.819> take

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
taping all that up so I might just take

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.180 
taping all that up so I might just take
all<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.269> off<00:03:23.449> and<00:03:23.690> just<00:03:23.810> keep<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.199> as<00:03:24.349> is<00:03:24.919> I
