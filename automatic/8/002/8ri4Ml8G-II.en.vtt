this case it's actually the gold versus
the<00:00:22.100> slate<00:00:22.400> but<00:00:22.910> in<00:00:23.030> reality<00:00:23.180> it's<00:00:23.690> more<00:00:23.840> about

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
the slate but in reality it's more about

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.380 
the slate but in reality it's more about
black<00:00:24.410> versus<00:00:24.920> white<00:00:24.950> iPhones<00:00:25.550> because<00:00:26.150> at

black versus white iPhones because at

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.609 
black versus white iPhones because at
the<00:00:26.480> end<00:00:26.510> of<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.780> day<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.200> front<00:00:27.440> of<00:00:27.530> the

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
the end of the day the front of the

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.590 
the end of the day the front of the
device<00:00:27.830> is<00:00:28.250> what<00:00:28.400> we<00:00:28.490> ultimately<00:00:28.700> look<00:00:29.420> at

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
device is what we ultimately look at

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.200 
device is what we ultimately look at
more<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.140> most<00:00:30.680> people<00:00:30.980> use<00:00:31.100> cases<00:00:31.640> on<00:00:31.820> their

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
more and most people use cases on their

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.210 
more and most people use cases on their
phones<00:00:32.450> anyways<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.530> back<00:00:33.710> is<00:00:33.890> kind<00:00:34.070> of

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
phones anyways so the back is kind of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.979 
phones anyways so the back is kind of
irrelevant<00:00:34.460> since<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.120> iPhone<00:00:35.239> 3G<00:00:35.780> I've

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
irrelevant since the iPhone 3G I've

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.290 
irrelevant since the iPhone 3G I've
owned<00:00:36.260> every<00:00:36.770> iPhone<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.370> they've<00:00:37.850> all<00:00:38.060> been

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
owned every iPhone and they've all been

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.389 
owned every iPhone and they've all been
black<00:00:38.630> iPhones<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.350> think<00:00:39.950> we<00:00:40.040> can<00:00:40.160> all<00:00:40.250> agree

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
black iPhones I think we can all agree

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.400 
black iPhones I think we can all agree
the<00:00:40.700> black<00:00:40.940> iPhone<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.570> stealthy<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:42.170> very

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
the black iPhone is stealthy and very

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.229 
the black iPhone is stealthy and very
elegant<00:00:42.590> however<00:00:43.489> with<00:00:43.670> that<00:00:43.700> stealthiness

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
elegant however with that stealthiness

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.930 
elegant however with that stealthiness
comes<00:00:44.630> a<00:00:44.750> compromise<00:00:45.200> with<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.220> black<00:00:46.430> iphone

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
comes a compromise with the black iphone

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.700 
comes a compromise with the black iphone
all<00:00:47.149> the<00:00:47.360> fine<00:00:47.540> details<00:00:47.570> that<00:00:48.079> Apple<00:00:48.380> put<00:00:48.530> into

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
all the fine details that Apple put into

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.590 
all the fine details that Apple put into
creating<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.100> phone<00:00:49.309> basically<00:00:49.790> disappear

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
creating the phone basically disappear

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.870 
creating the phone basically disappear

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:11.389 
those who are familiar with the Nexus 5

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:13.959 
those who are familiar with the Nexus 5
well<00:01:11.899> I<00:01:12.170> kind<00:01:12.619> of<00:01:12.679> wish<00:01:12.859> it<00:01:12.889> then<00:01:13.130> white<00:01:13.520> Nexus

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
well I kind of wish it then white Nexus

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.149 
well I kind of wish it then white Nexus
5<00:01:14.179> was<00:01:14.479> entirely<00:01:14.899> white<00:01:15.319> and<00:01:15.560> not<00:01:15.799> just<00:01:16.009> the

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
5 was entirely white and not just the

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.399 
5 was entirely white and not just the
back<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:16.969> basically<00:01:17.359> in<00:01:17.539> my<00:01:17.659> opinion<00:01:18.049> white

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
back so basically in my opinion white

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.230 
back so basically in my opinion white
iPhones<00:01:18.829> are<00:01:19.159> better<00:01:19.609> looking<00:01:20.029> than<00:01:20.179> the

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
iPhones are better looking than the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.179 
iPhones are better looking than the
black<00:01:20.479> iPhones<00:01:20.899> sure<00:01:21.619> this<00:01:21.799> is<00:01:21.920> just<00:01:22.100> my

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
black iPhones sure this is just my

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.769 
black iPhones sure this is just my
opinion<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.850> maybe<00:01:22.969> it's<00:01:23.179> partially<00:01:23.539> based

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:23.779 
opinion and maybe it's partially based

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:26.169 
opinion and maybe it's partially based
on<00:01:24.049> only<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:24.439> many<00:01:24.619> black<00:01:24.859> iPhones<00:01:25.310> but<00:01:25.999> that's

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
on only so many black iPhones but that's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.179 
on only so many black iPhones but that's
not<00:01:26.359> to<00:01:26.479> say<00:01:26.509> that<00:01:26.719> the<00:01:27.139> slate<00:01:27.409> iPhone<00:01:27.859> is<00:01:28.069> an

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
not to say that the slate iPhone is an

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.370 
not to say that the slate iPhone is an
elegant<00:01:28.579> all<00:01:29.149> I'm<00:01:29.420> saying<00:01:29.689> is<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:30.109> I've<00:01:30.229> used

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
elegant all I'm saying is that I've used

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.230 
elegant all I'm saying is that I've used
way<00:01:30.740> too<00:01:30.770> many<00:01:31.099> of<00:01:31.279> them<00:01:31.399> and<00:01:31.639> I<00:01:31.909> think<00:01:31.969> it's

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
way too many of them and I think it's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.539 
way too many of them and I think it's
