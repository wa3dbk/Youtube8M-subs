9-millimeter<00:00:59.370> submachine<00:00:59.940> gun<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.719> this

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
9-millimeter submachine gun but this

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260 
9-millimeter submachine gun but this
comes<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> expense<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:02.100> more<00:01:02.489> recoil<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
comes at the expense of more recoil and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.719 
comes at the expense of more recoil and
a<00:01:03.359> lower<00:01:03.539> rate<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.840> fire<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:05.100> anyway<00:01:05.460> let's

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
a lower rate of fire but anyway let's

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
a lower rate of fire but anyway let's
take<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> look<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> MPX<00:01:06.780> stats<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.530> see<00:01:07.740> how

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
take a look at the MPX stats and see how

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.850 
take a look at the MPX stats and see how
it<00:01:08.040> performs<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.790> game<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.750> MPX<00:01:10.170> fires<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it performs in game the MPX fires at a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.690 
it performs in game the MPX fires at a
reasonably<00:01:11.369> fast<00:01:11.810> 850<00:01:12.810> rpm<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.530> deals<00:01:14.010> 27

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
reasonably fast 850 rpm and deals 27

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.850 
reasonably fast 850 rpm and deals 27
damage<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> 12<00:01:15.720> meters<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.320> drops<00:01:16.650> off

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
damage out to 12 meters which drops off

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.399 
damage out to 12 meters which drops off
to<00:01:16.890> its<00:01:17.159> minimum<00:01:17.310> damage<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:18.060> 13<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.810> 50<00:01:19.259> meters

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to its minimum damage of 13 at 50 meters

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.070 
to its minimum damage of 13 at 50 meters
this<00:01:20.280> translates<00:01:20.759> into<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.570> four<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
this translates into about a four to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
this translates into about a four to
five<00:01:22.290> shot<00:01:22.560> kill<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:23.040> close<00:01:23.310> range<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:23.880> an

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
five shot kill at close range or an

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.850 
five shot kill at close range or an
eight<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.330> nine<00:01:24.509> shot<00:01:24.810> killed<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.320> long<00:01:25.590> range

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
eight to nine shot killed at long range

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.010 
eight to nine shot killed at long range
this<00:01:26.580> means<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.240> really<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.689> hitting

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
this means that it's really not hitting

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.420 
this means that it's really not hitting
that<00:01:28.200> much<00:01:28.439> harder<00:01:28.680> than<00:01:28.920> an<00:01:29.070> assault<00:01:29.369> rifle

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that much harder than an assault rifle

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.880 
that much harder than an assault rifle
at<00:01:29.820> close<00:01:30.030> range<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.020> doing<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.500> lot<00:01:31.680> less

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
at close range and it's doing a lot less

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.460 
at close range and it's doing a lot less
damage<00:01:32.280> than<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.490> carbine<00:01:33.000> at<00:01:33.270> long<00:01:33.509> range<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
damage than a carbine at long range the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.350 
damage than a carbine at long range the
problem<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.850> battlefield

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
problem with this is that in battlefield

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
problem with this is that in battlefield
4<00:01:36.420> there's<00:01:36.900> very<00:01:37.110> few<00:01:37.200> maps<00:01:37.650> where<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.040> can

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
4 there's very few maps where you can

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.160 
4 there's very few maps where you can
consistently<00:01:38.790> engage<00:01:39.180> targets<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:39.900> close

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
consistently engage targets at close

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.109 
consistently engage targets at close
range<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.340> expect<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> get<00:01:41.880> outshot

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
range so you can expect to get outshot

to<00:02:45.739> give<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.010> little<00:02:46.100> bit<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.519> leeway<00:02:46.700> when

it comes to barrel attachments so the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.820 
it comes to barrel attachments so the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
question is is the MPX actually worth

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.070 
question is is the MPX actually worth
using<00:02:52.160> well<00:02:53.000> by<00:02:53.239> now<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.660> think<00:02:53.930> you've

using well by now I think you've

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.050 
using well by now I think you've

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
probably realized that the short answer

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.229 
probably realized that the short answer
is<00:02:56.269> no<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:57.319> MPX<00:02:57.800> is<00:02:58.010> different<00:02:58.430> sure<00:02:58.610> but<00:02:59.000> it's

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
is no the MPX is different sure but it's

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.850 
is no the MPX is different sure but it's

the PDW are are both better options I

the PDW are are both better options I

mean even the mtar is probably a better

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.140

enjoy using the mtar at all don't get me
wrong<00:03:22.880> though<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.420> MPX<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.140> good<00:03:24.440> compared<00:03:24.860> to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
wrong though the MPX is good compared to

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.100 
wrong though the MPX is good compared to
a<00:03:25.010> lot<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.250> POWs<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.030> it's<00:03:26.390> decent<00:03:26.750> enough<00:03:26.900> for

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
a lot of POWs and it's decent enough for

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.350 
a lot of POWs and it's decent enough for
close-range<00:03:27.410> combat<00:03:27.680> but<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.640> problem<00:03:28.970> is<00:03:29.120> is

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
close-range combat but the problem is is

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.090 
close-range combat but the problem is is
that<00:03:29.420> it's<00:03:29.780> not<00:03:29.840> really<00:03:30.230> good<00:03:30.410> at<00:03:30.620> any<00:03:30.860> one

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
that it's not really good at any one

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.770 
that it's not really good at any one
particular<00:03:31.250> role<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.180> it's<00:03:32.269> not<00:03:32.450> really<00:03:32.600> a

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
particular role and it's not really a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.170

problem<00:03:35.600> is<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.810> I<00:03:36.049> doubt<00:03:36.260> they<00:03:36.470> could<00:03:36.500> patch

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
problem is that I doubt they could patch

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.620 
problem is that I doubt they could patch
this<00:03:37.100> gun<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.489> be<00:03:37.610> consistent<00:03:38.180> with<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.420> rest

with<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.440> real<00:03:57.620> world<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.519> I<00:03:58.549> doubt<00:03:58.790> they'll

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
with the real world so I doubt they'll

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.090 
with the real world so I doubt they'll

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
change the MP X's rate of fire and

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.860 
change the MP X's rate of fire and
reducing<00:04:01.880> its<00:04:02.000> recoil<00:04:02.420> wouldn't<00:04:02.780> be

to<00:04:56.840> a<00:04:56.870> ridiculous<00:04:57.230> 180<00:04:58.040> meters<00:04:58.430> per<00:04:58.580> second

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
combo most of the time you actually

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.850 
combo most of the time you actually
won't<00:05:16.910> need<00:05:17.120> to<00:05:17.240> aim<00:05:17.360> down<00:05:17.570> sights<00:05:17.900> at<00:05:18.080> all<00:05:18.230> if

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
won't need to aim down sights at all if

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.350 
won't need to aim down sights at all if
for<00:05:19.100> some<00:05:19.130> reason<00:05:19.280> you<00:05:19.610> really<00:05:19.940> do<00:05:20.090> want<00:05:20.330> to

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
for some reason you really do want to

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.060 
for some reason you really do want to
use<00:05:20.420> this<00:05:20.690> weapon<00:05:20.930> at<00:05:21.140> long<00:05:21.290> range<00:05:21.530> though<00:05:21.800> I

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
use this weapon at long range though I

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.070 
use this weapon at long range though I
found<00:05:22.310> it<00:05:22.430> actually<00:05:22.820> does<00:05:23.000> run<00:05:23.300> okay<00:05:23.750> with<00:05:23.960> the

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
found it actually does run okay with the

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.930 
found it actually does run okay with the
heavy<00:05:24.260> barrel<00:05:24.500> you<00:05:25.130> could<00:05:25.280> maybe<00:05:25.430> throw<00:05:25.760> on<00:05:25.880> a

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
heavy barrel you could maybe throw on a

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.670 
heavy barrel you could maybe throw on a
stubby<00:05:26.210> grip<00:05:26.300> with<00:05:26.630> this<00:05:26.750> combo<00:05:27.140> and<00:05:27.380> try<00:05:27.560> and

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
stubby grip with this combo and try and

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.070 
stubby grip with this combo and try and
counteract<00:05:28.040> the<00:05:28.220> guns<00:05:28.400> standing<00:05:28.730> 80s<00:05:29.360> but<00:05:29.900> I'd

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
counteract the guns standing 80s but I'd

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.600 
counteract the guns standing 80s but I'd
recommend<00:05:30.350> just<00:05:30.710> sticking<00:05:30.950> with<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.220> ergo

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
recommend just sticking with the ergo

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.100 
recommend just sticking with the ergo
because<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.090> heavy<00:05:32.240> barrel<00:05:32.450> still<00:05:32.810> doesn't

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
because the heavy barrel still doesn't

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.810 
because the heavy barrel still doesn't
turn<00:05:33.230> this<00:05:33.440> into<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:33.770> stop<00:05:34.040> and<00:05:34.160> pop<00:05:34.340> long-range

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
turn this into a stop and pop long-range

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.240 
turn this into a stop and pop long-range
weapon<00:05:35.240> in<00:05:35.720> any<00:05:36.050> case<00:05:36.140> I'd<00:05:36.560> avoid<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.950> muzzle

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
weapon in any case I'd avoid the muzzle

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.680 
weapon in any case I'd avoid the muzzle
brake<00:05:37.430> and<00:05:37.700> compensator<00:05:38.240> because<00:05:38.540> this

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
brake and compensator because this

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.300 
brake and compensator because this
weapon<00:05:39.050> certainly<00:05:39.410> doesn't<00:05:39.650> need<00:05:39.890> to<00:05:40.010> be<00:05:40.130> more

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
weapon certainly doesn't need to be more

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.940 
weapon certainly doesn't need to be more
inaccurate<00:05:40.700> than<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.240> already<00:05:41.450> is<00:05:41.650> but<00:05:42.650> anyway

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
inaccurate than it already is but anyway

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.590 
inaccurate than it already is but anyway
