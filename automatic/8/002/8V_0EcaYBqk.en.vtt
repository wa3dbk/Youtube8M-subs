00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
battles really really old mind you

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.710 
battles really really old mind you
so<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:04.100> wasn't<00:02:04.430> really<00:02:04.580> sure<00:02:04.790> how<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.180> combat<00:02:05.659> it

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
so I wasn't really sure how to combat it

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.749 
so I wasn't really sure how to combat it
like<00:02:06.350> right<00:02:06.920> away<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.709> that's<00:02:10.250> kind<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.670> a

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
like right away so that's kind of a

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.400 
like right away so that's kind of a
thing<00:02:11.590> had<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.620> not<00:02:13.360> gone<00:02:14.360> into<00:02:14.690> diggersby<00:02:15.020> now

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
thing had I not gone into diggersby now

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.620 
thing had I not gone into diggersby now
the<00:02:16.220> chopper<00:02:16.550> Barry<00:02:16.819> would<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.120> allowed<00:02:17.360> me

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
the chopper Barry would have allowed me

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.479 
the chopper Barry would have allowed me
to<00:02:17.780> live<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:17.990> hits<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.500> then<00:02:18.620> kill<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.130> back

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
to live the hits and then kill it back

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.699 
to live the hits and then kill it back

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
with the co return way however I went

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.530 
with the co return way however I went
diggersby<00:02:25.220> thinking<00:02:25.700> i'll<00:02:25.819> probably<00:02:26.300> just

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
diggersby thinking i'll probably just

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.350 
diggersby thinking i'll probably just
over<00:02:27.020> fake

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.820 

you<00:02:30.020> know<00:02:30.230> he<00:02:30.730> whatevs<00:02:31.730> uh<00:02:32.270> so<00:02:32.870> here<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.470> make<00:02:33.800> a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
you know he whatevs uh so here I make a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.980 
you know he whatevs uh so here I make a
dumb<00:02:34.130> move<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.670> instead<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.660> hitting<00:02:35.750> them

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
dumb move and instead of hitting them

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.380 
dumb move and instead of hitting them
with<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.410> brave<00:02:36.710> bird<00:02:37.010> doing<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:37.880> shitload<00:02:38.210> of

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
with a brave bird doing a shitload of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.950 
with a brave bird doing a shitload of
damage<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:40.330> probably<00:02:41.330> wouldn't<00:02:41.690> kill<00:02:41.840> it

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
damage I probably wouldn't kill it

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.360 
damage I probably wouldn't kill it
because<00:02:42.080> really<00:02:42.500> bulky<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.070> has<00:02:43.190> like

because really bulky and it has like

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.650 
because really bulky and it has like
base<00:02:43.550> 100<00:02:44.000> more<00:02:44.660> maybe<00:02:45.170> 100<00:02:45.590> or<00:02:45.740> more<00:02:46.660> defense

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
base 100 more maybe 100 or more defense

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.930 
base 100 more maybe 100 or more defense
I<00:02:48.050> probably<00:02:48.920> wouldn't<00:02:49.430> have<00:02:49.460> killed<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.820> but<00:02:49.880> I

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
I probably wouldn't have killed it but I

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.250 
I probably wouldn't have killed it but I
would<00:02:50.060> have<00:02:50.150> done<00:02:50.240> a<00:02:50.300> lot<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.570> damage<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.110> then

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
would have done a lot of damage and then

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.710 
would have done a lot of damage and then
I<00:02:51.320> could<00:02:51.410> have<00:02:51.530> gone<00:02:51.650> into<00:02:51.910> tokus<00:02:52.910> for<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
I could have gone into tokus for the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.230 
I could have gone into tokus for the
kill<00:02:54.290> back<00:02:54.740> plus<00:02:55.310> spray<00:02:55.760> bird<00:02:55.970> would<00:02:56.150> have

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
kill back plus spray bird would have

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.960 
kill back plus spray bird would have
definitely<00:02:56.420> killed<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:58.220> instead<00:02:58.610> he's

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
definitely killed it but instead he's

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.110 
thinking there's a slight chance goes
for<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.239> powerup<00:04:02.810> punch<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:03.890> like<00:04:04.850> he<00:04:04.970> did<00:04:05.090> last

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
for the powerup punch I like he did last

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.380 
for the powerup punch I like he did last
time<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.570> want<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.900> stay<00:04:06.080> in<00:04:06.250> if<00:04:07.250> not<00:04:07.580> I<00:04:07.880> can<00:04:08.060> just

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
time I want to stay in if not I can just

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.630 
time I want to stay in if not I can just
go<00:04:08.570> into<00:04:08.900> scizor<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.760> this<00:04:11.450> is<00:04:11.860> little<00:04:12.860> bit<00:04:13.340> of

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
go into scizor and this is little bit of

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.000 
go into scizor and this is little bit of
that<00:04:14.000> mind<00:04:14.390> you<00:04:14.660> this<00:04:14.930> is<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.170> first<00:04:15.410> day<00:04:15.980> of

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
that mind you this is the first day of

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.890 
that mind you this is the first day of
me<00:04:16.400> facing<00:04:16.940> hanging<00:04:17.180> on<00:04:17.330> so<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:17.540> wasn't<00:04:17.750> really

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
me facing hanging on so I wasn't really

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.770 
me facing hanging on so I wasn't really
aware<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.320> how<00:04:18.769> exactly<00:04:19.040> bull<00:04:19.669> he<00:04:19.880> was<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:20.720> I

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
aware of how exactly bull he was so I

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.500 
aware of how exactly bull he was so I
figured<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.200> brick<00:04:21.470> break<00:04:21.880> from<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:23.000> mega<00:04:23.240> scizor

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
figured a brick break from a mega scizor

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.950 
figured a brick break from a mega scizor
would<00:04:24.350> do<00:04:24.560> enough<00:04:24.979> damage<00:04:25.360> but<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.479> doesn't

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
would do enough damage but it doesn't

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.530 
would do enough damage but it doesn't
it's<00:04:27.320> just<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:28.130> think<00:04:28.370> kick<00:04:28.910> mega<00:04:29.060> hang<00:04:29.330> son

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
it's just so I think kick mega hang son

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.750 
it's just so I think kick mega hang son
has<00:04:29.690> over<00:04:30.169> base<00:04:30.380> 100<00:04:30.830> or<00:04:31.040> based<00:04:31.280> on<00:04:31.430> her<00:04:31.520> two<00:04:31.610> or

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
has over base 100 or based on her two or

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.200 
has over base 100 or based on her two or
more

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
more

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.090 
more
in<00:04:32.539> every<00:04:32.960> stat<00:04:33.169> except<00:04:33.410> for<00:04:33.560> special<00:04:33.620> attack

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
in every stat except for special attack

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.150 
in every stat except for special attack
so<00:04:34.340> it's<00:04:34.460> kind<00:04:34.699> of<00:04:34.759> held<00:04:35.030> open<00:04:35.620> whatever<00:04:36.620> the

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
so it's kind of held open whatever the

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.249 
so it's kind of held open whatever the
thing<00:04:37.190> about<00:04:37.520> mega<00:04:37.729> mega<00:04:38.270> kangaskhan<00:04:38.960> however

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
thing about mega mega kangaskhan however

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.450 
thing about mega mega kangaskhan however
is<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.740> Ghost<00:04:40.100> types<00:04:40.840> wallet<00:04:42.220> really<00:04:43.220> well

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
is that Ghost types wallet really well

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.350 
is that Ghost types wallet really well
after<00:04:44.389> a<00:04:44.419> mega<00:04:44.690> evolves<00:04:46.270> like<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:47.599> can<00:04:48.169> run

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
after a mega evolves like it can run

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.170 
after a mega evolves like it can run
earthquake<00:04:50.380> but<00:04:51.380> if<00:04:51.770> your<00:04:52.190> ghost<00:04:52.759> type<00:04:52.970> is

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
earthquake but if your ghost type is

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.240 
earthquake but if your ghost type is
like<00:04:53.389> Trevin<00:04:53.930> inner<00:04:54.139> core<00:04:54.380> base<00:04:54.560> you<00:04:54.949> can't

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
like Trevin inner core base you can't

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.390 
like Trevin inner core base you can't
really<00:04:55.400> touch<00:04:55.669> them<00:04:56.030> I<00:04:57.130> essentially<00:04:58.130> making

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
really touch them I essentially making

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.420 
really touch them I essentially making
them<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:58.699> hard<00:04:58.849> counter<00:04:59.300> I<00:05:02.770> guess<00:05:03.770> like<00:05:03.949> you

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
them a hard counter I guess like you

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.589 
them a hard counter I guess like you
have<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.639> play<00:05:04.759> some<00:05:04.940> kind<00:05:05.060> of<00:05:05.150> mind<00:05:05.330> games

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
have to play some kind of mind games

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.060 
have to play some kind of mind games
because<00:05:05.930> before<00:05:06.289> it<00:05:06.349> evolved<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.770> does<00:05:06.889> have

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
because before it evolved it does have

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.650 
because before it evolved it does have
scrappy<00:05:07.520> so<00:05:07.699> your<00:05:07.849> ghosts<00:05:08.060> aren't<00:05:08.270> exactly

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
scrappy so your ghosts aren't exactly

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.010 
scrappy so your ghosts aren't exactly
protected<00:05:09.490> in<00:05:10.490> fact<00:05:10.880> with<00:05:11.210> scrappy<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.750> believe

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
protected in fact with scrappy I believe

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.490 
protected in fact with scrappy I believe
mega<00:05:13.210> power<00:05:14.210> punch<00:05:14.539> is<00:05:14.870> super<00:05:15.259> effective

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
mega power punch is super effective

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.029 
mega power punch is super effective
disabled<00:05:16.039> I<00:05:16.099> and<00:05:17.020> spiritually<00:05:18.020> so<00:05:18.229> that's<00:05:18.919> a

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
disabled I and spiritually so that's a

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.620 
disabled I and spiritually so that's a
thing<00:05:19.190> he<00:05:19.610> goes<00:05:19.759> sky<00:05:20.030> attack<00:05:20.270> i'm<00:05:20.389> just<00:05:20.509> going

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
thing he goes sky attack i'm just going

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.370 
thing he goes sky attack i'm just going
to<00:05:20.660> u-turn<00:05:20.780> out<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.699> go<00:05:22.699> into<00:05:22.970> my<00:05:23.720> stable<00:05:24.320> I

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
to u-turn out and go into my stable I

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.230 
to u-turn out and go into my stable I
because<00:05:24.770> I<00:05:25.009> know<00:05:25.400> I<00:05:25.490> really<00:05:25.759> can't<00:05:25.909> touch<00:05:26.060> me

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
because I know I really can't touch me

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.730 
because I know I really can't touch me
if<00:05:26.330> he<00:05:26.389> goes<00:05:26.539> for<00:05:26.570> a<00:05:26.720> sky<00:05:26.930> tak<00:05:27.169> is<00:05:27.349> gonna<00:05:27.530> take

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
if he goes for a sky tak is gonna take

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.140 
if he goes for a sky tak is gonna take
him<00:05:27.889> with<00:05:27.979> her<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.190> charge<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.789> then<00:05:28.909> I'll<00:05:29.030> be

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
him with her to charge and then I'll be

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.240 
him with her to charge and then I'll be
stuck<00:05:29.180> in<00:05:29.570> it<00:05:29.690> in<00:05:29.810> his<00:05:29.930> burnham<00:05:30.289> so<00:05:30.860> it's<00:05:31.130> gonna

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
stuck in it in his burnham so it's gonna

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.450 
stuck in it in his burnham so it's gonna
give<00:05:31.400> me<00:05:31.490> a<00:05:31.550> free<00:05:31.759> window<00:05:32.240> to<00:05:32.590> go<00:05:33.590> for<00:05:33.919> recover

give me a free window to go for recover

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.330 
give me a free window to go for recover
and<00:05:34.909> I<00:05:35.479> don't<00:05:35.720> really<00:05:36.020> know<00:05:36.530> what<00:05:36.830> my<00:05:36.949> plan<00:05:37.310> of

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
and I don't really know what my plan of

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.730 
and I don't really know what my plan of
attack<00:05:37.610> here<00:05:38.180> was<00:05:38.419> I<00:05:38.449> don't<00:05:38.990> know<00:05:39.169> like<00:05:39.590> I

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
attack here was I don't know like I

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.279 
attack here was I don't know like I
don't<00:05:39.770> want<00:05:40.400> to<00:05:41.270> necessarily<00:05:41.570> go<00:05:41.990> into

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
don't want to necessarily go into
