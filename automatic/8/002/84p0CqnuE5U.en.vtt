00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.020
 hello we are on the computex 2014 and 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.660
 here we have the new asus convertible 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.400
 unfortunately not yet on the computex 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.840
 but it was officially announced here 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.600
 can already be found on the showfloor 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.880
 that's the asus transformer t 200 that 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.160
 So this is the bigger entry-level tablet 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.110
 or a transformer version of them 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.029
 Asians on the market brings the t 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.460
 100 has already sold very well 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.550
 that the 200 ta should be the same success in 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.480
 a slightly larger design, so to speak 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.489
 to repeat 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.180
 the platform remains basically the same 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:49.660
 will be the same as the updated t 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:51.850
 201 t 101 internet z 37 75 board of the four 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.730
 kerne has the 14 6 gigahertz 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.289
 work and if needed believe in 239 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.320
 I even go up 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.640
 otherwise I think 213 you have to 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.890
 then look again 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.500
 we have a 11.6 inch tall one here 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.270
 Unfortunately, the display is not full 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.400
 like many , it offers resolution 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.530
 Other manufacturers would like to do it here 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.350
 So we have absolute low end 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.240
 a resolution of 1 366 x 768 pixels 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.490
 is still an ips-panel which is relative 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.470
 bright and very good results 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.700
 the angles are definitely in too 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.740
 order if you like this from the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.840
 this is also a good thing 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.430
 under the hood as said the parents 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.020
 along with two gigabytes 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.470
 Memory will be short if he times 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.280
 go into the system house and 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.570
 here you see 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.360
 that's definitely the 37 75 combined 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.939
 with 2 gb of RAM and if I have 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.040
 now stand on in the pc 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.960
 then we see you are there 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.759
 the 64 gb version that is also with 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.320
 32 gigabyte version then from each of 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.789
 We definitely know this device 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.450
 We had this year in advance 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.610
 at the beginning 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.890
 there are in the village even below 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.710
 a 500 gigabyte hard drive here 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.969
 these goals are incorporated below the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.640
 displays exactly the center so that 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.030
 weight reasonably agrees with the tablet 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.940
 itself is 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.789
 12 mm thick and weighs 750 grams it is 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.920
 so not very easy to do so too 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.810
 say this is a 2 megapixel 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.630
 Camera on the front sits otherwise 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.700
 By the way, the whole package is 15 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.560
 kilogram so it's definitely not 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.030
 especially light we take the whole 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.459
 Let's go and have a look 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.880
 Both parts of what I noticed 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.430
 that this is the fortification up here on the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.250
 border has become much more stable than 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.450
 at the tea 200 at the t100 the button 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.709
 works better and you have here 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.269
 taken away in the back 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.700
 The whole thing can be better inserted 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.800
 and the body becomes much more stable 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.910
 even those behind do not wobble anymore 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.459
 so strong that was definitely one 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.769
 point of criticism we had at the t 100 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.940
 the first generation of people has to look around 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.440
 then we take care of the tray 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.459
 right around the dock again we have 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.470
 here on the back the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.030
 loudspeaker naturally the one and 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.200
 turns off than that 's the one here 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.360
 windows button there are on and 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.980
 switch new animal to come 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.260
 a 5 megapixel camera on the 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.000
 back and that was actually out of the question 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.319
 the two speakers are here 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.450
 left and right are still and what 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.370
 Of course, this is the back side 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.510
 of the ipad as if it were mega moderate 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.980
 put fingerprints on 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.980
 but she does not actually do that 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.200
 she is with one with a pattern resp 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.489
 with the known circle pattern federal 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.680
 what you get from cars already 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.239
 otherwise we met 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.130
 to the strings we have here so far 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.540
 nothing at the lower end, of course, but 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.250
 In a short time , the two are a plug 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.980
 for the double with 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.540
 the data port and on which I believe 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.300
 that would have to be the left side there 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.520
 we finally got a separate report of the 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.170
 the device is additionally supplied with power 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.270
 over a much stronger power supply than 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.710
 So far, you have the device faster 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.000
 load as it was the case then 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.650
 Of course there is the 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.770
 headphone jack a micro hdmi 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.970
 output micro usb connection and one 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.980
 micro sd card reader 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.200
 that was basically on the sides 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.580
 the tablet then we look at that 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.120
 Again, here you can see it all 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.010
 exactly 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.320
 The hands are really extremely stable 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.209
 it works because nothing breaks 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.770
 definitely not synonymous otherwise that works 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.520
 There is a lot more stable and up there 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.260
 not so easy anymore 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.300
 it is also significantly more than it is 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.800
 about 750 grams of the loose on the 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.080
 the balance brings that lies among other things 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.330
 because that's just these 500 gigabytes 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.739
 hard drive in it but I have that 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.410
 feeling there could be a battery in it 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.620
 Incidentally, tablet itself is 1 38 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.090
 hours of battery it seems much harder 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.310
 as if there was only a hard drive in it 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.470
 I would have been told there is no in there 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.669
 no battery in it but somehow has 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.620
 you already have the impression that it is so 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.400
 Interestingly, even one has 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.660
 get the internet donated 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.520
 is definitely a very interesting one 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.810
 then i will also be a speaker 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.500
 but I wanted the not yet so 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.780
 to believe correctly 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.300
 then we have a course called usb 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.610
 3.0 connection of course an extreme 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.530
 By the way, big trackpad can do that 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.240
 I think I work quite well 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.130
 which is adapted to the size of the device 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.810
 and then we have another usb 2.0 here 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.289
 you can connect the hard disk here 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.159
 and take us swap 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.539
 hopefully this can be done easily 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.979
 Screw another plate pure 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.539
 screw and maybe even a ssd 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.430
 install it so you can do more 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.589
 speed can get out there 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.479
 yes that was a very fast and 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:12.809
 maybe a bit bumpy and above all 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.509
 very noisy and first impression of the system 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:17.009
 200 ta before we are done I do 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.240
 One more thing I grab briefly 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.279
 right and want here the little brother 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.569
 to see how big the 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.939
 size difference between these two 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.349
 equipment and there it is already indicated 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.599
 Next details with the one I red 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.959
 t 100th but we'll come to that soon 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.719
 times 

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:35.180
 Anyway, that's t 200 ta then 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:38.819
 considerably larger than the little brother 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.610
 mobile gibbs at the computex 2014 with 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.749
 the ct 200h from asus if you like the video 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.849
 you already liked to see more 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:48.649
 from the computex since that please the
