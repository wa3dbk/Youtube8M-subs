00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
in which case don't think because your

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.280 
in which case don't think because your
brain<00:03:27.030> isn't<00:03:27.359> developed<00:03:27.540> enough<00:03:27.750> yet<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.079> do

to<00:06:16.010> read<00:06:16.190> the<00:06:16.310> names<00:06:16.550> 148<00:06:17.480> point<00:06:17.750> four<00:06:17.990> times

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
to read the names 148 point four times

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.670 
to read the names 148 point four times
actually<00:06:19.730> is<00:06:20.090> it<00:06:20.180> going<00:06:20.330> to<00:06:20.390> happen<00:06:22.330> yeah

actually is it going to happen yeah

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.930 
actually is it going to happen yeah
maybe<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.890> ending<00:06:25.160> sequence<00:06:25.370> is<00:06:25.670> supposed<00:06:25.880> to

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
maybe the ending sequence is supposed to

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.140
