00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.540 

there<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.730> is

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
there it is

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.970 
there it is
we're<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.120> with<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> lot<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.230> water<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.710> when<00:02:53.860> it

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
we're a with a lot of water so when it

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.390 
we're a with a lot of water so when it
dries<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.640> will<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:55.390> have<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:56.070> won't<00:02:57.070> give<00:02:57.280> it

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
dries it will just have a won't give it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.090 
dries it will just have a won't give it
such<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.580> gray<00:02:57.880> low<00:02:58.090> machine<00:02:58.600> look<00:02:58.950> okay<00:03:00.720> well

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
such a gray low machine look okay well

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.250 
such a gray low machine look okay well
there's<00:03:03.100> our<00:03:03.310> project<00:03:03.870> we're<00:03:04.870> through<00:03:05.110> with

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
there's our project we're through with

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.430 
there's our project we're through with
him<00:03:05.290> now<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:06.840> hit<00:03:07.840> next<00:03:08.170> will<00:03:08.320> be<00:03:08.350> the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
him now and hit next will be the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.440 
him now and hit next will be the
antiquing<00:03:09.130> solution<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.820> use<00:03:10.000> on<00:03:10.270> them

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
antiquing solution that I use on them

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.520 
antiquing solution that I use on them
and<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:13.150> do<00:03:13.330> not<00:03:13.480> put<00:03:13.780> like<00:03:13.990> I<00:03:14.110> said<00:03:14.350> you've

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
and you do not put like I said you've

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.530 
and you do not put like I said you've
got<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.770> do<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.430> antiquing<00:03:15.880> solution<00:03:16.360> before

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
got to do the antiquing solution before

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.340 
got to do the antiquing solution before
you<00:03:16.840> put<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.850> now<00:03:18.850> sometimes<00:03:19.800> afterwards

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
you put the now sometimes afterwards

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.790 
you put the now sometimes afterwards
perhaps<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.710> lot<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.010> times<00:03:24.220> when<00:03:24.460> you<00:03:24.750> these

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
perhaps a lot of times when you these

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.830 
perhaps a lot of times when you these
holes<00:03:26.800> that<00:03:27.070> you<00:03:27.130> drilled<00:03:27.250> get<00:03:27.670> wet<00:03:27.940> they

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
holes that you drilled get wet they

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.670 
holes that you drilled get wet they
would<00:03:29.110> expand<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:32.560> maybe<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:34.680> fishing

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
would expand and so maybe the fishing

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.620 
would expand and so maybe the fishing
pole<00:03:35.860> doesn't<00:03:36.040> fit<00:03:36.310> as<00:03:36.700> loosely<00:03:37.150> as<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.450> did

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
pole doesn't fit as loosely as it did

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.570 
pole doesn't fit as loosely as it did
with<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.960> so<00:03:38.350> all<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.680> do<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.130> take<00:03:39.370> your

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
with it so all you do is you take your

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.460 
with it so all you do is you take your
drill<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.600> just<00:03:40.780> read<00:03:41.020> rill<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.440> a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.840 
drill and you just read rill this a
little<00:03:41.800> bit<00:03:41.920> in<00:03:42.010> other<00:03:42.130> words<00:03:42.370> it's<00:03:42.550> not<00:03:42.610> going

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
little bit in other words it's not going

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.650 
little bit in other words it's not going
to<00:03:42.910> hurt<00:03:44.400> just<00:03:45.400> read<00:03:45.580> rip<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.910> hole<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:48.540> make<00:03:49.540> it

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660

pig<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.710> I<00:05:09.190> said<00:05:09.759> yeah<00:05:09.970> well<00:05:10.360> once<00:05:10.539> I<00:05:10.630> get

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
pig and I said yeah well once I get

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.020 
pig and I said yeah well once I get
through<00:05:10.900> with<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.080> fishermen<00:05:11.500> we'll<00:05:11.680> see

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
through with the fishermen we'll see

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.120 
through with the fishermen we'll see
doing<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.120> pig<00:05:13.360> someone<00:05:13.750> requested<00:05:14.289> that<00:05:14.530> but

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
doing a pig someone requested that but

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.950 
doing a pig someone requested that but
there's<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.430> number<00:05:15.550> of<00:05:15.729> other<00:05:15.909> things<00:05:16.240> but

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.200 

we're<00:05:19.960> there<00:05:20.259> with<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.470> fishermen<00:05:20.919> now

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
we're there with the fishermen now

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.430 
we're there with the fishermen now
except<00:05:22.210> for<00:05:22.270> thee<00:05:22.539> we've<00:05:22.750> got<00:05:22.930> sticking<00:05:23.320> the

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
except for thee we've got sticking the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.560 
except for thee we've got sticking the
antiquing<00:05:23.949> solution<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.759> then<00:05:25.300> we're<00:05:25.449> going

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
antiquing solution and then we're going

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.080 
antiquing solution and then we're going
to<00:05:25.690> have<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:25.960> assemble<00:05:26.289> him<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:27.310> we<00:05:27.639> will<00:05:27.880> do

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
to have to assemble him and we will do

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.760 
to have to assemble him and we will do
that<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.570> will<00:05:28.750> show<00:05:28.900> you<00:05:28.930> how<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.199> do<00:05:29.409> that<00:05:29.560> now

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
that I will show you how to do that now

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.960 
that I will show you how to do that now
it's<00:05:29.979> going<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.280> take<00:05:30.639> a<00:05:30.960> few<00:05:31.960> days<00:05:32.169> to<00:05:32.789> get<00:05:33.789> the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
it's going to take a few days to get the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.279 
it's going to take a few days to get the
antiquing<00:05:34.509> solution

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
antiquing solution

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.339 
antiquing solution
done<00:05:37.780> a<00:05:37.810> dry<00:05:38.650> that's<00:05:38.919> what<00:05:39.099> I<00:05:39.130> was<00:05:39.280> saying<00:05:39.520> and

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
done a dry that's what I was saying and

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.110 
done a dry that's what I was saying and
then<00:05:41.349> we'll<00:05:41.530> assembling<00:05:42.070> but<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.669> painting

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
then we'll assembling but the painting

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.770 
then we'll assembling but the painting
part<00:05:43.419> now<00:05:43.630> is<00:05:43.990> over<00:05:44.669> and<00:05:45.669> he's<00:05:46.300> looking<00:05:46.599> good

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
part now is over and he's looking good

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.499 
part now is over and he's looking good
they<00:05:47.770> look<00:05:47.919> even<00:05:48.070> better<00:05:48.310> once<00:05:48.639> he's<00:05:48.759> come<00:05:49.389> out

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
they look even better once he's come out

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.589 
they look even better once he's come out
of<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:50.469> antiquing<00:05:51.159> solution<00:05:51.669> but<00:05:52.210> you<00:05:52.270> see

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
of the antiquing solution but you see

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.810 
of the antiquing solution but you see
how<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.810> wood<00:05:53.139> shows<00:05:53.440> through<00:05:53.860> say<00:05:54.580> that's

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
how the wood shows through say that's

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.870 
how the wood shows through say that's
why<00:05:54.969> I<00:05:55.000> don't<00:05:55.090> paint<00:05:55.539> them<00:05:55.690> real<00:05:56.349> heavy

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
why I don't paint them real heavy

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.279 
why I don't paint them real heavy
because<00:05:57.880> then<00:05:58.419> you<00:05:58.539> can<00:05:58.719> look<00:05:58.750> at<00:05:58.990> that<00:05:59.139> and

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
because then you can look at that and

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.930 
because then you can look at that and
say<00:05:59.469> you<00:05:59.500> know<00:05:59.740> what<00:05:59.949> somebody<00:06:00.219> carve<00:06:00.639> out<00:06:00.789> on

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
say you know what somebody carve out on

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.590 
say you know what somebody carve out on
wood

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
wood

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.550 
wood
so<00:06:02.600> that's<00:06:02.810> all<00:06:02.990> that's<00:06:03.889> all<00:06:04.130> so<00:06:04.819> anyway

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
so that's all that's all so anyway

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.330 
so that's all that's all so anyway
that's<00:06:06.560> our<00:06:06.800> figure<00:06:07.190> and<00:06:07.430> I'm<00:06:08.680> we're<00:06:09.680> once<00:06:10.160> we

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
that's our figure and I'm we're once we

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.110 
that's our figure and I'm we're once we
get<00:06:10.490> that<00:06:10.669> done<00:06:10.729> then<00:06:11.240> we'll<00:06:12.139> have<00:06:12.440> the<00:06:13.120> I'll

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
get that done then we'll have the I'll

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.900 
get that done then we'll have the I'll
show<00:06:14.360> you<00:06:14.419> how<00:06:14.660> to<00:06:14.690> assemble<00:06:15.020> him<00:06:15.410> and<00:06:15.910> we'll

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
show you how to assemble him and we'll

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.189 
show you how to assemble him and we'll
put<00:06:17.090> him<00:06:17.180> on<00:06:17.270> a<00:06:17.300> base<00:06:17.539> and<00:06:17.870> he'll<00:06:17.990> be<00:06:18.110> a<00:06:18.139> real

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
put him on a base and he'll be a real

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.980 
put him on a base and he'll be a real
real<00:06:18.949> fine<00:06:19.160> carbon<00:06:19.580> okay<00:06:20.300> well<00:06:20.509> thank<00:06:20.750> you<00:06:20.810> now
