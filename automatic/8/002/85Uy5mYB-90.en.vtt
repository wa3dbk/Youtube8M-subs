00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
gaming that's the card so now let's go

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.430 
gaming that's the card so now let's go
over<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.660> computer<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.140> see<00:03:40.230> what's

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
over to the computer and see what's

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.750 
over to the computer and see what's
going<00:03:40.650> on<00:03:40.830> so<00:03:41.730> here<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.390> my<00:03:42.750> down<00:03:43.170> machine<00:03:43.760> you

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
got an adapter plugged in and you've got

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.500 
got an adapter plugged in and you've got
VGA<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.820> now<00:04:11.820> if<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.000> want<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.180> use<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.420> as

VGA and now if you want to use it as

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.630 
VGA and now if you want to use it as
little<00:04:12.810> profile<00:04:13.290> there<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.739> two<00:04:14.400> different

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
little profile there is two different

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.180 
little profile there is two different
brackets<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.510> you're<00:04:15.690> going<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:15.989> have<00:04:16.260> if

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
brackets that you're going to have if

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.539 
brackets that you're going to have if
you<00:04:17.370> want<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.700> use<00:04:17.850> VGA<00:04:18.299> low<00:04:18.840> profile<00:04:19.489> but<00:04:20.489> it

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
you want to use VGA low profile but it

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.279 
you want to use VGA low profile but it
does<00:04:20.789> include<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.180> two<00:04:21.299> brackets<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:22.169> that's

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
does include the two brackets so that's

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.310 
does include the two brackets so that's
nice

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
nice

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.320

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
see there's a screw down there and we're

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.680 
see there's a screw down there and we're
on<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.990> other<00:05:03.260> side<00:05:03.650> behind<00:05:04.039> this<00:05:04.100> cake

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
you're not gonna have to take the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.110 
you're not gonna have to take the
heatsink<00:05:06.919> on<00:05:07.039> for<00:05:07.250> anything<00:05:07.550> but<00:05:07.760> on<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:07.940> side

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
heatsink on for anything but on the side

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.870 
heatsink on for anything but on the side
of<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.300> heatsink<00:05:08.860> you<00:05:09.860> can<00:05:10.039> see<00:05:10.250> how<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.580> card

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
of the heatsink you can see how the card

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.670 
of the heatsink you can see how the card
is<00:05:11.120> very<00:05:11.449> very<00:05:11.870> close<00:05:12.229> to<00:05:12.530> it

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
is very very close to it

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.310 
is very very close to it
I<00:05:12.889> actually<00:05:13.610> there's<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.360> hinge<00:05:14.690> back<00:05:15.080> down

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
I actually there's a hinge back down

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.879 
I actually there's a hinge back down
there

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
there

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.219 
there
and<00:05:16.220> I<00:05:16.669> actually<00:05:16.820> had<00:05:17.270> to<00:05:17.300> take<00:05:17.630> off<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.990> hinge

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
and I actually had to take off the hinge

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.600 
and I actually had to take off the hinge
now<00:05:18.530> it's<00:05:18.650> pretty<00:05:18.800> easy<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.220> just<00:05:19.250> have<00:05:19.400> to

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
now it's pretty easy you just have to

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.969 
now it's pretty easy you just have to
pull<00:05:19.789> up<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:20.030> hinge<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:21.380> this<00:05:21.500> card<00:05:21.800> fits

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
pull up the hinge and this card fits

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.430 
pull up the hinge and this card fits
very<00:05:22.370> very<00:05:22.789> snug<00:05:23.150> so<00:05:23.810> I'm<00:05:23.870> going<00:05:24.139> to<00:05:24.169> go<00:05:24.320> and

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
very very snug so I'm going to go and

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.339 
very very snug so I'm going to go and
boot<00:05:24.680> up<00:05:24.710> my<00:05:24.800> computer<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:26.180> I'll<00:05:26.720> let<00:05:27.169> you

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
boot up my computer and I'll let you

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.120 
boot up my computer and I'll let you
hear<00:05:27.620> how<00:05:27.650> this<00:05:28.010> card<00:05:28.430> sounds<00:05:29.000> oh<00:05:29.770> my<00:05:30.770> stop

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
hear how this card sounds oh my stop

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:37.540 
hear how this card sounds oh my stop
cooler<00:05:31.520> is<00:05:31.610> very<00:05:31.849> loud<00:05:32.030> so<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.680> can<00:05:33.680> see<00:05:34.039> here

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.730 

this<00:05:38.150> sign<00:05:38.390> up<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:38.750> they<00:05:38.840> don't<00:05:38.870> wrap<00:05:39.470> up<00:05:39.620> the

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
this sign up so they don't wrap up the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
this sign up so they don't wrap up the
full<00:05:39.950> speed<00:05:41.290> and<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.890> haven't<00:05:43.430> really<00:05:43.610> noticed

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
full speed and I haven't really noticed

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.370 
full speed and I haven't really noticed
the<00:05:44.090> difference<00:05:44.390> between<00:05:44.540> the<00:05:44.750> fan<00:05:44.960> speed<00:05:45.230> of

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
the difference between the fan speed of

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.480 
the difference between the fan speed of
idle<00:05:46.090> or<00:05:47.090> when<00:05:47.780> using<00:05:48.200> 3d<00:05:48.560> applications<00:05:49.250> and

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
idle or when using 3d applications and

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.730 
idle or when using 3d applications and
games<00:05:49.700> but<00:05:50.090> it<00:05:50.900> seems<00:05:51.110> to<00:05:51.200> be<00:05:51.290> a<00:05:51.320> very<00:05:51.560> good

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
games but it seems to be a very good

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.520 
games but it seems to be a very good
card<00:05:52.780> so<00:05:53.780> let's<00:05:53.930> see<00:05:54.020> if<00:05:54.110> we<00:05:54.200> can<00:05:54.320> get<00:05:54.410> up<00:05:54.500> close

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
card so let's see if we can get up close

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.870 
card so let's see if we can get up close
in<00:05:54.920> the<00:05:54.950> fight
