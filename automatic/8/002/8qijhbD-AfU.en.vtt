00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
at last I mean I don't I don't this

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.969 
at last I mean I don't I don't this
year's<00:01:44.640> six<00:01:44.850> nations<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.509> shows<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.229> one

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
year's six nations it shows that one

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.910 
year's six nations it shows that one
game<00:01:47.720> doesn't<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.899> any<00:01:49.110> much<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.530> effect<00:01:49.799> on

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
game doesn't have any much of effect on

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620 
game doesn't have any much of effect on
the<00:01:50.070> next<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.640> look<00:01:50.970> at<00:01:51.090> though<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the next one because look at though the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.300 
the next one because look at though the
results<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.079> shifted<00:01:52.590> from<00:01:52.799> one<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.100> another

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
results have shifted from one to another

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.670 
results have shifted from one to another
what<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.210> important<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.780> momentum<00:01:55.049> shifts<00:01:55.560> in

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
what is important is momentum shifts in

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.069 
what is important is momentum shifts in
the<00:01:55.920> game<00:01:56.130> itself<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.719> know<00:01:57.810> obviously
