in<00:00:00.120> a<00:00:00.420> previous<00:00:00.750> video<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.500> showed<00:00:01.800> you<00:00:01.829> how<00:00:02.070> to

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
in a previous video I showed you how to

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.039 
in a previous video I showed you how to
build<00:00:02.220> this<00:00:02.550> little<00:00:02.850> gadget<00:00:03.060> which<00:00:03.840> can

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
build this little gadget which can

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.900 
build this little gadget which can
charge<00:00:04.290> your<00:00:04.500> phone<00:00:04.710> with<00:00:04.740> let's<00:00:05.370> say<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.609> car

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
charge your phone with let's say a car

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.350 
charge your phone with let's say a car
battery<00:00:06.089> or<00:00:06.509> solar<00:00:07.170> panels<00:00:07.710> or<00:00:08.150> basically<00:00:09.150> any

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
battery or solar panels or basically any

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.629

six<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:10.019> twenty<00:00:10.380> four<00:00:10.590> voltage<00:00:11.040> source

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
six to twenty four voltage source

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.060 
six to twenty four voltage source
but<00:00:12.179> back<00:00:12.540> then<00:00:12.570> one<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.290> my<00:00:13.440> buddies<00:00:13.769> had

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
but back then one of my buddies had

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.750 
but back then one of my buddies had
another<00:00:14.340> power<00:00:14.639> source<00:00:15.260> batteries<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.760> normal

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
another power source batteries a normal

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.810 
another power source batteries a normal
battery<00:00:18.000> has<00:00:18.539> 1.5<00:00:19.170> volts<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.920> when<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.609> put

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
battery has 1.5 volts and when you put

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.509 
battery has 1.5 volts and when you put
two<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.150> series<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:21.900> three<00:00:22.320> volts<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.830> 3

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
two in series you have three volts and 3

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.779 
two in series you have three volts and 3
in<00:00:23.640> series<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.300> 4.5<00:00:25.260> volts<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.609> this

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
in series you have 4.5 volts so in this

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.939 
in series you have 4.5 volts so in this
video<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.420> am<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.019> add<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> function<00:00:28.800> of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
video I am going to add the function of

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:45.830 
video I am going to add the function of
charging<00:00:29.640> my<00:00:29.789> phone<00:00:29.820> with<00:00:30.330> batteries

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.020 

there<00:00:46.840> exists<00:00:47.380> an<00:00:47.470> IC<00:00:47.860> which<00:00:48.280> looks<00:00:48.580> just<00:00:48.820> like

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
there exists an IC which looks just like

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.869 
there exists an IC which looks just like
my<00:00:49.270> lm2577<00:00:52.080> liske<00:00:53.080> Ematic<00:00:53.470> it<00:00:53.710> is<00:00:54.309> called<00:00:54.610> the

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
my lm2577 liske Ematic it is called the

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.310 
my lm2577 liske Ematic it is called the
lm2577<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.770> it<00:00:57.100> steps<00:00:57.400> up<00:00:57.580> voltages

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
lm2577 and it steps up voltages

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.290 
lm2577 and it steps up voltages
basically<00:00:59.320> just<00:00:59.530> what<00:00:59.739> we<00:00:59.950> need<00:01:00.100> but<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:00.910> fought

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
basically just what we need but I fought

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.240 
basically just what we need but I fought
creating<00:01:01.930> an<00:01:02.050> upper<00:01:02.260> big<00:01:02.470> circuit<00:01:02.920> in<00:01:03.070> this

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
creating an upper big circuit in this

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.880 
creating an upper big circuit in this
little<00:01:03.550> box<00:01:03.760> would<00:01:04.119> be<00:01:04.330> quite<00:01:04.629> difficult<00:01:04.869> so<00:01:05.860> I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
little box would be quite difficult so I

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.490 
little box would be quite difficult so I
searched<00:01:06.250> for<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.580> smaller<00:01:06.970> easier<00:01:07.900> solution

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
searched for a smaller easier solution

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.150 
searched for a smaller easier solution
and<00:01:08.680> I<00:01:09.369> found<00:01:09.640> one<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:11.200> specification

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
and I found one and the specification

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.790 
and I found one and the specification
says<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.910> it<00:01:13.060> starts<00:01:13.479> working<00:01:13.930> with<00:01:14.140> 2.5

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
says that it starts working with 2.5

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.700 
says that it starts working with 2.5
volts<00:01:15.280> so<00:01:15.850> two<00:01:16.330> batteries<00:01:16.840> in<00:01:17.050> serious<00:01:17.530> at

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
volts so two batteries in serious at

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.639 
volts so two batteries in serious at
least<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:18.820> it<00:01:18.940> is<00:01:19.119> and<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.960> looks<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.410> feels

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
least here it is and it looks and feels

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.130 
least here it is and it looks and feels
pretty<00:01:21.130> nice<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.640> solid<00:01:21.850> just<00:01:22.840> going<00:01:23.050> to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
pretty nice and solid just going to

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.740 
pretty nice and solid just going to
connect<00:01:23.440> my<00:01:23.530> positive<00:01:24.190> wire<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.820> in<00:01:25.030> plus<00:01:25.450> and

as<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.380> test<00:01:32.680> I<00:01:32.920> powered<00:01:33.340> my<00:01:33.550> newly<00:01:33.910> built

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
as a test I powered my newly built

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.080 
as a test I powered my newly built
Christmas<00:01:34.630> tree<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.710> works<00:01:35.950> fine<00:01:36.220> now<00:01:36.940> I'm

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
Christmas tree and it works fine now I'm

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.340 
Christmas tree and it works fine now I'm
gonna<00:01:37.300> try<00:01:37.539> my<00:01:37.780> phone<00:01:38.050> and<00:01:38.700> great<00:01:40.350> nothing

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
gonna try my phone and great nothing

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.060 
gonna try my phone and great nothing
happens<00:01:42.300> okay<00:01:43.300> get<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.080> told<00:01:44.800> you<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.039> my

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
happens okay get this I told you in my

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.609 
happens okay get this I told you in my
previous<00:01:45.160> video<00:01:45.970> our<00:01:46.330> shorter<00:01:46.840> two<00:01:46.930> data<00:01:47.200> pins

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
previous video our shorter two data pins

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.219 
previous video our shorter two data pins
well<00:01:48.340> I<00:01:48.580> used<00:01:48.940> my<00:01:49.149> multimeter<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:49.899> measure

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
well I used my multimeter and measure

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.710 
well I used my multimeter and measure
the<00:01:50.470> voltage<00:01:50.619> in<00:01:51.099> relation<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.640> ground<00:01:52.090> with

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
the voltage in relation to ground with

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.710 
the voltage in relation to ground with
all<00:01:52.959> pins<00:01:53.289> this<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.459> result<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.450> power

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
all pins this is the result the power

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.900 
all pins this is the result the power
pins<00:01:56.020> get<00:01:56.319> the<00:01:56.470> right<00:01:56.649> voltage<00:01:56.890> but<00:01:57.700> there's

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
pins get the right voltage but there's

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.779 
pins get the right voltage but there's
also<00:01:58.179> voltage<00:01:58.750> at<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.110> data<00:01:59.349> pins<00:01:59.800> and<00:02:00.069> some

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
also voltage at the data pins and some

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.880 
also voltage at the data pins and some
kinds<00:02:01.090> of<00:02:01.149> phones<00:02:01.450> like<00:02:01.899> let's<00:02:02.259> say<00:02:02.470> Apple

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
kinds of phones like let's say Apple

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.550 
kinds of phones like let's say Apple
phones<00:02:03.190> needs<00:02:03.970> voltage<00:02:04.509> levels<00:02:04.959> at<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.319> data

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
phones needs voltage levels at the data

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.309 
phones needs voltage levels at the data
pins<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.250> charge<00:02:06.580> because<00:02:07.479> Apple<00:02:07.959> likes<00:02:08.140> to

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
pins to charge because Apple likes to

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.559 
pins to charge because Apple likes to
make<00:02:08.470> everything<00:02:08.800> mysterious<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:09.970> special

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
make everything mysterious and special

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.720 
make everything mysterious and special
but<00:02:11.170> in<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.560> end<00:02:11.740> they<00:02:11.920> just<00:02:11.950> glue

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
but in the end they just glue

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.199 
but in the end they just glue
together<00:02:12.910> Abba<00:02:13.810> logic<00:02:14.290> but<00:02:15.130> maybe<00:02:15.580> this<00:02:15.849> even

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
together Abba logic but maybe this even

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.809 
together Abba logic but maybe this even
works<00:02:16.390> with<00:02:16.480> your<00:02:16.750> phone<00:02:17.020> all<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.349> know<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.430> it

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
works with your phone all I know is it

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.360 
works with your phone all I know is it
doesn't<00:02:19.300> work<00:02:19.450> with<00:02:19.599> mine<00:02:19.840> right<00:02:20.110> now<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
doesn't work with mine right now and the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.400 
doesn't work with mine right now and the
solution<00:02:21.849> for<00:02:21.880> me<00:02:22.150> here<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:22.720> short

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
solution for me here is to just short

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.680 
solution for me here is to just short
the<00:02:23.560> pins<00:02:23.770> again<00:02:23.950> then<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.030> phone<00:02:25.270> charts

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the pins again then the phone charts

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.990 
the pins again then the phone charts
like<00:02:25.930> always<00:02:26.380> move<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.280> out<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.730> way<00:02:27.970> I

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
like always move that out of the way I

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.020 
like always move that out of the way I
can<00:02:28.450> move<00:02:28.630> on<00:02:28.810> now<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.739> dissolve<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.580> USB

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
can move on now I dissolve the USB

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.839 
can move on now I dissolve the USB
sockets<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.630> opened<00:02:32.110> up<00:02:32.200> my<00:02:32.440> gadget<00:02:32.830> box<00:02:33.069> the

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
sockets and opened up my gadget box the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.900 
sockets and opened up my gadget box the
wiring<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.540> really<00:02:34.989> easy<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:36.010> input<00:02:36.400> -

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
wiring is really easy the input -

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.760 
wiring is really easy the input -
connects<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.569> negative<00:02:38.020> binding<00:02:38.470> post

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
connects to the negative binding post

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.369 
connects to the negative binding post
and<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.700> input<00:02:40.030> plus<00:02:40.300> connects<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.170> third

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
and the input plus connects to the third

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.800 
and the input plus connects to the third
position<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.129> stepping<00:02:42.400> switch<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
position of the stepping switch and the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.229 
position of the stepping switch and the
USB<00:02:44.080> socket<00:02:44.590> gets<00:02:44.800> wired<00:02:45.099> up<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.520> same<00:02:45.790> way<00:02:46.030> as

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
USB socket gets wired up the same way as

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.170 
USB socket gets wired up the same way as
the<00:02:46.510> old<00:02:46.540> one<00:02:46.930> but<00:02:47.709> not<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.160> data<00:02:48.370> pins<00:02:48.819> in<00:02:49.060> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
the old one but not the data pins in the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.540 
the old one but not the data pins in the
middle<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.629> just<00:02:50.260> shot<00:02:50.470> them<00:02:50.680> out<00:02:50.860> on<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.190> PCB

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
middle I just shot them out on the PCB

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.940 
middle I just shot them out on the PCB
saves<00:02:52.360> me<00:02:52.570> two<00:02:52.720> wires

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
saves me two wires

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.089 
saves me two wires
and<00:02:54.390> that's<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.630> just<00:02:56.380> gonna<00:02:56.590> put<00:02:56.800> everything
