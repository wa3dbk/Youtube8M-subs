00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.699
 the extra zone and two cds per coral 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.440
 the dallas cowboys and the two of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.760
 objectives will play for the first place of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.340
 the eastern division of the conference 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.230
 national this Sunday, October 20 in 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.230
 the lincoln financial field for the week 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.610
 seven of the nfl both teams are with 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.010
 mark three three after 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.810
 different beginnings however both 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
 They have left a very good impression on 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.550
 the last two weeks which should 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.629
 to stop at a great game 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.309
 dallas still has doubts about the 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.320
 participation of your marko broker 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.420
 maric who suffered a knee injury 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.949
 last week he tells me he's 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 doing everything possible to return 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.510
 but his status is questionable too 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.130
 must replace the absence of the linebacker 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 from marketwire who suffered a problem 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.719
 on his thigh and surprisingly he is 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.360
 listed as a last decision 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.399
 minute to face Philadelphia the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.290
 children will not have those who supposedly 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.329
 his starting quarterback there is with 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.910
 who tore his thigh two years ago 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.430
 weeks in place will start after the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.619
 substitute with the second worst defense 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.840
 total in the nfl the cowboys will have the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.700
 full hands this week as the figs 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.240
 they are the ninth offensive going through the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.579
 ball by air with 270 and 1.3 yards 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.130
 and the best running the ball with 178 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.259
 points 5 yards on the ground with the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.030
 possible absences of Mary and see the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.280
 responsibility for a possible victory 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.810
 of the cowboys will be exclusively the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.479
 shoulders of his tony field marshal 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.610
 I screw well with a 7 and 6 mark on 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.310
 career before the eagles looks for his third 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.509
 victory to the thread before where 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.009
 odds with the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.820
 children as three favorite points in the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.500
 spread and the total points are 55 in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.509
 the two games last year abbas 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.640
 scored 38 points in each of them 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.229
 although the children have covered the species 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 in four of the last five games 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.850
 against the cowboys taking into account the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.740
 Suitors statistics for each team 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.509
 We believe that the bet that we can 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.030
 benefit is more than 55 points 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.679
 total for the meeting thank you for 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.299

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.799
 I hope you enjoyed it soon

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.049
 best free picks in the industry and 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.750
 remember the luck does not lend and gives 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.989
 you only pay for that reform you ajax
