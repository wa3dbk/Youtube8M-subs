hello everyone and welcome to this

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.550 
hello everyone and welcome to this
week's<00:00:02.340> game<00:00:02.639> look<00:00:02.879> and<00:00:03.060> this<00:00:03.870> week<00:00:04.110> I've<00:00:04.319> been

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
week's game look and this week I've been

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.320 
week's game look and this week I've been
working<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.100> new<00:00:05.250> game<00:00:05.490> engine<00:00:05.940> for<00:00:05.970> my

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
working on the new game engine for my

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.930 
working on the new game engine for my
game<00:00:06.509> um<00:00:07.099> yeah<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.160> have<00:00:08.460> hopefully<00:00:08.639> already

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
game um yeah you have hopefully already

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.390 
game um yeah you have hopefully already
noticed<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.690> isn't<00:00:09.990> my<00:00:10.290> game<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:11.219> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
noticed that this isn't my game this is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.459 
noticed that this isn't my game this is
a<00:00:11.429> load<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.849> floating<00:00:12.240> cubes<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.870> I'm

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
a load of floating cubes and I'm

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.990 
a load of floating cubes and I'm
currently<00:00:13.889> using<00:00:14.009> them<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.519> test<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
currently using them to test the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.180 
currently using them to test the
rendering<00:00:15.480> speed<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.590> new<00:00:16.740> game<00:00:16.980> engine

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
rendering speed of the new game engine

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.410 
rendering speed of the new game engine
and<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:20.160> results<00:00:20.520> are<00:00:20.609> fairly<00:00:20.760> satisfactory

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
and the results are fairly satisfactory

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.460 
and the results are fairly satisfactory
I<00:00:21.750> think<00:00:22.140> I'm<00:00:22.680> currently<00:00:23.070> rendering<00:00:24.470> 35,000

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
I think I'm currently rendering 35,000

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.330 
I think I'm currently rendering 35,000
cubes<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.359> they're<00:00:27.359> rendering<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.019> about<00:00:28.340> 24

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
cubes and they're rendering at about 24

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.990 
cubes and they're rendering at about 24
25<00:00:29.970> frames<00:00:30.390> per<00:00:30.480> second<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.099> yeah<00:00:32.579> I'm<00:00:32.730> fairly

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
25 frames per second so yeah I'm fairly

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.209 
25 frames per second so yeah I'm fairly
happy<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.390> that

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
happy with that

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.620 
happy with that
I've<00:00:35.219> still<00:00:35.430> got<00:00:35.489> lots<00:00:35.700> more<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
I've still got lots more to do on the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.990 
I've still got lots more to do on the
game<00:00:36.780> engine<00:00:37.110> though<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.469> need<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.850> write<00:00:38.850> an

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
game engine though I need to write an

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.080 
game engine though I need to write an
obj<00:00:39.570> file<00:00:39.960> parser<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.520> load<00:00:41.760> in

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
obj file parser so that I can load in

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.220 
obj file parser so that I can load in
some<00:00:42.800> proper<00:00:43.800> meshes<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.640> rendered<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.270> also

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
some proper meshes to be rendered I also

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.750 
some proper meshes to be rendered I also
need<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.500> work<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> lighting<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.550> bit

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
need to work on the lighting a bit

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.100 
need to work on the lighting a bit
because<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.840> there's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
because as you can see there's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.500 
because as you can see there's
absolutely<00:00:49.260> no<00:00:49.800> lighting<00:00:50.059> whatsoever<00:00:51.059> at<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
absolutely no lighting whatsoever at the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.600 
absolutely no lighting whatsoever at the
moment<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.739> that's<00:00:52.920> something<00:00:53.160> I'll<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.399> doing

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
moment so that's something I'll be doing

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
moment so that's something I'll be doing
this<00:00:53.760> next<00:00:54.390> week<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:56.840> yeah<00:00:57.840> I'll<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.199> be

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
this next week and yeah I'll just be

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.889 
this next week and yeah I'll just be
working<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.890> try<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.520> connect<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.210> game

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
working to try and connect this game

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.470 
working to try and connect this game
engine<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.649> game<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.789> be

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
engine up to my game so that we can be

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.460 
engine up to my game so that we can be
working<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> game<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.970> were<00:01:06.090> before

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
working in the game as we were before

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.530 
working in the game as we were before
and<00:01:07.610> then<00:01:08.610> once<00:01:08.909> I've<00:01:09.060> done<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.420> think

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and then once I've done that I think

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.820 
and then once I've done that I think
I'll<00:01:09.810> probably<00:01:10.020> try<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.380> add<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> few<00:01:10.799> more

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
I'll probably try and add a few more

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.210 
I'll probably try and add a few more
things<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> game<00:01:11.520> engine<00:01:11.880> such<00:01:12.299> as

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
things to the game engine such as

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.100 
things to the game engine such as
texture<00:01:14.220> maps<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.850> support<00:01:15.390> for<00:01:15.509> texture<00:01:15.900> maps

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
texture maps or support for texture maps

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.100 
texture maps or support for texture maps
I<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:17.130> I'll<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.340> useful<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.450> batch

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
I think I'll be useful for the batch

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.440 
I think I'll be useful for the batch
rendering<00:01:20.360> also<00:01:21.979> multiple<00:01:22.979> light<00:01:23.189> sources

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
rendering also multiple light sources

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.760 
rendering also multiple light sources
would<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.720> good<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.619> things

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
would be good so that I can have things

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.420 
would be good so that I can have things
like<00:01:25.950> street<00:01:26.400> lamps<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.909> stuff

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
like street lamps and stuff

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.340 
like street lamps and stuff
and<00:01:29.000> I'm<00:01:29.180> sure<00:01:29.600> there's<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.900> lot<00:01:30.080> of<00:01:30.200> other

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
and I'm sure there's a lot of other

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.100 
and I'm sure there's a lot of other
stuff<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:30.950> will<00:01:31.430> think<00:01:31.730> of<00:01:32.000> no<00:01:32.360> mapping<00:01:32.960> as

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
stuff that I will think of no mapping as

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.390 
stuff that I will think of no mapping as
well<00:01:33.290> as<00:01:33.440> something<00:01:33.710> else<00:01:33.800> I'd<00:01:33.950> like<00:01:33.980> to<00:01:34.160> do

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
well as something else I'd like to do

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.850 
well as something else I'd like to do
specular<00:01:35.300> lighting<00:01:35.750> I<00:01:35.990> will<00:01:36.320> hopefully<00:01:36.500> do

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
specular lighting I will hopefully do

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.710 
specular lighting I will hopefully do
this<00:01:37.340> week<00:01:37.640> hopefully<00:01:37.940> when<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.300> work<00:01:38.480> on<00:01:38.660> the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
this week hopefully when I work on the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.320 
this week hopefully when I work on the
lighting<00:01:39.340> but<00:01:40.340> yeah<00:01:40.430> that's<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.730> load<00:01:40.910> load

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
lighting but yeah that's a load load

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.700 
lighting but yeah that's a load load
more<00:01:41.510> stuff<00:01:41.780> we<00:01:41.870> want<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.110> get<00:01:42.230> into<00:01:42.410> this<00:01:42.500> game

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
more stuff we want to get into this game

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.590 
more stuff we want to get into this game
engine<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.340> you'll<00:01:44.090> be<00:01:44.180> able<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.360> see<00:01:44.480> that

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
engine and you'll be able to see that

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.560 
engine and you'll be able to see that
over<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.900> next<00:01:44.960> few<00:01:45.410> weeks<00:01:46.000> but<00:01:47.000> for<00:01:47.300> this

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
over the next few weeks but for this

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.640 
over the next few weeks but for this
week<00:01:47.780> I<00:01:47.930> think<00:01:48.140> that's<00:01:48.290> pretty<00:01:48.470> much

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
week I think that's pretty much

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.430 
week I think that's pretty much
everything<00:01:49.720> if<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:50.840> want<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.050> follow<00:01:51.200> me<00:01:51.410> on
