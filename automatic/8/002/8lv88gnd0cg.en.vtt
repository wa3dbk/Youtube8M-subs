we<00:00:29.180> draw<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:29.419> analogy<00:00:29.689> between<00:00:29.990> the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.770 

and<00:00:49.180> he's<00:00:49.450> put<00:00:49.660> to<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.930> test<00:00:50.350> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and he's put to the test and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:04.060 
and he's put to the test and
unfortunately<00:00:52.780> he<00:00:53.050> doesn't<00:00:53.460> succeed

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.859 

it's<00:01:04.400> cut<00:01:04.640> there<00:01:04.820> for<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.059> bull-riding

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
it's cut there for the bull-riding

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.039 
it's cut there for the bull-riding
a<00:01:06.899> lot<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.890> similar<00:01:08.750> bruises<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.899> my<00:01:09.929> legs

a lot of it's similar bruises on my legs
and<00:01:10.530> I'll<00:01:12.740> just<00:01:13.740> watch<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.490> actions<00:01:14.969> over

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and I'll just watch the actions over

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.499 
and I'll just watch the actions over
there<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> same<00:01:16.289> is<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> harder<00:01:17.609> in

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and keep to fit off to the song so you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.779 
and keep to fit off to the song so you
just<00:01:27.060> relay<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.899> you<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.369> put<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.640> this

we<00:01:40.110> had<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.349> mount<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.679> long<00:01:40.799> piece<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.159> steel

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
we had to mount a long piece of steel

we had to mount a long piece of steel
that<00:01:41.549> was<00:01:41.640> hitting<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.090> engines<00:01:42.689> probably

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
that was hitting up engines probably

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.949 
that was hitting up engines probably

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
three to four hundred kilos so there's

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.620 
three to four hundred kilos so there's
the<00:01:46.079> frames<00:01:46.319> preacher<00:01:47.450> significant<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.539> be

the<00:02:05.610> chain<00:02:06.480> runs<00:02:08.070> bend<00:02:08.460> over<00:02:08.700> which

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the chain runs bend over which

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.220 
the chain runs bend over which
is<00:02:09.119> powered<00:02:09.390> by<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.539> little<00:02:09.810> electrical<00:02:10.170> model

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
is powered by a little electrical model

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.450 
is powered by a little electrical model
yeah<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.060> obviously<00:02:15.570> got<00:02:15.870> no<00:02:16.110> air<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:16.650> yeah

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
yeah it is obviously got no air so yeah

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:27.080 
yeah it is obviously got no air so yeah
that's<00:02:17.850> my<00:02:18.060> commercial<00:02:18.600> tomorrow<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.940> was

that's my commercial tomorrow it was

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.640 
that's my commercial tomorrow it was
quite<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.630> challenge

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
quite a challenge

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.850 
quite a challenge
none<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.700> stuff<00:02:29.850> we<00:02:30.240> could<00:02:30.540> rent

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
vertical and engine problems we were

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.460 
vertical and engine problems we were
lugging<00:02:35.100> around<00:02:35.340> for<00:02:35.730> Hunter<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.300> nice<00:02:36.510> big<00:02:36.989> v8

engine

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.080 

the<00:02:43.989> set<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.379> large<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.520> it's<00:02:45.819> realistic

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
the set is large and it's realistic

we<00:02:47.490> famous<00:02:47.790> huge<00:02:48.240> warehouses<00:02:48.750> testing

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.640 

I<00:03:03.620> thought<00:03:04.370> we<00:03:04.550> would<00:03:04.700> give<00:03:04.880> them<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.360> a

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
I thought we would give them a a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.320 
I thought we would give them a a
mechanical<00:03:06.650> bull

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
mechanical bull

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.449 
mechanical bull
and<00:03:08.480> then<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.959> go<00:03:09.140> as<00:03:09.260> Photoshop<00:03:09.830> an<00:03:10.010> engine

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
and then you go as Photoshop an engine

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.449 
and then you go as Photoshop an engine
on<00:03:10.550> us<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.230> was<00:03:12.290> quite<00:03:12.530> interesting<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:13.340> we

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
on us so it was quite interesting and we

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.790 
on us so it was quite interesting and we
did<00:03:13.700> nothing<00:03:13.959> haven't<00:03:14.959> actually<00:03:15.080> seen

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.220 

we<00:03:18.430> thought<00:03:18.580> your<00:03:18.730> faces<00:03:19.060> yeah<00:03:22.230> yeah

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
we thought your faces yeah yeah

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.470 
we thought your faces yeah yeah
definitely

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
definitely

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.180 
definitely

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
solo Connecticut Niles we went looking

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:39.860 
solo Connecticut Niles we went looking
for<00:03:30.580> an<00:03:31.060> awesome<00:03:31.270> demonstration

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.270 

probably<00:03:40.870> one<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.380> best<00:03:41.560> examples<00:03:42.190> of

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
probably one of the best examples of

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.170 
probably one of the best examples of
