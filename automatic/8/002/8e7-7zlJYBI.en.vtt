need a small amount okay and you take it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.799 
need a small amount okay and you take it
and<00:00:45.289> stick<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.390> shank<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> hook

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and stick it on to the shank of the hook

00:00:48.809 --> 00:01:10.830 
and stick it on to the shank of the hook
just<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.370> there<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:53.149> take<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> pellet

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.410 

there<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.649> go

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.120 

they've<00:01:15.080> you've<00:01:15.920> made<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.900> little<00:01:19.360> float<00:01:20.360> there

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
they've you've made a little float there

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.639 
they've you've made a little float there
and<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:24.159> this<00:01:25.159> bogey<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:26.259> it's<00:01:27.259> kind<00:01:27.560> of

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
and this this bogey is it's kind of

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.700 
and this this bogey is it's kind of
neutrally<00:01:28.130> buoyant<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:29.290> by<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.380> time<00:01:30.560> you

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
neutrally buoyant and by the time you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.529 
neutrally buoyant and by the time you
fix<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.190> hook<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.789> baits<00:01:32.000> on<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.420> they'll

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
fix the hook and the baits on it they'll

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.210 
fix the hook and the baits on it they'll
usually<00:01:33.729> Natalie<00:01:34.729> usually<00:01:35.090> kind<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:36.220> depend

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
usually Natalie usually kind of depend

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.100 
usually Natalie usually kind of depend
on<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.520> particles<00:01:37.970> float<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.390> hook<00:01:38.539> sinks

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
on the particles float the hook sinks

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.660 
on the particles float the hook sinks
it's<00:01:39.289> kind<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.530> neutrally<00:01:39.920> buoyant<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.430> oh

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
it's kind of neutrally buoyant so oh

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.719 
it's kind of neutrally buoyant so oh
this<00:01:41.570> will<00:01:41.799> usually<00:01:42.799> just<00:01:42.979> float<00:01:43.399> a<00:01:43.430> little

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
this will usually just float a little

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.940 
this will usually just float a little
bit<00:01:43.850> below<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.119> surface<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.560> can<00:01:45.649> use

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
bit below the surface and you can use

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.760 
bit below the surface and you can use
you<00:01:46.490> can<00:01:46.700> adjust<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.300> strike<00:01:47.990> indicator<00:01:48.619> if

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
you can adjust the strike indicator if

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.070 
you can adjust the strike indicator if
you<00:01:48.920> want<00:01:49.819> to<00:01:49.909> control<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.360> from<00:01:50.450> sinking<00:01:50.899> down

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
you want to control it from sinking down

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.630 
you want to control it from sinking down
too<00:01:51.350> far<00:01:51.590> at<00:01:52.520> any<00:01:52.729> rate<00:01:52.970> that's<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:54.640> really

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
too far at any rate that's a really

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.149 
too far at any rate that's a really
great<00:01:55.819> surface<00:01:56.270> rake<00:01:56.509> a<00:01:56.810> great<00:01:57.560> alternative

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
great surface rake a great alternative
