00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.260
 hi girls then new video always 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.150
 with chic pupa snow products 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.869
 this time we use as a basis a 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.970
 pencil matic stylus 004 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.099
 we have to put in the corner 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.510
 inside of the eye 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.240
 but then we also use another 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.500
 matitone that is 0 0 3 is always matic 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.259
 stylus that is beautiful wisteria color e 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.339
 we give it to put in the rest we say 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.250
 two thirds of eyelid now we take 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.400
 the pupa stick the zerouno e 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.119
 first use the yellow and then the 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.940
 wisteria color for yellow use a 

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:50.559
 small brush that is not too much 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.449
 small in short a thing has no way to 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.119
 half and I'm going to put it in the corner 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:59.949
 inside where I put the 

00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:01.600
 pencil 0 0 4 and then I go and put it 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.939
 also below even though I didn't put the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.979
 Pencil will still be beautiful 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:10.049
 brilliant maybe in a bit less 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.049
 compared to super never a desired effect 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.000
 now I take the lilac 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:21.969
 indeed the wisteria and I'm going to put it with 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.880
 a flat brush a little bigger is 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:27.729
 the pupa one and in fact I go to 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:34.390
 put on all the wisteria color in 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:36.520
 cream that I just applied I put 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.829
 even a little bit between yellow and di 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.929
 just close to create a color 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:45.609
 intermediate that does not make too much detachment 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:49.689
 now I take the palette from 0 0 3 e 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:51.850
 I use this mud color for 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.909
 apply it using a paintbrush 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.920
 pupa this is here to fade it 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.049
 I'm going to fade in the fold upwards 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.780
 towards the outside and even a little towards 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:07.980
 the inside is a nice shade 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.910
 ample, I have so much space 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:16.230
 now always with the palette 0 1 0 0 1 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.750
 I'm going to get the blue and apply it 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.650
 I always use a brush with bristles 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.070
 compact enough to fade it I go 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:31.080
 to put in the fold to the outside 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:33.420
 more than anything I concentrate I don't 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.750
 a shade too high I remain 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.060
 quite low because if I don't go above 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.050
 to the mud shade and it would cover everything 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.630
 this listened to me to give 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:51.030
 look deep and then throw it 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.560
 even a little bit inward 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.900
 from the outer corner just to always 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.550
 a question of depth of vision 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.710
 now with a brush to blend but 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.000
 with softer bristles I take the color 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.520
 clear that a very bright white e 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.790
 I go under the eyebrow arch a 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.130
 create light points precisely 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.740
 now always with the pencil 0 0 3 the 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.180
 wisteria matitone I'm going to apply it 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.180
 in the lower eyelid 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.540
 it fades a little cones with your finger and then 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.530
 I take a small pen brush with 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.239
 coli and pupa compact bristles and go to 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.040
 just apply the color eyeshadow 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:41.060
 wisteria and then in the outer corner 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.060
 I apply blue 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.060
 now I take a pencil to pop art 0 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.040
 0 4 what a beautiful violet I am going to put it 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.810
 in the inner lower rim of the eye 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.480
 now I could choose between two eyeliner 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.980
 the wisteria and the blue one 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.840
 I chose with the blues simply for the 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.269
 fact that what you say or about this 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.099
 kind of make up went a little bit to 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.099
 dying, that is to say, you see, was really noticed 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.200
 little so I chose blue that would have 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.900
 definitely enhanced make-up better 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.039
 up 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.910
 let's go atrocious our line of 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:25.470
 thinner eyeliner inwards a 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.470
 a little bit thicker towards the outside 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.180
 here is our tail 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.860
 and now we see the eyelashes a little 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:48.770
 mascara above and below in abundance 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.300
 after that resumed the liners again 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:56.530
 the wisteria color and the use as 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.400
 colored mascara to color the tips 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.520
 lower lashes 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.070
 so here he uses it to show a 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.870
 little good colors and shades 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.900
 etc 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.170
 and now blush the alca from ever since 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:16.160
 snow chic the number 203 which is a 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.870
 magnificent red should be dosed this well 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.300
 here because otherwise you become heidi 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:26.480
 so you see a little bit on one finger 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.530
 little by little then massage well 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.690
 make the product adhere well to the 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.000
 your skin 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:39.110
 then make it conform to the case 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.200
 Now add lipstick to this case 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.940
 I use the number 0 0 2 which a bel 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.660
 fluo color cia on me really is 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.780
 fluo 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.210
 so I to remedy this color a 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.070
 a little too bright I only put it on 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.550
 center of the lips and then I remove it 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.570
 seasoned to make it a little more tenuous 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.590
 see with these eyes 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.590
 it would really be too much 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.080
 here here this is the finished make up 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.160
 now he has a little bit close to me 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.160
 see the whole thing a little better 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.330
 and I greet you 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.330
 a kiss and the next
