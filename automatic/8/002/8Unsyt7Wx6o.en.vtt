00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
coming out of the speaker so let's just

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.420 
coming out of the speaker so let's just
do<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:40.119> makes<00:01:40.810> me<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.920> I<00:01:41.950> want<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.220> get<00:01:42.400> a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
do this makes me so I want to get a

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.240 
do this makes me so I want to get a
holster<00:01:42.910> so<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.119> think<00:01:43.330> have<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.290> have<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.070> Vita

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
holster so I think have to have the Vita

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.490 
holster so I think have to have the Vita
sort<00:01:45.580> of<00:01:45.670> mounted<00:01:46.180> on<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.020> jewel<00:01:47.200> shop<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.470> I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
sort of mounted on the jewel shop and I

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.960 
sort of mounted on the jewel shop and I
think<00:01:47.680> if<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:47.920> was<00:01:48.310> an<00:01:48.400> option<00:01:48.550> for<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.910> third

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
think if that was an option for a third

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.420 
think if that was an option for a third
party<00:01:49.600> company<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.979> would<00:01:51.070> be<00:01:51.130> quite<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.340> nice

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
party company that would be quite a nice

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.430 
party company that would be quite a nice
idea<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:52.300> just<00:01:52.630> getting<00:01:52.750> started<00:01:53.140> on<00:01:53.229> Tomb

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
idea so just getting started on Tomb

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.390 
idea so just getting started on Tomb
Raider<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:55.540> you<00:01:55.660> can<00:01:55.780> see<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.170> menus<00:01:56.530> the
