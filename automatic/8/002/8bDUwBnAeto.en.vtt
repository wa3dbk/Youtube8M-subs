you<00:02:30.220> see<00:02:30.520> there's<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.420> problem<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.260> that

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
you see there's a problem and that

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.760 
you see there's a problem and that
problem<00:02:32.830> is<00:02:34.110> artificial<00:02:35.110> colors<00:02:35.500> actually

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
problem is artificial colors actually

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.839 
problem is artificial colors actually
will<00:02:36.310> occupy<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:38.110> receptor<00:02:38.800> sites<00:02:39.099> in<00:02:39.459> your
