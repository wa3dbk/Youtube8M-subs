00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.500
 Tell me, the state surpasses fuji abruzzo. 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.269
 here and today as you have seen by 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.940
 title I will talk a little about the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.449
 requirements that released the 1st 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.779
 four and how likely are the pc's going 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.850
 and many people asking me what 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.000
 I think that such a board what I think of 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.529
 such pcs will run br4 is not basically 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.510
 the uncle I think is that if you run bf3 you 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.360
 will probably run fine 4 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.690
 only with a few less frames 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.510
 the 15 fps of id difference maybe one 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.670
 little more a little less simply 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.820
 because the minimum and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.640
 recommended systems from both f-3 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.840
 how much of neighborhood four are alike in 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.489
 case of f 3 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.320
 they asked for a core tuna of 2.7 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.260
 regis now in neighborhood four are 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.430
 asking for 2.8 practically nothing 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.880
 difference 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.340
 the same looks for two of 2.4 and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.799
 4gb memory I think this is not much 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.010
 to nobody today most of them have 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.070
 at least 8 gb of ram on the pc and 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.860
 free disk space of 30 gb and now 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.540
 There was a doubt I do not know if 30 game 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.979
 will be against him are 100 should be 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.310
 because the baath 3 with teles and it has 34 gig 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.040
 if I'm not mistaken I think it will be well 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.439
 more than 30 gb with a 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.840
 of them and now in question of plates 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.650
 are asking for the same thing as the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.350
 f 3 1 8800 gt there at least in the case 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:49.140
 also specify a good 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.270
 old amd nhd 3870 our board is 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.460
 very old so now you agree 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.219
 with me that the minimum requirements are 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.040
 very similar ones already speaks to the conclusion that 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.899
 Shoot about that now let's go to the 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.090
 recommended and good in part of the system 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.670
 operating system recommend windows 8 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.209
 probably because of optimizations 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.170
 that direct x 11 will have on windows 8 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.890
 for you general x 11.1 and probably 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.980
 will have 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.720
 and an improvement in frames due to this 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.330
 So we need to see if it's worth it. 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.250
 is to swap operating system only by 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.180
 cause of these frames I'll probably go 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.790
 to exchange 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.760
 on the cpu part and eating a quad 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.980
 core of intel then six core amd i think 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.320
 that you do not even need to explain why 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.310
 the differences between the processors 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.959
 amd and intel 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.790
 obviously everybody already knows that in 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.459
 theo is stronger than he gave me is not for nothing 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.680
 that intel with a processor with 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.260
 four cores can beat a 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.080
 processor with eight cores time to 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.760
 structure is much better than 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.850
 It is not surprising that most of the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.880
 stars is to make the stream prefer 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.220
 intel because they behave is better with 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.410
 programs there also 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.290
 recommend quadcore for both intel 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.310
 will buy md since they do not specify 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.500
 to 8 gb of hd memory again this does not 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.140
 It must be news I say today is 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:19.320
 now on the graphics card part and 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.310
 recommend a 7870 or a gtx 660 with is 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.900
 the graphic memory of 3 gigabytes 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.450
 probably because of the textures that 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.690
 will be with a resolution evolutions 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.420
 heavy and will probably have more 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.299
 textures uploaded on maps 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.970
 while in b3 they recommended an aime 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:44.700
 of 69 50 or more gtx 560 and with this 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.680
 setup in neighborhood 3 you 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:54.150
 and could run from 60 to 80 frames per 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.190
 second in the resolution hd nina this 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.310
 middle than in the graphics settings 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.799
 mentioned in the medium a or good né 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.110
 and with the requirements very similar there I 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.549
 I come to the conclusion that in the neighborhood 4 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.640
 you can put the settings 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.890
 graphs according to your precise 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.320
 Do you have a bad pc? 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.930
 graphical settings in the new but will 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.750
 run the game and if you have a very pc 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.299
 very good top that you have space of 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.750
 leftovers in performance where you go 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.389
 to be able to put even more graphic 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.610
 more graphics between quotes né 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.710
 I say if you have a very good pc you 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.330
 will be able to put on ultra and feel 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.430
 quite a difference 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.620
 visually since in neighborhood 3 you do not 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.099
 have to see let's say so much 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.990
 difference between another and ohio for example 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.759
 I've seen a lot of people commenting that will 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.979
 stay despite the weight of nasa to 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.219
 rotating or else it will be much heavier 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.499
 and these people forget is to think that 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.930
 in a chart evolution let's say 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:57.449
 so it also exists from the 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:01.319
 optimization as more technology 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:04.590
 optimization will have the future is not good 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:07.979
 says so because heavier and yes things 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.189
 more efficient then optimization with 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.849
 sure is in this evolution but still good 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:16.889
 is the question 6050 stressing enough 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.469
 obviously I will say that not since 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:23.460
 any first person shooter 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:26.520
 the frames per second frame is very 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.249
 important and greatly affects performance 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.120
 that not only in the best 3 in 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:36.569
 any game cs code all a person 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.810
 running the game with a fluidity in frames 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:42.539
 you will certainly have more advantage to 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.210
 joão pessoa running at 60 frames per 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.669
 second mainly in buzz 3 where 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.430
 You've had about 100 frames 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.639
 besides, this is a lot but a lot 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.039
 even easier to control the bush and 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.110
 record your weapon so that's why 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.899
 you see a lot of players 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.629
 playing for at least a hundred 

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:06.479
 frames and that's what I'm even talking about 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:09.060
 you have a 60- resident monitor at 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:12.750
 resolution and see what difference it will 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.879
 to have me in the case that when I switched 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.680
 resolution to have more frames I felt 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:19.649
 a difference of night and day 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.020
 simply make it a thousand times easier 

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:23.969
 control the weapon's record and play 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.610
 seems much more fluid 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:29.610
 You sure have a monitor. 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.069
 of 60 reais you will not see without frames 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.259
 however you will feel a good deal 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:37.440
 Strange you feel the game is over 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.839
 and it's not just me that I speak and 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.710
 this tip is also different. 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:43.530
 other tips 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.080
 in the channel this tip is certainly a 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.060
 tip that will improve your performance 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.070
 inside the game so hopefully you guys 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.830
 have even enjoyed giving liquidity 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.810
 in the flowers to give that strength I will 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.420
 leave the playlist link that 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.370
 have all the tips of the channel because my 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.350
 Dad on facebook and follow me on twitter. 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:06.260
 follow on twitter to not lose any 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:06.260
 live stream and that until next time and I went
