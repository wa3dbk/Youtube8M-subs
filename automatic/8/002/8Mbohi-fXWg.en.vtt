 petty ltashka went to repay 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:06.899
 the most ridiculous opponent to arrest him 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:09.780
 that while he rides on him is absolutely not 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.850
 draws attention opponent aha i mean 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.740
 only go out into battle so soon 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.200
 the focus is that I will just light up immediately in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.360

 enemy ISU-152 began to bring in a harp 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.750
 beyond the hangar 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.090
 and ours still calmly 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.250
 rolls to its position only at the end 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.079
 the route through it finally starts 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.240

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.200
 it turns out and not very effective 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.270
 here the opponents decided to show their 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.429
 inconstancy resulting quickly 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.039
 lose interest in this kind of obvious and 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.190
 dangerous target with the exception of a pair of tanks 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.550
 or maybe they just lose out of 7 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.170
 because the red icon is so invisible 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.970
