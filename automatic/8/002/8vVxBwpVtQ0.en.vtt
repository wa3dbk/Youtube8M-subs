 against aik stockholm last two too 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.729
 here are the friendlies of duels 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.350
 both are always pretty exciting 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.380
 however, most fall or have 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.329
 united in many mostly the better 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.640
 end on his side 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.719
 23 victories are here four liverpooler 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.990
 win and seven draw 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:06.210
 to the scorers at liverpool so far 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.879
 daniel's storage with the 1 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.460
 0-winner for liverpool 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.670
 most successful and only scorer 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:19.910
 this is then at united danny way back 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:24.390
 and Robin van Persie both with each 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.400
 22 meet with liverpools luis suÃ¡rez 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.610
 yes locked for a long time I do not know 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.680
 what a war has i think 19 that has 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.160
 a court 19 weeks where he spent ten weeks 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.840
 if we're not sure and in 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.030
 defender quartet with one 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.490
 injury at united is the hospital 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.680
 then a little bit thick raphael 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.750
 injured hernandez injured 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.880
 jonny evans hurt no i hurt 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.010
 and darren fletcher are injured now 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.790
 everything is not so the performers 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.810
 or not always in the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.360
 center of the exhibition in the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.400
 table expressed after the second 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.490
 Currently , liverpool is second 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.800
 with 2 to 0 goals at six points 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:13.110
 united is because they are her fourth with 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.990
 a win and a tie 41 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.870
 difference plus three gates 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.360
 accordingly and four points yes like 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.090
 it looks 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.910
 I think it will be a close match again 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.710
 in most cases, there are not many in these games 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:37.470
 gates like a maximum of two pieces na 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:39.750
 yes and what does a maximum of 23 mean? 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.060
 actually the main result most 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.620
 so a 21 so I guess it will be a 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.250
 narrow result 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.200
 and this time I'm going to win a 1 0 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.880
 away team so the team of 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.880
 david moss
