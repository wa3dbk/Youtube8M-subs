00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.509
 of everything 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.889
 without a doubt one of the most games 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.930
 expected of the year by all 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.910
 fans of the genre of cars 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.410
 spa of the film 4 the new delivery of the 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.360
 veteran dangerous saga of the 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.160
 developer days that also reaches the 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.570
 first title of the franchise in giving the 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.570
 jump to the next generation consoles 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.470
 commenting first on the way 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.420
 campaign we tell you that this time 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.610
 we want to give greater prominence to this 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.770
 modality which has almost always played 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.540
 a purely testimonial role and even 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.540
 nonexistent in the eyes of faults 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.010
 in this sense the scenarios of the mode 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.930
 history will now be much bigger and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 open which will give great freedom 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.410
 of action being able to choose between 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.360
 several alternative ways to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.090
 flank the enemies or get up 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.430
 our objetive 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.710
 it will be possible to face a mission using 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.360
 different tactics as we wish to opt 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.220
 more for stealth or for an attack 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.229
 direct seeing that mention that 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.330
 practically all the elements of the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.190
 scenario will be destructible so 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.080
 If a wall hinders our way not 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.320
 we will have more to make us jump by 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.320
 the airs 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.750
 it will also be more important 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.220
 the use of vehicles which pilot 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.350
 we will do both on dry land to 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.300
 conform and air against tones by 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.010
 example with missions which we will have 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.280
 make an assault in the ocean 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.870
 using water vehicles although we have 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.090
 to clarify that the campaign will continue 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.830
 being designed for a single player without 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.460
 possibility of playing so 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.460
 cooperative 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.970
 now going on to comment 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.190
 the new possibilities of the mode 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.140
 online multiplayer will come loaded 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.149
 of many improvements confirming as of 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.340
 input the Xbox one and 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.160
 Playstation 4 will allow games of 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.870
 up to 64 simultaneous players equaling 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.640
 if in this way so far 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.210
 it was only possible in the versions 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.210
 of pc 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.170
 in addition the patrols in which 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.480
 divide the players of each side 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.610
 may be up to 5 players instead 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.770
 of 4 an option that had been very 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.720
 demanded by many users and that opens 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.720
 the doors to greater team play 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.500
 it's also another pretty element 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.450
 significant the fact that for 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.250
 first time in the saga the vehicles that 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.170
 pile more they will not have ammunition 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.850
 limited so they will be necessary 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.950
 replenish them before their 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.660
 projectiles are exhausted or otherwise 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.660
 they will be left without being able to shoot 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.970
 although without a doubt the novelty more 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.070
 important is the expected return of the 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.960
 comandante dealing for those who more 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.060
 you see familiar with the first 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.800
 deliveries of the wings of a player who 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.840
 will follow all the action of the field of 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.940
 battle from an aerial view and this 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.860
 way you can perform actions such as giving 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.140
 practical orders to the leaders of the 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.820
 different patrols deployed as a bird 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.130
 which indicates the position of the enemies 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.780
 throw from the air supplies and 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.370
 vehicles or even carry out 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.830
 devastating missile attacks 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.990
 tomahawk while being able to make use of 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.060
 all these skills will depend on the 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.920
 concrete flags of the map that our 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.340
 team has under its control in each 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.340
 instant 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.200
 but that's not all, since we have also 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.600
 to mention that not only could we play 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.700
 as commanders from pc ball console 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.560
 but also from a tablet something that 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.630
 implies that the commander is no longer 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.700
 be an infantryman like 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.280
 happened in battlefield if in fact not 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.320
 may die nor for a place of 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.570
 player so if we add the two 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.120
 commanders of each team the games 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.120
 online will actually be 66 players 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.810
 and before ending as expected 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.610
 the game will demonstrate high quality 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.590
 very realistic visual and very 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.600
 spectacular highlighting so much for a 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.760
 system of destruction in the scenarios 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.130
 absolutely amazing as for some 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.810
 characters endowed with animations and 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.510
 especially of some faces very 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.490
 detailed for it they will be flagged 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.560
 use of from spain 3 one version 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.630
 evolved from the graphic engine used in 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.670
 the previous battle film giving us is 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.070
 of an unprecedented level in games 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.780
 of the genre is truly 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.610
 impressive the scale they have now 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.380
 the land scenarios only in their 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.570
 extension but also in its height 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.250
 can happen in just a few seconds that 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.900
 fight in the tunnels of the metro to 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.210
 be doing it on the roof of a 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.610
 huge skyscraper which can even be 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.470
 be destroyed from its foundations something 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.330
 that will completely transform the field 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.840
 of battle during the course of the 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.840
 games 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.720
 in addition a mode has also been added 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.210
 spectator what will allow us to observe 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.200
 the games of other players 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.240
 controlling the camera at our whim 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.130
 in order to learn from them or create 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.930
 our own videos of the best 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.880
 moments of being also very 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.250
 oriented to this option towards the ies 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.530
 force is to say the electronic sports 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.510
 where a game can be commented 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.290
 as if it was a television broadcast 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.290
 it was 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.789
 battlefield 4 will hit the stores of 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.849
 the hand of electronics from 29 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:20.770
 October for xbox 360 platforms 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.900
 and playstation3 while the 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.849
 versions of xbox one and playstation 4 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.650
 will be released at the end of this same 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.910
 year coinciding with the departure to 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.910
 market of both consoles
