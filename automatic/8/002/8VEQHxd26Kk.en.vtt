that you have to move very fast also
remember<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.480> have<00:02:39.840> your<00:02:39.920> polish<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.069> already

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
remember to have your polish is already

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.460 
remember to have your polish is already
open<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.090> ready<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.540> go<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.110> you're<00:02:43.440> not

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
open and ready to go so that you're not

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.350 
open and ready to go so that you're not
wasting<00:02:43.769> any<00:02:44.130> time<00:02:44.220> when<00:02:44.550> doing<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.090> because

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
wasting any time when doing this because

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.120 
wasting any time when doing this because
the<00:02:45.630> Polish<00:02:45.959> dries<00:02:46.170> quite<00:02:46.590> quickly<00:02:48.739> also<00:02:49.739> of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the Polish dries quite quickly also of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.280 
the Polish dries quite quickly also of
yours<00:02:50.370> aren't<00:02:50.610> spreading<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.600> way<00:02:51.750> mine<00:02:52.049> are

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
yours aren't spreading the way mine are

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.340 
yours aren't spreading the way mine are
tap<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.950> glass<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.640> little<00:02:54.090> bit<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.480> they<00:02:55.080> tend

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
tap the glass a little bit and they tend

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.280 
tap the glass a little bit and they tend
to<00:02:55.410> spread<00:02:55.680> some<00:02:55.799> more<00:02:56.280> another<00:02:57.180> trick<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.840> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
to spread some more another trick is to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:13.600 
to spread some more another trick is to
use<00:02:58.380> bottled<00:02:59.160> water<00:02:59.780> not<00:03:00.780> tap<00:03:01.140> water<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:11.750> I

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
use bottled water not tap water and I

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.479 
use bottled water not tap water and I
try<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.640> do<00:03:14.959> enough<00:03:15.959> rings<00:03:16.290> but<00:03:16.680> not<00:03:16.860> too<00:03:17.190> many

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
try to do enough rings but not too many

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.090 
try to do enough rings but not too many
rings<00:03:17.790> because<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.269> don't<00:03:18.450> want<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.959> get<00:03:19.140> a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
rings because you don't want to get a

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.250 
rings because you don't want to get a
big<00:03:20.549> old<00:03:20.730> glob<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.299> paint<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> center<00:03:22.230> of

your bullseye because that will glob on

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
out that if you just twist like this

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.250 
out that if you just twist like this
comes<00:04:40.130> out<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.520> lot<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.660> paint<00:04:41.870> comes<00:04:42.080> off<00:04:42.200> a

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
comes out a lot the paint comes off a

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.190 
comes out a lot the paint comes off a
lot<00:04:42.650> easier<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.430> don't<00:04:43.460> have<00:04:43.700> to<00:04:43.880> move<00:04:44.780> your

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
lot easier you don't have to move your

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.100 
lot easier you don't have to move your
q-tip<00:04:45.440> around<00:04:45.889> a<00:04:45.979> bunch<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.340> then<00:04:49.930> there<00:04:50.930> it

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
q-tip around a bunch and then there it

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.050 
q-tip around a bunch and then there it
is<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:53.120> rainbow<00:04:53.590> nail<00:04:54.590> art<00:04:54.979> water<00:04:55.550> marbling

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
is the rainbow nail art water marbling

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.930 
is the rainbow nail art water marbling
and<00:04:56.270> for<00:04:57.260> me<00:04:57.440> this<00:04:57.800> one's<00:04:58.070> a<00:04:58.370> little<00:04:58.669> bit

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
and for me this one's a little bit

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.750 
and for me this one's a little bit
easier<00:04:59.090> than<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.200> fancy<00:05:00.740> like<00:05:01.100> designs<00:05:01.550> are

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
easier than the fancy like designs are

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.640 
easier than the fancy like designs are
all<00:05:01.940> swirled<00:05:02.330> around<00:05:02.720> because<00:05:03.080> it's<00:05:03.289> just<00:05:03.380> the

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
all swirled around because it's just the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.850 
all swirled around because it's just the
lines<00:05:03.889> and<00:05:04.810> it's<00:05:05.810> kind<00:05:05.990> of<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.169> good<00:05:06.350> starter

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
lines and it's kind of a good starter

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.800 
lines and it's kind of a good starter
for<00:05:07.039> water<00:05:07.250> marbling<00:05:07.789> if<00:05:08.000> you<00:05:08.450> haven't<00:05:08.600> done

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
for water marbling if you haven't done

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.550 
for water marbling if you haven't done
it<00:05:08.870> before<00:05:09.080> just<00:05:09.979> remember<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:11.350> you<00:05:12.350> know<00:05:12.470> to

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
it before just remember to you know to

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.350 
it before just remember to you know to
tape<00:05:12.950> up<00:05:13.070> your<00:05:13.100> nails<00:05:13.430> because<00:05:13.970> that's<00:05:14.120> very

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
tape up your nails because that's very

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
important and keeps the paint from being

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.120 
important and keeps the paint from being
stuck<00:05:18.139> all<00:05:18.440> over<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:19.630> I<00:05:20.630> like<00:05:21.260> to<00:05:21.410> do<00:05:21.530> one<00:05:21.889> hand
