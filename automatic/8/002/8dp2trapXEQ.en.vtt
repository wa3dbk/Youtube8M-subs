00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
to that much which is probably not

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.750 
to that much which is probably not
enough<00:04:33.780> anyway<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:35.050> put<00:04:35.740> cold<00:04:36.040> water<00:04:36.130> in<00:04:36.430> here

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
to bring it up to about Gallup because

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.900

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
normally you would fill that part with

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.090 
normally you would fill that part with
ice<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:42.340> we<00:04:42.550> pretty<00:04:43.480> great<00:04:44.400> watch<00:04:45.400> this<00:04:47.100> nice

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
ice and we pretty great watch this nice

ice and we pretty great watch this nice
and<00:04:48.130> realistic<00:04:48.610> juice<00:04:50.430> so<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.520> way<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:51.910> would

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
and realistic juice so the way you would

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.780 
and realistic juice so the way you would
fill<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.240> up<00:04:52.390> with<00:04:52.510> ice<00:04:52.750> right<00:04:53.550> but<00:04:54.550> it's

still<00:04:54.850> pretty<00:04:55.390> warm<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:55.900> it's<00:04:56.080> going<00:04:56.169> to<00:04:56.230> melt

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
still pretty warm so it's going to melt
