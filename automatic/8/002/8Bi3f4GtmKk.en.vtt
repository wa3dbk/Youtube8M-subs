00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:05.370
 feed welcomes you tips 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.769
 device for cottages and houses 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.799
 I want to show you how I am doing 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.089
 diagnostics 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.490
 front hub bearing 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:18.670
 I know everything here tapered bearings and their 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:23.230
 need to view in time because 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:29.680
 I had a case of the whole person at the airport 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:33.429
 and I have this bearing stuck well, I 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.570
 just passed back like would roll it out 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:39.159
 at a speed of 40 kilometers I drove it 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.620
 then with the same speed back in 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.469
 city 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.039
 it's killometr probably I drove 30 well 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.079
 and while drove to the city everything came there in 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.390
 worthlessness but thank God that drove without 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.899
 lace well i mean in tow nobody 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.050
 pulling 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.239
 but I had to change everything there to find here 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.800
 I want to show it to you before 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.379
 wanted to show it see what 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.210
 I found you see 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.960
 always show me all these instruments 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.250
 I take away the box let him always rescues me 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.869
 all the tools here are even tweezers but I 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.990
 Now this screw seems to be visible to you so 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:29.430
 we are generally not recommended 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:33.159
 pull out because how would she then 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:38.920
 let the wheel down but I decided like this 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.909
 try in a simple way so kind 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.909
 would our plates 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:00.240
 he seems to be a little lucky i mean 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:04.390
 that's how broken you see ah 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.610
 harmful what 's so small 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.060
 a fragment that is, he did not get there 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.250
 but it is advisable not to pull out because 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.350
 we do not know and he has long been there for strength 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.150
 right hat worn off dollars that is 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.150
 better to do it at tire 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.370
 Well, this is how it is and how small 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.570
 retreat 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.540
 because I accidentally saw it and now 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.450
 do we need to make a diagnosis but for the beginning 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:42.120
 you need to jack the car first 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:47.110
 Yes, I refused the regular jack 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.600
 because there are these jacks 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.870
 holders where the jack is inserted because 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:58.989
 they disappear during revol 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:01.989
 none there as it is not itself corrosion 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.329
 defended anyway he disappears and goes 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.440
 out of action and so I decided to exchange here 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.220
 such opelevsky 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.340
 I had a jack opel it that with him 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.370
 there is only a jack but this is good 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.920
 legs before you need before raising 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.310
 you need to always put the bosses under 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.450
 I express the wheels to you. 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.609
 urban well and constantly drive here with 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.359
 myself but for now just put on 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:37.079
 speed and then roam there 2 so 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:40.079
 insert you need to put this thing and 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.079
 start off 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:04:07.900
 so not to miss see here 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:11.319
 the ground and here it is this board does not give 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.299
 jacking down they are heavy it 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.970
 the space does not take the trunk then I 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.209
 there is always a place for it 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.960
 on the road will help out so here's what 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.930
 advice on the jack and so look wheel 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:31.300
 the wheel rotates 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:35.199
 it can be seen yes now we go here as 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.770
 books write special 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:42.449
 pullers 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.449
 but I always deal it so 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:29.470
 and took off 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.030
 We look lubrication is still normal here 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.410
 the mask is also normal 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:38.290
 and how to check the play here I watched 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.630
 herbalist and he is there a fixture 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.260
 showed here it is from the beretta disk so 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.270
 cuts the weld arm to it removes 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.840
 wheel to sentence this thing and for 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:53.710
 lever shakes i just take the wheel here 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:57.490
 let's say for the bottom of the wheel and for 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:02.410
 the door of the forest like this 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:06.550
 and shake here you hear even hear 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:14.020
 little lungs eat that enough 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:21.310
 to lustig need to remove the nut 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:24.070
 unscrew by soldering to adjust the hatch 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.900
 then feed her according to the rules 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.340
 need a nut new buyer 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.500
 but I manage to make me an anode 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.930
 ok zakir nil 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.810
 if like and of course a dead nut 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:41.020
 replace and everything is fine everything is fine and 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:44.500
 so the virginity of the wheel is done rather 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.740
 front wheel bearing 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:51.690
 that is, if lubrication is bad lubrication 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.020
 replace it need to follow 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:07:01.860
 necessarily 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:04.080
 It was not like I often check on 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.140
 about the stripper, I have already become a cap 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:11.330
 easy out did not try new but so i 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:14.400
 take it off so that's it 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:18.320
 people do wheel diagnostics 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.970
 front hub bearing 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:25.440
 well and here from you as always 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:28.230
