00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.960
 the fish route of cape hatteras Wednesday the exhibition is reinforced 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.570
 your new visual look 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.289
 will be 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.289
 because 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.899
 with a touch of humor that he was accustomed to the speed of formula 1 

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:22.039
 when he decided to pilot the design of an air-powered car 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.449
 the engineer to achieve investments he plans to set up a structure for 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.449
 to develop compressed air motor in southern France 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.739
 to 15 years 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.230
 after a long period of time, at the discretion of those titles, we 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.320
 very difficult period against him we have a small society and we had a 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.260
 very very difficult period the suspect and that was fruit of justice 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.180
 the upturn came along with rising oil prices 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.100
 which made investments in alternative energy more attractive and that is how 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.340
 has virtually fire mission of the cruise 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.890
 the attention under the car floor if the driver of the astra sedan 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.200
 three seats you should choose between three passengers are 25 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.890
 power 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.540
 valdomiro de souza is one of the pilots of the base been forced real need 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.280
 of having an approved compressor proof the actor the car finishes new of the also in the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.350
 design all one of them is the steering wheel not the guidelines as the cases by pt 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.040
 but sheyla 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.910
 so the driver's legs were stuck here between the ropes to 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.830
 reach the pedals 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.729
 bringing the driver forward the car can get shorter 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.880
 but it's ve up to the beach leftover space the landing is a big club 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.489
 the car will weigh 363 kilos this would give at most 150 kilometers per hour 

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:51.829
 the worst was the 3-1 defeat and we can make a stronger test 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.609
 of 100 medley 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.569
 but we want to make cars that are lighter require less power we look for 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.569
 today they are very heavy and they use too much energy to move because 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:08.140
 pollution causes 7 and mexico with four models thought by the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.420
 inventor go from the taxi to the collective transport the new engine developed by 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.890
 it is that soon the user or traditional fuel 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.700
 while running on gasoline with ethanol refueling tank Ark 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.889
 besides neglecting the engineer can drive the prototype that never failed to 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.389
 part of the industrial park 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.979
 the author still for the increase in rhythm different from the conventional ones 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.969
 proved that it can work and already has the rights guaranteed by India 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.169
 bought by the same group because it has just launched the world's cheapest car 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:49.559
 the ore that will cost just over four thousand reais the launch of the nano 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:53.789
 not only because of the price of the car, 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:58.469
 complying with the rules of carbon dioxide 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:04.159
 overwhelming pulls polluted harvey Indian cities and how much more cars on the streets 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.589
 traffic was worse and the more congestion the 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:13.359
 an environmental NGO in India the more police the cars get longer 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.039
 connected to travel the same distance 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:17.219
 if it depends on him 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.609
 it is inevitable that the cars can issue for 2 to 0 we were processed 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.059
 much less than conventional motors 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.219
 the hybrid version 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:27.829
 he now has 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.399
 the 150 million reais invested by the Indians 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:32.309
 if approved the project
