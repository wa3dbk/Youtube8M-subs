00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.580
 acquisition of analog inputs is one of the most commonly used functions of the 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.200
 accident and 6-0 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.730
 usd 6 mi 9 has eight analog inputs that you can use 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.269
 criticized the finals 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.229
 the total sampling rate of the device is 48,000 lunches per 

00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:19.689
 second then if you were to get more with eight channels 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.380
 you could get up to six thousand walruses per second 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.810
 by carnival 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.140
 so let's set up our acquisition for the channel with 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.899
 milan was shown per second 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.079
 but first I would like to present a radio that we have here 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.910
 this is the device the ecdc 6009 and we have a potentially connected to it 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.560
 we will use the 5 volt output of the 6dec 9d ecd to limit the potential 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.740
 increase 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.870
 in its output will be an analog signal that we want 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.650
 We still want it on channel zero. 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.560
 in the positive terminal 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.600
 of the potential subway comes a land sign 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.180
 where it is connected to a terminal gmd of the module this for reference of 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.270
 out of 5 module fatalities 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 Now what we're going to do is use the side and saw 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.729
 kleber saw is a graphical programming language that allows 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.720
 set up data acquisition quickly 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.920
 at the same time what is extremely flexible and powerful 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.620
 you can download the evaluation version of the lip for 30 days 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.070
 accessing www sites 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.570
 point on me point with / p clÃ©bio 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.120
 now I'm going to create a virtual instrument 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.200
 I heard 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.200
 and on our front panel with right click 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.610
 and insert 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.270
 a graph to display waveforms on the front panel 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.510
 so we choose the graph on the vane 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.660
 and sized to the desired size 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.960
 now let's give up 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.310
 defined to scale 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.210
 for example the potential increase being fed at the level of 5 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.429
 points 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.929
 therefore 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.689
 Let's have the 0 to 5 turn signal coming out of it. 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.359
 we will also select the option to scale a new one 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.909
 because we want to ensure that the scale does not change during the execution of the 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.379
 program 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.569
 now let's change nothing to the block diagram and here we see 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.719
 the terminal of our graph 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.049
 What will we do now 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.179
 is to configure our data acquisition 'by right-clicking 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.500
 and select the option moved in the invicta iol 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.999
 choose the drive from darque mx 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.789
 and then the armed assistant give the assistant 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.679
 and let's put it in the diagram 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:58.969
 now the assistant gives you that it will only take to open and co and we can 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.759
 configured data acquisition 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.759
 for example let's get these signals 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.419
 by an analog stone 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:10.319
 measuring 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.769
 tension 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.449
 and let's choose the zero channel 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.579
 because it is in him that he is connected or potentially 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.619
 let's select movies 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.969
 and now we can specify other parameters 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:25.989
 our device 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.340
 has an east range plus ten in minus 10 points 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.739
 the next step is to select the type of measurement that is referenced through 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:36.819
 option 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.469
 LOL 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.469
 finally we will choose the option 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.549
 of acquisition 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.229
 Continue 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.189
 and we can also observe 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.189
 that the acquisition rate is of me or the 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.719
 click us on hockenheim 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.710
 and the work is going to build 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.330
 a function that makes data acquisition empty than our 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.169
 settings 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.289
 how do we select continuous motorcycle purchase 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.569
 we asked questions, we want to include a structure 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.319
 the acquisition function 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.919
 to ensure that the executive code continuously 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.840
 the answer is yes 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.500
 the work that places it within the luthero lopes automatically. 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.830
 now let's put the graph inside the loop 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.889
 so you can update or continually 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.490
 and now we're going online 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.529
 the output of the acquisition function 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.529
 entities to the chart 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.090
 we go back to the front panel 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.919
 to run the program 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.689
 at this point our data is being collected on the screen 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:00.550
 as years is something potentially and you will see it is by the way varying 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.650
 we created a program 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.419
 we get our sins 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.200
 and presented in a graph using light saw 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.510
 and the data acquisition device 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.260
 US $ 6 thousand and nine
