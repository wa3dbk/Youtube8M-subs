guys a quick review on the program
called<00:00:06.420> efflux<00:00:06.960> or<00:00:07.259> flux<00:00:07.560> I'm<00:00:08.280> also<00:00:08.429> going<00:00:08.580> to

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
called efflux or flux I'm also going to

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.040 
called efflux or flux I'm also going to
be<00:00:08.730> showing<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:09.059> how<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.450> works<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.900> i'll

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
be showing you how it works and i'll

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.499 
be showing you how it works and i'll
explain<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.679> what<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:10.980> does<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:12.090> flux<00:00:12.330> is

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
explain to you what it does so flux is

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.330 
explain to you what it does so flux is
basically<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:12.990> program<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.679> changes<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
basically a program that changes the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.000 
basically a program that changes the
light<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.299> your<00:00:15.360> computer's<00:00:15.990> display<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
light of your computer's display the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.529 
light of your computer's display the
plant<00:00:17.279> depending<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:17.970> time<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.210> day<00:00:18.330> it

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
plant depending on what time of day it

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.170 
plant depending on what time of day it
is<00:00:18.680> so<00:00:19.680> computer<00:00:20.039> monitors<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.699> designed<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
is so computer monitors are designed to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.670 
is so computer monitors are designed to
look<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.720> Sun<00:00:21.930> they<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.439> blue

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
look like the Sun they have that blue

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.929 
look like the Sun they have that blue

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.890 
a.m. in the morning you probably
shouldn't<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.310> looking<00:00:29.429> at<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> Sun<00:00:30.119> because

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900

comfortable sitting in front of the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.369 
comfortable sitting in front of the
computer<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.770> long<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.239> flux<00:00:39.660> it

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
computer that long but with flux it

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.280 
computer that long but with flux it
changes<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.550> makes<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.059> light<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.230> night

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
changes that it makes the light at night

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.569 
changes that it makes the light at night
it<00:00:44.250> makes<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> warmer<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.800> then<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.010> day<00:00:47.309> it

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it makes it warmer and then a day it

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.279 
it makes it warmer and then a day it
makes<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.239> look<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.840> unlike<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> normal

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
makes it look like this unlike a normal

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.709 
makes it look like this unlike a normal
it<00:00:49.680> does<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.700> warmer<00:00:51.120> rocker<00:00:51.329> light

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
it does and that warmer rocker light

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.319 
it does and that warmer rocker light
