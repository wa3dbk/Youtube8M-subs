hero arts black ink just created a

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.629 
hero arts black ink just created a
little<00:03:46.590> scene<00:03:46.859> there<00:03:47.069> and<00:03:47.280> then<00:03:47.400> I'm<00:03:47.489> going<00:03:47.609> to

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
little scene there and then I'm going to

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
was in our inspiration piece as well

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.839 
was in our inspiration piece as well
using<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.169> celery<00:03:52.590> ink<00:03:52.919> from<00:03:53.160> Avery<00:03:53.669> Elle<00:03:53.700> and

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
dot so I just kind of built some layers

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.129 
dot so I just kind of built some layers
behind<00:03:58.730> where<00:03:59.730> this<00:03:59.970> die-cut<00:04:00.299> is<00:04:00.780> going<00:04:01.019> to

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139

originally plan this but I was looking
at<00:05:17.159> this<00:05:17.280> and<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:17.520> thought<00:05:17.699> wouldn't<00:05:17.940> it<00:05:18.030> be

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
at this and I thought wouldn't it be

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.990 
at this and I thought wouldn't it be
cool<00:05:18.389> if<00:05:18.449> you<00:05:18.690> could<00:05:18.810> tuck<00:05:19.229> a<00:05:19.409> gift<00:05:19.740> card<00:05:20.069> into

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
cool if you could tuck a gift card into

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.820 
cool if you could tuck a gift card into
this<00:05:21.150> design<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:21.960> what<00:05:22.139> I'm<00:05:22.229> doing<00:05:22.259> is<00:05:22.680> I'm

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
this design so what I'm doing is I'm

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.279 
this design so what I'm doing is I'm
just<00:05:23.039> taking<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.699> craft<00:05:24.360> knife<00:05:24.599> and<00:05:24.930> cutting

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
just taking a craft knife and cutting

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.309 
just taking a craft knife and cutting
around<00:05:25.759> those<00:05:26.759> circles<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:27.479> I<00:05:27.539> stamped<00:05:28.110> so

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
around those circles that I stamped so

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:29.629 
around those circles that I stamped so
I'm<00:05:28.409> not<00:05:28.530> cutting<00:05:28.830> through<00:05:29.159> them<00:05:29.310> I'm<00:05:29.430> just

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
I'm not cutting through them I'm just

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.189 
I'm not cutting through them I'm just
cutting<00:05:29.819> around<00:05:30.030> them<00:05:30.479> so<00:05:30.509> that<00:05:30.690> you'll<00:05:30.930> still

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
cutting around them so that you'll still

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.709 
cutting around them so that you'll still
see<00:05:31.530> them<00:05:31.740> and<00:05:32.009> I<00:05:32.460> cut<00:05:32.729> that<00:05:32.880> opening<00:05:33.419> large

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
see them and I cut that opening large

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:35.719 
see them and I cut that opening large
enough<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.229> slide<00:05:34.530> a<00:05:34.560> gift<00:05:35.009> card<00:05:35.280> in<00:05:35.460> so<00:05:35.669> you

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
enough to slide a gift card in so you

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.689 
enough to slide a gift card in so you
can<00:05:35.940> actually<00:05:35.969> incorporate<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:37.349> gift<00:05:37.560> card

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
can actually incorporate the gift card

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.939 
can actually incorporate the gift card
onto<00:05:38.699> the<00:05:38.819> front<00:05:39.060> of<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.240> card<00:05:39.569> but<00:05:40.500> when<00:05:40.830> you

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
onto the front of the card but when you

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.890 
onto the front of the card but when you
take<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.340> out<00:05:41.430> you<00:05:41.490> still<00:05:41.969> have<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.300> card<00:05:42.539> kind

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
take it out you still have the card kind

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.320 
take it out you still have the card kind
of<00:05:43.020> all<00:05:43.169> in<00:05:43.380> one<00:05:43.560> piece<00:05:43.889> so<00:05:43.919> it<00:05:44.279> still<00:05:44.610> looks

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
of all in one piece so it still looks

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.230 
of all in one piece so it still looks
great<00:05:45.599> with<00:05:45.990> or<00:05:46.169> without<00:05:46.319> the<00:05:46.830> gift<00:05:47.069> card<00:05:47.240> now
