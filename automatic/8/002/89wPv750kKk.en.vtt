from the New Testament appeal to me very

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.280 
from the New Testament appeal to me very
much<00:02:14.090> when<00:02:15.050> Jesus<00:02:15.650> said<00:02:16.120> as<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.750> days<00:02:17.990> of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
much when Jesus said as in the days of

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.430 
much when Jesus said as in the days of
Noah<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.090> days<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.690> coming<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.319> the

Noah so in the days of the coming of the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.800 
Noah so in the days of the coming of the
Son<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.709> Man<00:02:22.040> I've<00:02:22.700> always<00:02:23.120> believed<00:02:23.480> he<00:02:23.690> was
