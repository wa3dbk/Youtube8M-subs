party so maybe I'll have this I also got
a<00:02:51.690> lens<00:02:52.200> solution<00:02:52.739> with<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.610> from

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
a lens solution with this it's from

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.160 
a lens solution with this it's from
Bausch<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.450> Lomb<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.519> that's<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.330> think<00:02:57.959> is

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
Bausch and Lomb so that's the I think is

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.010 
Bausch and Lomb so that's the I think is
the<00:02:58.410> basic<00:02:58.739> lens<00:02:58.920> solution<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.370> can

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
the basic lens solution you can

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.060
