00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.909
 simply to have a mind and like 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.129
 many situations of another victim of 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.559
 time to have the distance I did not feel 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.570
 affection body sensations and agonies but 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.460
 that now be death and I only remembered 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.920
 when he said he loved you and that the 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.710
 love that I felt day by day rose 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.689
 there is nothing left and nothing to fight 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.700
 lost the most difficult battle of 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.560
 face first and foremost my 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.689
 support has been your hard image the one that you 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.330
 understood and understood your messages a 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.159
 friend who was there to support you 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.320
 when you had problems always for 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.689
 advise you the people around me 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.460
 he listened to his moments were the purpose 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.430
 in facing deception studies and I 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.920
 I include in having it to accept and for what 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.930
 he felt it was easy to forgive 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.759
 if what I was doing was my false alarm 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.640
 my mind was located in that I 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.409
 hit the soul and limited to demonstrate 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.750
 what I felt I had not imagined 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.119
 that in you more I would lose that I 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.560
 would cheat that was never expected but it is 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.110
 that with your actions I was 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.180
 desperate you looked and told me that is 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.399
 thing of the past was not easy for me 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.500
 do everything for students the time 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.509
 He said everything about you I was moving away from 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.000
 feel weird with me you felt that they were 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.189
 changing and beginning to understand the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.990
 reality but -have I scratched leaves 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.660
 I'm not scratching again, I started thinking 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.130
 things differently but there are things 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.620
 I gave you that I never gave them to 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.930
 anyone and even want to return the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.580
 long ago I know that you can no longer just 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.620
 I have to accept sometimes 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.720
 we would discuss quickly, the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.750
 thought encouraged me to leg arts and the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.880
 I was trying to get closer a little more 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.190
 that you knew it was their only one that has 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.049
 of this part is that every action every 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.880
 second on it has stayed in the 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.850
 memory entered into oblivion 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.780
 decided I'll have to keep standing gender 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.520
 in thanks 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.470
 I thank you that you find are the 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.660
 last words what has happened in the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.480
 two I've made things clear this 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.970
 the last goodbye the last goodbye that comes out 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.340
 from me it's a farewell and not a 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.920
 point and apart for you I knew love you and 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.739
 also respect you when I failed you 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.840
 I knew how to apologize now he values it 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.600
 too late the most beautiful in the world 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.940
 it happened to you and that was left behind 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.830
 now nothing is left just sad 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.560
 memories that in my mind were left to 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.890
 closed when we love them together and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.870
 we swear to love us all our lives have passed 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.630
 the years I still do not forget that 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.340
 moon night when I made you mine but 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.980
 deceptions and betrayals of type we 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.260
 would like our god blessed something we 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.269
 would leave a fruit of love that we 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.430
 mark life despite that 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.110
 apart if you said that you cheat me this you 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.030
 I can forget we're going something in the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.610
 entrails that unites us and that always there 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.010
 there will be a blood bond that never 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.260
 forget 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.720
 maybe the farewell was better for the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.540
 two forgiven to be desired I leave it all 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.849
 to god be in last letter my last 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.500
 goodbye where I want to write what time 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.810
 all have not learned to forgive 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.540
 although it is not easy to forget the person 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.340
 to the fifth you love your other half the one who 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.470
 accompanied in good times and bad 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.629
 although it will not matter everything at your side 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.319
 I was always there and when I fought 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.840
 I thought another discussion fingers and will take 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.959
 and in a matter of days this will be fixed 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.790
 do not make that mistake, nothing will be fixed and 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.549
 if they reach an agreement of the mind and 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.390
 I understand when an alliance arrives 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.090
 trust turns into distrust 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.519
 problems and discussions increase day with 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.040
 day fight always move forward and you die 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.500
 joy in fixing what is ours no longer 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.020
 I have faith I do not know if you remember it when 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.640
 you had problems I never left you alone 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.830
 Change encourage you and give you my 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.200
 understanding you paid with betrayals and 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.660
 with a disappointment that you were never mine 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.669
 and that he never cared how much you 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.160
 I wanted what this guy I love you though 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.290
 you never loved me I do not keep you selfish and 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.419
 when you fall in love do not stop with what 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.520
 same as you did to me because you 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.520
 You are my misery My sorrow my suffer 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.390
 you are multicolored
