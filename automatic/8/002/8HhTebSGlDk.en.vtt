00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.389
 international media wonder about 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.200

 speech but sultan nazarbayev 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.109
 especially in its version in Kazakh 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.600
 language rather resembled farewell 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:25.439
 with his country with me the sultan of nazarbayev 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.480
 hulk hogan sorry for the augers then the people hoisted 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.699
 I have a lot to do 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.390

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.030
 a responsibility 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.040
 will become your throughout your 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.960
 speeches at the feast of the first president 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.020
 Nursultan Nazarbayev is very rare 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.250
 used the pronouns I and we are increasingly 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.440
 he said you 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.280
 appealing to the youth standing before him 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.469
 on the square 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.809
 but it turned out that he addressed at 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.460
 this to the whole nation was taken that way 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.920
 viewers of this cult literally 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.840
 this word show exactly this issue 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.660
 Leading international media have also asked 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.699

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.180
 attempts to blind the cult of personality from the living 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.159
 and bac and in all this festive husk 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 one question remained unanswered 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.260
 who will still be the second president 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.600
 Kazakhstan today is concerned about this issue 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.340
 so many foreign investors 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.680
 who have seriously invested oil 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.450
 global Kazakhstan deposits 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.400
 powers that care development

 situation in the territory between Russia and 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.170
 China and those who deal with issues

 supply the us armed forces 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.320
 in our interview to our 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.850
 tv channel 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.409
 Viktor Snoren carefully 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.670
 analyzed all possible 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.369
 candidates for the presidency 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.180
 Kazakhstan and made its forecast 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.920
 calling the name of the successor fil fine 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.780
 understand and reasonable people talk about 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.829
 successor of the republic of kazakhstan 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.590
 if you look at the current politicians in 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.229
 Kazakhstan and who could really 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.710
 pretend to be bad let's get to 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.200
 kazakhstan then sink saying them wrong 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.060
 and many meanwhile on the internet people 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.049
 seriously discuss the possibility of doing 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.049
 bets on successor 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.380
 the future generation seems to be complete 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.599
 seriousness will take a promise and 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.000
 bases and you have to work you 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.040
 you have to do science 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.040
