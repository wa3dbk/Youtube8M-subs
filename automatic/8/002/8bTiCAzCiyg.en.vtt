00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello with you smartphones and we have on the test 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.460
 i mini version of htc one model flagship 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.210
 htc one mini recognizable design 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.490
 high - quality display 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.170
 good iron plus many others 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.850
 lotions which should be paid 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.800
 attention is all here 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.199
 but whether they are sufficient for the price tags 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.529
 4000 hryvnia and try to figure out 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.810
 our review can not argue the flagship 2012 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.400
 years of study and went out for the glory of it that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.140
 manufacturer suffered major 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.120
 design elements to compact 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 version looks justified 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.960
 it kept the continuity 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.190
 recognition I really like 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
 combination of materials 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 light metal with white inserts 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.590
 plastic 1 gives the machine reliability 2 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.149
 provides long-term preservation 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.520
 initial appearance tube 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.770
 looks expensive as it actually costs 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 by the way material covering the display 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.399
 safety glass gorilla glass 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.680
 assembly performed on an exemplary 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.879
 indicative level 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.680
 basic controls are also 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.190
 moved the clan line from the eldest 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.010
 brother 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.479
 full one-handed control 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.880
 classes strongly and even the owners do not 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.430
 very large palms let's go around 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.439
 the case on the front of the 2 speakers 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.869
 there is a peephole near the top 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.869
 16 megapixel front camera and 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.000
 light sensors for 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.000
 the grid also sleep online indicator 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 located above the bottom of the company logo 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.250
 back button and google main screen 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.560
 or the application bar, depending on how you click 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.770
 on the back of the microphone 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.409
 flash main camera and promotional labels 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 the right lateral edge got separate 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.880
 volume control buttons 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.549
 and the left micro sim slot on the bottom 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.320
 just the microusb entrance on the top 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.470
 standard audio jack 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.579
 and the power button at the base of the 43 inch 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.460
 lcd 2 display resolution 720 matrix 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.400
 1280 points 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.480
 supported touch 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.540
 lines with two fingers 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.050
 at the same time good viewing angles 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.460
 horizontal and vertical turning 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.470
 screen behavior in the sun is decent 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.570
 information remains readable 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.090
 especially if the backlight is set to 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.920
 maximum brightness adjustable as 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.280
 manually and automatically 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.260
 the colors on the display are bright and juicy in general 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.890
 the manufacturer put the top five for this 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.810
 component 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.010
 the model is based on dual core 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.230
 snapdragon 400 at 1 and 4 gigahertz except 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.480
 Adreno 305 and 1 graphics here 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.280
 gigabyte ddr2 ram 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.230
 before you test results for 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.150
 device performance without 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.740
 problems loses go video and 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.590
 allows you to run most 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.750
 resource-intensive games which by the way go without 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.540
 restrictions on the detail of graphics 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.550
 total user memory 16 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.470
 gigabytes in reality after full 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.070
 reset only ten available 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.870
 by half 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.640
 I will not say that this is not enough however 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.709
 the manufacturer did the right thing 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.050
 released 8 gigabyte version of this 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.220
 tube oh es hey shell takes 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.260
 quite a lot of space 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.870
 although as an option one could add 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.310
 there is no slot for memory cards and 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.640
 test specimen 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.340
 however, the rashid repository can simply 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.080
 connecting usb flash drives wireless 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.000
 communications are possible through 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.550
 bluetooth 40 wi-fi 802 11b jen 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.590
 divisions and look for connect 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.860
 built-in gps and glonass receiver 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.390
 as well as digital compass htc one mini 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.750
 running operating 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.310
 android 4 2 2 system installed on top 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.370
 shell from the manufacturer 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.620
 this is the fifth generation about features 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.140
 sense 50 we talked in detail in the review 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.209
 van model above video review link 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.080
 this device 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.060
 the smartphone is equipped with two 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.670
 front stereo speakers 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.470
 they sound great as desired 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.750
 connect mode beats audio 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.250
 as for conversational dynamics by 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.590
 interlocutor at the maximum level 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.290
 the volume is well heard even on the streets 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.049
 Noisy place for this part of the manufacturer 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.790
 we put plus the built-in lithium capacity 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.560
 polymer battery per thousand 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.240
 eight hundred milliamp-hours with a stretch 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.430
 enough for one full day 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.520
 my hands bath was not used by 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.160
 full talk music chat online and 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.070
 constant mail checking sometimes games and 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.110
 watching a video of course there is a mode 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.240
 energy savings we get you 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.670
 restrict releasing the handset with 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.680
 multimedia orientation manufacturer 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.390
 apparently understands that the user will 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.320
 use it not only as 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.660
 dialers 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.390
 so the larger battery was 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.070
 would be very useful here what I was left with 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.610
 in the greatest delight so it is from 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.010
 cameras 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.360
 photo and video quality stayed the same 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.420
 older model van 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.400
 recall the matrix here at 4 megapixels but 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.710
 it is ultra pixel size 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.020
 only two micro pixels 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.390
 meter when taking pictures you can choose 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.270
 many preset plots or 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.210
 hdr mode there is a panoramic shot 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.220
 HD video recording available 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.840
 detailed embedded video 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.200
 applications we told in the review 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.780
 learn and one cost be kept by you 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.540
 not start 4 thousand hryvnia a lot or 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.850
 little for some much for others given 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.710
 premium sound is quite good 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.200
 performance and enclosures in metal 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.870
 very affordable, but of course 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.150
 There is something to complain about the camera and capacity 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.340
 battery but still i think that 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.450
 the decision to purchase the festival will not be 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.700
 taken on emotions 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.010
 I only have them 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.680
 positive and how do you like this model 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.090
 would you buy it yourself if you think that 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.070
 this price segment has more 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.200
 interesting tubes with similar equipment 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.210
 We will be glad to read your comments 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.070
 also do not forget to put like or 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.230
 dislike and of course subscribe
