00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi to all guys and welcome back 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.350
 finally in this new video today 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.630
 I'm here with the unboxing of the brand new 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.670
 ipod touch 6 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.670
 let's not waste time and start right away 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.710
 yes while i was on vacation apple ha 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.740
 surprisingly released the new line of 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.890
 ipod which includes the new ipod shuffle i 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.439
 new ipod nano but above all the new 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.119
 sixth generation ipod touch 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.400
 I must say that this product has me 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.040
 struck right away for more than one 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.559
 reason and so I decided to buy the 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.300
 16 gigabyte model to give it a 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.699
 possibility and today I have decided to 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.680
 share with you its unboxing like 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.229
 see here once this is removed 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.570
 protective plastic that covers the whole 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.400
 pack the actual box 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.960
 follows the old ones in perfect line 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.059
 generations of ipod touch 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.610
 in front there is a sticker of the product that 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.379
 shows it as if it were on and there 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.659
 also reveals a very important thing 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.760
 from here in fact we will be able to understand that the 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.299
 preinstalled ios version of 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.610
 factory is 8.4 which means support 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.890
 ad apple music out of the box hill that 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.080
 makes sense because in the end i ipod 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.850
 should have the main purpose of 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.640
 play music on both sides 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.700
 instead we find the inscription ipod touch e 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.110
 finally on the upper side we find the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.220
 classic apple logo that a moment but it is 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.990
 overturned 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.390
 yes apparently just the opposite 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.130
 we find the upside down apple logo 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.500
 however we proceed finally with the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.540
 remove the seal from the packaging that 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.060
 consists of this small tab 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.160
 orange wrapping the outside of the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.230
 box and finally there remains nothing else 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.360
 do that gently lift the 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.760
 cover 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.020
 here is the ipod touch in overlay but 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.030
 I would say that for the moment it can 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.100
 wait so let's put it aside and 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.290
 let's see what else lies behind 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.390
 this case with the design by design 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.640
 apple in california actually i was more 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.310
 ironic that serious because we all know 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.200
 that inside there is a small one 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.570
 manuals plus historical legendaries 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.989
 apple stickers then we find the cable 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.239
 usb lightning data to 9-pin and then 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.190
 legendary year pot headphones that you 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.349
 remember in the ipod packaging 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.730
 touch are not headsets then 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.260
 have neither the microphone in the 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.810
 volume buttons are 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.180
 very simple headphones marked of course 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.370
 apple year well but now let's put it 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.240
 away all these odds and ends we do 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.400
 enter the 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.200
 strong touch ipod touch of sixth 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.300
 generation as you see him taken into 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.270
 gold coloration and speaking of its own 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.240
 this the sixth generation comes in six 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.340
 different colors silver gray gold 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.010
 sidereal that is different from the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.070
 fifth generation pink black 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.570
 blue and red of paddock trend 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.370
 I must say that I was very tempted to 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.410
 take the blue as it attracts 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.300
 really a lot but it is also true that from 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.490
 years since the iPhone 5 came out is 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.860
 practically I wanted to try this 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.720
 cursed gold color is therefore for 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.910
 this time it went like this and I have to say 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.920
 that I did not even regret 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.840
 I must say that it is not bad at all but it has 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.940
 having said that we remove the film 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.950
 protective plastic and here it is 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.510
 the naked and raw ipod 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.060
 I would say that it is worth spending just 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.020
 a minute to watch them more closely 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.690
 first the first thing I noticed 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.540
 is that being the first device without 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.030
 the fingerprint sensor is silent about 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.280
 still the old home button and you can 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.560
 note that in the gold color the 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.360
 square in the middle of the circle and it too 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.340
 of a golden shade I know is a 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.560
 detail however ball is very eye catching 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.480
 and overall it is really beautiful 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.670
 otherwise it is aesthetically very 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.950
 similar if not practically the same as 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.290
 fifth generation is ahead with the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.660
 its 4-inch display and its 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.970
 facetime camera I think it is 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.640
 the only front capable of shooting 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.620
 the beauty of 10 photos per second is 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.110
 on the back side with the other 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.040
 8 megapixel capable camera and fight 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.770
 to shoot slow motion video at 120fps shots 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.240
 in sequence and time lapse video 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.910
 speed up the only difference with the 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.730
 fifth aesthetic generation and also between 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.100
 Functional quotation marks is that the is missing 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.900
 small hook for a wrist band 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.120
 in the previous model indeed 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.340
 in the lower right rear corner 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.260
 there was the possibility of attacking a 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.390
 i pod strap to be able to 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.950
 secure this on our wrist now 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.140
 possibility has been removed 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.880
 ok guys I'm turning it on for the 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.950
 first time and I'm really curious about 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.470
 try it out and see what 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.910
 point knows how to push this little guy not 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.740
 there is your other because this was it 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.630
 simply an unboxing 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.460

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.560
