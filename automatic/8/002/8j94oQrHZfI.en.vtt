think<00:00:28.840> teachers<00:00:29.769> are<00:00:30.160> afraid<00:00:31.060> of<00:00:31.090> poetry

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
think teachers are afraid of poetry

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.049 
think teachers are afraid of poetry
because<00:00:32.370> they<00:00:33.370> don't<00:00:33.580> have<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:33.940> experience

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
because they don't have the experience

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.930 
because they don't have the experience
themselves<00:00:34.660> of<00:00:35.230> enjoying<00:00:35.769> it<00:00:36.070> it<00:00:36.460> might<00:00:36.760> be

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
themselves of enjoying it it might be

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.400 
themselves of enjoying it it might be
something<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.360> they're<00:00:37.600> afraid<00:00:37.809> to<00:00:38.110> write

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
something that they're afraid to write

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.020 
something that they're afraid to write
because<00:00:38.950> they<00:00:39.129> feel<00:00:39.370> as<00:00:39.489> though<00:00:39.520> they<00:00:39.640> can't

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
because they feel as though they can't

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.180 
because they feel as though they can't
write<00:00:40.300> it<00:00:40.510> they<00:00:40.960> don't<00:00:41.200> enjoy<00:00:41.559> it<00:00:41.590> because<00:00:41.950> of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
write it they don't enjoy it because of

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.459 
write it they don't enjoy it because of
them<00:00:42.460> may<00:00:42.610> be<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.879> way<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.030> was<00:00:43.440> taught<00:00:44.440> to

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
them may be the way it was taught to

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.889 
them may be the way it was taught to
them<00:00:44.620> in<00:00:44.890> school<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:45.820> I<00:00:45.850> think<00:00:45.969> once<00:00:46.360> teachers

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
them in school so I think once teachers

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.279 
them in school so I think once teachers
get<00:00:47.320> familiar<00:00:47.860> with<00:00:48.480> poetry<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:49.780> start

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
get familiar with poetry and start

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.860 
get familiar with poetry and start
trying<00:00:50.649> some<00:00:50.949> things<00:00:50.980> out<00:00:51.370> for<00:00:51.579> themselves

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
trying some things out for themselves

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.180 
trying some things out for themselves
they'll<00:00:52.870> get<00:00:53.020> more<00:00:53.170> comfortable<00:00:53.410> with<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:54.010> and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
they'll get more comfortable with it and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.660 
they'll get more comfortable with it and
they'll<00:00:54.699> see<00:00:55.000> that<00:00:55.239> like<00:00:56.170> Lynn<00:00:56.410> said<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:57.460> can

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
they'll see that like Lynn said it can

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.580 
they'll see that like Lynn said it can
be<00:00:57.789> for<00:00:57.940> everybody<00:00:58.359> that<00:00:58.600> even<00:00:59.410> their

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
be for everybody that even their

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.950 
be for everybody that even their
struggling<00:01:00.219> kids<00:01:00.670> can<00:01:01.090> be<00:01:01.180> successful<00:01:01.809> with

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
struggling kids can be successful with

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.869 
struggling kids can be successful with
it<00:01:02.140> if<00:01:02.260> we<00:01:02.469> provide<00:01:02.859> the<00:01:03.070> right<00:01:03.250> scaffolds<00:01:03.820> for
