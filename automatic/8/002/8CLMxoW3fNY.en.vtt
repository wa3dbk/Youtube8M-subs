abandon the Oder 2004 platform not by
choice<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.560> feel<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:16.920> really<00:00:17.100> about<00:00:17.160> force<00:00:17.810> I'm

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
choice I feel but really about force I'm

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.120 
choice I feel but really about force I'm
aware<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> older<00:00:19.500> platform<00:00:19.650> can't

aware that the older platform can't
necessarily<00:00:20.310> accommodate<00:00:21.270> certain

characteristics<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.920> assuming<00:00:23.880> most

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
characteristics that I'm assuming most

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.599 
characteristics that I'm assuming most
developers<00:00:24.689> feel<00:00:25.140> should<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.160> able<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.519> be

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
developers feel should be able to be

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.310 
developers feel should be able to be
delivered<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> most<00:00:27.240> basic<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.869> packages

delivered to the most basic of packages

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.230 
delivered to the most basic of packages
but<00:00:29.099> that's<00:00:29.279> another<00:00:29.460> boring<00:00:29.730> story<00:00:30.060> for

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
but that's another boring story for

but that's another boring story for
another<00:00:30.330> day<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.660> topic<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:31.260> hand<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.560> this

package and the experience I've had with
it<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.570> far<00:00:33.809> I've<00:00:34.079> only<00:00:34.140> had<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.469> installed<00:00:34.649> for

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
a little bit most packages from UK 2000

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
a little bit most packages from UK 2000
seem<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.710> hit<00:00:37.860> harder<00:00:38.460> than<00:00:38.700> other<00:00:39.360> packages

the<00:00:42.270> worst<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.780> love<00:00:42.989> them<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> death<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.379> some

the worst I love them to death but some

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.229 
the worst I love them to death but some
packages<00:00:44.399> from<00:00:44.520> them<00:00:44.700> could<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> nightmare

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239

I'm<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.500> sure<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.980> with<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.489> package<00:00:47.730> it's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
I'm not sure if with this package it's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.729 
I'm not sure if with this package it's
just<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> high<00:00:48.390> quality<00:00:48.660> imagery<00:00:49.050> or<00:00:49.200> Airport
