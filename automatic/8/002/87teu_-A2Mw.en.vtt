00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:03.480
 Laux is a very big fish 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.700
 but fillet 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.180
 is not that difficult 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.460
 experience coarser pull with the fish as it is done 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.289
 as we first see her cut in the head in the tight 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.630
 after that 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.650
 lead the knife 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 along the back 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.449
 and jumped on the devices 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.449
 the entire page 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.650
 then maybe they'll raise that and have a better look at it 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.850
 section 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.300
 As you can see the blade will always come along and the backbone 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.300
 guided 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.930
 so they can solve the meat relatively easily 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.800
 the eighth victory is not necessarily fast 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.190
 rather, no Flash should be left behind on the kick that must 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.590
 be done thoroughly 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.880
 turn the ski boots 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 remove the anal fin 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
 and cut them back along the back 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.740
 Remove the upper Krepler on the back 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 they can pull off here now 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.070
 another hovers on the head 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.800
 solve the fillet in front 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.770
 Now they can turn the fish over again 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.220
 and have one with it 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.220
 whole 4 the view of the cut surfaces 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.380
 the knife under the devices inserted along the backbone 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 replaces the fillet in the rent 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.570
 and with a final cut that says' the second Philips of the bones 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.760
 exempt 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.040
 Thinking of course not throwing away is perfect 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.850
 but to prepare Zuken or for other fish dishes 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.699
 Now they are cleaning 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.159
 the Phillies too 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.719
 and on request you can too 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.439
 Remove the layer from the abdominal flap 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.439
 Do not put the entire construction flat market for it 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.429
 work threatened be with the knife 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.429
 And just removing the daily would be a pity about the meat 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.549
 same procedure with the second Philipp 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.539
 with a very flat cut 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.359
 you can get the fat and also the cartilage on the bottom side is easy 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.359
 remove 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.909
 to answer 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.329
 the Phillies have 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.189
 at the middle around where the backbone 3 along relatively many bones this 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:12.979
 need to use pliers 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.039
 can be seen here 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:17.779
 that works relatively quickly 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:19.999
 because the bones are very big 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.999
 you can easily grasp them 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.059
 swipe with your finger 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:31.059
 over the meat then they can feel the bones very well 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.909
 that they make sense that come in a row 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.529
 and can be easily removed 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.809
 You do not necessarily have to buy a Greten tongs 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:07.539
 normal tool pliers or a household renovation too high they consider 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:08.619
 just look for that 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.619
 cleaned well Â» 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.259
 after terminals 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.259
 Her two salmon fillets are ready 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.449
 Fish coarser 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.389
 Wish you a good appetite 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.620
 and enjoy cooking 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.289
 is fit by beautiful Laux
