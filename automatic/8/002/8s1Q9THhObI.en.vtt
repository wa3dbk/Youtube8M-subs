 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.880
 video dedicated to the last 15 teams a 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.980
 particular video because he doesn't want to 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.080
 be a real review 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.369
 because in any case we will not analyze in 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.220
 detail the player even if he 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.860
 we will talk in depth but he wants 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.259
 focus on a soccer player who has me 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.750
 really amazed we are talking about 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.210
 glik in its second version in form 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.140
 released in one of the last theme of the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.670
 week I bought 9900 credits counted 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.980
 which is discarded 9.882 therefore patiendi ci 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.079
 I would go to lose 20 credits and trust me 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.320
 you can get 9800 so anyway 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.079
 you do business with us what we immediately notice about 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.809
 i guess he has 55 speed and coming 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.089
 stema dottor weitz marco you know very well 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.749
 that's in a game where speed is 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.489
 all have a player like glik with 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.129
 55 speed when you are in front 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.590
 an aguero suffers a lot and I say that 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.220
 you may be right because it is not 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.960
 undeniable that he is one of the most defenders 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.930
 lenses of the series even though there is 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.440
 worse but amazed me now let's see 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.200
 how to use this glik that 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.450
 watch out for 86 in-game as a defender 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.020
 central always these statistics yes 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.180
 take from footed or twitter profile 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.040
 of air france 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.740
 I leave everything in Description more 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.090
 glik statistics that are 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.520
 interesting for a defender 96 of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.610
 physical strength then physical wins 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.300
 all he really physical moves 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.400
 anyone with 86 head accuracy 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.030
 so anyway, head knows how to take it 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.820
 one meter and ninety then hardly 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.410
 surmountable of medium low head of 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.180
 wordpress which is the only thing there 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.710
 need to have a defender like this because 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.350
 if he was a defender 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.200
 so slow with maybe a high wordpress 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.950
 you understand that we will have a lot more 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.530
 then struggles to 90 of you with standing 85 of 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.629
 slip 89 of marking 88 of 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.990
 interception 90 of aggressiveness 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.940
 so you understand that there is certainly a way 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.350
 player we can not say that how 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.440
 defense 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.610
 central is not very strong indeed on the ma is 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.920
 one of the strongest central defenders 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.540
 of the series up from the point of view 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.980
 defensive then people will surely go 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.870
 to deploy chiellini jokes for the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.400
 speed but trust blick is not bad 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.660
 what to do with this player number 1 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.180
 put it in a form in which it is located at 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.340
 his ease that can be or a 4 3 3 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.750
 that's fine in this case but we'll have to 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.730
 make small changes 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.340
 or as surely someone has us 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.710
 already thought central in a defense a 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.600
 five as central between the three or 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.370
 in a three-man defense as a man in the middle 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.050
 I don't like the three-man defense 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.940
 because this year seems to me enough 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.410
 easily attacked by all 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.110
 four between three etcetera, etc. 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.700
 but it's a great form if you know 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.560
 therefore, I cannot defend 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.140
 I 'd rather go to the 5 per defense 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.550
 tell you anyway what you can do if 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.590
 instead you want it to deploy at 4 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.040
 surely you put them a front one 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.690
 mediate a median that defends and that's it 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.300
 so that will not be the midfield you have 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.880
 need people back on defense 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.010
 in this case de rossi or I had made of 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.050
 usual or pirlo that despite not being 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.270
 however fast he is behind in defense because 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.370
 you need something not to allow 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.870
 the opposing team to attack you 1 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.820
 against 1 click 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.790
 because in that case in open field 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.170
 trust me, but nobody defends 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.270
 quite obvious because it is not 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.280
 so fast number 2 you have to 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.250
 absolutely put them next a 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.250
 very fast central defender can 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.100
 being chiellini can be mexes must 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.110
 be a defender with at least 70's 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.610
 speed in my opinion and not to say that 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.860
 you are a thought to use etc. and so on 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.290
 however, understand that maybe put yourself 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.850
 next to a pd there is a lex what happens 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.310
 which are both very slow 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.600
 you would really struggle to counteract the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.280
 opposing defenses in this case instead 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.610
 in a configuration with a defender 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.740
 slow is a fast defender could 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.230
 be amazed how right back what to do 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.820
 I put caceres in this case you if 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.920
 you don't want to spend on castres put 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.530
 anyway I know why because in that 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.420
 In case you have a full back we wo n't be in 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.340
 attack and lend a hand behind it then 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.620
 behind does not salt too much does not leave 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.540
 discovered glik does not leave them to manage 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.050
 too many meters from the field 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.430
 avoid taking counter-attacks then 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.500
 defenders we understand a little 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.600
 put the midfield equal what not 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.220
 you have to do with glik definitely not 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.650
 you have to go out in midfield then 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.140
 rather containing content containing 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.050
 it is rather seen that however it has a 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.640
 great placement because it looks like a 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.340
 right place at the right time not 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.680
 defend with glik defend with the 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.260
 full-back or the median or the other defender 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.920
 central left glik the task of 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.300
 follow the computer cuts but do it 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.340
 manage to compete that the task is not 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.520
 very badly to defend therefore not used 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.390
 him and especially if you use him 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.160
 be careful when you go to contrasts 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.440
 you have to fight only when you are 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.420
 one hundred percent secure to recover 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.160
 the ball anyway to do it 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.070
 rather because if you go to counter 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.920
 bad and greet you because you don't 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.960
 recover more however glik is not 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.790
 absolutely bad indeed I liked it 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.740
 very much I will let you pass now 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.090
 some team and I've already made them 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.730
 pass some stairs where you can be 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.350
 I really liked using it 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.970
 you know it's not a game anymore 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.560
 dedicated to slow defenders though 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.050
 trust me give a chance glik 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.560
 because it's absolutely worth it 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.690
 so we saw bligg tell me if 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.910
 you have had experience with some others 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.320
 defender is slow because glik is not 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.330
 the only slow defender of the game there 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.160
 are three less than the match pd informs us 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.410
 etcetera etc. of topics with whom you 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.600
 you found it good to say two 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.480
 not very fast defenders either 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.690
 slow vi you point godín sif is a nice sif 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.380
 two absurd walls therefore of not a few if 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.150
 think of it 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.150
 we will see each other soon
