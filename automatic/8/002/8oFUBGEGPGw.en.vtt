arm the whole hop opposing side has to

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.230 
arm the whole hop opposing side has to
work<00:01:59.050> in<00:01:59.200> stability<00:01:59.710> so<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.220> abdominals<00:02:01.000> work

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
work in stability so the abdominals work

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.080 
work in stability so the abdominals work
the<00:02:01.570> legs<00:02:01.900> work<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.710> grip<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.340> gonna<00:02:03.580> work<00:02:03.820> you
