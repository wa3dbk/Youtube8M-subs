00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
display of Merson in your window or

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.660 
display of Merson in your window or
something<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.830> that<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> said<00:01:02.220> I<00:01:02.460> don't

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
something like that and I said I don't

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
something like that and I said I don't
just<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.330> let's<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.170> something<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
just do that let's just do something a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.950 
just do that let's just do something a
bit<00:01:05.010> more<00:01:05.129> interesting<00:01:05.190> so<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.510> idea<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.930> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
bit more interesting so the idea was to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.370 
bit more interesting so the idea was to
actually<00:01:07.800> build<00:01:08.550> a<00:01:08.670> few<00:01:08.850> bikes<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.540> were<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
actually build a few bikes that were a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.710 
actually build a few bikes that were a
collaboration<00:01:11.009> between<00:01:11.190> myself<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.970> Mercian

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
collaboration between myself and Mercian

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.840 
collaboration between myself and Mercian
so<00:01:13.229> basically<00:01:13.590> once<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.160> this<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.580> would

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
so basically once we do this one would

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.670 
so basically once we do this one would
be<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.060> 2<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> whole<00:01:15.690> world<00:01:15.960> new<00:01:16.440> tune

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
be just 2 in the whole world new tune

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.020 
be just 2 in the whole world new tune
there<00:01:17.009> will<00:01:17.160> they<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.490> that's<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.940> be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
there will they go that's going to be

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.670 
there will they go that's going to be
all<00:01:18.119> right

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.069

a<00:01:30.200> frame<00:01:30.500> jig<00:01:30.799> here<00:01:31.070> at<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.280> shop<00:01:31.520> where

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
a frame jig here at the shop where

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.230 
a frame jig here at the shop where
customer<00:01:33.079> comes<00:01:33.409> in<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.670> sit<00:01:34.880> him<00:01:34.970> on<00:01:35.119> the

take all the measurements that's

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:46.810 
take all the measurements that's
required<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.600> build<00:01:38.780> that<00:01:38.990> frame

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.440 

like<00:01:47.180> still<00:01:47.420> down<00:01:47.659> on<00:01:47.979> Hana<00:01:48.979> she<00:01:49.250> send<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:50.270> down

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
like still down on Hana she send it down

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.950 
like still down on Hana she send it down
to<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.719> workshop<00:01:52.060> once<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.240> frame<00:01:53.570> Ward<00:01:53.840> has

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
to the workshop once the frame Ward has

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.460 
to the workshop once the frame Ward has
been<00:01:54.140> taken<00:01:54.939> we<00:01:55.939> then<00:01:56.270> process<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.259> frame

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
been taken we then process the frame

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.980 
been taken we then process the frame
order<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:57.920> see<00:01:58.130> what<00:01:58.789> tubing<00:01:59.360> is<00:01:59.479> required

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
order and see what tubing is required

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.490 
order and see what tubing is required
for<00:02:00.770> each<00:02:01.009> individual<00:02:02.000> frame<00:02:02.179> each<00:02:02.780> frame

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
for each individual frame each frame

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.319 
for each individual frame each frame
builders<00:02:03.860> got<00:02:04.070> his<00:02:04.189> own<00:02:04.340> particular<00:02:04.820> frame

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
builders got his own particular frame

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.690 
builders got his own particular frame
number<00:02:05.750> stamped<00:02:06.740> on<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.100> bottom<00:02:07.250> bracket

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.779 
number stamped on the bottom bracket
shell<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.509> we<00:02:08.630> can<00:02:08.810> recognize<00:02:08.989> who<00:02:09.830> has<00:02:10.130> built

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
shell so we can recognize who has built

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.330 
shell so we can recognize who has built
that<00:02:10.910> frame<00:02:11.360> for<00:02:11.569> that<00:02:11.599> customer<00:02:12.099> once<00:02:13.099> it

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
that frame for that customer once it

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.790 
that frame for that customer once it
gets<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.730> top<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.239> pile<00:02:14.530> one<00:02:15.530> frame
