00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
many reasons first of all many students

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.920 
many reasons first of all many students
like<00:00:33.399> the<00:00:33.579> idea<00:00:33.969> of<00:00:34.030> a<00:00:34.300> smaller<00:00:34.600> campus

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930

students<00:00:35.559> get<00:00:35.710> to<00:00:35.829> know<00:00:35.950> their<00:00:36.160> professors

students get to know their professors

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.000

but<00:00:37.510> more<00:00:37.660> importantly<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.380> professor's<00:00:38.829> get

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
but more importantly the professor's get

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.799 
but more importantly the professor's get
to<00:00:39.100> know<00:00:39.220> them<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.670> I<00:00:40.000> think<00:00:40.210> that's<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.510> real

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
to know them and I think that's a real

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.389 
to know them and I think that's a real
