00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.620 
Venus roll razor and what I love most
about<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.340> flexi<00:01:52.970> ball<00:01:53.119> because<00:01:53.479> it

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
about it is the flexi ball because it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.230 
about it is the flexi ball because it
moves<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:54.020> multiple<00:01:54.590> directions<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.430> that<00:01:56.060> is

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
moves in multiple directions and that is

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.899 
moves in multiple directions and that is
so<00:01:56.420> helpful<00:01:56.720> when<00:01:57.049> I'm<00:01:57.200> shaving<00:01:57.490> tricky<00:01:58.490> areas

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
so helpful when I'm shaving tricky areas

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.060 
so helpful when I'm shaving tricky areas
like<00:01:59.330> my<00:01:59.539> ankle<00:02:00.020> hairs<00:02:00.289> because<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:00.979> know

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
like my ankle hairs because you know

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.149

that<00:02:01.220> area<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:02.390> tricky<00:02:02.840> but<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.530> flexi

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
that area is so tricky but the flexi

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.859 
that area is so tricky but the flexi
ball<00:02:04.310> just<00:02:04.580> moves<00:02:04.789> in<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.030> perfect<00:02:05.390> direction

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
ball just moves in the perfect direction

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.419

where<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.080> need<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.619> move<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.220> just

as you can see over here the flexi ball

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.009
