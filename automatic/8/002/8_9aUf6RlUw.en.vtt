00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
hey YouTube okay so I'm driving my

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.460 
hey YouTube okay so I'm driving my
accord<00:00:05.220> right<00:00:05.430> now<00:00:05.609> it's<00:00:05.879> doing<00:00:06.810> okay<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.140> guess

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
accord right now it's doing okay I guess

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.820 
accord right now it's doing okay I guess
but<00:00:08.269> this<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> question<00:00:09.929> I'm<00:00:10.110> posing<00:00:10.139> right

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
but this is a question I'm posing right

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.919 
but this is a question I'm posing right
now<00:00:11.070> okay<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:11.940> I'm<00:00:12.179> gonna<00:00:12.269> pull<00:00:12.540> over<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
now okay so I'm gonna pull over to the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.509 
now okay so I'm gonna pull over to the
side<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.320> then<00:00:13.440> I'm<00:00:13.530> going<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> slow

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
side and then I'm going to do a slow

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.080 
side and then I'm going to do a slow
slow<00:00:15.089> acceleration<00:00:15.680> okay<00:00:16.680> now<00:00:17.520> watch<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
slow acceleration okay now watch the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.550 
slow acceleration okay now watch the
tachometer<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.779> listen<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> engine

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
tachometer and listen to the engine

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.220 
tachometer and listen to the engine
pitch<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.029> goes<00:00:21.180> out<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.449> first<00:00:21.720> gear<00:00:21.930> just

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
pitch so it goes out of first gear just

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.990 
pitch so it goes out of first gear just
fine<00:00:22.640> right<00:00:25.189> but<00:00:26.189> watch<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:26.640> happens<00:00:26.699> in

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
fine right but watch what happens in

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.029 
fine right but watch what happens in
second<00:00:27.359> gear<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.960> all<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.410> gears<00:00:28.650> above

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
second gear and and all the gears above

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.919 
second gear and and all the gears above
it<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.090> 20<00:00:30.330> miles<00:00:30.480> an<00:00:30.630> hour<00:00:30.689> than<00:00:30.900> watch

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it so I'm at 20 miles an hour than watch

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.620 
it so I'm at 20 miles an hour than watch
I<00:00:31.349> let<00:00:32.130> go<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> gas<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.210> drops<00:00:33.420> all<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
I let go of the gas and it drops all the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.049 
I let go of the gas and it drops all the
way<00:00:33.690> back<00:00:33.840> down<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.140> back<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.370> now<00:00:35.370> my

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
way back down and back up now my

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.930 
way back down and back up now my
kickdown<00:00:36.420> cable<00:00:37.160> let's<00:00:38.160> see<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.579> doesn't

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
kickdown cable let's see if it doesn't

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.600 
kickdown cable let's see if it doesn't
see<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> goes<00:00:39.300> up<00:00:39.450> into<00:00:39.660> first

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.960 

well<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.910> went<00:00:45.030> yeah<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.420> went<00:00:45.510> into<00:00:45.750> first<00:00:46.970> but

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
well it went yeah it went into first but

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.400 
well it went yeah it went into first but
you<00:00:48.060> see<00:00:48.270> how<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> tachometer<00:00:48.990> keeps

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you see how the tachometer keeps

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
you see how the tachometer keeps
dropping<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.010> coming<00:00:50.220> back<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:51.150> doesn't

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
dropping and coming back up that doesn't

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.780 
dropping and coming back up that doesn't
seem<00:00:51.840> right<00:00:51.900> it<00:00:52.380> just<00:00:52.770> doesn't<00:00:53.070> seem<00:00:53.280> normal

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
seem right it just doesn't seem normal

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.110 
seem right it just doesn't seem normal
and<00:00:54.830> last<00:00:55.830> night<00:00:56.100> when<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.310> did<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.580> test<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and last night when I did this test it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680 
and last night when I did this test it
didn't<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:58.970> like<00:00:59.970> it<00:01:00.120> took<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.330> minute<00:01:00.540> for

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
didn't do that like it took a minute for

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.869 
didn't do that like it took a minute for
it<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> downshift<00:01:01.080> but<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:02.280> I'm<00:01:02.370> gonna<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it to downshift but what I'm gonna do is

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.180 
it to downshift but what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:01:03.030> gonna<00:01:03.150> reset<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.750> computer<00:01:04.199> today<00:01:04.410> to

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
I'm gonna reset my computer today to

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.859 
I'm gonna reset my computer today to
factory<00:01:05.580> settings<00:01:05.790> everything<00:01:06.479> I'm<00:01:06.750> gonna

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
factory settings everything I'm gonna

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.450 
factory settings everything I'm gonna
disconnect<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.380> battery<00:01:07.650> cable<00:01:07.740> disconnect

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
disconnect the battery cable disconnect

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
disconnect the battery cable disconnect
the<00:01:08.550> backup<00:01:08.990> disconnect<00:01:09.990> everything<00:01:10.170> because

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the backup disconnect everything because

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
the backup disconnect everything because
it<00:01:11.070> seems<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.330> an<00:01:12.420> electrical

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it seems as if it's an electrical

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.390 
it seems as if it's an electrical
problem<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:13.800> it<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.070> actual

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
problem because if it was the actual

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.820 
problem because if it was the actual
torque<00:01:14.790> converter<00:01:15.149> then<00:01:15.899> I<00:01:15.930> wouldn't<00:01:16.440> not

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
torque converter then I wouldn't not

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.260 
torque converter then I wouldn't not
only<00:01:17.009> would<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.160> would<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.580> moving<00:01:17.910> forward

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
only would I would not be moving forward

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
only would I would not be moving forward
but<00:01:18.899> I<00:01:19.560> also<00:01:20.190> would<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:22.440> wouldn't<00:01:22.740> lock

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
but I also would not be it wouldn't lock

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.260 
but I also would not be it wouldn't lock
up<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.190> all<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.610> my<00:01:23.670> check<00:01:23.880> engine<00:01:24.149> light

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
up at all and my check engine light

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.020 
up at all and my check engine light
would<00:01:24.390> come<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.640> something

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
would come on so this is just something

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.420 
would come on so this is just something
that<00:01:27.060> I'm<00:01:27.300> planning<00:01:27.660> on<00:01:27.720> doing<00:01:27.780> today<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:29.160> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that I'm planning on doing today as you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
that I'm planning on doing today as you
can<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.060> still<00:01:30.360> low<00:01:30.660> on<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.080> down<00:01:31.470> on

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
can see it's still low on the down on

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.740 
can see it's still low on the down on
the<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.640> let<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> gas<00:01:33.300> it's<00:01:33.540> still

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the when I let go of the gas it's still

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.680 
the when I let go of the gas it's still
low<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.380> RPMs<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.970> doesn't<00:01:36.210> come<00:01:36.360> back<00:01:36.509> up

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
low the RPMs and it doesn't come back up

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.420 
low the RPMs and it doesn't come back up
to<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.020> actual<00:01:37.410> place<00:01:37.890> where<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.250> supposed

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
to the actual place where it's supposed

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.090 
to the actual place where it's supposed
to<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.170> posing<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.649> very<00:01:40.830> difficult

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
to so this is posing a very difficult

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.850 
to so this is posing a very difficult
question<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.750> transmission<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.530> going

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
question as if my transmission is going

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.310 
question as if my transmission is going
bad<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:45.110> if<00:01:47.510> you<00:01:48.510> know<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.869> need<00:01:49.080> to<00:01:49.229> get

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
bad or if you know I just need to get

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.289 
bad or if you know I just need to get
something<00:01:49.560> adjusted<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.970> don't<00:01:51.119> think

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
something adjusted because I don't think

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.960 
something adjusted because I don't think
it's<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.479> clutch<00:01:51.690> band<00:01:51.900> either<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.640> could

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
it's a clutch band either but it could

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's a clutch band either but it could
