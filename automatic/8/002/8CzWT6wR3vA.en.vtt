all<00:00:01.170> right<00:00:01.350> here's<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.650> mini<00:00:01.860> mill<00:00:02.070> all<00:00:02.310> set

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
all right here's the mini mill all set

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.539 
all right here's the mini mill all set
up<00:00:02.760> finally<00:00:03.270> with<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.600> x<00:00:03.810> y&amp;z<00:00:04.650> axis<00:00:05.160> is<00:00:05.370> all

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
up finally with the x y&amp;z axis is all

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.100 
up finally with the x y&amp;z axis is all
hooked<00:00:05.970> up<00:00:06.529> using<00:00:07.529> quick<00:00:07.890> connects<00:00:08.250> here<00:00:09.110> and

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
hooked up using quick connects here and

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.870 
hooked up using quick connects here and
then<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.590> have<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> main<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.250> switch<00:00:11.610> power

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
then we have a main on switch power

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.200 
then we have a main on switch power
supply<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.570> blip<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.320> Driver<00:00:14.280> board<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
supply on blip and Driver board on the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.779 
supply on blip and Driver board on the
right<00:00:16.010> you've<00:00:17.010> gotten<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.400> all<00:00:17.520> calibrated<00:00:19.789> to

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
right you've gotten it all calibrated to

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.390 
right you've gotten it all calibrated to
the<00:00:21.029> correct<00:00:21.390> amount<00:00:21.539> steps<00:00:22.289> per<00:00:22.650> inch<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.369> I

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the correct amount steps per inch and I

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
the correct amount steps per inch and I
have<00:00:23.580> some<00:00:23.820> practice<00:00:24.300> foam<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.990> there<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:27.560> we

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
have some practice foam on there and we

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.690 
have some practice foam on there and we
have<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:29.220> arm<00:00:29.519> here<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.390> holds<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
have a little arm here that holds the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
have a little arm here that holds the
LCD<00:00:32.700> monitor<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:34.520> what<00:00:35.520> I've<00:00:35.700> done<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:37.079> am

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
LCD monitor and what I've done is I am

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.060 
LCD monitor and what I've done is I am
going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.010> cut<00:00:38.719> out<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.050> foam<00:00:40.350> hopefully

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
going to cut out of this foam hopefully

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.450 
going to cut out of this foam hopefully
a<00:00:41.899> pocket<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.770> bearing<00:00:44.100> will<00:00:44.250> fit

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
a pocket that this bearing will fit

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.229 
a pocket that this bearing will fit
right<00:00:44.489> into<00:00:46.190> it<00:00:47.190> should<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.730> right<00:00:48.000> about

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
right into it should be right about

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.750 
right into it should be right about
exact<00:00:48.629> flush<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.829> diameter<00:00:50.160> should<00:00:50.550> be

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
exact flush and the diameter should be

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
exact flush and the diameter should be
exact<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:55.199> I'll<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.530> clamp<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> down

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
exact so and I'll just clamp it down

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.299 
exact so and I'll just clamp it down
with<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.520> hand<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.559> bearing<00:00:59.039> is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
with my hand I have this bearing is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.550 
with my hand I have this bearing is
point<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:01.460> roughly<00:01:03.170> 0.45<00:01:04.170> inches<00:01:04.769> thick<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
point for roughly 0.45 inches thick I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.179 
point for roughly 0.45 inches thick I
have<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.740> set<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.750> plunge<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.530> plunge<00:01:10.830> down

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
have it set to plunge to plunge down

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.910 
have it set to plunge to plunge down
into<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.700> material<00:01:12.229> 0.25<00:01:13.229> inches<00:01:13.680> at<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> time

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
into the material 0.25 inches at a time

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.039 
into the material 0.25 inches at a time
so<00:01:14.820> basically<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.720> make<00:01:15.869> that

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
so basically it's going to make that

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.530 
so basically it's going to make that
loop<00:01:16.350> twice

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.539 

the<00:01:21.540> first<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:22.080> it'll<00:01:22.320> cut<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.710> 0.25<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the first one it'll cut out 0.25 and

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.120 
the first one it'll cut out 0.25 and
then<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.780> next<00:01:25.110> cut<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.590> will<00:01:25.710> cut<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
then the next cut it will cut out the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.420 
then the next cut it will cut out the
balance<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.240> material<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.680> first<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.280> all

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
balance of the material so first of all

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.190 
balance of the material so first of all
we<00:01:29.700> want<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.590> zero<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.799> was<00:01:31.920> gonna<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:33.200> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
we want to zero I was gonna use that you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.590 
we want to zero I was gonna use that you
can<00:01:34.259> steal<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:36.649> zero<00:01:37.649> out<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> X<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.270> zero<00:01:39.539> out

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
can steal it zero out the X and zero out

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.899 
can steal it zero out the X and zero out
the<00:01:39.930> y<00:01:42.770> up<00:01:43.770> learn<00:01:44.009> reset<00:01:45.770> motors<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:47.009> zero

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the y up learn reset motors going zero

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:57.430 
the y up learn reset motors going zero
zero<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:49.920> we'll<00:01:50.159> jog<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.789> axis<00:01:51.330> down

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.940 

and<00:01:58.440> we'll<00:01:58.740> call<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.190> point<00:01:59.520> zero<00:02:00.950> looks

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and we'll call that point zero looks

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.550 
and we'll call that point zero looks
pretty<00:02:02.220> close<00:02:02.429> anyway<00:02:04.069> so<00:02:05.299> there<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:06.560> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
pretty close anyway so there we go and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.550 
pretty close anyway so there we go and
then<00:02:07.709> we'll<00:02:07.830> jog<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.250> back<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.410> get

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
then we'll jog it back up so I can get

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.030 
then we'll jog it back up so I can get
my<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.299> hold<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:13.049> to<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.319> with<00:02:13.530> my<00:02:13.680> hand

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
my so I can hold on to it with my hand

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.199 
my so I can hold on to it with my hand
and<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:15.720> need<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.959> turn<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.769> on<00:02:17.280> and

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
and we need to turn it on on on and

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.440 
and we need to turn it on on on and
spindle<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:22.459> all<00:02:23.459> right

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
spindle on all right

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.930 
spindle on all right
to<00:02:24.599> run<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> program<00:02:24.959> so

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
to run the program so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.809 
to run the program so
like<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.300> start

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:41.720 

hold<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.569> down<00:02:30.719> with<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.049> hand

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:03:29.490 

watching<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.720> up<00:02:42.989> there

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.140 

make<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.680> second<00:03:30.220> pass

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:04:28.860 

my<00:03:36.510> roll<00:03:36.750> back<00:03:36.959> out

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.770 

and<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.889> program

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.029 

right<00:04:33.780> where<00:04:33.930> we<00:04:34.020> started<00:04:34.379> there<00:04:34.590> at<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.830> very

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
right where we started there at the very

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.230 
right where we started there at the very
tip-top<00:04:36.560> so<00:04:37.560> what<00:04:38.430> we'll<00:04:38.580> go<00:04:38.759> ahead<00:04:38.849> and<00:04:39.000> do

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
tip-top so what we'll go ahead and do

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.050 
tip-top so what we'll go ahead and do
now<00:04:39.479> is<00:04:40.370> jog<00:04:41.370> that<00:04:41.639> access<00:04:42.210> out<00:04:42.419> of<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.659> way

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
now is jog that access out of the way

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.360 
now is jog that access out of the way
and<00:04:45.060> we'll<00:04:45.300> dump<00:04:45.569> this<00:04:45.780> out<00:04:45.990> in<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.379> foam<00:04:47.159> out

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
and we'll dump this out in the foam out

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.100 
and we'll dump this out in the foam out
in<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.610> trash<00:04:47.849> can<00:04:48.150> try<00:04:48.479> it<00:04:48.539> too<00:04:48.629> anyway

oh<00:04:55.159> look<00:04:56.159> at<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:56.569> the<00:04:57.569> whole<00:04:59.090> now<00:05:00.090> will

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
oh look at that the whole now will

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.029 
oh look at that the whole now will
determine<00:05:00.810> whether<00:05:01.110> or<00:05:01.229> not<00:05:01.409> this<00:05:01.650> bearing

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
determine whether or not this bearing

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:13.470 
determine whether or not this bearing
fits<00:05:02.310> in<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:02.550> hole<00:05:06.409> got<00:05:07.409> a<00:05:09.800> perfect<00:05:10.800> fit

testbed<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:20.130> I<00:05:21.130> actually<00:05:21.340> designed<00:05:21.880> that<00:05:22.210> in

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420

the<00:05:23.200> Wizards<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.950> you<00:05:24.010> can<00:05:24.130> pick<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.490> Wizards

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
the Wizards and you can pick the Wizards

depth<00:05:49.210> that's<00:05:49.570> what<00:05:49.720> we<00:05:49.780> had<00:05:49.900> 7.25<00:05:50.860> so<00:05:51.670> I<00:05:51.730> took

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
depth that's what we had 7.25 so I took

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.700 
depth that's what we had 7.25 so I took
two<00:05:52.180> passes<00:05:53.160> final<00:05:54.160> depth<00:05:55.320> so<00:05:56.320> that's<00:05:56.500> how<00:05:56.650> you

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
two passes final depth so that's how you

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.610 
two passes final depth so that's how you
do<00:05:56.860> it<00:05:56.980> in<00:05:57.070> that<00:05:57.280> with<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.090> tutorial<00:05:58.780> or<00:05:59.500> with

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
do it in that with the tutorial or with

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.940 
do it in that with the tutorial or with

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.000 

that's<00:06:05.760> it<00:06:05.940> in<00:06:06.030> a<00:06:06.180> nutshell<00:06:06.680> you<00:06:07.680> want<00:06:07.830> to<00:06:07.890> get

that's it in a nutshell you want to get

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.770 
that's it in a nutshell you want to get
more<00:06:08.190> complicated<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:09.150> can<00:06:09.240> draw<00:06:09.390> the<00:06:09.450> part

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
more complicated you can draw the part

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.480 
more complicated you can draw the part
in<00:06:09.960> something<00:06:10.230> like<00:06:10.440> SolidWorks<00:06:11.100> and<00:06:11.310> then

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
in something like SolidWorks and then

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.760 
in something like SolidWorks and then
post<00:06:12.060> prosthetic<00:06:12.750> process<00:06:13.410> that<00:06:13.560> I've<00:06:13.650> been

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
post prosthetic process that I've been

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.400 
post prosthetic process that I've been
using<00:06:13.920> sheet<00:06:14.310> cam<00:06:14.630> so<00:06:15.630> if<00:06:15.930> you<00:06:16.050> wanted<00:06:16.230> it<00:06:16.380> that

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
using sheet cam so if you wanted it that

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.810 
using sheet cam so if you wanted it that
would<00:06:16.620> do<00:06:16.740> something<00:06:16.950> like<00:06:17.160> you're<00:06:17.520> wanting

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
would do something like you're wanting

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.640 
would do something like you're wanting
to<00:06:17.850> do<00:06:18.030> a<00:06:18.060> bolt<00:06:18.390> circle<00:06:18.840> around<00:06:18.960> here<00:06:19.440> or

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
to do a bolt circle around here or

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.290 
to do a bolt circle around here or
something<00:06:19.680> a<00:06:20.070> little<00:06:20.250> more<00:06:20.280> exotic<00:06:20.700> than<00:06:21.000> just

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
something a little more exotic than just

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.170 
something a little more exotic than just
pocketing<00:06:21.990> a<00:06:22.050> bearing<00:06:22.380> bit<00:06:22.820> there's<00:06:23.820> no<00:06:24.000> way

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
pocketing a bearing bit there's no way

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.870 
pocketing a bearing bit there's no way
to<00:06:24.240> do<00:06:24.450> that<00:06:24.480> by<00:06:25.410> hand<00:06:25.650> with<00:06:26.070> just<00:06:26.400> a<00:06:26.580> cutting

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
to do that by hand with just a cutting

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.690 
to do that by hand with just a cutting
bit<00:06:27.090> that<00:06:27.930> would<00:06:28.160> there's<00:06:29.160> no<00:06:29.340> way<00:06:29.460> to<00:06:29.520> do<00:06:29.670> that

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
bit that would there's no way to do that

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.470 
bit that would there's no way to do that
so<00:06:30.240> pretty<00:06:30.690> cool<00:06:31.400> and<00:06:32.400> there's<00:06:32.700> this<00:06:33.000> step

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
so pretty cool and there's this step

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.970 
so pretty cool and there's this step

almost zero backlash it's very close and
then<00:06:59.680> we<00:06:59.740> can<00:06:59.919> turn<00:07:00.070> on<00:07:00.160> backlash

make<00:07:25.840> though<00:07:26.020> so<00:07:26.350> Oh<00:07:26.560> a<00:07:27.130> little<00:07:27.340> something

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:27.580 
make though so Oh a little something

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.920 
make though so Oh a little something
it's<00:07:27.789> a<00:07:27.820> little<00:07:28.000> different<00:07:28.300> this<00:07:28.449> is<00:07:28.510> a<00:07:28.630> direct

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
it's a little different this is a direct

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.770 
it's a little different this is a direct
drive<00:07:29.169> this<00:07:29.650> is<00:07:29.830> different<00:07:30.490> than<00:07:30.630> most<00:07:31.630> the

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:31.780 
drive this is different than most the

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.950 
drive this is different than most the
design<00:07:32.169> most<00:07:32.440> folks<00:07:32.680> use<00:07:33.690> come<00:07:34.690> around<00:07:34.840> to

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 
design most folks use come around to

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.999 
design most folks use come around to
this<00:07:35.080> side<00:07:35.139> this<00:07:35.889> is<00:07:36.039> a<00:07:36.070> direct<00:07:36.430> drive<00:07:37.889> to<00:07:38.889> the

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:39.009 
this side this is a direct drive to the

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:41.279 
this side this is a direct drive to the
head<00:07:39.160> there's<00:07:39.340> no<00:07:39.400> pulley<00:07:39.880> reduction<00:07:40.389> the

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:41.289 
head there's no pulley reduction the

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:43.170 
head there's no pulley reduction the
only<00:07:41.500> downside<00:07:41.889> to<00:07:41.979> that<00:07:42.039> is<00:07:42.280> they're<00:07:42.490> almost

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.180 
only downside to that is they're almost

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.150 
only downside to that is they're almost
zero<00:07:43.750> clearance<00:07:44.050> it's<00:07:44.380> probably<00:07:44.860> an<00:07:45.010> eighth

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.160 
zero clearance it's probably an eighth

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.650 
zero clearance it's probably an eighth
of<00:07:45.280> an<00:07:45.400> inch<00:07:45.490> clearance<00:07:45.910> between<00:07:46.090> these<00:07:46.479> two

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:46.660 
of an inch clearance between these two

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.080 
of an inch clearance between these two
motors<00:07:47.020> but<00:07:47.800> they<00:07:47.919> do<00:07:47.979> clear<00:07:48.310> each<00:07:48.430> other<00:07:48.639> so

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.090 
motors but they do clear each other so

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:54.420 
motors but they do clear each other so
all<00:07:49.389> is<00:07:49.510> well<00:07:49.570> there<00:07:52.830> but<00:07:53.830> that's<00:07:54.130> about<00:07:54.370> it

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.430 
all is well there but that's about it

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.189 
all is well there but that's about it
now<00:07:54.789> I'm<00:07:54.909> gonna<00:07:55.000> put<00:07:55.180> some<00:07:55.330> weight<00:07:55.539> covers<00:07:56.020> on

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 
now I'm gonna put some weight covers on

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:57.480 
now I'm gonna put some weight covers on
here<00:07:56.409> I<00:07:56.440> have<00:07:56.650> those<00:07:56.919> I<00:07:56.949> just<00:07:57.070> haven't<00:07:57.400> put

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:57.490 
here I have those I just haven't put

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.219 
here I have those I just haven't put
them<00:07:57.580> on<00:07:57.760> yet<00:07:57.970> though<00:07:58.180> keep<00:07:58.630> the<00:07:58.780> foam<00:07:58.960> off

00:07:59.219 --> 00:07:59.229 
them on yet though keep the foam off

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.560 
them on yet though keep the foam off
these<00:07:59.409> ball<00:07:59.620> or<00:07:59.919> the<00:07:59.949> aluminum<00:08:00.639> off<00:08:01.180> the<00:08:01.419> ball

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:01.570 
these ball or the aluminum off the ball

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.029 
these ball or the aluminum off the ball
nuts<00:08:01.810> when<00:08:01.960> you're<00:08:02.080> machining<00:08:02.530> aluminum<00:08:02.919> or

00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 
nuts when you're machining aluminum or

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.189 
nuts when you're machining aluminum or
something<00:08:03.250> like<00:08:03.370> that<00:08:03.479> so<00:08:04.479> you<00:08:04.570> don't<00:08:04.659> wear

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 
something like that so you don't wear

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:08.760 
something like that so you don't wear
them<00:08:05.380> all<00:08:05.530> out<00:08:06.990> but<00:08:07.990> all<00:08:08.229> it<00:08:08.349> all<00:08:08.470> looks<00:08:08.710> pretty

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:08.770 
them all out but all it all looks pretty

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.930 
them all out but all it all looks pretty
good<00:08:09.039> and<00:08:09.250> and<00:08:10.000> I<00:08:10.690> think<00:08:10.960> we'll<00:08:11.940> hopefully

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:12.940 
good and and I think we'll hopefully

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.229 
good and and I think we'll hopefully
they'll<00:08:13.330> make<00:08:13.570> some<00:08:13.599> cool<00:08:13.960> stuff
