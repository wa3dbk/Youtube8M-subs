see it goes right down to cover by the
wing<00:00:40.950> mirror<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.309> well<00:00:41.640> unlike<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.500> OEM<00:00:43.500> ones

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
wing mirror as well unlike the OEM ones

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.209 
wing mirror as well unlike the OEM ones
are<00:00:44.539> of<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.289> obviously<00:00:46.530> cost<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.980> lot<00:00:47.160> less

clips<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.680> well<00:00:55.070> I'm<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.309> quite<00:00:56.610> sure<00:00:56.640> how<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
clips as well I'm not quite sure how you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.959 
clips as well I'm not quite sure how you
use<00:00:57.780> those<00:00:58.020> yet<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:59.399> does<00:00:59.550> come<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.910> some

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
use those yet it does come with some

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.590 
use those yet it does come with some
instructions<00:01:01.609> that<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.239> put<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
instructions that you have to put the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.920 
instructions that you have to put the
front<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.049> first<00:01:04.820> try<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.970> slide<00:01:06.360> slot<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
front in first try and slide slot the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.899 
front in first try and slide slot the
back<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.840> then<00:01:09.840> basically<00:01:10.320> bend<00:01:11.310> them<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
back in and then basically bend them to

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.679 
back in and then basically bend them to
fit<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.540> push<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.710> into<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.280> seal<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.420> what

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
fit and push it into the seal so what

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.210 
fit and push it into the seal so what
I'm<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.170> now<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.560> try<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.920> fit<00:01:17.130> them

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
I'm going to do now is try to fit them

00:01:17.220 --> 00:02:09.060 
I'm going to do now is try to fit them
to<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> car

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.470 

so<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.130> fix<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.490> problem<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.180> window

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
so to fix the problem of the window

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.270 
so to fix the problem of the window
flexors<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.290> windows<00:02:12.620> not<00:02:12.830> going<00:02:13.160> up

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
flexors and the windows not going up

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.490 
flexors and the windows not going up
properly<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:14.390> have<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.570> just<00:02:14.840> bend<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.320> out

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
properly you have to just bend it out

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.770 
properly you have to just bend it out
Bend<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.340> wind<00:02:16.550> deflectors<00:02:17.030> out<00:02:17.210> from<00:02:17.510> about

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
Bend the wind deflectors out from about

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.380 
Bend the wind deflectors out from about
here<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.400> where<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:19.760> getting<00:02:20.150> caught

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
here this is where it's getting caught

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.780 
here this is where it's getting caught
and<00:02:20.660> this<00:02:20.750> is<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.560> point<00:02:21.830> here<00:02:22.070> is<00:02:22.190> where<00:02:22.430> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
and this is this point here is where the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.680 
and this is this point here is where the
wind<00:02:23.600> deflector<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:25.100> gets<00:02:25.790> really<00:02:26.060> close<00:02:26.420> to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
wind deflector this gets really close to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.810 
wind deflector this gets really close to
the<00:02:26.810> window<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.500> glass<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.670> just

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
the window and the glass so you just

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.340 
the window and the glass so you just
have<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.000> pull<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.330> out<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.840> will<00:02:29.900> kind<00:02:30.140> of

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
have to pull it out and it will kind of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
have to pull it out and it will kind of
you<00:02:31.280> can<00:02:31.460> almost<00:02:31.850> feel<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.830> sit<00:02:33.830> into<00:02:33.980> place

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
you can almost feel it sit into place

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:47.490 
you can almost feel it sit into place
better

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.080 

and<00:02:48.500> then<00:02:48.709> when<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.950> closes<00:02:49.159> it<00:02:49.519> sits<00:02:49.790> in<00:02:49.970> there

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
and then when it closes it sits in there

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.059 
and then when it closes it sits in there
nicely<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.900> passenger<00:02:51.349> windows<00:02:51.709> have<00:02:51.890> gone

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
nicely the passenger windows have gone

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:00.009 
nicely the passenger windows have gone
in<00:02:52.250> fine<00:02:52.580> first<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:58.459> deflectors<00:02:59.060> do<00:02:59.390> slightly

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
in fine first the deflectors do slightly

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:08.710 
in fine first the deflectors do slightly
move<00:03:02.650> when<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:03.769> see<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.040> glass<00:03:07.209> go<00:03:08.209> past<00:03:08.510> the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
move when you see the glass go past the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.610 
move when you see the glass go past the
first<00:03:08.959> bottom<00:03:09.440> bit<00:03:09.590> there<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.290> then<00:03:12.440> when

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
first bottom bit there and then when

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.059 
first bottom bit there and then when
they<00:03:12.769> finally<00:03:13.370> go<00:03:13.579> in<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.900> see<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.319> deflector

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
they finally go in you see the deflector

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:24.819 
they finally go in you see the deflector
flex<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.640> bit<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.239> sit<00:03:17.569> into<00:03:17.810> place<00:03:23.829> they're

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
flex a bit and sit into place they're

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.589 
flex a bit and sit into place they're
not<00:03:24.859> as<00:03:25.099> good<00:03:25.160> as<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:26.769> official<00:03:27.769> Honda<00:03:28.099> ones
