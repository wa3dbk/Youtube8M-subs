que transita por tus venas, amigos (Translation from Spanish: what's flowing in your veins, friends?)

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.698
Cinco De Maya is coming up

00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:06.806
So today, I am going to show you how to cook some Mexican cuisine food!

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.582
And what's more Mexican than a burrito? 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.720
A quesadilla! A Waffle Quesadilla! 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.372
You already probably know the ingredients. They are very simple

00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:15.969
We just need some tortillas 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.943
As well as some shredded cheese

00:00:18.428 --> 00:00:20.908
and some canola oil, canola spray oil

00:00:20.908 --> 00:00:24.583
And of course, to make it a waffle quesadilla, we need a waffle iron

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:28.978
when you plug in your waffle iron, you want to make sure it's ready before you start cookin

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180
than you grab a the canola oil, shake it up as always

00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:35.096
and spray just a notch

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.360
as well as the other side

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.857
then you are going to grab your tortillas 

00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:42.973
I am feeling Mexican already

00:00:42.973 --> 00:00:45.561
and you wanna spread some shredded cheese on top of it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.759
I like my quesadillas nice and cheesy 

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:52.652
I think it's going to be dripping cheese a little bit, but oh well

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:54.845
and then you just plug it in

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.320
In about 30 seconds you flip that thing and let it do its thing

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.388
and just wait until you feel that the cheese is starting to melt

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.398
30 seconds and it's time to open it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.620
Umm, the waffle quasadilla

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.321
I am going to grab my delicious waffle quesadilla 

00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:13.389
and throw it and let it rest for just a little bit

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:16.961
while it's resting I am going to grab some grilled chees off my waffle

00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:19.148
and enjoy that!

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:22.423
it's time to cut it in four pieces

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:24.736
umm, do you smell that cheese?

00:01:25.846 --> 00:01:27.126
CHEE-ZI-LICOUS!!

00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:31.971
my cutting skills are not the best

00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:34.498
But my waffle tortillas skills are not questioned!

00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:36.216
[crunching the waffle quesadilla]

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:38.939
this is so good!

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:40.701
THUMBS UP!

00:01:42.284 --> 00:01:42.784

00:01:43.863 --> 00:01:44.363
two

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:45.846

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:49.744

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:50.729
Cheeze out!

00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:52.922
que paso, que paso

00:01:52.922 --> 00:01:53.920
I am going to eat them all!

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.893
Muhahaha! I am going to eat them all!

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.100
- Que transita haha. BAHAHAHAH!

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.738
- stop it!

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:04.192
que transita por tus venas, amigos 

00:02:04.192 --> 00:02:05.450
