00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
computer because essentially that's

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.480 
computer because essentially that's
really<00:01:30.630> well<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> was<00:01:31.079> now<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.159> point<00:01:32.400> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490

moment that I spent behind the computer

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.050 
moment that I spent behind the computer
was<00:01:40.619> time<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.159> couldn't<00:01:41.610> spend<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.909> from

or just working on our overall business

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.280 
or just working on our overall business
and<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:47.130> seconds<00:01:48.030> mattered<00:01:48.479> while<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.140> might

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
and so seconds mattered while you might

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.440 
and so seconds mattered while you might
say<00:01:49.560> working<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.070> an<00:01:50.189> image<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.640> say<00:01:50.790> 10<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.090> 15

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
say working on an image for say 10 or 15

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.899 
say working on an image for say 10 or 15
seconds<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.930> actually<00:01:52.259> fairly<00:01:52.590> quick<00:01:53.040> when

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
seconds is actually fairly quick when

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
seconds is actually fairly quick when
you<00:01:54.000> talk<00:01:54.180> about<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.689> say<00:01:54.960> five<00:01:55.259> hundred

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you talk about it on say five hundred

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.010 
you talk about it on say five hundred
thousand<00:01:55.920> images<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.090> shave<00:01:57.360> off<00:01:57.570> even

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
thousand images if I can shave off even

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
thousand images if I can shave off even
a<00:01:58.200> few<00:01:58.530> seconds<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.460> cut<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.790> from

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
a few seconds so if I can cut it from

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.880 
a few seconds so if I can cut it from
ten<00:02:00.210> seconds<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.990> seven<00:02:01.320> seconds<00:02:01.770> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
ten seconds down to seven seconds I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.950 
ten seconds down to seven seconds I
realize<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.850> would<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.060> saving<00:02:03.420> hundreds

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
realize that I would be saving hundreds

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.780 
realize that I would be saving hundreds
of<00:02:04.020> hours<00:02:04.140> over<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.619> course<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.100> year<00:02:05.130> so

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
of hours over the course of a year so

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.609 
of hours over the course of a year so
over<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.090> two<00:02:06.450> years<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.899> spent<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.290> lot<00:02:07.590> of

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
over that two years I spent a lot of

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.440 
over that two years I spent a lot of
time<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.950> trying<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.520> think<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.879> how<00:02:09.390> we

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
time just trying to think of how we

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.119 
time just trying to think of how we
could<00:02:09.690> make<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.080> leg<00:02:10.259> room<00:02:10.410> workflow<00:02:10.800> more

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
could make the leg room workflow more

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.430 
could make the leg room workflow more
efficient<00:02:11.610> at<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.360> point<00:02:12.569> i<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.900> actually

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
efficient at this point i can actually

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.380 
efficient at this point i can actually
and<00:02:13.770> edit<00:02:14.190> at<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> rate<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.610> fifteen<00:02:14.910> hundred
