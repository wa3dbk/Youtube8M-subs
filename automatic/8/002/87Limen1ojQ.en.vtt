00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.230
 calculate 41 negative -31 negative -26 positive 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.929
 50 negative 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.929
 it's about addition and subtraction of whole numbers 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.929
 for this the first thing we will do is eliminate the parentheses 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.319
 so that if there is a negative sign in front of the parentheses 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.949
 we will put the opposite 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.979
 of the number that is inside 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.440
 but if in front of the parenthesis there is a positive sign 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.700
 we will leave the number of the interior with the same but it has 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.140
 Let's go there 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.200
 The first thing we find is a negative 41 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.180
 That's how we wrote it 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.580
 after more than writing the opposite 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.720
 of 31 negative as indicated by the sign of out 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.720
 I would like 31 positive 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.030
 this negative too 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.210
 it turns us the positive 26 in its position 26 negative 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.920
 and finally 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.830
 this positive let us invariant interior number 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.390
 once done that let's group the positive numbers 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.980
 What are they 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.870
 thirty one one 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.870
 the negative numbers that are 41 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.150
 26 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.500
 and 50 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.910
 in this way 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.150
 we have 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.800
 that at 31 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 we stop what remains 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.740
 117 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.820
 as they are two numbers of different sign 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 we will lend their values 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.330
 117 - 31 66 without taking into account the sign 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 and now we will put the result to sign the highest in absolute value therefore 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.590
 117 the negative sign 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.380
 the result after 86 negative
