00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.660
 in trouble 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.179
 today we are going to see 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.089
 how the game is played with a vehicle 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.820
 cavalry factions 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.230
 pissarro in ecatepec 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.330
 in interview between title of this vehicle is a roof 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.650
 which when calculating the distance to the objective 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.230
 and keep prisoner 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.620
 the director of the being 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.720
 moves towards him 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.720
 center 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.240
 You have to see if the objective 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.010
 is that the left can be on the right 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.790
 the reticle will jump to where we want located 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.220
 in the bottom of the recycle you can see the distance in this 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.510
 a letter 3 - the selected request - 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.970
 that for example 3 the letter g 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.360
 for the municipal 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.850
 high explosive 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.300
 assumption np polanski 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.590
 the letter p 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.830
 for the ammunition arrow 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.260
 we can nothing apps 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.660
 efe sps 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.610
 according to the letter if always if the third age is being used 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.009
 the way to make fire with vehicles of this type as he pizarro 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.690
 It is very simple 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.310
 first we follow the objective during a time slot tournament 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.240
 second we calculate the distance 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.270
 moment in which the reticle moved 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.270
 and we will have to put them together again 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.940
 this one has been wrong 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.979
 I remove the shots do not hit 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.979
 they will stay by contrast 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.829
 we again make layoffs 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:23.139
 they repeat 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.139
 we follow the goal for a short period of time 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.269
 both hoops 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.569
 very clear 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.569
 you always have to do it 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:41.649
 there we have an objective we focus 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.529
 it has been seen how it moves from the eyepiece 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.529
 the objective is refocused 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:55.219
 If the accident is correct, the first attempt the first shot will already impact 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.219
 directly on 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.729
 your case of such rights 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.689
 although we see general 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.319
 we faint and papaya collapsed 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.319
 you always have to follow 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.049
 3 the target is located 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.109
 they are made of theirs it is calculated objective central sierra distance
