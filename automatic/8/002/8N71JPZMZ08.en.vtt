00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this time around you're probably

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.040 
this time around you're probably
wondering<00:00:17.460> how<00:00:17.760> has<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.240> band<00:00:18.480> progressed

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
wondering how has this band progressed

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.779 
wondering how has this band progressed
in<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.560> three<00:00:19.800> years<00:00:20.039> they've<00:00:20.340> been<00:00:20.490> away

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
in the three years they've been away

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.730 
in the three years they've been away
from<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.119> scene<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.689> think<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.529> a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
from the scene I think that it's a

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.590 
from the scene I think that it's a
little<00:00:22.859> bit<00:00:22.980> hard<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.430> describe<00:00:23.850> their<00:00:24.240> sound

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
little bit hard to describe their sound

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.980 
little bit hard to describe their sound
necessarily<00:00:25.500> under<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:26.369> genre

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
necessarily under one genre

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.040 
necessarily under one genre
post-hardcore<00:00:28.369> dance<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:30.269> little<00:00:30.750> bit<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
post-hardcore dance a little bit of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.010 
post-hardcore dance a little bit of
electronic<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:32.880> all<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> above

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
electronic it's really all of the above

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.380 
electronic it's really all of the above
honestly<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.280> fuse<00:00:35.670> all<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.239> these

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
honestly because they fuse all of these

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.420 
honestly because they fuse all of these
genres<00:00:36.420> together<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.410> quite<00:00:37.680> well<00:00:38.100> they're

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
genres together and quite well they're

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.069 
genres together and quite well they're
one<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.610> those<00:00:38.760> bands<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.420> kind<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.750> mix

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
one of those bands that can kind of mix

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.930 
one of those bands that can kind of mix
and<00:00:40.230> match<00:00:40.320> they<00:00:40.710> don't<00:00:40.890> necessarily<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
and match they don't necessarily have to

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.389 
and match they don't necessarily have to
fall<00:00:42.239> under<00:00:42.899> one<00:00:43.079> category<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.920> order<00:00:44.250> for

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
fall under one category in order for

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.100 
fall under one category in order for
them<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> succeed<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.480> think<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.899> Enter

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
them to succeed I think that Enter

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.869 
them to succeed I think that Enter

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
Shikari have succeeded for several

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.459 
Shikari have succeeded for several
different<00:00:48.000> reasons<00:00:48.270> mainly<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.200> fact

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
different reasons mainly for the fact

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.229 
different reasons mainly for the fact
that<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.770> dare<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.610> different

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that they dare to be different

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.299 
that they dare to be different
in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.539> world<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> hard<00:00:52.410> music<00:00:53.070> scene

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
in the world of the hard music scene

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.340 
in the world of the hard music scene
many<00:00:53.730> bands<00:00:54.000> settle<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> same<00:00:54.899> routines

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
many bands settle for the same routines

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.860

out<00:06:13.910> it's<00:06:14.210> not<00:06:14.300> necessarily<00:06:14.960> a<00:06:14.990> scream<00:06:15.590> it's

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
out it's not necessarily a scream it's

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.340 
out it's not necessarily a scream it's
those<00:06:16.250> clean<00:06:16.730> vocals<00:06:17.210> but<00:06:17.450> still<00:06:17.780> with<00:06:18.080> a<00:06:18.110> bit

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
those clean vocals but still with a bit

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.140 
those clean vocals but still with a bit
of<00:06:18.470> desperation<00:06:18.710> in<00:06:19.490> there<00:06:19.700> and<00:06:19.940> you<00:06:20.000> can

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
of desperation in there and you can

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.240 
of desperation in there and you can
definitely<00:06:20.360> hear<00:06:21.110> like<00:06:21.380> maybe<00:06:21.680> you<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:21.980> a<00:06:22.010> few

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
definitely hear like maybe you and a few

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.100 
definitely hear like maybe you and a few
imperfections<00:06:22.580> in<00:06:23.180> the<00:06:23.210> voice<00:06:23.419> but<00:06:23.810> I<00:06:23.900> think

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
imperfections in the voice but I think

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.780 
imperfections in the voice but I think
that's<00:06:24.260> what<00:06:24.440> makes<00:06:24.620> it<00:06:24.770> feel<00:06:24.950> more<00:06:25.220> genuine

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
that's what makes it feel more genuine

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.030 
that's what makes it feel more genuine
and<00:06:25.970> more<00:06:26.390> passionate<00:06:26.720> maybe<00:06:27.500> even<00:06:27.830> more

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
and more passionate maybe even more

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.010 
and more passionate maybe even more
emotive<00:06:28.610> the<00:06:28.970> instrumental<00:06:29.510> really<00:06:29.750> builds

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
emotive the instrumental really builds

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.810 
emotive the instrumental really builds
up<00:06:30.140> on<00:06:30.260> this<00:06:30.500> one<00:06:30.680> with<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:30.919> bass<00:06:31.160> the<00:06:31.490> guitars

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
up on this one with the bass the guitars

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.550 
up on this one with the bass the guitars
and<00:06:32.150> the<00:06:32.270> pounding<00:06:32.660> drums<00:06:32.960> really<00:06:33.290> just

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
and the pounding drums really just

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.960 
and the pounding drums really just
starting<00:06:33.890> to<00:06:33.919> surround<00:06:34.460> them<00:06:34.669> and<00:06:34.850> it's

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
starting to surround them and it's

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.420 
starting to surround them and it's
second<00:06:35.360> half<00:06:35.570> it<00:06:35.840> might<00:06:36.200> have<00:06:36.380> an<00:06:36.530> odd<00:06:36.770> start

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
second half it might have an odd start

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.620 
second half it might have an odd start
to<00:06:37.610> the<00:06:37.700> track<00:06:37.940> but<00:06:38.270> I<00:06:38.330> think<00:06:38.600> that<00:06:38.750> with<00:06:38.930> time

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
to the track but I think that with time

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.270 
to the track but I think that with time
could<00:06:39.750> easily<00:06:39.990> turn<00:06:40.500> into<00:06:40.530> one<00:06:41.010> of<00:06:41.100> my

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
could easily turn into one of my

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.430 
could easily turn into one of my
favorites<00:06:41.700> and<00:06:41.820> probably<00:06:42.390> a<00:06:42.420> fan<00:06:42.870> favorite

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
favorites and probably a fan favorite

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.140 
favorites and probably a fan favorite
I'm<00:06:43.710> not<00:06:43.920> sure<00:06:44.130> about<00:06:44.280> the<00:06:44.490> shelf-life<00:06:45.000> of

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
I'm not sure about the shelf-life of

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.180 
I'm not sure about the shelf-life of
this<00:06:45.300> record<00:06:45.540> because<00:06:45.930> I<00:06:46.020> can't<00:06:46.260> say<00:06:46.470> the<00:06:46.650> last

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
this record because I can't say the last

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.040 
this record because I can't say the last
album<00:06:47.700> a<00:06:47.880> flash<00:06:48.180> flood<00:06:48.420> of<00:06:48.600> color<00:06:48.810> was

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
album a flash flood of color was

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.570 
album a flash flood of color was
something<00:06:49.320> that<00:06:49.350> I<00:06:49.500> was<00:06:49.680> constantly<00:06:49.950> spinning

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
something that I was constantly spinning

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.250 
something that I was constantly spinning
it<00:06:50.880> had<00:06:50.970> probably<00:06:51.360> been<00:06:51.570> about<00:06:51.750> two<00:06:52.020> years

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
it had probably been about two years

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.080 
it had probably been about two years
before<00:06:52.470> I<00:06:52.680> had<00:06:52.830> heard<00:06:53.010> it<00:06:53.160> in<00:06:53.280> full<00:06:53.580> before<00:06:54.060> I

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
before I had heard it in full before I

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.090 
before I had heard it in full before I
heard<00:06:54.330> it<00:06:54.480> in<00:06:54.600> preparation<00:06:54.930> for<00:06:55.290> this<00:06:55.620> review

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 
heard it in preparation for this review

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.740 
heard it in preparation for this review
but<00:06:56.520> the<00:06:56.640> mine<00:06:56.820> sweep<00:06:57.060> is<00:06:57.240> definitely<00:06:57.690> an

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
but the mine sweep is definitely an

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.210 
but the mine sweep is definitely an
impressive<00:06:58.230> record<00:06:58.410> that<00:06:58.710> deserves<00:06:58.980> to<00:06:59.130> be

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
impressive record that deserves to be

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.280 
impressive record that deserves to be
spun<00:06:59.490> at<00:06:59.670> least<00:06:59.850> a<00:06:59.940> few<00:07:00.180> times<00:07:00.240> I<00:07:00.780> think<00:07:01.020> that

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
spun at least a few times I think that

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.170 
spun at least a few times I think that
it<00:07:01.380> shows<00:07:01.620> improvements<00:07:02.310> in<00:07:02.430> some<00:07:02.610> areas<00:07:03.000> but

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
it shows improvements in some areas but

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.910 
it shows improvements in some areas but
also<00:07:03.330> shows<00:07:03.840> a<00:07:04.170> few<00:07:04.350> things<00:07:04.530> that<00:07:04.740> could<00:07:04.800> be

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
also shows a few things that could be

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.920 
also shows a few things that could be
tweaked<00:07:05.220> and<00:07:05.400> worked<00:07:05.610> on<00:07:05.790> and<00:07:06.000> improved<00:07:06.390> for

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
tweaked and worked on and improved for

tweaked and worked on and improved for
me<00:07:07.080> this<00:07:07.500> record<00:07:07.830> is<00:07:07.950> a<00:07:08.100> four<00:07:08.460> out<00:07:08.730> of<00:07:08.790> five<00:07:09.030> so
