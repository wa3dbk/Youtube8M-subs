00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.210
 and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 i 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.510
 Hello everyone I'm going to have now 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.150
 I bring a video of how to start a channel 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.420
 on youtube some of you have 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.500
 asked about tips and tips on how 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.809
 start your channel on youtube and I feel like 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.850
 I can help you a little on this subject 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.250
 before going deeper into them 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.800
 I clarify that this video does not have any 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 magic trick to make you grow fast 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.950
 on YouTube as grabbing subscribers in 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.680
 less than a month clear that takes time and 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.110
 I work hard but if how to make a 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.989
 good channel if you are interested 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.019
 keep watching the video noise my videos 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 with the pai nou cap project this program 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.909
 they are side is compatible with 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.310
 mac computers there are other programs that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.060
 They are also very good and they are free 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.180
 like the mobile and the windows movie maker 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.790
 that are already installed in the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.920
 computer when you buy them I'll 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.300
 I recommend that if you are going to start in 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.110
 Youtube 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.150
 never this money in an editor 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.060
 extremely expensive unless it is 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.010
 sure you will be constantly 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.190
 the camera that I use is the canon tea 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.960
 tree and that the truth is very good but 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.990
 if you are under a budget you can 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.480
 use your smartphone or iphone because 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.630
 they can take stickers videos 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.430
 with a very good resolution and the best 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.640
 everything is that we all have a 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.100
 smartphone or an iphone the bad thing is that the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.470
 battery is going to end very quickly the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.290
 memory was full and the audio can 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.450
 be that it is not very good I recommend you 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.790
 Make small filters always at 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.060
 start your videos to be more 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.240
 entertained so your audience will stay 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.340
 more time watching and you will know from a 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.220
 principle that the video will be treated 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.880
 in a matter of uploading videos is about 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.780
 upload videos every week is constant 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.970
 but give yourself the time to be able to create a 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.720
 good content in the video 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.820
 the more videos you think you create the stronger 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.430
 so that more people are your 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.970
 channel so it's recommended that you be 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.670
 very constant a miniature is the image 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.270
 that everyone sees before entering your video 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.060
 and although you do not believe that image and the 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.670
 banner is something of the most important in 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.950
 your channel apart from the content and the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.110
 lighting and the miniature is very 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.600
 important because it is what attracts the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.510
 make people click on your video 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.330
 although they prefer to click on this 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.920
 well edited image well lit very 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:11.090
 pretty or to this image that is dark and 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.640
 that you can not see well what there is 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.860
 is what you think 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.590
 but if it is because you are very at the time of 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.569
 make your miniature because the truth is 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.720
 that is going to help you so that people 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.240
 go see your videos I recommend you 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.670
 that you use pickman which is what I 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.700
 use and the truth helps me a lot so that 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.790
 my miniatures look so much better 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.040
 which is a very good website to edit 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.160
 the images so I recommend them 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.890
 so they go and do not use like 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.590
 that the thumbnails the banner is the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.830
 image that everyone sees when they do 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.959
 click on your channel and that is very important 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.239
 because it is your image and the first 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.210
 impression that everyone sees you have to try 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.510
 of having a very organized channel having 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.120
 to videos in different categories 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.170
 so that people when they see your 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.190
 channel that has snowed this channel is nice 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.470
 professional and this is my recommendation 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.739
 to have good lighting, I do not know 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.030
 they need studies only record 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.390
 in front of a window 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.670
 Just make sure you do not get 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.740
 is hitting the sunlight directly 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.680
 because that's not going to make it look 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.290
 also if you are going to start I recommend you 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.320
 make popular videos like in my 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.830
 bag that there is my backpack routines 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.190
 morning night routine since they are videos 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.140
 very sought after those are the ones you pick up 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.750
 that's been all for the video now 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.090
 I hope I have not boring you and if you want 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.430

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.600

 great to get up to 500 likes I do not know if 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:23.280
