like<00:01:36.270> Queen<00:01:36.630> size<00:01:36.900> when<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.350> done<00:01:37.470> when<00:01:37.590> you

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
like Queen size when it's done when you

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.110 
like Queen size when it's done when you
put<00:01:37.830> two<00:01:37.950> layer<00:01:38.159> cakes<00:01:38.190> together<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.850> makes<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
put two layer cakes together it makes a

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.020 
put two layer cakes together it makes a
queen<00:01:39.299> size<00:01:39.540> quilt<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.490> block<00:01:41.729> we're

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
queen size quilt so the block we're

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.760 
queen size quilt so the block we're
doing<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.420> called<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.810> envelope<00:01:42.960> block<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
doing is called the envelope block and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.500 
doing is called the envelope block and
it<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.979> made<00:01:44.220> using<00:01:44.460> half<00:01:44.729> square<00:01:45.000> triangles

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
it is made using half square triangles

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.690 
it is made using half square triangles
and<00:01:45.720> how<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.380> make<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:46.920> half<00:01:47.100> square<00:01:47.310> triangles

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and how I make my half square triangles

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.430 
and how I make my half square triangles
is<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.909> sew<00:01:48.210> all<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.479> way<00:01:48.840> around<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.260> outside

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
is I sew all the way around the outside

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.520 
is I sew all the way around the outside
edge<00:01:49.880> just<00:01:50.880> completely<00:01:51.659> around<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> then<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
edge just completely around and then I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.280 
edge just completely around and then I
cut<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.890> diagonally<00:01:53.190> both<00:01:54.030> sides<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.049> let's

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
cut it diagonally both sides so let's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.170 
cut it diagonally both sides so let's
take<00:01:55.560> these<00:01:55.740> two<00:01:55.799> pieces<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.790> two<00:01:56.970> layer

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
take these two pieces I have two layer

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.230 
take these two pieces I have two layer
cakes<00:01:57.510> here<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.680> my<00:01:59.040> background<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.820> my

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
cakes here I have my background and my

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.240 
cakes here I have my background and my
printed<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.680> putting<00:02:01.860> them<00:02:02.010> right

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
printed one and I'm putting them right

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.980 
printed one and I'm putting them right
sides<00:02:02.520> together<00:02:02.760> and<00:02:03.030> I'm<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.780> sew

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
sides together and I'm just going to sew

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:12.280 
sides together and I'm just going to sew
all<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.260> way<00:02:04.619> around<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:08.789> here<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.179> go

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.900 

this<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.440> such<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.770> fast<00:02:14.190> way<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.460> make<00:02:14.580> half

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
this is such a fast way to make half

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.980 
this is such a fast way to make half
square<00:02:15.150> triangles<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.870> love<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:17.660> now<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.720> can

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
square triangles I love it now you can

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.540 
square triangles I love it now you can
stop<00:02:19.290> at<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.530> quarter<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.890> an<00:02:19.950> inch<00:02:20.070> or<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.400> can

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
stop at a quarter of an inch or you can

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.450 
stop at a quarter of an inch or you can
sew<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:20.970> off<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.330> edge<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:26.040> now<00:02:26.250> we've

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
sew right off the edge so now we've

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.220 
sew right off the edge so now we've
sewed<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.910> all<00:02:27.210> around<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> outside<00:02:27.780> edge

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
sewed this all around the outside edge

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.690 
sewed this all around the outside edge
and<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.890> need<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.190> cut<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.490> diagonally

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
and we just need to cut it diagonally

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.500 
and we just need to cut it diagonally
both<00:02:30.210> directions<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.860> lay<00:02:32.220> my<00:02:32.430> ruler<00:02:32.490> on<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
both directions so I lay my ruler on the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.470 
both directions so I lay my ruler on the
corners<00:02:34.380> opposite<00:02:35.340> corners<00:02:35.760> diagonally

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
corners opposite corners diagonally

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.780 
corners opposite corners diagonally
across<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:37.080> block<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.710> we're<00:02:38.460> going<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.640> make

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
across the block and we're going to make

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.970 
across the block and we're going to make
a<00:02:38.850> cut<00:02:39.180> there<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:40.440> we're<00:02:40.560> going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.710> come

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
a cut there and then we're going to come

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.260 
a cut there and then we're going to come
here<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.220> do<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> same<00:02:41.790> thing<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.240> other

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
here and do the same thing on the other

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.210 
here and do the same thing on the other
side<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.230> going<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.590> give<00:02:46.740> you<00:02:46.860> four

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
side this is going to give you four

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.190 
side this is going to give you four
half-square<00:02:47.490> triangles<00:02:48.300> right<00:02:48.600> off<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.020> bat

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
half-square triangles right off the bat

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.490 
half-square triangles right off the bat
so<00:02:50.070> then<00:02:50.220> we're<00:02:50.310> going<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.460> iron<00:02:50.640> these<00:02:50.880> open

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
so then we're going to iron these open

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.280 
so then we're going to iron these open
just<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.740> this<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.580> keep<00:02:54.540> my<00:02:54.720> darker<00:02:55.110> fabric

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
just like this I keep my darker fabric

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.680 
just like this I keep my darker fabric
to<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.740> top<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:57.450> set

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
to the top and then you can just set

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.060 
to the top and then you can just set
your<00:02:57.870> seam<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.470> roll<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.830> back

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
your seam and roll it back

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.220 
your seam and roll it back
ah<00:03:00.050> can't<00:03:01.050> get<00:03:01.170> those<00:03:01.260> apart<00:03:01.620> there<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:01.950> go<00:03:03.230> and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
ah can't get those apart there we go and

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.680 
ah can't get those apart there we go and
then<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.130> got<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.550> more<00:03:05.790> over<00:03:06.060> here<00:03:08.570> here<00:03:09.570> we

bring in this one and I put it in what's

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.690 
bring in this one and I put it in what's
going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.570> look<00:03:33.750> backwards<00:03:34.440> for<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.460> time

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
going to look backwards for the time

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.030 
going to look backwards for the time
being<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.140> it's<00:03:37.290> going<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.470> stick<00:03:37.800> up<00:03:37.920> at

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
being and so it's going to stick up at

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.770 
being and so it's going to stick up at
the<00:03:38.160> top<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.240> like<00:03:39.510> an<00:03:39.660> open

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
the top like that like it like an open

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.750 
the top like that like it like an open
flap<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:41.040> what<00:03:41.160> we're<00:03:41.280> going<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.430> do<00:03:41.580> then<00:03:41.730> is

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
flap so what we're going to do then is

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.190 
flap so what we're going to do then is
we're<00:03:42.030> going<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.180> sew<00:03:42.420> two<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.840> these<00:03:42.900> together

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
we're going to sew two of these together

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.230 
we're going to sew two of these together
like<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:48.830> get<00:03:49.830> that<00:03:50.100> right<00:03:51.060> there

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
like this and get that right there

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.699 
like this and get that right there
together

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.110 

and<00:03:54.709> I'm<00:03:54.829> going<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.040> stretch<00:03:55.400> this<00:03:55.430> down<00:03:55.879> here

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
and I'm going to stretch this down here

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.160 
and I'm going to stretch this down here
and<00:03:56.180> make<00:03:56.420> this<00:03:57.760> fit<00:03:58.760> perfect<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:01.989> then<00:04:02.989> we're

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
and make this fit perfect and then we're

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.179 
and make this fit perfect and then we're
going<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.319> iron<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:03.920> open<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:08.620> then<00:04:09.620> we're

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
going to iron this open and then we're

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.619 
going to iron this open and then we're
going<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.340> bring<00:04:10.519> it<00:04:10.639> over<00:04:10.730> here<00:04:10.879> and<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.420> can

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
going to bring it over here and you can

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.059 
going to bring it over here and you can
see<00:04:11.810> right<00:04:11.959> here<00:04:12.019> I've<00:04:12.319> already<00:04:12.590> sewn<00:04:12.829> these

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
see right here I've already sewn these

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.940 
see right here I've already sewn these
two<00:04:13.310> together<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.840> makes<00:04:15.139> the<00:04:15.349> base<00:04:15.650> of

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
two together and this makes the base of

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.219 
two together and this makes the base of
the<00:04:16.220> envelope<00:04:16.729> block<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.359> then<00:04:17.930> we're<00:04:18.109> going

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
the envelope block and then we're going

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.379 
the envelope block and then we're going
to<00:04:18.320> join<00:04:18.709> these<00:04:18.919> two<00:04:19.190> rows<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:19.880> basically

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
to join these two rows and basically

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.180 
to join these two rows and basically
it's<00:04:20.630> really<00:04:20.870> like<00:04:21.199> putting<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.709> four<00:04:21.979> patch

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
it's really like putting a four patch

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.580 
it's really like putting a four patch
together<00:04:22.639> it's<00:04:22.849> just<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:23.300> one<00:04:24.139> seam<00:04:24.410> in<00:04:24.530> the

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
together it's just that one seam in the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.180 
together it's just that one seam in the
middle<00:04:24.860> we<00:04:24.949> have<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.310> match<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:26.919> I'm<00:04:27.919> going<00:04:28.130> to

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
middle we have to match and I'm going to

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.930 
middle we have to match and I'm going to
put<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.400> pin<00:04:28.729> right<00:04:28.759> in<00:04:29.120> there<00:04:30.550> so<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.729> I<00:04:31.759> can

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
put a pin right in there so that I can

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.999 
put a pin right in there so that I can
just<00:04:32.120> whiz<00:04:32.330> down<00:04:32.599> that<00:04:32.780> seam<00:04:33.050> i<00:04:33.229> I've<00:04:33.680> made

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
just whiz down that seam i I've made

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.100 
just whiz down that seam i I've made
sure<00:04:34.039> that<00:04:34.280> those<00:04:34.639> seams<00:04:35.090> are<00:04:35.330> nested<00:04:35.870> right

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
sure that those seams are nested right

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.150 
sure that those seams are nested right
nicely<00:04:36.650> together

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
nicely together

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.620 
nicely together
and<00:04:37.669> then<00:04:38.000> we're<00:04:38.090> going<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.240> go<00:04:38.419> over<00:04:38.509> to<00:04:38.570> the

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
and then we're going to go over to the

00:04:38.630 --> 00:05:00.290 
and then we're going to go over to the
sewing<00:04:38.840> machine<00:04:39.259> and<00:04:39.289> sew<00:04:39.500> this<00:04:40.280> row

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.209 

there<00:05:01.300> we<00:05:01.479> go<00:05:01.719> okay<00:05:02.259> so<00:05:02.319> now<00:05:02.620> we<00:05:02.680> just<00:05:02.800> need<00:05:03.009> to

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
is a quick and easy layout and I'll show

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.730 
is a quick and easy layout and I'll show
you<00:05:11.710> how<00:05:11.979> we<00:05:12.039> do<00:05:12.310> that

so<00:05:14.740> just<00:05:15.009> to<00:05:15.129> recap<00:05:15.449> when<00:05:16.449> you<00:05:16.599> make<00:05:16.810> this

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
so just to recap when you make this

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.140 
so just to recap when you make this
block<00:05:17.409> you're<00:05:17.889> going<00:05:18.069> to<00:05:18.129> use<00:05:18.400> you're<00:05:18.969> going

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
block you're going to use you're going

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.600 
block you're going to use you're going
to<00:05:19.210> use<00:05:19.360> three<00:05:19.750> of<00:05:19.780> these<00:05:20.129> from<00:05:21.129> one<00:05:21.340> block

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
to use three of these from one block

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.249 
to use three of these from one block
that's<00:05:22.030> going<00:05:22.240> to<00:05:22.300> make<00:05:22.449> your<00:05:22.599> envelope<00:05:23.080> right

in a lid

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.860 
in a lid
you<00:05:27.430> know<00:05:27.550> from<00:05:27.789> somewhere<00:05:28.150> else<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.419> you<00:05:28.509> set

that in backwards I just want to make
sure<00:05:30.610> you<00:05:30.699> got<00:05:30.849> that<00:05:31.090> because<00:05:31.300> it's<00:05:31.449> really

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
sure you got that because it's really

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.719 
sure you got that because it's really
important<00:05:32.349> to<00:05:32.530> the<00:05:32.650> layout<00:05:32.979> of<00:05:33.009> the<00:05:33.340> quilt<00:05:33.580> so

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
important to the layout of the quilt so

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.659 
important to the layout of the quilt so
the<00:05:33.819> block<00:05:34.060> looks<00:05:34.360> right<00:05:34.659> and<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:36.250> now<00:05:36.460> we're

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
the block looks right and so now we're

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.309 
the block looks right and so now we're
just<00:05:36.699> going<00:05:37.000> to<00:05:37.060> lay<00:05:37.270> them<00:05:37.389> out<00:05:37.509> and<00:05:37.900> we're
