actually set back 2.5 inches that's
quite<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> bit<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> nose<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.090> lot<00:00:27.330> longer

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
quite a bit the nose is a lot longer

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.570 
quite a bit the nose is a lot longer
than<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> tail<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.859> board<00:00:29.070> does<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.550> a

dc-3<00:00:31.160> BTX<00:00:32.160> profile<00:00:32.820> shape<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> most

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
dc-3 BTX profile shape it's the most

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.830 
dc-3 BTX profile shape it's the most
similar<00:00:34.559> profile<00:00:35.430> shaped<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.149> camber<00:00:36.540> that

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
similar profile shaped to camber that

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.860 
similar profile shaped to camber that
canoe<00:00:37.230> offers<00:00:37.770> there's<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.910> mild<00:00:39.300> camber<00:00:39.750> or

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
canoe offers there's a mild camber or

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.920 
canoe offers there's a mild camber or
mild<00:00:40.410> rocker<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.950> between<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> feet<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.930> then

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
mild rocker in between the feet and then

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.959 
mild rocker in between the feet and then
camera<00:00:43.379> zones<00:00:43.590> from<00:00:44.219> underneath<00:00:44.520> insert

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
camera zones from underneath insert

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.110 
camera zones from underneath insert
packs<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> contact<00:00:46.469> points<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.579> because

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
packs to the contact points but because

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.299 
packs to the contact points but because
the<00:00:48.390> board<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.440> directional<00:00:49.920> board<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the board is a directional board it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.330 
the board is a directional board it
slightly<00:00:50.789> been<00:00:51.149> set<00:00:51.449> back<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.949> profile

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
slightly been set back that that profile

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
slightly been set back that that profile
shape<00:00:53.550> isn't<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:54.000> dead<00:00:54.300> center<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.899> only

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
shape isn't like dead center it's only

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.220 
shape isn't like dead center it's only
centered<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.949> between<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.910> stance<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.840> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
centered in between the stance now it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
centered in between the stance now it's
a<00:00:58.289> great<00:00:58.500> combination<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.129> both<00:00:59.309> overall<00:00:59.879> like

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
a great combination of both overall like

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.639 
a great combination of both overall like
I<00:01:00.059> said<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.629> most<00:01:00.809> similar<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.379> can

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
I said it's the most similar to a can

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.290 
I said it's the most similar to a can
with<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> real<00:01:02.129> camber<00:01:02.550> board<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.149> when

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
with like a real camber board so when

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
with like a real camber board so when
you<00:01:03.359> set<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.750> board<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.199> flat<00:01:04.500> ground<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you set this board on flat ground the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.770 
you set this board on flat ground the
only<00:01:05.580> things<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.850> are<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.240> touch<00:01:06.390> are

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
only things that are going to touch are

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.390 
only things that are going to touch are
the<00:01:06.930> contact<00:01:07.350> points<00:01:07.650> even<00:01:07.799> though<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the contact points even though there is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.270 
the contact points even though there is
a<00:01:08.549> mild<00:01:09.090> rocker<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:10.020> between<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.560> feet<00:01:10.770> now

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
a mild rocker in between your feet now

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
a mild rocker in between your feet now
overall<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.119> board<00:01:12.420> will<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> flex

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
overall this board will have a flex

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.429 
overall this board will have a flex
rating<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.460> 7<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:15.600> there's<00:01:16.140> something<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
rating of a 7 now there's something a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.289 
rating of a 7 now there's something a
little<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.770> different<00:01:17.220> about<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:18.000> Flex

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
little bit different about the Flex

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.480 
little bit different about the Flex
rating<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.320> split<00:01:19.950> board<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
rating of a split board and then a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.300 
rating of a split board and then a
regular<00:01:20.790> board<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:22.310> usually

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
regular board is that usually

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.280 
regular board is that usually
longitudinally<00:01:24.270> from<00:01:24.450> my<00:01:24.600> tip<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> tail<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
longitudinally from my tip to tail the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.770 
longitudinally from my tip to tail the
boards<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:25.890> seem<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> little<00:01:26.909> bit<00:01:27.210> stiffer<00:01:27.600> or

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
boards will seem a little bit stiffer or

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
boards will seem a little bit stiffer or
like<00:01:28.740> manufacturers<00:01:29.430> will<00:01:29.640> make<00:01:29.880> them<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
like manufacturers will make them a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.480 
like manufacturers will make them a
little<00:01:30.210> bit<00:01:30.420> stiffer<00:01:30.799> but<00:01:31.799> when<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.159> put<00:01:32.400> this

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
little bit stiffer but when you put this

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
little bit stiffer but when you put this
thing<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.759> an<00:01:32.909> edge<00:01:33.140> torsionally<00:01:34.140> they're

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
thing on an edge torsionally they're

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
thing on an edge torsionally they're
gonna<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> little<00:01:34.979> bit<00:01:35.130> softer<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.759> hardpack

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
gonna be a little bit softer on hardpack

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.850 
gonna be a little bit softer on hardpack
even<00:01:36.960> though<00:01:37.020> they're<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.350> designed

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
even though they're not really designed

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.890 
even though they're not really designed
for<00:01:38.009> hard<00:01:38.280> pack<00:01:38.369> sometimes<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.420> need<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> get

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
for hard pack sometimes you need to get

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.109 
for hard pack sometimes you need to get
on<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.220> get<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.460> pottery<00:01:41.759> sometimes<00:01:42.060> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
on to or to get to pottery sometimes you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.840 
on to or to get to pottery sometimes you
have<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.479> ride<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.320> hard<00:01:43.619> pack<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.340> just

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
have to go ride on hard pack so I'm just

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.399 
have to go ride on hard pack so I'm just
known<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.210> even<00:01:45.390> though<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.869> pretty<00:01:46.049> stiff

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
known that even though it's pretty stiff

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.200 
known that even though it's pretty stiff
from<00:01:46.649> tip<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> tail<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.880> gonna<00:01:48.030> be

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
from tip to tail it's gonna be

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
really well rounded split board it's

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.460 
really well rounded split board it's
called<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.220> canoe<00:02:44.520> beast<00:02:45.150> split<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.200> has<00:02:46.440> a

called the canoe beast split it has a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.770 
called the canoe beast split it has a
more<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:47.040> camber<00:02:47.670> profile<00:02:48.060> shape<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.480> think

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
more of a camber profile shape I think

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.570 
more of a camber profile shape I think
it's<00:02:48.870> great<00:02:49.050> type<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.470> Cummins<00:02:49.800> loves<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.310> and
