00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 minecraft is one of the biggest phenomena 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.529
 between electronic games with millions 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.309
 players fans and copies sold throughout 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.469
 the world 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.110
 its success is so great that enter 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.509
 several other developers to imitate 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
 your style of playability or even 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.920
 try to create a copy 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.050
 now check out the top five with some of the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.340
 best and most creative games 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.470
 inspired by maine daycare but for 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.170
 open our list I put my 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.570
 mainz for too much can be purchased 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.370
 through the American live xbox 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.090
 has a special space for games 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.280
 indy 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.190
 the game mixes the visual style of 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.410
 minecraft as the gameplay 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.270
 absolutely identical to the first king 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.789
 the game also has an option to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.070
 if you create your own split maps 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.440
 screen for up to four players 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.280
 can be played online in rooms of 20 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.710
 people 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.140
 the demo version of the game offers only one 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.870
 horrible way against the zombies but this 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.719
 initially bad image of the game passes 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.229
 so players pepper the dep nef 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.229
 online 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.980
 now it would be wrong to say that blokland was 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.050
 inspired by minecraft in fact the game 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.360
 was launched years before but the quality 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.910
 of the game is so much that it could not of form 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.280
 some fail to be on that list the 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.980
 atlante is basically a virtual lego 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.320
 multiplayer game including 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.450
 with mother already in physics that allows 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.130
 go out destroying your creations 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.680
 besides building it is also possible 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.880
 create weapons and vehicles to exploit the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.620
 game world 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.630
 the most interesting is that too 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.880
 several rules that can be 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.010
 applied in matches with them 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.830
 the game can become a fps 10 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.800
 a racing game or even a game of 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.479
 survival in a zombie apocalypse 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.790
 although block or have done less 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.950
 success that minecraft the resources 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.560
 available in the game are so successful 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.560
 and give more options to all players 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.400
 there I join with less world generated 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.020
 randomly from minecraft with 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.000
 rpg elements 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.240
 in this way the game offers a world 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.130
 open 3d very interesting and unique already 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.710
 that buildings and castles are 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.850
 created automatically before start 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.890
 of each game 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.710
 an easy way for you to imagine this 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.210
 is mixing the minecraft look one of the 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.210
 vast skyrim 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.570
 on our list of top five I put 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.060
 a game called club word 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.490
 join the gameplay and fighting mechanics 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.970
 of Zelda with the visual 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.910
 minecraft the result will be with word a 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.950
 rich one of the smells of exploration 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.810
 monsters and boss fights 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.600
 developers have no plans to 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.330
 mining or excavation but the 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.830
 game has full support for buildings and 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.830
 item manufactures 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:18.590
 the an in our top five of games 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.680
 similar to minecraft now it appears 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.230
 just did this is an indispensable game to 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.870
 minecraft and ken fox fans 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.090
 the game is a fps that favors work in 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.400
 team and also offers were of 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.470
 completely new strategy 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.080
 players can build strongholds 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.450
 to protect your team and even dig 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.850
 tunnels to surprise opponents 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.210
 the game has four classes and 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.700
 supports up to 32 players in the same room 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.660
 It is worth remembering that in the 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.660
 sale in extinct 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.610
