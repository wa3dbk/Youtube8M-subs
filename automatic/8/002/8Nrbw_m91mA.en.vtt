00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.980
 good afternoon in the goal ideal 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.340
 were the three points you can say 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.250
 function one day after the process 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.470
 adapting the editions around the world 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.940
 that that also wants to screamed a goal 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.470
 Peruvian by eliminatory in this 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.470
 stadium after 23 years 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.790
 I'm angry with the result 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.649
 I wish I had won 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.910
 the strategy of the work was 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.860
 perfect 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.260
 it would be a game to win 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.590
 it was not like that and therefore I'm not going 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.590
 according 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.380
 people most loved work afternoon joseph 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.540
 Sanchez and says the Andean network identity 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.790
 culture of social education and networks 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.100
 story that the audience thought so much 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.140
 the Peruvian who encouraged almost all 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.870
 party and the public 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.550
 Bolivian public was here 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.320
 known this field has been trainer 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.940
 of blooming at its beginnings then 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.670
 I knew how to play in peace thanks 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.070
 I found the audience wonderful 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.729
 the Bolivian like the Peruvian 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.420
 I think the Peruvian presence was in the 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.120
 grandstands was multicolored beautifully 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.890
 willing to encourage the team 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.010
 I think the team showed that it is 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.270
 avoided entirely in favor of all 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.369
 those who wanted to see it win 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.020
 that was not possible and well we asked 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.640
 sorry for that community surely 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.190
 they would be enjoying it much more if 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.650
 we would have won 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.360
 sergio good afternoon that 's arriving from 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.380
 radio ovation 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.060
 we are live again and you won me 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.400
 a little bit with the answer because you tell me 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.040
 that you are dissatisfied with the result 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.020
 in any case 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.670
 out there passes the key of not winning 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.350
 not taking advantage of the opportunities in the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.670
 first time especially where I think that 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.400
 if we were broadly superior 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.030
 I do not think that the main reason for not 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.060
 have won happens to support a 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.000
 arbitration modality 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.040
 that having been justice is we have 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.500
 played against ten 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.689
 and being righteous there were no 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.540
 stopped carias where we definitely 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.519
 we were very open of backlash I think 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.730
 that also the rival goal starts in 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.730
 a lack of chiroque 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.200
 of which I upload many and allowed a 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.450
 a certain predominance of the rival 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.129
 so I'm going really discontent 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.840
 because I think we did everything possible 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.840
 to win and did not 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.220
 you last night said you have four of 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.290
 three or four projects at altitude with 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.940
 a group of players this project to 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.070
 margin result I think we have another 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.630
 positive I think it can be a contribution 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.210
 for the next process your choices 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.370
 in parties as in peace or instinct and 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.970
 final and the other how much in this group are 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.970
 to go to assumption 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.940
 I think the strategy used was very 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.350
 right is the time to thank in 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.110
 first place to the players 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.330
 for dedicating themselves as they have dedicated themselves to 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.760
 prepare this game for all my 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.710
 collaborators of course very 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.020
 especially to the federation to all the 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.520
 introduction I had from the preaching that 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.260
 he supported us from the point of view 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.730
 economic from the point of view of all 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.760
 the things we need to be able to 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.600
 do the work to those who collaborated 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.520
 in the design of the strategy that 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.520
 they have been next to me all this time 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.920
 I have the peace of mind of having done 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.640
 everything necessary to win the sadness 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.640
 back to the achieved 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.340
 and about the I spent a part of the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.200
 ask how much do I have to check 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.390
 a little bit to have a preliminary list 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.920
 but I have to check it a little now 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.170
 with the doctors to see how they were 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.450
 some of them also talk to 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.790
 gonzalo to see how they ended how 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.400
 finished training today and in 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.320
 function of that determine who are going and 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.290
 who are released from the 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.590
 arrival to assumption to return their 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.590
 clubs 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.680
 but only mark model luís 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.720
 ovation developers arequipa 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.720
 teacher some players that way 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.520
 very special suddenly have stood out in 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.110
 our selection will try football and 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.360
 that they would suddenly be some 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.240
 taken into account to travel to Paraguay 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.759
 Thank you 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.680
 but when the same and featured there were 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.400
 many I'm happy with the effort 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.849
 of all some 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.740
 with better possibilities other names 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.400
 but very clear that we had chosen 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.830
 all right 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.790
 this and that where we had doubts the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.790
 doubts appeared 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.410
 and when rain has answered there to 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.410
 your colleague that we're waiting for 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.090
 value a bit the situation 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.550
 markarián good afternoon for 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.919
 american sports of bolivia is because 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.720
 two different stages are marked zones 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.669
 favorable to one or the other favorable to 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.560
 Bolivian staff and especially in the 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.539
 yields of your selection and other 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.130
 point the mortals and that Peru was worried 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.740
 more suddenly the subject of attitude 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.020
 that of the Bolivian team itself 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.610
 all for this period they had at 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.259
 apparently he spoke over the height 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.220
 of the team's own October today 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.680
 I do not agree with that anymore 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.229
 we have worried 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.020
 first of all by choosing well our 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.910
 second players to be analyzed 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.919
 the best we could to our rival 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.110
 that he had a new coach and that 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.520
 I had changed some things but 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.990
 We collected all the information that 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.180
 we needed to make our table 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.620
 is on the court knowing all the 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.650
 details knowing what the opponent could 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:04.930
 do so I do not agree with what 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:08.169
 that you raise the teacher of the 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:11.139
 city ​​of tarapoto in a teacher one day 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:13.690
 It took him seconds to get the rabbit out 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.720
 of the spectacular galley beliefs of 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.550
 tie of Peru in Bolivian land serves 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.110
 to motivate the guys that you're going to 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.420
 travel to asunción paraguay 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.060
 undoubtedly and commit them to do the 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.340
 same effort without a doubt 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.050
 there is something positive inside the fight 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.260
 that we have not won and I'm 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.970
 of the 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.740
 and together that we had lost what 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.330
 we will make expected 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.940
 that's already there but we have to go to 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.380
 Paraguay to recover some more 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:46.030
 a tough geographical struggle awaits us 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.980
 would be good afternoons in my house the 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.080
 first football there is something that is 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.640
 stands out from the Bolivian national team or 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.150
 understood that there martino 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.040
 sung in the first time 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.080
 that has not ripped out kingfisher 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.110
 surprised but we hardly knew 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.910
 we knew willow we realized 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.120
 the 20 minutes that Martin arrived to enter 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.460
 because it was heated and obviously 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.820
 I was going to enter we envisioned in the locker room 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.410
 I was going to enter and we had to mark 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.410
 from that point of view there was no 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:19.310
 surprise everything in two if it were 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.310
 initial 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.580
 the press conference of sergio 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.350
 Markarián has answered succinctly 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.550
 but as a group 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.550
 let's say it would seem to me
