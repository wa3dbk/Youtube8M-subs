hello and welcome back to the channel

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.360 
hello and welcome back to the channel
over<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> last<00:00:08.670> few<00:00:09.059> days<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.660> did<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.370> unboxing

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
over the last few days I did a unboxing

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.939 
over the last few days I did a unboxing
of<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.790> SEMA<00:00:12.240> xhc<00:00:13.400> drone<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.710> it's<00:00:16.710> pretty

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
of the SEMA xhc drone and it's pretty

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.130 
of the SEMA xhc drone and it's pretty
much<00:00:17.160> agreed<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.029> camera<00:00:18.930> that's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
much agreed that the camera that's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.330 
much agreed that the camera that's
included<00:00:19.890> with<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.640> SEMA<00:00:21.029> x8c<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:22.080> not<00:00:22.980> really

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
included with the SEMA x8c is not really

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.920 
included with the SEMA x8c is not really
great<00:00:24.830> it's<00:00:25.830> not<00:00:26.070> 1080p<00:00:26.789> produces<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> lot<00:00:27.900> of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
great it's not 1080p produces a lot of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.840 
great it's not 1080p produces a lot of
jell-o<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:30.199> to<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.320> honest<00:00:31.650> let's<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.700> get

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
jell-o and to be honest let's just get

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.810 
jell-o and to be honest let's just get
rid<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:39.590> proper<00:00:40.590> alternative<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
rid of it a proper alternative for the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.619 
rid of it a proper alternative for the
SEMA<00:00:42.090> camera<00:00:42.540> would<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> xiaomi<00:00:44.399> yi

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
SEMA camera would be the xiaomi yi

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.779 
SEMA camera would be the xiaomi yi
action<00:00:45.629> camera<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.219> small<00:00:47.520> it's

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
action camera because it's small it's

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
action camera because it's small it's
light<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.719> 1080p<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:50.850> could<00:00:51.090> take<00:00:51.270> video<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
light it's 1080p it could take video it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.910 
light it's 1080p it could take video it
can<00:00:51.989> take<00:00:52.170> photos

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
can take photos

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
can take photos
it<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.940> take<00:00:54.149> series<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.809> photos<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:56.780> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
it can take series of photos and it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.330 
it can take series of photos and it
actually<00:00:58.320> fits<00:00:58.890> pretty<00:00:59.789> well<00:01:00.199> but<00:01:01.199> how<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.100> we

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
actually fits pretty well but how do we

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.030 
actually fits pretty well but how do we
mount<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.840> solution<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> problem<00:01:04.920> is

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
mount it the solution to the problem is

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.100 
mount it the solution to the problem is
pretty<00:01:05.250> simple<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:06.270> build<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.570> frame<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
pretty simple we build a frame for the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.590 
pretty simple we build a frame for the
camera<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:08.400> protects<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> camera<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
camera that protects the camera and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.350 
camera that protects the camera and
reduces<00:01:10.470> some<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.159> vibrations<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:12.270> are

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
reduces some of the vibrations that are

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.219 
reduces some of the vibrations that are
put<00:01:12.540> forth<00:01:12.780> from<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> drone<00:01:14.630> we<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.900> need<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
put forth from the drone we just need to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.070 
put forth from the drone we just need to
make<00:01:16.350> sure<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.520> new<00:01:17.700> camera<00:01:18.119> mount<00:01:18.330> fits

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
make sure that the new camera mount fits

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.929 
make sure that the new camera mount fits
the<00:01:19.290> old<00:01:19.409> camera<00:01:19.890> mount<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.970> did<00:01:21.119> before

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.780 

the<00:01:26.939> camera<00:01:27.299> mount<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> printed<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.259> PLA<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the camera mount is printed in PLA it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.870 
the camera mount is printed in PLA it
weighs<00:01:30.090> 28<00:01:30.630> point<00:01:31.020> five<00:01:31.229> grams<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.729> can

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
weighs 28 point five grams and it can

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.359 
weighs 28 point five grams and it can
take<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.479> lot<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:34.079> vibration<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.100> put

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
take up a lot of vibration that is put

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.649 
take up a lot of vibration that is put
for<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> drone<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> camera<00:01:38.659> this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
for it from the drone to the camera this

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.370 
for it from the drone to the camera this
minimizes<00:01:40.110> jello<00:01:41.329> or<00:01:42.329> any<00:01:42.689> other<00:01:42.899> effects

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
minimizes jello or any other effects

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.069 
minimizes jello or any other effects
also<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.820> drone<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.420> drop<00:01:45.720> from<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
also if the drone was to drop from the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.289 
also if the drone was to drop from the
sky<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.799> frame<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.579> take<00:01:47.759> quite<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.030> beating

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
sky the frame can take quite a beating

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.840 
sky the frame can take quite a beating
and<00:01:48.689> still<00:01:49.530> keep<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> camera<00:01:50.250> somewhat<00:01:50.610> safe

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and still keep the camera somewhat safe

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.960 
and still keep the camera somewhat safe
one<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> disadvantages<00:01:52.860> from<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.579> action

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
one of the disadvantages from the action

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.459 
one of the disadvantages from the action
cam<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.219> has<00:01:56.460> its<00:01:57.119> buttons<00:01:57.479> all<00:01:58.409> over

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
cam is that it has its buttons all over

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.160 
cam is that it has its buttons all over
the<00:01:59.070> camera<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.420> want<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> mount<00:02:00.899> this

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the camera so if you want to mount this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.030 
the camera so if you want to mount this
to<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> drone<00:02:02.509> we<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.899> somehow<00:02:04.469> make

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
to the drone we have to somehow make

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.249 
to the drone we have to somehow make
sure<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.880> still<00:02:06.180> reach<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.960> buttons

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
sure that we can still reach the buttons

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.830 
sure that we can still reach the buttons
so<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:07.950> all<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> functions<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.509> camera

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
so we have all the functions the camera

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.500 
so we have all the functions the camera
mount<00:02:10.080> has<00:02:10.979> all<00:02:11.280> buttons<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.030> camera

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
mount has all buttons of the camera

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.480 
mount has all buttons of the camera
access

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
access

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.460 
access
there's<00:02:14.490> also<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.970> small<00:02:15.209> extrusion<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
there's also a small extrusion for the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.580 
there's also a small extrusion for the
microphone<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.780> microphone<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.380> not

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
microphone so the microphone is not

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.760 
microphone so the microphone is not
completely<00:02:20.130> covered<00:02:20.610> up<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.290> directed

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
completely covered up and it is directed

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.160 
completely covered up and it is directed
to<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.099> front<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:25.500> start<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:25.950> stop<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.489> video

to the front to start and stop the video

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.070 
to the front to start and stop the video
there's<00:02:28.170> even<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.800> small<00:02:29.400> lever<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.660> can<00:02:30.930> be

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
there's even a small lever that can be

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.309 
there's even a small lever that can be
used<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:32.280> start<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.790> stop<00:02:33.030> recording<00:02:36.319> the
