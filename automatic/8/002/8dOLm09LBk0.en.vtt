00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 and these convictions the minister of the 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.140
 justice warns him to warn 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.670
 organized his insolvency and an offense 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.889
 good evening richard malka thank you for being with 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.090
 we are a lawyer you must 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.349
 specify you are also representative of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 radio france in a lawsuit against 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.619
 diodeed before coming back maybe on 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.970
 the statements of christiane taubira 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.949
 and on that of manual valls a mode 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.930
 this case where is it so I 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.210
 reported to the prosecutor on behalf of radio 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.500
 france skids that had occurred 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.869
 against patrick cohen 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.240
 the prosecutor's office announced as a result of this 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.349
 asked that an investigation was opened 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.510
 a preliminary inquiry 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.640
 so the Swiss procedure going on she 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.070
 will be long but it is necessary because 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.149
 that there are rights to respect and this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.140
 are the same for everyone and there 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.640
 understood for dieudonné 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 as long as the procedure is going on 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.710
 when you say languages ​​why because 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.300
 that it's a fussy procedure 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.829
 difficult then there may be 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.809
 a referral to the court 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.820
 all this takes time there are 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.949
 duke's guarantees of contradictory to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.600
 respect dieudonné can defend himself 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.010
 and so it is normal that it takes 1 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.020
 take a long time 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.250
 just had to give seems seems 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.739
 use a lot in these procedures 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.170
 judicial organized its insolvency 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.240
 is a crime that's what the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.150
 guard of the seals today how does that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.860
 proves itself on a legal plane this is 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.780
 a complicated v10 to establish 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.570
 usually he is he is often 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.520
 involved for fathers as a result of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.439
 divorce who do not pay pensions 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.630
 their wives or for their wives 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.479
 their children and who therefore organize 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.530
 their insolvency and make themselves 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.869
 to be unable to be 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.020
 sought in liability by their 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.590
 wives in this case it turns out when 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.030
 same as this pseudo comedian 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.710
 reap huge revenues 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.860
 places are expensive there is a whole 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.960
 industry that revolves around ce2 of the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.190
 hate and violence that distills at 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.750
 during his shows 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.530
 and oddly he himself does not have a euro 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.700
 when it comes to paying these 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.290
 pecuniary sentences 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.570
 as long as there is a problem on which 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.299
 again justice will investigate 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.340
 because it is abnormal that a citizen does not 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.289
 not pay his fines 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.330
 damages does not pay his 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.070
 taxes since this was also the case 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.200
 so like any citizen 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.019
 dieudonné has to pay when he is 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.690
 condemned to be anti system 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.610
 cisse not paying these convictions 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.440
 then it's against the rule of law 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.580
 then the convictions valero we go the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.890
 remand sentenced eight times 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.700
 relax several times he has for 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.989
 moment not to leave what he had to 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.489
 he did not discharge what they 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.620
 had accumulated total of these 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.980
 convictions 65000 euros of which more than 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.709
 37000 in definitive sentence that is 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.549
 what can the state concretely do I 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.780
 ask the question after the reactions 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.600
 we heard today more 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.160
 overall democracy that consists 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.350
 not to allow the enemies of the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.420
 democracy to wipe the shoes 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.940
 above without any reaction 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.799
 the rule of law to weapons and must 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.200
 use against those who do not 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.910
 do not respect their homework 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.570
 the occurrence there are weapons there are 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.799
 means were prosecuted for organizing 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.450
 insolvency effectively one can 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.109
 pursued continues here in this case the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.829
 public ministry agree the parking 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.519
 officially all that no complaints 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.410
 has not been filed 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.239
 no but the Ministry of Justice has 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.850
 obviously the power to trigger 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.230
 investigations against any citizen 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.810
 who does not respect his homework 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.609
 a citizen who does not pay his taxes he 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.920
 is pursued by the services of bercy 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.989
 a citizen who does not pay his 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.380
 convictions also dieudonné must 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.480
 being 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.519
 a citizen who uses donations that 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.470
 launch subscriptions to pay its 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.859
 fines as dieudonné did it there 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.390
 also it's a dedication so there's a whole 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.129
 set of offenses for which he 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.440
 could perfectly be pursued 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:46.069
 you believe it's I believe these 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.349
 people there who trade this 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.760
 hate first do business and so 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.349
 they are sensitive to the argument of the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.900
 wallet is so these are 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.300
 excellent actions than engaging 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.010
 prosecutions and seek to make them 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.239
 pay on that land to which they 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.340
 are extremely sensitive 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.440
 sir a bala m bala is not a 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.819
 character of the interested parties entrusts he 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.470
 how did he do so far to 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.629
 do not pay it seems incredible 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.640
 it sounds incredible but if you 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.170
 organize so that this 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.090
 be your wife they are 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.459
 owners of all who garners 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.870
 all the recipes and you're going 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.159
 you arrange to never have 1 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.659
 euros in your account 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:23.020
 then there is nothing to you will take 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:25.400
 can not tend to 9 is what the state has 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.110
 maybe too late in this case where 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.669
 is it finally common in 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.440
 this type of case that the fines are not 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.110
 not paid or unpaid remain so 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.210
 general no it was not common listen 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.770
 I believe that through the reactions of 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.789
 manual valls and christiane taubira 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.760
 today these two ministers say 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.289
 with a certain courage and a great sense 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.200
 responsibilities and so 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.330
 remarkably written and think this 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.159
 morning even for christiane taubira that 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.650
 it is our humanity to all that is 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:57.250
 assaulted by these words of sir 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.380
 m'bala m'bala is that we must react 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.030
 when someone goes on stage to 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.419
 regret the disappearance of rooms in 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.370
 gas 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.050
 because it is there and it will take it 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.760
 should also be addressed 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.979
 spectators who gives money for 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.320
 go laugh about these here and then 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.760
 find their children and watch them 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.669
 how is it possible in a 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.840
 civilization in a democracy 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.450
 to accept that without reacting 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.419
 democracy must make use of all 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.390
 his weapons so as not to allow 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.190
 propagators of hatred and violence from 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.289
 do their grim work because 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.539
 these words at one time turn into 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.919
 acts always thanks and charm to cannes 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.300
 came back on this plateau tonight in 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.300
 a moment all the news of the day
