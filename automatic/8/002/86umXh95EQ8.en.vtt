00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
here we have a hard drive bay they pop

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.940 
here we have a hard drive bay they pop
out<00:00:43.730> let's<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:44.910> ahead<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.260> it's<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.379> wheels<00:00:46.620> so

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
out let's go ahead and it's on wheels so

out let's go ahead and it's on wheels so
it<00:00:47.100> rolls<00:00:47.309> nicely<00:00:52.610> ok<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.840> these<00:00:54.840> hard<00:00:55.110> drives

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it rolls nicely ok so these hard drives

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.750 
it rolls nicely ok so these hard drives
are<00:00:55.680> actually<00:00:56.670> locked<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.090> place<00:00:59.090> takes<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.210> key

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
are actually locked in place takes a key

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.240 
are actually locked in place takes a key
there's<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:02.910> dell<00:01:03.149> key<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.199> here's<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.799> del

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
there's my dell key so here's the del

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.590 
there's my dell key so here's the del
key<00:01:05.299> just<00:01:06.299> stick<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.630> right<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.409> slot

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
pentium three Zeon's there are 7 100

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.970 
pentium three Zeon's there are 7 100
megahertz<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.880> ram<00:03:16.090> board<00:03:16.560> which<00:03:17.560> can

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
megahertz and the ram board which can

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.129 
megahertz and the ram board which can
support<00:03:18.160> up<00:03:18.579> to<00:03:19.290> 16<00:03:20.290> memory<00:03:20.829> modules

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
support up to 16 memory modules

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.379 
support up to 16 memory modules
currently<00:03:23.139> I<00:03:23.170> have<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.620> halfway<00:03:24.040> full<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.790> it

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
currently I have it halfway full and it

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.110 
currently I have it halfway full and it
has<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.569> total<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:26.079> two<00:03:26.350> gigabytes<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:26.889> RAM<00:03:27.120> so

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
has a total of two gigabytes of RAM so

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.360 
has a total of two gigabytes of RAM so
if<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.389> can<00:03:28.540> find<00:03:28.769> some<00:03:29.769> more<00:03:29.950> i<00:03:30.010> can<00:03:30.190> probably

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
if I can find some more i can probably

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.970 
if I can find some more i can probably
max<00:03:30.639> it<00:03:30.790> out<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.060> four<00:03:31.269> gigs<00:03:31.510> ram<00:03:31.810> which<00:03:32.799> is

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
max it out to four gigs ram which is

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.809 
max it out to four gigs ram which is
plenty<00:03:33.400> for<00:03:34.019> what<00:03:35.019> I'm<00:03:35.139> doing

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.509 

there's<00:03:38.689> a<00:03:38.749> little<00:03:38.930> air<00:03:39.079> flow<00:03:39.459> kind<00:03:40.459> of

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
there's a little air flow kind of

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.379 
there's a little air flow kind of
directs<00:03:40.849> the<00:03:40.999> heir<00:03:41.469> to<00:03:42.469> the<00:03:42.590> CPUs<00:03:43.099> and<00:03:43.389> there

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
directs the heir to the CPUs and there

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.599 
directs the heir to the CPUs and there
you<00:03:44.510> can<00:03:44.540> see<00:03:44.659> part<00:03:45.079> of<00:03:45.109> the<00:03:45.170> motherboard<00:03:48.609> it's

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
you can see part of the motherboard it's

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.949 
you can see part of the motherboard it's
very<00:03:49.879> neat<00:03:50.689> system<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:52.430> this<00:03:52.939> surprising<00:03:53.900> a

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
very neat system and this surprising a

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.209 
very neat system and this surprising a
lot<00:03:54.079> of<00:03:54.170> these<00:03:54.260> are<00:03:54.469> ending<00:03:54.709> up<00:03:54.799> in<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:54.980> dump

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:55.219 
lot of these are ending up in the dump

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:57.190 
lot of these are ending up in the dump
right<00:03:55.400> now<00:03:55.579> because<00:03:55.969> people<00:03:56.689> are<00:03:56.780> upgrading

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
right now because people are upgrading

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.530 
right now because people are upgrading
to<00:03:57.230> newer<00:03:57.920> faster<00:03:58.219> machines<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.239> are<00:03:59.299> a<00:03:59.389> lot

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
to newer faster machines that are a lot

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.780 
to newer faster machines that are a lot
cheaper<00:03:59.859> you<00:04:00.859> can<00:04:00.889> usually<00:04:01.159> get<00:04:01.459> one<00:04:01.609> of<00:04:01.700> these

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
cheaper you can usually get one of these

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.899 
cheaper you can usually get one of these
for<00:04:01.849> free<00:04:02.269> or<00:04:02.569> almost<00:04:02.930> no<00:04:03.439> cost<00:04:06.189> on<00:04:07.189> the<00:04:07.730> back

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
for free or almost no cost on the back

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.459 
for free or almost no cost on the back
of<00:04:07.939> the<00:04:08.239> server<00:04:08.629> we<00:04:09.260> have<00:04:09.530> our<00:04:10.060> power<00:04:11.060> supplies

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:11.469 
of the server we have our power supplies

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.349 
of the server we have our power supplies
there's<00:04:12.469> three<00:04:12.919> power<00:04:13.310> supplies<00:04:13.639> all<00:04:13.939> hot

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
there's three power supplies all hot

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:24.390 
there's three power supplies all hot
swappable<00:04:20.289> there<00:04:21.289> i<00:04:21.500> think<00:04:21.739> 320<00:04:22.729> watts<00:04:22.940> each

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
swappable there i think 320 watts each

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.300 
swappable there i think 320 watts each
and<00:04:26.050> this<00:04:27.050> thing<00:04:27.229> will<00:04:27.440> run<00:04:27.590> just<00:04:27.830> fine<00:04:28.009> with

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
and this thing will run just fine with

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.439 
and this thing will run just fine with
one<00:04:28.520> power<00:04:28.759> supply<00:04:29.090> connected<00:04:30.970> so<00:04:31.970> currently

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
one power supply connected so currently

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.390 
one power supply connected so currently
I<00:04:32.539> just<00:04:32.810> use<00:04:32.960> one<00:04:33.849> and<00:04:34.849> in<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:36.009> once<00:04:37.009> it's<00:04:37.160> up<00:04:37.310> and

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
I just use one and in a once it's up and

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.390 
I just use one and in a once it's up and
running<00:04:37.490> as<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:37.940> dedicated<00:04:38.840> server<00:04:39.289> I<00:04:39.770> am
