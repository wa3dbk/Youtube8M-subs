 I got a sample of gaming mouse 300 m 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:19.000
 Of course I would like to open it elsewhere 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.580
 I saw it somewhere in the right tmk ergonomics design 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.270
 It is more than day 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.270

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.410
 Hmm 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.610

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:44.909
 Internal use does not have very It is a simple entered Toka driver disk 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.909
 The game itself is a cougar 300 with just one more manual 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.390
 Type of color orange 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.390
 The center has a black attitude and has become orange plavan 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.130
 This course centers are in the eye load change çˆ»Nohen turbo Tanto a mart how 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.740
 There is a click 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.090
 I want to left 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.840
 There is that side button 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.700
 Normal in size 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.069
 It does about the same and hit the right horse 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.069
 What is this button behind 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.120

 Mode cycle not 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.750
 Is placed 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.050
 I buy it now and keep playing, but the shape that Amon passes is 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.060
 This is a little bothersome when I go home as it is different from other manufacturers 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.940
 unknown 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.940
 There was also a form that substitutes the corresponding mouse sole 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.050
 Easy to pull out because the large knob turn to part of with the usb 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.820
 It's in the back 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.820
 Unfortunately it is human plating processing 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.500
 The rest is true, even if it is a narrow usb port, it can be used with other usb terminals. 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.500
 May interfere with 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.540
 Well usb cable is cloth 1001 shaped 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.490
 It is hard to get involved 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.750
 It's just a bit hard 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.750
 Because Seki is hard 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.300
 Depending on the environment for a while 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.970
 Water still remains 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:04.360
 As there is cable 1.8m, maa 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.660
 It will be the place where the general long and short was not gone 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.660
 Yup 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.690
 For now, I will end it here in the form of the open video more than this time 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:19.620
