what<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.760> heard<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.239> transmission<00:00:54.870> what

what you heard on that transmission what

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
what you heard on that transmission what
happened<00:00:56.539> well<00:00:57.539> now<00:00:58.340> Waller<00:00:59.340> I'm<00:00:59.609> afraid<00:00:59.910> that

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
happened well now Waller I'm afraid that

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.930 
happened well now Waller I'm afraid that
unless<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.750> was<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.039> really<00:01:02.430> couldn't<00:01:02.670> say

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
unless I was there I really couldn't say

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.810 
unless I was there I really couldn't say
from<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.510> bits<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.650> information<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.369> got<00:01:05.549> back

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
from the bits of information we got back

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.240 
from the bits of information we got back
here<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:07.290> it'd<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.770> pure<00:01:08.010> guesswork

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
here I think it'd just be pure guesswork

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.640 
here I think it'd just be pure guesswork
to<00:01:08.820> try<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.270> estimate<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:09.930> had<00:01:10.229> happened<00:01:10.590> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to try and estimate what had happened in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.929 
to try and estimate what had happened in
the<00:01:10.680> vehicle<00:01:12.140> well<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.860> did<00:01:14.100> seem<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.880> have

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the vehicle well it did seem to have

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
the vehicle well it did seem to have
something<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.689> their<00:01:16.140> attitude

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
something to do with their attitude

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.649 
something to do with their attitude
however<00:01:17.009> did<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:17.520> well<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.450> unsure

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
however did it not well I'm unsure

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.200 
however did it not well I'm unsure
whether<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.710> their<00:01:20.100> attitude<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:20.970> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
whether it was their attitude or it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.810 
whether it was their attitude or it
could<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.509> been<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> eight<00:01:22.740> ball<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.490> that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
could have been the eight ball here that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.210 
could have been the eight ball here that
was<00:01:24.060> tumbling<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.290> something<00:01:25.799> else<00:01:25.979> depending

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
was tumbling or something else depending

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.730 
was tumbling or something else depending
on<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.880> switched<00:01:27.270> from<00:01:27.570> one<00:01:28.350> computer

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
on how they switched from one computer

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.330 
on how they switched from one computer
to<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.159> other<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.700> could<00:01:30.479> explain<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.829> Nelson

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
to the other I could explain with Nelson

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.730 
to the other I could explain with Nelson
how<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.790> intended<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> make<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.229> burn<00:01:34.470> if

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
how they intended to make that burn if

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.270 
how they intended to make that burn if
that<00:01:34.890> would<00:01:35.009> help

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
that would help

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
that would help
well<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.970> might<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.600> were<00:01:36.659> talking

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
well it might they were talking

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530 
well it might they were talking
considerably<00:01:37.650> about<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.280> eggs<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.060> abort

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
abort guidance system yes but you might

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.020 
abort guidance system yes but you might
explain<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.720> us<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.079> how<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:44.009> plugged<00:01:44.790> in

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
explain to us and how that is plugged in

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.819

know yet I don't think Walter whether or
not<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.810> was<00:03:00.960> necessary<00:03:01.530> for<00:03:01.590> Tom<00:03:01.950> Stafford<00:03:02.430> to

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
not it was necessary for Tom Stafford to

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.440 
not it was necessary for Tom Stafford to
override<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.990> abort<00:03:04.710> guidance<00:03:05.130> system<00:03:05.520> when

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
override the abort guidance system when

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.420 
override the abort guidance system when
that<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.830> gyration<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.950> believe<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.280> was

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
that the gyration I believe it was

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.970 
that the gyration I believe it was
described<00:03:08.880> as<00:03:09.090> when<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.480> occurred<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.800> did

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
described as when it occurred it did

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.240 
described as when it occurred it did
occur<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.310> think<00:03:11.730> right<00:03:11.970> at<00:03:12.150> staging<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:13.250> that's

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
occur I think right at staging so that's

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.490 
occur I think right at staging so that's
that's<00:03:14.550> that's<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.600> point<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:15.930> time<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.200> the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
that's that's the point in time that the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.310 
that's that's the point in time that the
problem<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:18.020> guess<00:03:19.020> there<00:03:19.200> will<00:03:19.290> be

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
problem is but I guess there will be

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.230 
problem is but I guess there will be
some<00:03:19.650> head<00:03:20.040> scratching<00:03:20.460> for<00:03:20.580> some<00:03:20.760> time<00:03:21.090> to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
some head scratching for some time to

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.230 
some head scratching for some time to
come<00:03:21.270> as<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.840> exactly<00:03:21.960> what<00:03:22.470> happened<00:03:23.240> imagine

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
come as to exactly what happened imagine

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.090 
come as to exactly what happened imagine
not<00:03:24.330> only<00:03:24.390> some<00:03:24.750> head<00:03:24.900> scratching<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:25.680> I

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
not only some head scratching but I

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.780 
not only some head scratching but I
would<00:03:26.580> think<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:28.010> until<00:03:29.010> there<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> very

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
would think that until there is a very

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.780 
would think that until there is a very
clear<00:03:30.210> readout<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.690> what<00:03:31.200> happened<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.950> why

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
clear readout of what happened and why

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.330 
clear readout of what happened and why
it<00:03:32.820> happened<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.680> how<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.860> can<00:03:35.040> be<00:03:35.220> prevented

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
it happened and how it can be prevented

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.940 
it happened and how it can be prevented
from<00:03:35.730> happening<00:03:36.090> again<00:03:36.270> that<00:03:37.170> for<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.740> first

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
from happening again that for the first

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.490 
from happening again that for the first
time<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.580> flight<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.820> Apollo<00:03:39.060> 10<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:40.470> see

time and the flight of Apollo 10 we see

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.740

Bruce<00:04:17.190> you've<00:04:17.910> heard<00:04:18.090> something<00:04:18.510> of<00:04:18.630> around

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
Bruce you've heard something of around

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.650 
Bruce you've heard something of around
there<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.770> would<00:04:20.370> indicate<00:04:20.609> how<00:04:21.150> seriously

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
there that would indicate how seriously

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.380 
there that would indicate how seriously
they<00:04:21.840> take<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.200> problem<00:04:22.970> they<00:04:23.970> take<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.330> very

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
they take this problem they take it very

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.210 
they take this problem they take it very
seriously<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.350> think<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:25.740> hit<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:25.950> nail

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
seriously and I think you hit the nail

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.110 
seriously and I think you hit the nail
on<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.460> head<00:04:26.729> when<00:04:26.910> you

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
on the head when you

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.000 
on the head when you
said<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.479> for<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:27.960> first<00:04:28.199> time<00:04:28.410> something's

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
said that for the first time something's

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.460 
said that for the first time something's
come<00:04:29.220> up<00:04:29.250> which<00:04:29.910> really<00:04:29.940> could<00:04:30.720> change<00:04:31.080> the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
come up which really could change the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.670 
come up which really could change the
plans<00:04:31.740> for<00:04:32.100> Apollo<00:04:32.610> 11<00:04:33.350> obviously<00:04:34.350> nobody

here<00:04:34.979> is<00:04:35.130> sure<00:04:35.340> yet<00:04:35.550> what<00:04:35.699> happened<00:04:36.120> either

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
here is sure yet what happened either

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.300 
here is sure yet what happened either
but<00:04:36.630> they<00:04:37.050> are<00:04:37.229> sure<00:04:37.470> about<00:04:37.500> what<00:04:37.979> they<00:04:38.130> want

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
but they are sure about what they want

on the returning trip and once they're

on the returning trip and once they're
back<00:04:43.979> on<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.250> ground<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.850> they<00:04:45.330> want<00:04:45.540> to

back on the ground and they want to

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.110 
back on the ground and they want to
monitor<00:04:46.020> all<00:04:46.290> of<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.710> electronic<00:04:47.610> data<00:04:47.880> the

monitor all of the electronic data the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.510 
monitor all of the electronic data the
various<00:04:48.479> bits<00:04:49.199> of<00:04:49.500> tracking<00:04:49.770> information

various bits of tracking information

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.550 
various bits of tracking information
that<00:04:50.669> come<00:04:50.850> down<00:04:51.000> here<00:04:51.210> that's<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.870> process<00:04:52.080> as

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
that come down here that's a process as

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.800 
that come down here that's a process as
you<00:04:52.680> know<00:04:52.710> order<00:04:53.220> that<00:04:53.370> takes<00:04:53.610> some<00:04:53.910> time<00:04:53.940> two

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
you know order that takes some time two

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.230 
you know order that takes some time two
or<00:04:54.960> three<00:04:55.139> weeks<00:04:55.380> usually<00:04:55.680> so<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.820> think<00:04:56.940> it's

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
or three weeks usually so I think it's

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.030 
or three weeks usually so I think it's
fair<00:04:57.449> to<00:04:57.479> say<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.560> future<00:04:58.889> of

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
fair to say that the the future of

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.129 
fair to say that the the future of
Apollo<00:04:59.340> 11<00:04:59.789> is<00:04:59.910> a<00:04:59.940> moon<00:05:00.210> landing<00:05:00.690> mission<00:05:00.720> is

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
Apollo 11 is a moon landing mission is

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.159 
Apollo 11 is a moon landing mission is
in<00:05:01.440> doubt<00:05:01.710> now<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.490> it's<00:05:03.419> going<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.750> be<00:05:03.870> some

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
in doubt now and it's going to be some

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.439 
in doubt now and it's going to be some
substantial<00:05:04.500> period<00:05:05.340> of<00:05:05.430> time<00:05:05.699> before<00:05:06.030> we

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
substantial period of time before we

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.300 
substantial period of time before we
know<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.260> indeed<00:05:07.590> before<00:05:08.100> the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
know and and indeed before the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.550 
know and and indeed before the
directories<00:05:09.090> of<00:05:09.300> this<00:05:09.419> NASA<00:05:09.690> program<00:05:10.289> know

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
directories of this NASA program know

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.129 
directories of this NASA program know
which<00:05:10.800> way<00:05:10.979> it's<00:05:11.160> going<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.490> go<00:05:11.870> this<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:12.930> the

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
which way it's going to go this is the

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.439 
which way it's going to go this is the
first<00:05:13.320> thing<00:05:14.130> like<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.430> that's<00:05:14.880> happened<00:05:15.270> up

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
first thing like that that's happened up

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:16.640 
first thing like that that's happened up
till<00:05:15.690> now<00:05:15.870> it's<00:05:16.110> been<00:05:16.260> pretty<00:05:16.440> much<00:05:16.530> a

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
till now it's been pretty much a

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.159 
till now it's been pretty much a
textbook<00:05:17.039> flight<00:05:17.520> they<00:05:18.240> may<00:05:18.449> have<00:05:18.539> lost<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:18.990> few

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
textbook flight they may have lost a few

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.779 
textbook flight they may have lost a few
photographs<00:05:19.380> but<00:05:19.919> the<00:05:20.070> moon<00:05:20.190> mappers<00:05:20.639> say

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
photographs but the moon mappers say

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.820 
photographs but the moon mappers say
they<00:05:20.940> have<00:05:21.060> a<00:05:21.090> lot<00:05:21.300> of<00:05:21.389> those<00:05:21.570> anyway<00:05:22.020> this<00:05:22.680> is

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
they have a lot of those anyway this is

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.620 
they have a lot of those anyway this is
for<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:23.160> first<00:05:23.370> time<00:05:23.580> it's<00:05:23.850> a<00:05:23.940> real<00:05:24.330> serious

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
for the first time it's a real serious

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.580 
for the first time it's a real serious
worry<00:05:25.610> Bruce<00:05:26.810> it<00:05:27.810> is<00:05:27.960> true<00:05:28.169> of<00:05:28.289> course<00:05:28.530> that

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
worry Bruce it is true of course that

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.659 
worry Bruce it is true of course that
when<00:05:28.949> they<00:05:29.240> blast<00:05:30.240> off<00:05:30.539> from<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:31.110> moon

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669

on a stable platform on the moon and if
this<00:05:37.680> if<00:05:38.460> this<00:05:38.789> was<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.360> malfunction<00:05:40.050> tonight

this if this was a malfunction tonight

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.560 
this if this was a malfunction tonight
it<00:05:41.220> was<00:05:41.340> directly<00:05:41.760> connected<00:05:42.030> with<00:05:42.389> the

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
it was directly connected with the

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.170 
it was directly connected with the

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
separation from the ascent stage then

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.670 
separation from the ascent stage then
that<00:05:45.479> may<00:05:45.690> be<00:05:45.720> considered<00:05:46.349> when<00:05:46.500> Houston

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
that may be considered when Houston

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.890 
that may be considered when Houston
begins<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.460> assess<00:05:47.880> all<00:05:48.090> of<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.360> data<00:05:48.570> and

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
begins to assess all of the data and

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.070 
begins to assess all of the data and
gets<00:05:49.410> the<00:05:49.620> debriefing<00:05:50.280> from<00:05:50.310> these

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
gets the debriefing from these

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.420 
gets the debriefing from these

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
that the solid platform for the ascent

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.770 
that the solid platform for the ascent

but<00:06:06.660> the<00:06:06.870> you<00:06:07.139> know<00:06:07.229> we're<00:06:07.410> not<00:06:07.560> sure<00:06:07.860> yet<00:06:07.889> it

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
but the you know we're not sure yet it

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.460 
but the you know we're not sure yet it
could<00:06:08.880> have<00:06:09.000> been<00:06:09.120> an<00:06:09.240> attitude<00:06:09.720> problem<00:06:09.750> and

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
could have been an attitude problem and

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.210 
could have been an attitude problem and
if<00:06:10.560> it's<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:11.430> attitude<00:06:11.849> in<00:06:12.000> the<00:06:12.090> ascent<00:06:12.510> stage

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
if it's the attitude in the ascent stage

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.379 
if it's the attitude in the ascent stage
then<00:06:14.220> it<00:06:14.250> seems<00:06:14.580> to<00:06:14.639> me<00:06:14.789> they're<00:06:14.940> in<00:06:15.030> trouble

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
then it seems to me they're in trouble

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.180 
then it seems to me they're in trouble
because<00:06:15.510> you've<00:06:15.840> you're<00:06:16.500> on<00:06:16.650> the<00:06:16.800> surface

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
because you've you're on the surface

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.620 
because you've you're on the surface
you've<00:06:17.400> really<00:06:17.669> got<00:06:17.820> to<00:06:17.940> start<00:06:18.120> going<00:06:18.330> pretty

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
you've really got to start going pretty

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.520 
you've really got to start going pretty
well<00:06:18.720> straight<00:06:19.289> up<00:06:19.849> that<00:06:20.849> right<00:06:21.720> I<00:06:22.020> didn't

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
well straight up that right I didn't

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.409 
well straight up that right I didn't
mean<00:06:22.680> to<00:06:22.889> suggest<00:06:23.340> that<00:06:23.789> all<00:06:24.090> was<00:06:24.389> well

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
mean to suggest that all was well

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.750 
mean to suggest that all was well
because<00:06:25.229> they<00:06:25.620> they<00:06:25.889> will<00:06:26.070> have<00:06:26.280> a<00:06:26.310> stable

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
because they they will have a stable

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.250 
because they they will have a stable
platform<00:06:26.940> but<00:06:27.479> it<00:06:27.599> is<00:06:27.720> one<00:06:28.080> of<00:06:28.110> the

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
platform but it is one of the

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.560 
platform but it is one of the
considerations<00:06:28.919> I'm<00:06:29.130> sure<00:06:29.400> that<00:06:29.610> will<00:06:29.820> be<00:06:30.030> fed

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
considerations I'm sure that will be fed

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.510 
considerations I'm sure that will be fed
into<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:30.870> mix<00:06:31.199> as<00:06:31.380> they<00:06:31.560> say<00:06:31.830> I<00:06:32.070> hope<00:06:32.340> you're

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
into the mix as they say I hope you're

Kirstin is just message the lunar module
that<00:06:43.200> they<00:06:43.320> already<00:06:43.530> have<00:06:43.890> analyzed<00:06:44.370> the

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
at staging and they believed it was

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.570 
at staging and they believed it was
because<00:06:49.200> one<00:06:49.650> of<00:06:49.680> the<00:06:49.830> switches<00:06:50.280> and<00:06:50.310> the

because one of the switches and the

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.340 
because one of the switches and the

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
lunar module was thrown into the wrong

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.350

called<00:06:54.660> if<00:06:55.170> that<00:06:55.410> analysis<00:06:56.280> proves<00:06:56.550> to<00:06:56.700> be

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
called if that analysis proves to be

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.420 
called if that analysis proves to be
correct<00:06:57.210> then<00:06:57.480> presumably<00:06:58.110> all<00:06:58.770> will<00:06:59.010> be<00:06:59.160> well
