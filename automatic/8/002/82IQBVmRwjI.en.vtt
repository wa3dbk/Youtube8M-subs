the<00:01:02.070> front<00:01:02.310> crawl<00:01:02.550> uses<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.000> flutter<00:01:03.239> kick<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the front crawl uses a flutter kick and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.840 
the front crawl uses a flutter kick and
it<00:01:03.989> also<00:01:04.110> uses<00:01:04.380> an<00:01:04.650> alternating<00:01:05.220> arm<00:01:05.400> motion

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
it also uses an alternating arm motion

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.760 
it also uses an alternating arm motion
when<00:01:06.510> you're<00:01:06.630> doing<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:06.869> arms<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.500> want<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
bring one arm out of the water at a time

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.430 
bring one arm out of the water at a time
and<00:01:09.600> enter<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.800> smooth<00:01:11.160> entry<00:01:12.229> just<00:01:13.229> like

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
and enter with a smooth entry just like

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.859 
and enter with a smooth entry just like

this it's important that you're not
smacking<00:01:16.410> the<00:01:16.530> water<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.250> instead<00:01:17.580> that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
smacking the water but instead that

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.790 
smacking the water but instead that
you're<00:01:17.850> cutting<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:19.229> other<00:01:19.350> thing<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
elbows up high just like this so once

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.999 
elbows up high just like this so once
you're<00:01:24.900> comfortable<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> glide<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
you're comfortable with the glide and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.290 
you're comfortable with the glide and
you're<00:01:26.190> comfortable<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> glide<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
you're comfortable with the glide and

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.020 
you're comfortable with the glide and
the<00:01:27.509> kick<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:28.229> start<00:01:28.619> adding<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> arms<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the kick then start adding the arms that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:42.779 
the kick then start adding the arms that
will<00:01:30.150> look<00:01:30.300> something<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.690> this

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.249 

once<00:01:43.789> you<00:01:43.909> have<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.180> arms<00:01:44.509> down<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:45.140> may

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
once you have the arms down you may

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.929 
once you have the arms down you may
wonder<00:01:45.530> how<00:01:45.890> are<00:01:46.280> your<00:01:46.369> squeeze<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.729> breathe

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
wonder how are your squeeze to breathe

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.240 
wonder how are your squeeze to breathe
for<00:01:47.750> breathing<00:01:48.229> there's<00:01:48.799> a<00:01:48.860> couple<00:01:49.159> of

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
for breathing there's a couple of

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.830 
for breathing there's a couple of
different<00:01:49.549> ways<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:49.820> can<00:01:49.939> do<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.810> can

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
different ways you can do it you can

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.690 
different ways you can do it you can
either<00:01:51.110> pop<00:01:51.380> your<00:01:51.590> head<00:01:51.710> in<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.979> read<00:01:52.159> or<00:01:52.549> you

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
either pop your head in to read or you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.419 
either pop your head in to read or you
can<00:01:52.850> turn<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.360> side<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.740> best<00:01:54.979> way<00:01:55.189> is

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
can turn it to the side the best way is

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.830 
can turn it to the side the best way is
to<00:01:55.460> just<00:01:55.729> rotate<00:01:55.939> your<00:01:56.270> head<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.600> side

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
to just rotate your head to the side

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.350 
to just rotate your head to the side
this<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.289> called<00:01:57.439> rotary<00:01:57.950> breathing<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.119> for

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
this is called rotary breathing so for

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.819 
this is called rotary breathing so for
rotary<00:01:59.600> breathing<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.409> want<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.619> pick<00:02:00.799> a
