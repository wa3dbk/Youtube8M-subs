00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
come on ok almost 300 meters 300 plus

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.600 
come on ok almost 300 meters 300 plus
meters<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.509> are<00:01:42.720> still<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.470> 100<00:01:44.460> meter

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
meters and we are still going 100 meter

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.010 
meters and we are still going 100 meter
I<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:44.880> about<00:01:45.000> 100<00:01:45.570> meters<00:01:45.659> away<00:01:45.899> from

400<00:01:46.740> which<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.189> level<00:01:47.670> two<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.869> we

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
400 which is that level two can we

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.660 
400 which is that level two can we
actually<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.409> come<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.710> come<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.040> ok<00:01:50.490> here

now<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:53.909> are<00:01:54.060> heading<00:01:54.509> toward<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> six

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
now we are heading toward the six

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.429 
now we are heading toward the six
unlimited<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.210> actually<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
unlimited and we actually do that in the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.770 
unlimited and we actually do that in the
second<00:01:59.009> round<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.630> is

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
second round if we can then this is

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.389 
second round if we can then this is
going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> fastest<00:02:01.680> episode<00:02:02.219> ever<00:02:02.369> i

was hoping to do it like in under two

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.899 
was hoping to do it like in under two
minutes<00:02:03.899> what<00:02:04.829> something<00:02:05.340> i<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.790> is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
there good good good good ok here we go

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.720 
there good good good good ok here we go
right<00:02:15.900> come<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.140> go<00:02:16.709> forward<00:02:17.069> not<00:02:17.250> backward

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
right come on go forward not backward

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.180 
right come on go forward not backward
forward<00:02:18.150> all<00:02:18.780> right<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.560> he's<00:02:19.680> bit<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.920> speed

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
forward all right and he's bit of speed

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.940 
forward all right and he's bit of speed
and<00:02:21.000> here<00:02:21.239> we<00:02:21.360> go<00:02:21.390> right<00:02:21.720> good<00:02:22.020> good<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.920> I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
and here we go right good good so I

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.430 
and here we go right good good so I
think<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.520> tactic<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.090> saying<00:02:24.510> down<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
think the tactic is saying down on the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.830 
think the tactic is saying down on the
ground<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.760> longer<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.390> stay<00:02:27.540> up<00:02:27.569> in

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
ground the longer that you stay up in

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.690 
ground the longer that you stay up in
the<00:02:27.870> air<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.410> lose<00:02:28.650> control<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.190> lose<00:02:29.400> speed

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
the air you lose control you lose speed

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.369 
the air you lose control you lose speed
and<00:02:30.000> then<00:02:30.150> when<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.390> go<00:02:30.510> down<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.900> can't<00:02:31.200> go

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
and then when you go down you can't go

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.160 
and then when you go down you can't go
uphill<00:02:31.590> anymore<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.450> my<00:02:33.599> target<00:02:33.840> now

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
uphill anymore so this is my target now

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.229 
uphill anymore so this is my target now
is<00:02:34.200> actually<00:02:34.530> just<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:35.069> doubt<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.610> would<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.209> to
