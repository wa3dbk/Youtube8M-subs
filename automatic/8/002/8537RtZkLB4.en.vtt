00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
other thing about making these marinated

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.840 
other thing about making these marinated
dried<00:05:27.690> tomatoes<00:05:28.230> is<00:05:28.440> I<00:05:28.740> keep<00:05:29.010> them<00:05:29.160> all<00:05:29.400> year

dried tomatoes is I keep them all year
round<00:05:30.110> so<00:05:31.110> sometimes<00:05:31.320> what<00:05:31.800> happens<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:32.340> the

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
round so sometimes what happens to the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.090 
round so sometimes what happens to the
herbs<00:05:32.640> is<00:05:32.970> they<00:05:33.180> get<00:05:33.360> really<00:05:34.020> dark<00:05:34.350> from

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
herbs is they get really dark from

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.710 
herbs is they get really dark from
sitting<00:05:35.430> in<00:05:35.550> there<00:05:35.730> and<00:05:35.940> then<00:05:36.030> I<00:05:36.060> fished<00:05:36.510> them

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
sitting in there and then I fished them

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.920 
sitting in there and then I fished them
out<00:05:36.840> as<00:05:37.140> well<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:37.830> put<00:05:38.580> them<00:05:38.790> on<00:05:38.940> pizzas<00:05:39.330> and

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
out as well and put them on pizzas and

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.480 
out as well and put them on pizzas and
they<00:05:40.290> just<00:05:40.560> give<00:05:40.740> so<00:05:41.160> much<00:05:41.760> flavor<00:05:43.130> okay<00:05:44.130> so<00:05:44.190> we

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
they just give so much flavor okay so we

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.280 
they just give so much flavor okay so we
can<00:05:44.700> pour<00:05:44.970> in<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:46.020> olive<00:05:46.350> oil<00:05:46.530> now<00:05:47.750> or<00:05:48.750> if<00:05:49.110> you

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
can pour in the olive oil now or if you

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.830 
can pour in the olive oil now or if you
have<00:05:49.530> some<00:05:50.040> flavored<00:05:50.550> oil<00:05:50.760> already<00:05:51.210> made<00:05:51.510> like

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
have some flavored oil already made like

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.230 
have some flavored oil already made like

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
maybe you have some garlic scape oil you

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.690 
maybe you have some garlic scape oil you
could<00:05:54.420> add<00:05:54.630> that<00:05:54.900> right<00:05:55.110> in<00:05:55.380> as<00:05:55.650> well<00:05:55.860> again

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
could add that right in as well again

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.000 
could add that right in as well again
leaving<00:05:57.150> about<00:05:57.419> an<00:05:57.780> inch<00:05:58.410> of<00:05:58.620> head<00:05:58.830> space

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
leaving about an inch of head space

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.820 
leaving about an inch of head space
usually<00:05:59.940> for<00:06:00.419> most<00:06:00.450> jars<00:06:01.020> that<00:06:01.140> means<00:06:01.560> where

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
usually for most jars that means where

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.909 
usually for most jars that means where
the<00:06:02.010> ring<00:06:02.280> would<00:06:02.490> go<00:06:02.640> around<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.270> and<00:06:03.919> that's

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
the ring would go around it and that's

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.560 
the ring would go around it and that's
it<00:06:06.050> so<00:06:07.050> how<00:06:07.320> do<00:06:07.380> you<00:06:07.560> know<00:06:07.770> like<00:06:08.130> what<00:06:08.400> herbs<00:06:08.669> to

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
it so how do you know like what herbs to

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.980 
it so how do you know like what herbs to
mix<00:06:09.780> and<00:06:09.960> match<00:06:10.169> I<00:06:10.560> mean<00:06:11.280> is<00:06:11.550> it<00:06:12.120> is<00:06:12.510> it<00:06:12.720> really

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
mix and match I mean is it is it really

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.320 
mix and match I mean is it is it really
