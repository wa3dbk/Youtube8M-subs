okay<00:00:06.050> so<00:00:06.110> now<00:00:06.410> we're<00:00:06.590> going<00:00:06.680> to<00:00:06.800> look<00:00:06.980> at<00:00:07.190> some

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
okay so now we're going to look at some

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.850 
okay so now we're going to look at some
possible<00:00:08.270> ways<00:00:08.330> that<00:00:08.810> your<00:00:09.170> tatting<00:00:09.410> machine

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
possible ways that your tatting machine

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.520 
possible ways that your tatting machine
might<00:00:10.100> be<00:00:10.130> broken<00:00:10.510> so<00:00:11.510> before<00:00:11.900> you<00:00:12.050> jump<00:00:12.290> in

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
might be broken so before you jump in

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.410 
might be broken so before you jump in
and<00:00:12.710> presume<00:00:13.220> that<00:00:13.250> your<00:00:13.640> time<00:00:13.820> machine<00:00:14.269> is

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
and presume that your time machine is

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.780 
and presume that your time machine is
broken<00:00:14.690> you<00:00:15.140> want<00:00:15.320> to<00:00:15.559> just<00:00:16.220> double<00:00:16.550> check

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
broken you want to just double check

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.359 
broken you want to just double check
that<00:00:16.820> it's<00:00:17.150> all<00:00:17.330> set<00:00:17.689> up<00:00:17.720> correctly<00:00:18.410> make<00:00:19.160> sure

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
that it's all set up correctly make sure

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.640 
that it's all set up correctly make sure
that<00:00:19.640> your<00:00:19.820> clip<00:00:20.090> chords<00:00:20.660> are<00:00:20.960> correctly<00:00:21.470> in

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
that your clip chords are correctly in

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.400 
that your clip chords are correctly in
the<00:00:21.800> holes<00:00:22.010> and<00:00:22.970> make<00:00:23.240> sure<00:00:23.510> that<00:00:23.900> your

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
the holes and make sure that your

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.220 
the holes and make sure that your
contact<00:00:25.160> screw<00:00:25.520> is<00:00:25.820> touching<00:00:26.449> your<00:00:26.690> front

the<00:00:56.870> wall<00:00:57.140> okay<00:00:57.950> so<00:00:58.160> if<00:00:58.850> all<00:00:59.120> of<00:00:59.270> that<00:00:59.450> is

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
the wall okay so if all of that is

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.139 
the wall okay so if all of that is
working<00:01:00.739> well<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.160> your<00:01:01.430> temp<00:01:01.670> touching

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
working well and your temp touching

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.310 
working well and your temp touching
machine<00:01:02.480> is<00:01:02.750> still<00:01:03.440> not<00:01:04.250> working<00:01:04.580> correctly

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
machine is still not working correctly

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.290 
machine is still not working correctly
then<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.770> might<00:01:06.979> have<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.520> look<00:01:07.670> at<00:01:08.030> some

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
then you might have to look at some

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.529 
then you might have to look at some
other<00:01:08.479> possible<00:01:09.170> reasons<00:01:09.770> okay<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:10.300> the<00:01:11.300> first

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
other possible reasons okay so the first

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.380 
other possible reasons okay so the first
reason<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.229> might<00:01:12.440> find<00:01:12.709> is<00:01:13.069> you<00:01:13.700> might<00:01:13.970> find

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
reason you might find is you might find

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.430 
reason you might find is you might find
some<00:01:15.160> oxidization<00:01:16.160> on<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.959> contact<00:01:17.959> points

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
some oxidization on the contact points

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.380 
some oxidization on the contact points
okay<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.860> contact<00:01:19.310> points<00:01:19.640> will<00:01:19.789> be<00:01:19.910> here<00:01:20.209> on

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
okay the contact points will be here on

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.919 
okay the contact points will be here on
the<00:01:20.990> rear<00:01:21.170> binding<00:01:21.740> post<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:22.630> maybe<00:01:23.630> up<00:01:23.899> here

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
the rear binding post and maybe up here

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.639 
the rear binding post and maybe up here
on<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.950> contact<00:01:25.640> screw<00:01:26.599> okay<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.500> may

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
on the contact screw okay so you may

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.430 
on the contact screw okay so you may
need<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.130> look<00:01:28.250> out<00:01:28.429> for<00:01:28.759> some<00:01:29.440> oxidization

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
need to look out for some oxidization

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.059 
need to look out for some oxidization
and<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.360> need<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.630> remove<00:01:33.020> this<00:01:33.259> wire

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
and and you need to remove this wire

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.370 
and and you need to remove this wire
wall<00:01:34.399> maybe<00:01:34.759> just<00:01:35.000> give<00:01:35.179> it<00:01:35.300> a<00:01:35.390> nice<00:01:35.539> strong

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
wall maybe just give it a nice strong

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.760 
wall maybe just give it a nice strong
brush<00:01:36.970> this<00:01:37.970> will<00:01:38.209> remove<00:01:38.539> any<00:01:38.810> oxidization

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
brush this will remove any oxidization

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.010 
brush this will remove any oxidization
give<00:01:39.979> it<00:01:40.069> a<00:01:40.130> good<00:01:40.340> clean<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.000> make<00:01:41.569> sure<00:01:41.720> that

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
give it a good clean and make sure that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.889 
give it a good clean and make sure that
the<00:01:42.229> contact<00:01:42.590> points<00:01:43.069> are<00:01:43.250> kept<00:01:43.789> clean<00:01:44.569> and

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
the contact points are kept clean and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.279 
the contact points are kept clean and
this<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:46.190> once<00:01:46.789> again<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.479> contact<00:01:47.929> spring

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
this is once again is the contact spring

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.919 
this is once again is the contact spring
and<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.979> contacts<00:01:49.369> screw<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.750> rear

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
and the contacts screw and the rear

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.840 
and the contacts screw and the rear
binding<00:01:51.380> posts<00:01:51.679> these<00:01:51.830> are<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.130> most

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
binding posts these are the most

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.510 
binding posts these are the most
areas<00:01:53.540> here<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.440> that<00:01:54.710> when<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.130> click<00:01:55.340> on

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
areas here so that when you click on

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.750 
areas here so that when you click on
your<00:01:55.760> flip<00:01:56.090> card<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:57.230> get<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.650> good<00:01:58.010> connection

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
your flip card you get a good connection

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.300 
your flip card you get a good connection
so<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.600> electricity<00:02:00.020> will<00:02:00.470> flow<00:02:00.500> through<00:02:01.130> to

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
so the electricity will flow through to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.630 
so the electricity will flow through to
your<00:02:01.520> machine<00:02:01.850> very<00:02:02.810> well

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
your machine very well

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.220 
your machine very well
another<00:02:04.640> possible<00:02:05.180> reason<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.840> might<00:02:05.990> break

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
another possible reason it might break

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.969 
another possible reason it might break
is<00:02:06.520> looking<00:02:07.520> at<00:02:07.670> your<00:02:07.880> power<00:02:08.240> supply<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:09.830> need

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
is looking at your power supply you need

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.750 
is looking at your power supply you need
to<00:02:10.130> look<00:02:10.310> at<00:02:10.670> your<00:02:11.210> power<00:02:12.020> supply<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.770> your

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
to look at your power supply and your

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.890 
to look at your power supply and your
cables<00:02:14.510> here<00:02:14.780> okay<00:02:15.200> cables<00:02:15.740> at<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.130> bottom<00:02:16.900> so

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900

here because if you pull down here

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.310 
here because if you pull down here
there's<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.980> chance<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.490> we<00:02:43.940> work<00:02:44.750> inside<00:02:47.320> we

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
there's a chance that we work inside we

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.990 
there's a chance that we work inside we
will<00:02:48.500> see<00:02:48.800> this<00:02:48.950> connector<00:02:49.550> here

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.300 

this<00:02:52.570> connector<00:02:53.080> is<00:02:53.520> my<00:02:54.520> brick<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.210> then<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
this connector is my brick and then the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.100 
this connector is my brick and then the
electricity<00:02:58.150> will<00:02:58.300> not<00:02:58.480> pass<00:02:58.720> from<00:02:58.960> your

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
electricity will not pass from your

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.530 
electricity will not pass from your
power<00:02:59.350> supply<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.860> your<00:03:00.340> foot<00:03:00.670> pedal<00:03:01.000> or<00:03:01.180> your

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
power supply to your foot pedal or your

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.380 
power supply to your foot pedal or your
machine<00:03:01.840> very<00:03:02.530> well<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:03.040> kind<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.670> here<00:03:03.940> you

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
machine very well this kind of here you

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.060 
machine very well this kind of here you
might<00:03:04.600> become<00:03:04.780> loose<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.380> even<00:03:06.190> brick<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:08.070> yep

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
might become loose and even brick so yep

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.160 
might become loose and even brick so yep
you<00:03:09.430> want<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.760> check<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.510> every<00:03:10.870> now<00:03:11.020> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
you want to check that every now and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.540 
you want to check that every now and
again<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.530> see<00:03:11.710> that<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.130> good<00:03:12.160> working

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
again to see that it's in good working

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.230 
again to see that it's in good working
order<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.240> make<00:03:14.050> sure<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.830> maintain<00:03:15.790> it

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
order and make sure that you maintain it

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.500 
order and make sure that you maintain it
well<00:03:16.390> by<00:03:17.230> plugging<00:03:17.590> again<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:19.330> right

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
well by plugging again in the right

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.220 
well by plugging again in the right
fashion<00:03:20.910> finally<00:03:21.910> another<00:03:22.330> reason<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:23.080> might

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
fashion finally another reason you might

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.320 
fashion finally another reason you might
find<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.800> your<00:03:23.980> machine<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.370> broken<00:03:24.820> is<00:03:25.180> you

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
find that your machine is broken is you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.980 
find that your machine is broken is you
might<00:03:25.540> have<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:26.230> bad<00:03:27.510> capacitor<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.840> capacitor

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
might have a bad capacitor the capacitor

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.190 
might have a bad capacitor the capacitor
is<00:03:29.710> the<00:03:29.950> area<00:03:30.370> between<00:03:30.610> your<00:03:30.880> two<00:03:31.330> coils<00:03:31.690> and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
is the area between your two coils and

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.150 
is the area between your two coils and
around<00:03:32.650> about<00:03:32.920> here<00:03:33.630> okay<00:03:34.630> this<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.170> very

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
around about here okay this is a very

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.130 
around about here okay this is a very
complicated<00:03:36.460> fix<00:03:37.210> and<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.630> only<00:03:37.810> way<00:03:38.080> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
complicated fix and the only way to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.590 
complicated fix and the only way to
really<00:03:38.530> test<00:03:38.860> this<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:39.340> by<00:03:39.880> having<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.360> whole

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
really test this is by having a whole

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.310 
really test this is by having a whole
different<00:03:41.410> coil<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.250> capacitor<00:03:43.020> system<00:03:44.020> that

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
different coil and capacitor system that

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.230 
different coil and capacitor system that
you<00:03:44.440> can<00:03:44.650> troubleshoot<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.610> with<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.090> you'll

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
you can troubleshoot it with so you'll

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.530 
you can troubleshoot it with so you'll
have<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.200> you'll<00:03:47.650> see<00:03:47.860> if<00:03:48.160> if<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:49.300> one's

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
have to and you'll see if if this one's

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.420 
have to and you'll see if if this one's
faulty<00:03:49.990> and<00:03:50.230> look<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.770> put<00:03:51.100> another<00:03:51.250> one

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
faulty and look if you put another one

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.430 
faulty and look if you put another one
in<00:03:51.460> and<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:52.030> works<00:03:52.270> you<00:03:52.720> know<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.200> one

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
in and it works you know that this one

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.040 
in and it works you know that this one
is<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:54.100> faulty<00:03:54.610> capacitor<00:03:55.210> and<00:03:55.390> then<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:55.870> can

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
is a faulty capacitor and then you can

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.680 
is a faulty capacitor and then you can
replace<00:03:56.320> it<00:03:56.440> with<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.860> new<00:03:57.100> one<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:58.330> that's<00:03:58.540> a

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
replace it with a new one so that's a

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.680 
replace it with a new one so that's a
few<00:03:58.900> ways<00:03:59.110> you<00:03:59.350> might<00:03:59.530> find<00:04:00.180> if<00:04:01.180> your<00:04:01.330> tattoo

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
few ways you might find if your tattoo

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.790 
few ways you might find if your tattoo
machine<00:04:02.170> is<00:04:02.380> broken<00:04:02.770> and<00:04:03.100> how<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.310> fix<00:04:03.640> it
