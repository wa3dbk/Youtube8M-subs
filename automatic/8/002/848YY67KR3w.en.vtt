00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 ok hi everyone guys welcome in 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.240
 this new part of the scene series 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.160
 fox last part were the stands 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.590
 an absurd method and today we will dedicate ourselves 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.570
 all another method but a method 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.929
 which will include water this is the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.539
 first generation in which it will be possible 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:23.820
 make it and its name the fish in 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.010
 shine the peach chain 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.500
 then what we should obviously have 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.780
 they will be hooks and 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.760
 the rest will be going fishing 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.620
 consecutively populates in the water 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.570
 obviously it's not that simple there 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.570
 will be facilitated because 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.160
 fishing will not always lead to bonds 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.770
 fruits in fact sometimes we might not 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.250
 peck nothing at all to make that 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.520
 we will adopt at mouth oar we will fish 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.650
 always at least one hundred pokémon for 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.860
 hundred and what we should do is 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.129
 getting us is not all a bit with suckers 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.880
 in my case I will use this but the mar 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.470
 and he knows the windy truth there 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.090
 will leave the rumors a page of 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.509
 pokemon central b where you can find 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.940
 all the few that they can have 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.440
 precisely this skill that combined with 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.210
 a factor we're going to see between 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.190
 very little will allow you to do 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.640
 your bait can be a hundred for 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.310
 one hundred 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.350
 this second factor is called 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.630
 spots and commercials are places in the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.060
 which us once we will launch love it 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.100
 we will occupy all the space in a street 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.140
 exposure the one where I am 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.540
 for example it is a commercial as if 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.220
 launch in any kind of love we'll see 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.409
 with cooper have all the space a 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.600
 arrangement we have in this mini 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.250
 area because if see behind the practice 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.290
 obviously that is not considered 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.500
 is not considered solely at 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.210
 space ahead of our the brass that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.520
 includes the phrase the rock and that 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.799
 minimum space is our spot 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.630
 obviously not the only one available for 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.600
 in case you will find lots of them 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.759
 indescriptions release a page of a 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.579
 blog where you find all the best 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.759
 spot with many beautiful images where 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.549
 you can find all your pokémon 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.380
 I will show you all the few who do 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.209
 found in every spot and then you can 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.400
 also regulate your soul to see 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.510
 practically how this fish works 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.570
 fire 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.090
 then we will obviously have to have 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.489
 of the years because as we fish without and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.000
 then find our favorite sport myself 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.980
 for example it will be here on the one below ad 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.410
 oilfields where it is possible to take 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.310
 of scripts and gods 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.240
 idra gage and with the superandole 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.110
 respectively with the good year with the 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.690
 overcoming then the method consists 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.910
 precisely in making fishing chains ie 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.330
 always go for our bite 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.470
 place also thanks to suction cups to the spot 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.330
 abboccherà hundred percent then 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.230
 obviously it will vary based on the skill 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.210
 of each player if he can do it 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.640
 bite or not if it will succeed to 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.890
 pull it up let's say because the place doesn't 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.270
 will always bite every time 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.280
 we will fish our own fish 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.970
 chance to meet with shine and 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.490
 increase 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.610
 until we form a chain of 40 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.490
 little where the odds will come to 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.220
 then one of 200 children means that 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.830
 a pokémon that we will draw on 200 will be 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.140
 sciani and also the odds not 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.420
 in fact they will decrease if you caught a 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.790
 po with auchan no one forbids you to go 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.840
 to have another one bite and another 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.460
 even more 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.430
 and this is precisely the chain of 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.100
 draft that will include the method of 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.870
 today there are then the various elements to be 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.580
 take into consideration that they will 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.250
 break our chain 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.050
 obviously beyond those we pull 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.760
 too early too late that year 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.730
 for example the fact that if yours 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.480
 friend while connected to the players 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.030
 out system the pss will send you for example 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.610
 a power or will break the chain then if 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.380
 you move if you activate the agreements not the 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.650
 bicycle if you are not in the water 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.140
 because there are spots where not 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.739
 there is no need for notes 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.030
 stay staying in the water 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.850
 these are the only elements 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.070
 Our fish dinners in dinners 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.959
 as no other thing will break the 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.480
 not even our escape from the chain 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.959
 pokémon now I would say go to 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.959
 practical part 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.940
 first caught by 20 they would call 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.310
 samp and the boys now that it comes down to 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.440
 first attempt obviously then based 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.750
 to the commercials that you decide how I have you 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.690
 already said you will find the little fair yes 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.420
 can find mainly relica e 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.550
 gisella dragons I think is wrong 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.060
 only these two if I don't want to 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.030
 stupid now for example we age 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.520
 another pokémon that has nothing to do with it 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.380
 and how to notice guys we will go 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.420
 always to bite our little 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.550
 not then if you press at the right time 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.950
 your little london pulled up 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.500
 otherwise the chain will break but 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.320
 this is really hard to break one 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.660
 chain because there is enough to stay a while 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.970
 concentrate not never get distracted from the 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.640
 lake and as soon as the points arrive 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.530
 interrupted because said questions 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.130
 exclamation marks on our head 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:25.090
 we will have to click to and we will arrive so the 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.090
 our pokémon 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.860
 another relic will go gynt I came 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.860
 here for dreams still does not appear 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.749
 and we could go on like this guys 

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:45.149
 infinitely our probabilities of 1 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:48.509
 out of 200 they will really make themselves heard 

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:51.029
 in fact many people have fished 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:53.189
 these cyan fish until you get to 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.809
 pokémon that have lost value 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:57.240
 however we say that it is always nice to have a 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:58.830
 red gary dos a new drag age shine 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.619
 pokémon pokémon who made the 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.110
 history are always nice to have them in 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:06.599
 box use them with friends who knows if 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.409
 captain with good with good statistics 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:13.229
 and boys this was the method of gods 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.059
 beat the pitching chain thanks of the 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.249
 see you at the next ed 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:19.139
 last method remember to mister la 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:21.589
 facebook page and lava think books hello 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:21.589
 to all
