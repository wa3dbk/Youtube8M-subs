00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 and 

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:12.459
 [Music] 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.430
 life today is going to be for you 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.980
 demonstrate how to make this tutorial 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.710
 for nails actually it's a time 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.810
 that I made my debut but when you 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.820
 can see here I like to be light on 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.210
 sees that slab during all the videos 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.010
 and it's blurry I'm against short day 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.079
 I decided their fate 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.210
 just because it's a minor 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.329
 would have preferred and who have the most 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.950
 success with my friends and company 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.270
 written nor in the background not so complicated 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.930
 that and that does not require a 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.520
 ultra ultra ultra fine dexterity so 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.230
 I think I'll be reviewing the 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.600
 products that are used very quickly 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.430
 so we have a base this is your 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.970
 choice but I use that of m sila 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.480
 all-in-one subjects then apply 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.989
 the colour 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.360
 walton of sally hansen in the 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.940
 collection express war I invite two 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.229
 coaches between two to give a finish 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.560
 satin I used the color white and 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.560
 wau de memory in the collection informed 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.280
 seems to me so that makes my white background 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.119
 speak on it to read the book state 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.259
 emotional I used varnish given on earth 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.380
 on the effect by witchcraft and seniors 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:33.219
 so your black just the little 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:37.029
 special touch of the golden varnish with 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:39.369
 glitters of art deco in the hollow and 

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:41.349
 this blog just stop and finally 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.960
 I have a protective layer 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.360
 smile chain 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.670
 like this here in the second the prices of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.560
 products that have been used and I 'm going 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.050
 to actually show you how to achieve 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.050
 the tutorial in question so let's go 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.860
 I have already applied to have what is 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.000
 there by drowning them I put in 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.370
 the shot I could be certain to have 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.260
 infinite been the forms and when I 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.570
 will apply on the expressed were of 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.570
 sally hansen in the color whitehorn 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:38.310
 and most of which the normal avenue 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:40.390
 [Music] 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.000
 in the color that I 'm going to apply 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.129
 that's what i want to balling 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.440
 the frustrating interaction it's just for 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.400
 let it be less mans after finishing 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.400
 a little more did not create 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.480
 [Music] 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.370
 to make our special offer the goal 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.220
 it's to make zigzag lines on 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.110
 the nail and I'm going to show you a little 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.840
 5 so that you understand a little bit of what 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.550
 I was talking about the second zigzags 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.550
 so we will take a blank piece of paper 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.959
 take a leaf like this one we have 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.600
 our nails such as those above 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.140
 and there with our varnish we go everything 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:32.209
 simply to put the brush and do 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.370
 lines like this one did it 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.650
 different lengths so long others 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.420
 body and we have more we support stronger 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.920
 at the beginning of the line what will do in 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.600
 so that it would have wider at the beginning 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.060
 of the most holy vaast in their absence 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.940
 therefore it will give precisely 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.489
 an impression of these terminals 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.560
 so that's for the technique and I 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.260
 will show you the questionnaire with 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.830
 a product so I'm going to use the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:01.040
 personal art like these the mark 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.380
 so witchcraft so born in art and these are 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.540
 red varnish but with a mouthpiece 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.640
 corn like those here and there all we 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.739
 is that we differ as I do you 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.180
 drew 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:17.620
 so we press zigzag and let go 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:28.420
 to finish a veil 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:28.420
 [Music] 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.400
 so it gives something like this here 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.470
 [Music] 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.009
 and that's it and we only know that 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.870
 fingers so as I explained when 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.490
 we do the blacks have the buttocks 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.250
 of exal so even if we do not have a 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.080
 very great minutia the exams even if we 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.000
 aspen will be like an enemy 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.520
 the important thing is to apply more 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.110
 form early and support less and 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.240
 least either towards the end for sar a 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.550
 simply point and we actually 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.800
 randomly on the angles 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.660
 without blacks doing what we do 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.690
 wants to enforce it's another 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.820
 varnish that one and brilliants of henry 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.130
 and it's the same principle as the name 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.250
 so it's a varnish with a tip more 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.050
 miles to be able to apply the varnish to 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.950
 nails and what we do is we go 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.500
 come to just make lines to 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:28.070
 some places for everywhere and we 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.020
 does the lines below christmas of 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.630
 our black lines we already have everything 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:40.319
 simply 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:40.319
 [Music] 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.660
 and that's so it's 1 really ends 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.540
 really random quotation marks 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.310
 and when one adds having fooled as 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.200
 that even if it itself a little bit in the 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.790
 north it seems almost not because 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.790
 so much color difference 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:17.570
 [Music] 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.160
 that's what we get in the end I 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.780
 sign to approach so you can 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.690
 to see again because it is in any case the 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.400
 camera will come cut a bit of the 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.430
 Brightness of the room game now 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:32.080
 that I protector in the end you can 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:36.530
 see that it's a pretty colorful effect 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.840
 and it's very very very bright it makes 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.280
 happy then in any case all the people 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.110
 will ask you if you even that 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.610
 had done it or not since it comes with 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.530
 this month of these waves is that as the 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.290
 lines are dezired even if we tremble 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.580
 it does not matter it's even better 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.990
 unlike when we make lines 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.060
 and very straight lines 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.500
 so that's what gives me a real 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.040
 game stops a layer of protection 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:02.660
 I told myself the mega way of servitude 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:04.700
 and that's his complete actually this tutorial 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.470
 for nails once everything is 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.460
 really simple we will apply a 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.800
 finishing layer 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.990
 precisely to prevent the colors 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.250
 mingle honor each other you 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.229
 can take a larger amount 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.020
 transparency on your brush like 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:19.760
 this one what are you going to brush it's going 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.030
 to be the superficial layer of 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.789
 transparent and not the colors 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:27.010
 together for his meat an impetus i 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:29.120
 so this is our final 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.590
 I hope you like it I put 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.090
 some pictures that are much the 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.240
 less influential than in the version 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.919
 original and that's all me what you 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.419
 think and try drama around 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:40.490
 tutorial you want but then one of 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.650
 things I like most about this look 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.970
 the water for the nails is that even that 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.030
 have been wearing the bag for several days 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:49.310
 after June 4-5 wears even if there are 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.440
 doubts on the tip of the nail it does not 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.240
 it seems pretty scales because 

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.220
 it is very colorful and full of 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.240
 colors which makes it so that we have 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.260
 seem to have a beautiful manna that 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.289
 for much longer 

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.669
 staes all so here I hope it 

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:04.510
 was stronger without the next read 

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:04.510
 ciao girls
