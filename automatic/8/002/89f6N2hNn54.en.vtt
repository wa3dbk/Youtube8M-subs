branched out into audio products and

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.629 
branched out into audio products and
that's<00:00:08.720> very<00:00:09.080> interesting<00:00:09.530> to<00:00:09.679> see<00:00:09.919> as<00:00:10.160> they

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
that's very interesting to see as they

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.100 
that's very interesting to see as they

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
company so their first headphone is the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.900 
company so their first headphone is the
flow<00:00:14.749> made<00:00:15.379> to<00:00:15.530> be<00:00:15.679> a<00:00:15.709> lifestyle<00:00:16.309> product<00:00:16.760> with

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
and priced competitively at $69 so let's

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.490 
and priced competitively at $69 so let's
find<00:00:22.700> out<00:00:22.850> exactly<00:00:23.120> what<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:23.870> outcome<00:00:24.290> is

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
find out exactly what the outcome is

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.380 
find out exactly what the outcome is
with<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:24.830> flow<00:00:25.100> and<00:00:25.370> I'm<00:00:25.820> curious<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.360> see

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
with the flow and I'm curious to see

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.120 
with the flow and I'm curious to see
whether<00:00:26.810> or<00:00:26.960> not<00:00:27.050> this<00:00:27.350> feels<00:00:27.800> like<00:00:28.010> a

coating that we're so familiar with

coating that we're so familiar with
giving<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.510> flow<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:47.929> more<00:00:48.050> premium<00:00:48.589> feel

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
giving the flow and more premium feel

they<00:00:49.309> are<00:00:49.429> flexible<00:00:49.879> however<00:00:50.359> there<00:00:50.629> isn't

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
they are flexible however there isn't

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.139 
they are flexible however there isn't
any<00:00:51.170> earcup<00:00:51.620> swivel<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:52.219> while<00:00:52.819> they<00:00:52.999> are

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
any earcup swivel and while they are

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.270 
any earcup swivel and while they are
expandable<00:00:53.749> it<00:00:54.229> feels<00:00:54.589> like<00:00:54.769> pulling<00:00:55.129> out<00:00:55.249> a

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
expandable it feels like pulling out a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.430 
expandable it feels like pulling out a
nail<00:00:55.579> out<00:00:55.850> of<00:00:56.030> wood<00:00:56.269> as<00:00:56.479> you<00:00:56.780> literally<00:00:57.170> have

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
nail out of wood as you literally have

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.840 
nail out of wood as you literally have
to<00:00:57.589> apply<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:57.829> lot<00:00:58.190> of<00:00:58.219> force

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
to apply a lot of force

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.910 
to apply a lot of force
I<00:00:58.999> was<00:00:59.569> curious<00:00:59.870> as<00:01:00.139> to<00:01:00.170> how<00:01:00.499> this<00:01:00.710> was

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
I was curious as to how this was

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.680 
I was curious as to how this was
implemented<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:01.760> looks<00:01:02.269> like<00:01:02.359> you're<00:01:02.659> just

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
implemented and looks like you're just

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.689 
implemented and looks like you're just
pulling<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:03.260> plastic<00:01:03.440> bit<00:01:03.859> higher<00:01:04.190> so<00:01:04.550> the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
pulling the plastic bit higher so the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.120 
pulling the plastic bit higher so the
rubber<00:01:04.850> band<00:01:05.180> holding<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.020> hand<00:01:06.229> band<00:01:06.469> moves

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
rubber band holding the hand band moves

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.160 
rubber band holding the hand band moves
higher<00:01:07.399> so<00:01:07.820> not<00:01:08.180> very<00:01:08.479> impressed<00:01:08.899> with<00:01:09.049> this

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
higher so not very impressed with this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.499 
higher so not very impressed with this

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
design the flow with multi functionality

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.300

in<00:01:13.549> mind<00:01:13.820> both<00:01:14.360> for<00:01:14.600> music<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.110> gaming<00:01:15.590> as<00:01:15.920> the

cable and microphone are both removable

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.590 
cable and microphone are both removable
the<00:01:18.829> included<00:01:19.189> microphone<00:01:19.579> is<00:01:19.850> quite<00:01:20.119> large

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
the included microphone is quite large

the included microphone is quite large
I<00:01:20.780> would<00:01:21.170> have<00:01:21.289> preferred<00:01:21.469> something

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
I would have preferred something

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.670 
I would have preferred something
low-profile<00:01:22.759> or<00:01:23.000> even<00:01:23.299> retractable<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.200> is

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
low-profile or even retractable it is

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.889 
low-profile or even retractable it is
flexible<00:01:25.130> however<00:01:25.670> but<00:01:26.149> I<00:01:26.180> don't<00:01:26.450> really<00:01:26.630> see

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
flexible however but I don't really see

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.899 
flexible however but I don't really see
it<00:01:26.960> fitting<00:01:27.229> in<00:01:27.469> with<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.649> design<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.399> just

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
it fitting in with the design and just

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.550 
it fitting in with the design and just
feels<00:01:29.119> like<00:01:29.299> an<00:01:29.420> afterthought<00:01:29.990> rather<00:01:30.380> than

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
feels like an afterthought rather than

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.190 
feels like an afterthought rather than
the<00:01:30.619> feature<00:01:30.859> that<00:01:30.979> I<00:01:31.340> would<00:01:31.490> actually<00:01:31.700> use

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
the feature that I would actually use

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.870 
the feature that I would actually use
microphone<00:01:33.200> quality<00:01:33.350> with<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:33.920> flow<00:01:34.130> for<00:01:34.729> its

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
microphone quality with the flow for its

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.760 
microphone quality with the flow for its
class<00:01:35.180> is<00:01:35.479> actually<00:01:35.600> pretty<00:01:36.140> decent

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
class is actually pretty decent

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.039 
class is actually pretty decent
it<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.490> quiet<00:01:37.789> tall<00:01:38.149> so<00:01:38.299> you<00:01:38.390> have<00:01:38.539> to<00:01:38.689> boost<00:01:38.899> a

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
it is quiet tall so you have to boost a

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.230 
it is quiet tall so you have to boost a
signal<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:39.590> therefore<00:01:40.100> introduces<00:01:41.060> some

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
signal and therefore introduces some

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.330 
signal and therefore introduces some
noise<00:01:41.539> now<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:42.590> love<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:43.070> we<00:01:43.189> have

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
noise now I love that we have

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.279 
noise now I love that we have
interchangeable<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.299> removable<00:01:44.810> cables

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
interchangeable and removable cables

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.369 
lightweight design and the low pressure
clamping<00:02:37.610> didn't<00:02:38.239> ruin<00:02:38.510> my<00:02:38.720> experience

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
clamping didn't ruin my experience

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.500 
clamping didn't ruin my experience
however<00:02:39.980> because<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.640> frame<00:02:40.849> design<00:02:41.239> it

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
however because of the frame design it

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.210 
however because of the frame design it
is<00:02:41.629> impossible<00:02:42.379> to<00:02:42.409> wear<00:02:42.650> them<00:02:42.799> with<00:02:42.920> glasses

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
is impossible to wear them with glasses

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.339 
and this is where ear cup articulation
really<00:02:46.430> could<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.700> saved<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.150> day<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.599> also
