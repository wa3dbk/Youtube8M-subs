00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
another bugle on the other side of what

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.050 
another bugle on the other side of what
we<00:01:52.990> call<00:01:53.260> we<00:01:54.160> decided<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.550> call<00:01:54.610> rock<00:01:54.850> point

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
we call we decided to call rock point

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.030 
we call we decided to call rock point
yeah<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:59.140> was<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.320> closest<00:01:59.680> one<00:01:59.860> of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
yeah and so that was the closest one of

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.450 
yeah and so that was the closest one of
the<00:02:00.130> fear<00:02:00.400> so<00:02:01.000> we<00:02:01.120> came<00:02:01.300> after<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:02.100> came<00:02:03.100> up<00:02:03.310> a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
the fear so we came after it came up a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.310 
the fear so we came after it came up a
little<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:04.240> right<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.479> us<00:02:04.570> here<00:02:04.750> we<00:02:04.900> have<00:02:05.050> and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
little the right of us here we have and

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.560 
little the right of us here we have and
I<00:02:05.619> think<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.520> took<00:02:06.729> off<00:02:06.940> up<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.360> draw<00:02:07.600> yeah<00:02:09.570> so

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
I think it took off up the draw yeah so

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.910 
I think it took off up the draw yeah so
we<00:02:10.720> started<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.170> come<00:02:11.290> up<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.500> just<00:02:11.530> got<00:02:11.800> the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
we started to come up I just got the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.510 
we started to come up I just got the
base<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.880> this<00:02:13.480> bowl<00:02:14.160> we<00:02:15.160> think<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.430> was

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
base of it in this bowl we think it was

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.760 
base of it in this bowl we think it was
