00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
Impala Murr pack which is 50 volts cut

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.050 
Impala Murr pack which is 50 volts cut
off<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.880> charger<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:53.410> capacity<00:01:54.040> is<00:01:54.220> 64

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
off the charger and the capacity is 64

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.390 
off the charger and the capacity is 64
amp<00:01:55.390> hours<00:01:56.160> so<00:01:57.160> it's<00:01:58.590> about<00:01:59.590> two<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.160> a<00:02:00.340> half

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
amp hours so it's about two and a half

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.740 
amp hours so it's about two and a half
kilowatt<00:02:01.090> hours<00:02:01.600> of<00:02:01.630> usable<00:02:02.440> energy<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.540> the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
kilowatt hours of usable energy so the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.620 
kilowatt hours of usable energy so the
bike<00:02:04.900> weighs<00:02:05.110> 150<00:02:05.890> pounds<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:07.080> is<00:02:08.080> about<00:02:09.630> 32

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
bike weighs 150 pounds and is about 32

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.260 
bike weighs 150 pounds and is about 32
horsepower<00:02:11.230> give<00:02:12.010> or<00:02:12.130> take<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
horsepower give or take so it is the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.750 
horsepower give or take so it is the
weight<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.630> an<00:02:13.750> 80<00:02:13.930> cc<00:02:14.230> dirt<00:02:14.590> bike<00:02:14.800> with<00:02:15.580> the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
weight of an 80 cc dirt bike with the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.150 
weight of an 80 cc dirt bike with the
power<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.510> 125

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
power of a 125

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.839 
power of a 125
so<00:02:18.700> that's<00:02:18.970> it

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
so that's it

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.390 
so that's it
thank<00:02:21.239> you
