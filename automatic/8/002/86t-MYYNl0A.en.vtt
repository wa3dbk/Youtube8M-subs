00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 and make me new Superamas videos 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.850
 bradford wiiu and good this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.560
 teach how to get the anp for 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.900
 get this character two ways one 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.349
 doing 100 combats and another that is 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.690
 much faster doing at least one 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.529
 that I have never or in an assault 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.869
 Intrepid you kill one and it's already here 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.189
 You see, I've done two with Kirby but this one 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.369
 has been testing because I am testing 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.650
 with characters and I saw techniques and internal 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.119
 good and only one that will go catching 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.940
 this character that power with marc 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.620
 it also serves that it was letting go 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 on one edge you left caracas once for 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.980
 up the attack after crossing the field 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.190
 it gives a little bit to it and so 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.760
 repeatedly 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.820
 I saw it a fairly long process so 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.109
 I'm thinking and Jack Kirby and I thought 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.109
 in doing the following 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.500
 with kirk beer I am it until it happens here 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.550
 the potato that is approaching 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.550
 it's like that 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.570
 good that so it has not left but the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 keys as is not 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:19.689
 and they only make a jacket for 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.289
 so that he goes out to this one he gives that back to 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.260
 16 of the character to choose character and already 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.900
 I would leave that hand 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.990
 it has left me before and I committed suicide 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.560
 so that to teach it now it is not 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.060
 will unlock the old hand field but 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.800
 the first time I fight against him win 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.080
 you lose it unlocks also the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.480
 field and now we're going to beat him 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.480
 supposed to know about the character 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.509
 but good if you only want to do 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.329
 that you want to do what makes you fail 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.759
 the character with Kirby I see it more 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.049
 simple only one death with the 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.000
 truth that with lucina I think that for 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.780
 spend what you kill at 8 I see 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.220
 better because there is also a challenge to 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.970
 when you kill 8 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.970
 so 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.190
 for that if the trips but for a 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.989
 character the truth that enough 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.270
 long until it comes out having a 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.020
 beginning 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.020
 really wants 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.410
 good is offering a lot of resistance 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.200
 esteban hat equal 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.900
 doubts but I was calling the campero 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.650
 again because the duckling is so and I 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.650
 I think it's a duck 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.640
 outside 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.630
 now yes 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.790
 because nothing they lower it they join the establishment 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.200
 and it was like it is here 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.120
 I do not bet that the field joined 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.370
 because I said I've tried it 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.170
 before to see if I could with Kirby and I 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.840
 has come out so he has tried now but 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.010
 I also wish to unblock the field well 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.900
 How good I hope you liked the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.900
 video here I say goodbye goodbye
