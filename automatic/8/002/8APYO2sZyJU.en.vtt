1/16 socket put on there put that pipe

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.010 
1/16 socket put on there put that pipe
on<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> end<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:48.629> also<00:00:48.809> gonna<00:00:49.170> put<00:00:49.260> a

on the end and I'm also gonna put a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.479 
on the end and I'm also gonna put a
another<00:00:52.020> breaker<00:00:52.440> bar<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.040> end<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.370> this

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
another breaker bar on the end of this

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.229 
another breaker bar on the end of this
tool<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:55.620> I'll<00:00:56.100> start<00:00:56.309> pulling<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> down

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
tool here and I'll start pulling it down

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.310 
tool here and I'll start pulling it down
and<00:00:57.379> it<00:00:58.379> takes<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:59.180> two<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.570> four<00:01:00.960> hundred

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and it takes about two to four hundred

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.639 
and it takes about two to four hundred
foot-pounds<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.489> torque<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:03.619> compress<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
foot-pounds of torque to compress that

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.859 
foot-pounds of torque to compress that
sleeve<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.539> to<00:01:06.570> put<00:01:06.750> the
