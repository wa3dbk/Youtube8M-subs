00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.540
 hello friends I'm 301 dan and 2 and I bring you 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.459
 my predictions for the go from April 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.410
 2014 I planned not to upload this video because 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.720
 we are a few days away from going to the 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.400
 real list but some give and leavers me 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.410
 They asked for my opinion because 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.020
 it seems the list will take a few days 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.060
 more in going well already know what always 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.160
 before commenting shit analyze the 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.720
 video and give your views be 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.820
 mature when commenting 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.680
 negatively all comment is 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.480
 accepted but as I know there's always 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.109
 comments good assholes I want 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.719
 ask them to avoid them, let's start 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:46.179
 forbidden to remove the limiter I do not 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.980
 I would forbid but someone gave me the tip now 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.809
 that the machines have shown this 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.819
 format that with a single attack can 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.890
 make shit any more tourist 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:56.980
 specifically the cyber dragon and the 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.260
 daily hieratic seal of the ashes 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.510
 this prediction I only make it by wanting 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.159
 kill the hieratics a bit since they 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.900
 this letter allows them to do their 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.210
 combination with the dragon roulers 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.310
 infinite then accelerates the deck 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.350
 recovers removed and when it dies 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.840
 relive hieratic to start the combo 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.810
 again if they do not touch it they move them 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.460
 of convocation again I only predict 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.649
 those two because I'm afraid to do 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.420
 predictions of prohibitions and the other 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.789
 question is for not wanting to copy the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.020
 list of 11 g we continue with the 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:32.679
 limited limited brotherhood of the fist 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.299
 of fire or gold many will criticize me for 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.159
 make this prediction instead of 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.289
 include the balloon lara or the formation of 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.030
 tenti fire but it seems better than 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.459
 touch the monster that makes the game 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.959
 when there is some bad hand besides 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.209
 that gives the fire fist a 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.979
 double acceleration since it takes out the tanks 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.259
 of the dec and in turn laten looking for a 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.420
 monster that depending on what's 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.429
 is playing the one I find worthy of 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.250
 enter the list or go latent 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.349
 again to two or one horde of evil 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.969
 option I wanted to include this guy because 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.340
 it is rumored that the arrival of 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.200
 monsters artifacts is coming and I do not think 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.500
 that konami wants to risk his new 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.090
 archetype because everything is level 5 or shrinkage 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.220
 in the view that the sirens 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.870
 they remain powerful despite the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.209
 changes that the des has suffered 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.069
 limitation of the atlante and dragons I the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.049
 I would touch because it is the only one that can 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.920
 fix the game and you abuse it with 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.530
 the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.270
 horde of evil knight fire extinguisher 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.010
 they have all seen it in the tournaments 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.410
 official is an extremely effect 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.450
 abusive because it is activated in 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.250
 any time of your arrival this will 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.440
 removes the possibility to the opponent of 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.930
 answer because it will likewise activate 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.239
 its effect and will make the field shit 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.100
 sergi because it secures the lot here and 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.080
 Most of those who play this dq sanz 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.380
 three of them to make it faster 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.330
 win street patrol of Stygia I 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.920
 touch her because it is the reason that 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.200
 nurses are in top 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.060
 also if they want to do something to them they could 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.790
 put it on one or ban the chain the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.769
 go to bullying and crane because 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.780
 boeing are so homosexual that only 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.940
 protect the call to do shit at 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.980
 opponent and its effect is even better 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.100
 that honest is the only bad thing is that 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.290
 it only serves for his archetype to stun the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.150
 trap because I enter the main one and 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.260
 saident of many so efficient that 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.650
 it's even better than three royal 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.409
 let's continue with the semi-limited semi 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.629
 limited to the black gail the swirl 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.579
 because in the new envelope of dragons they 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.200
 comes a support to the black wings and 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.140
 how is the former has become garbage 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.390
 they will want to give them some power load of 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.250
 the light cavalry for the support that 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.989
 it still does not come out but it is expected that 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.180
 reach tcg as soon as the 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.090
 re-printing of quasar in Latin America 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.190
 parrot lolo the beast gladiator bestiari 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.290
 because they required power and konami only 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.569
 gave a monster that is risky to play 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.810
 so I would opt for them to leave 2 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.930
 to this kind solemn warning because 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.930
 I'm all we want to be pros magician of the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.209
 I fuck I predict it because I have not 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.940
 seen this format playable so the 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.129
 He condemned the same as his whose me 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.870
 true six samurai continue because 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.329
 they have not supported them and the portal 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.540
 will continue to be prohibited now 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.370
 would release because they are not so dangerous 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.459
 I drink the day because nobody uses it and it is not 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.709
 so dangerous sometimes 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.600
 reasoning is a matter of chance and with 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.660
 the decks of now it's easier to guess 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.849
 what level will the monkey be here conclude 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.770
 my predictions I want to tell you that 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.569
 I feel like some letters have gone 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.550
 of more and others it happened to me to add them 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.770
 because I made the video very fast and not 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.080
 I had time to think of everything so 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.110
 this is my prediction of the format I hope 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.990
 that you liked already know that I accept 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.030

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.220
 video you liked dale on I like it if 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.000
 you want more subscribe see you in my 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.000
