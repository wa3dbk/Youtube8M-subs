00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.340
 Hello dear lovers 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:12.000
 grapes season 2014 harvest can 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.030
 say already started this year delay 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.050
 on all maps and hybrid forum 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.760
 is at least a week or even two 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.930
 weeks so this year everything is early 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:33.680
 early morning varieties of delay and ripening 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.510
 at least 10 days starting our season 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.910
 Zaporizhish Zaporozhsky want of course 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.559
 say i keep it just for 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.230
 spraying varieties or harmful forum 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.210
 functionally female type of flower 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.489
 there is specifically here I have it for 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.280
 pollination caches 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.289
 but in this madonna became pleasant 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.879
 by surprise in Omsk already 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.719
 stained colored light though they are not quite 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.549
 crimson how he type on such a straight 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.060
 bluish color but maybe influenced 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.110
 the fact that he is near the wall and 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:20.460
 temperature that day warmed 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.680
 heat bricks at night it gave away heat and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.409
 so the ripening went a little bit 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.250
 faster 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.560
 buds on April 7th we suffered on it 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.810
 so the harvest at the moment is with us 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.270
 there is only with replacement kidneys that is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:44.790
 ron and small half a kilogram can 700 grams 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.790
 and replacing the kidneys from stepchildren as seen 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.009
 here I am trying to get more 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.550
 second harvest 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:57.830
 I break a bush because on such a bush 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.670
 literally seven or eight nails this 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:06.220
 very small load anyway 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.380
 pleasantly surprised this year he has 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.510
 rudiments well, they are such bitter now 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.720
 when fully mature they won't even 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.750
 it will not be felt and tasted 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.190
 interfere with taste although he did not get the light 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:27.320
 now see he got close 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.510
 light sugars still very little tweaking can 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.870
 but taste 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.950
 as such there is no one here 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:41.110
 drones right here he is interspersed with a stepson 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:47.660
 Vym are still green and not scored 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:50.390
 condition later this year I decided 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.340
 upload video starter hybrid 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.960
 forum as they mature that is 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.900
 some sort or hybrid form has matured 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:04.300
 there will be a short video for this variety with 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.070
 a brief description with the date of the particular 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.250
 ripening today we have this 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.010
 the moment is 24 0 7 2014 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.459
 that is, you need to say so that 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.459
 term 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.800
 last year there are already a lot of varieties and 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.270
 hybrid forms practically scored 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.690
 they could eat sugar 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:27.290
 this moment here it is the first one 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.959
 now we have already painted and quite 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.840
 little left to set 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.550
 good sugar and taste well go on 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.500
 other varieties such as adrian to now 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.989
 she's almost turned but I don't 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.200
 will not go just I'll show when 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.440

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.230
 Already painted anniversary Cherkassk 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.390

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.870
 ripe yet so this is our 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.720

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.920
 lay out as soon as I take off 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.990
 new 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.700
