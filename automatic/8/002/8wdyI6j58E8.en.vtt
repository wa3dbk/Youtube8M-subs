00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.650 
you're a beginner or you're more
advanced<00:00:19.860> what<00:00:20.789> did<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:20.970> do<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.300> with<00:00:21.570> your

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
advanced what did you do it with your

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.170 
advanced what did you do it with your
students<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.980> was<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> ultimate<00:00:23.430> fusion

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
students so this was the ultimate fusion

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.630 
students so this was the ultimate fusion
for<00:00:24.660> meter<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.440> portraiture<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.190> landscape

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
for meter from portraiture to landscape

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.750 
for meter from portraiture to landscape
because<00:00:27.480> really<00:00:27.660> my<00:00:27.779> shots<00:00:28.260> are<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.920> just

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
because really my shots are not just

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.790 
because really my shots are not just
fashion<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.300> they're<00:00:30.449> also<00:00:30.800> contextual

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
fashion but they're also contextual

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.349 
fashion but they're also contextual
interesting<00:00:32.430> pictures<00:00:32.879> that<00:00:33.120> have

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:33.359 
interesting pictures that have

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:35.149 
interesting pictures that have
top-quality<00:00:33.960> locations<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:35.039> this

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:35.159 
top-quality locations have this

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.669 
top-quality locations have this
opportunity<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.789> show<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.449> the<00:00:36.600> students<00:00:37.050> my

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
opportunity to show to the students my

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.750 
opportunity to show to the students my
techniques<00:00:38.159> using<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.149> models<00:00:40.639> there<00:00:41.639> are

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
techniques using the models there are

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520 
techniques using the models there are
several<00:00:42.120> hours<00:00:42.569> of<00:00:42.809> following<00:00:43.199> us<00:00:43.350> around

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
several hours of following us around

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.079 
several hours of following us around
while<00:00:43.889> we<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.190> our<00:00:44.219> thing<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.699> then<00:00:44.940> there's

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
while we do our thing and then there's

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.399 
while we do our thing and then there's
also<00:00:45.210> several<00:00:45.719> hours<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.319> the

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
also several hours of the

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.139 
also several hours of the
post-processing<00:00:47.069> which<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.549> the<00:00:47.699> other<00:00:47.879> half

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
post-processing which is the other half

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.919 
post-processing which is the other half
the<00:00:48.359> magic

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
the magic

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.869 
the magic
these<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.499> our<00:00:49.589> two<00:00:49.769> layers<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.159> of<00:00:50.579> course

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
these are our two layers here of course

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.289 
these are our two layers here of course
I've<00:00:51.839> brushes<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.519> 100%<00:00:53.519> and<00:00:53.819> now<00:00:53.969> let's<00:00:54.179> just

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
I've brushes at 100% and now let's just

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.099 
I've brushes at 100% and now let's just
say<00:00:54.510> I'm<00:00:54.959> just<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.559> stroke<00:00:55.979> across<00:00:56.399> it

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
say I'm just going to stroke across it

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.939 
say I'm just going to stroke across it
if<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.379> show<00:00:58.909> this<00:00:59.909> you'll<00:01:00.869> see<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.409> I'm

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
if I show this you'll see that I'm

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.259 
if I show this you'll see that I'm
actually<00:01:02.100> cutting<00:01:02.519> through<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.119> layer

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
actually cutting through to the layer

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.330 
actually cutting through to the layer
the<00:01:03.539> meat<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.620> I'm<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> scrub

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
the meat and so I'm going to scrub

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.150 
the meat and so I'm going to scrub
through<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:05.790> 50%<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.900> far<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.320> might<00:01:07.710> half<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
through at 50% as far as might half of

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.430 
through at 50% as far as might half of
walking<00:01:08.550> around<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:09.120> we<00:01:09.270> did<00:01:09.480> all<00:01:10.140> right

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
walking around here we did all right

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.290 
walking around here we did all right
outside<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.040> Chateau<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.730> to<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.150> different

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
ideas of things that are going on inside

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.100 
ideas of things that are going on inside

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.460 
dungeon that we explored there's a few
things<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.980> consider<00:01:23.160> in<00:01:23.760> dark<00:01:24.540> situations<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
things to consider in dark situations I

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.910 
things to consider in dark situations I
set<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.400> up<00:01:26.460> an<00:01:26.880> aperture<00:01:27.360> priority<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
set this up an aperture priority and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.910 
set this up an aperture priority and
in<00:01:29.009> my<00:01:29.580> auto<00:01:29.820> bracketing<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:31.200> minus<00:01:31.650> 2

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
in my auto bracketing I go from minus 2

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.219 
in my auto bracketing I go from minus 2
to<00:01:31.950> plus<00:01:32.460> 2<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.390> they'll<00:01:33.659> come<00:01:33.780> away<00:01:34.020> with

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
to plus 2 I think they'll come away with

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.539 
to plus 2 I think they'll come away with
this<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.590> knowing<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:34.920> whole<00:01:34.950> new<00:01:35.280> set<00:01:35.520> of
