00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
August maybe early September because we

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
figure we probably prime it up a bit at

the end of year last year I just got it
serviced<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.320> should<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.620> good<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.190> go

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
serviced so it should be good to go
