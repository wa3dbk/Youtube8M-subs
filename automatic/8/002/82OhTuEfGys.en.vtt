00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
of tonight what did you learn from

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.820

again I think the fact that they can
respond<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.159> 80-minute<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.790> had<00:01:20.970> their

game 1 by halftime we could have dropped

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.320 
game 1 by halftime we could have dropped
off<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.880> know<00:01:23.970> made<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.930> easy<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.290> ourselves

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
off you know made it easy on ourselves

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that was probably the most placing thing

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.340 
that was probably the most placing thing
from<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.210> coaching<00:01:39.390> perspective<00:01:39.689> yeah<00:01:40.110> yeah<00:01:40.320> I

to say i was really happy with your
effort<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:58.590> apart<00:01:59.460> from<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.729> team<00:01:59.969> song<00:02:00.240> in

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
effort there apart from the team song in

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.910 
effort there apart from the team song in
the<00:02:00.450> sheds<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:00.899> probably<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> most<00:02:01.380> subdued

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the sheds it's probably the most subdued

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
the sheds it's probably the most subdued
the<00:02:02.280> team<00:02:02.490> spain<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.390> whole<00:02:03.570> tournament

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the team spain in this whole tournament

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.539 
the team spain in this whole tournament
is<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> sign<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.770> them<00:02:04.979> knowing<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.399> it's

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
is that a sign of them knowing that it's

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.029 
is that a sign of them knowing that it's
only<00:02:05.700> half<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.119> job<00:02:06.329> done<00:02:06.509> now<00:02:06.689> yeah<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> suppose

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
only half a job done now yeah I suppose

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.369 
only half a job done now yeah I suppose
but<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:09.149> relief<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.959> know<00:02:10.140> there's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
but I think relief to you know there's

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.270 
but I think relief to you know there's
an<00:02:10.500> element<00:02:10.739> of

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
an element of

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.220 
an element of
you<00:02:11.370> know<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.670> week<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.060> go<00:02:12.209> over<00:02:12.240> there<00:02:12.959> their

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you know the week to go over there their

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.900 
you know the week to go over there their
voice<00:02:13.380> got<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> back<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.220> mind<00:02:14.459> of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
voice got that the back you mind of

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.610 
voice got that the back you mind of
being<00:02:15.510> there<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.930> getting<00:02:16.140> there<00:02:16.380> getting

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
being there and getting there getting

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.000 
being there and getting there getting
getting<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> job<00:02:17.880> done<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.450> now<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:19.530> know<00:02:19.650> who

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
getting the job done so now we know who

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.380 
getting the job done so now we know who
were<00:02:20.130> playing<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:21.030> we're<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.270> it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
were playing and that we're in it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.660 
were playing and that we're in it
ourselves<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:23.010> can<00:02:23.190> rebuild<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:23.580> i

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
ourselves we can we can rebuild but i

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.520 
ourselves we can we can rebuild but i
think<00:02:23.880> they<00:02:24.030> also<00:02:24.480> understood<00:02:24.990> in<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.170> that

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
think they also understood in that that

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.490 
think they also understood in that that
feeling<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.040> also<00:02:26.370> about<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:27.660> know<00:02:27.989> there's<00:02:28.380> a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
feeling is also about you know there's a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.020 
feeling is also about you know there's a
huge<00:02:28.709> respect<00:02:29.010> for<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.250> kiwis<00:02:29.580> as<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> group

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
huge respect for the kiwis as a group

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.360 
huge respect for the kiwis as a group
and<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.600> at<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.590> game<00:02:31.770> next<00:02:32.010> week<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.280> going

and that at the game next week is going
to<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.580> much<00:02:33.060> much<00:02:33.270> higher<00:02:33.510> level<00:02:34.010> we're

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.710 
to be a much much higher level we're
going<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.190> be<00:02:35.310> really<00:02:35.550> put<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.940> test<00:02:36.180> our

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
going to be really put to the test our

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.680 
going to be really put to the test our
defense<00:02:36.900> I'm<00:02:37.260> talking<00:02:37.500> about<00:02:37.910> but<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.569> know

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
we're confident that we'll also do a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.330 
we're confident that we'll also do a
little<00:02:42.300> bit<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.480> testing<00:02:42.690> ourselves<00:02:43.010> or<00:02:44.010> so

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
little bit of testing ourselves or so

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.920 
little bit of testing ourselves or so
you<00:02:44.400> wouldn't<00:02:44.700> have<00:02:44.790> seen<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.300> game<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.900> were

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
you wouldn't have seen the game you were

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.630 
you wouldn't have seen the game you were
preparing<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.650> team<00:02:46.800> for<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.100> game<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:47.459> New

preparing the team for the game but New
Zealand<00:02:47.940> England<00:02:48.030> had<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.360> fair<00:02:48.660> head<00:02:48.870> out

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
Zealand England had a fair head out

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.570 
Zealand England had a fair head out
tonight<00:02:49.290> one<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.980> best<00:02:50.130> games<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
tonight one of the best games of the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.699 
tonight one of the best games of the
tournament<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:50.940> there<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> danger<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.840> would

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
tournament is there a danger that would

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.740 
tournament is there a danger that would
probably<00:02:52.950> had<00:02:53.130> an<00:02:53.250> easy<00:02:53.550> run<00:02:54.000> into<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.450> final

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
probably had an easy run into the final

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.330 
probably had an easy run into the final
and<00:02:54.900> haven't<00:02:55.140> really<00:02:55.620> been<00:02:55.769> tested<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
and haven't really been tested in the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.340 
and haven't really been tested in the
last<00:02:56.550> few<00:02:56.790> games<00:02:56.940> no<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.780> don't<00:02:58.019> think<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.200> I

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
last few games no I don't think so I

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.470 
last few games no I don't think so I
don't<00:02:58.560> think<00:02:58.680> that's<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.640> toughest<00:02:59.970> game<00:03:00.330> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
don't think that's the toughest game the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.210 
don't think that's the toughest game the
cure<00:03:00.630> was<00:03:00.660> applied<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.170> don't<00:03:01.590> think<00:03:01.830> prior<00:03:02.100> to

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
cure was applied I don't think prior to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.190 
cure was applied I don't think prior to
that<00:03:02.400> though<00:03:02.970> they've<00:03:03.269> hardly<00:03:03.720> been<00:03:03.810> stopped

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
that though they've hardly been stopped

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 
but final question it's that it's going

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:52.850 
but final question it's that it's going
to<00:06:51.539> be<00:06:51.689> such<00:06:51.959> a<00:06:51.990> big<00:06:52.289> game<00:06:52.469> at<00:06:52.649> Old<00:06:52.770> Trafford

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:54.629 
it's going to be such big occasion

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:55.879 
it's going to be such big occasion
obviously<00:06:54.990> they're<00:06:55.199> built<00:06:55.499> throughout<00:06:55.830> the

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
obviously they're built throughout the

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.079 
obviously they're built throughout the
tournament<00:06:56.189> and<00:06:56.459> they're<00:06:56.580> probably<00:06:56.729> playing

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:57.089 
tournament and they're probably playing

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:59.659 
tournament and they're probably playing
as<00:06:57.360> well<00:06:58.259> as<00:06:58.409> the<00:06:58.589> Kiwi<00:06:58.860> side<00:06:59.069> has<00:06:59.249> ever<00:06:59.399> played

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
in the last few years that we've played

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.869 
in the last few years that we've played
them<00:07:01.409> the<00:07:01.860> Australian<00:07:02.219> site<00:07:02.369> is<00:07:02.459> built<00:07:02.729> as

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 
them the Australian site is built as

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.219 
them the Australian site is built as
well<00:07:03.059> so<00:07:03.330> it's<00:07:03.419> going<00:07:03.539> to<00:07:03.599> be<00:07:03.719> one<00:07:03.839> heck<00:07:04.050> of<00:07:04.080> the

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
well so it's going to be one heck of the

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 
they've surely mean scoring some

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:10.010 
they've surely mean scoring some
magnificent<00:07:08.969> tries<00:07:09.449> though<00:07:09.719> they<00:07:09.959> were

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
magnificent tries though they were

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.199 
magnificent tries though they were
stifle<00:07:10.709> there<00:07:10.860> today<00:07:10.949> but<00:07:11.099> I<00:07:11.459> still<00:07:11.999> come<00:07:12.180> up

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:12.209 
stifle there today but I still come up

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:13.549 
stifle there today but I still come up
with<00:07:12.479> the<00:07:12.569> tries<00:07:12.779> that<00:07:12.959> mattered<00:07:13.289> when<00:07:13.439> they

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:13.559 
with the tries that mattered when they

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:14.959 
with the tries that mattered when they
could<00:07:13.770> and<00:07:13.889> that's<00:07:13.979> that's<00:07:14.279> that's<00:07:14.699> the

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:14.969 
could and that's that's that's the

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:18.109 
could and that's that's that's the
quality<00:07:15.330> of<00:07:15.360> their<00:07:15.509> side<00:07:16.369> we<00:07:17.369> we<00:07:17.789> have<00:07:17.909> similar

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:18.119 
quality of their side we we have similar

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:19.670 
quality of their side we we have similar
quality<00:07:18.569> so<00:07:18.779> it<00:07:18.839> should<00:07:19.080> be<00:07:19.110> a<00:07:19.229> great<00:07:19.559> game

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
quality so it should be a great game

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.459 
quality so it should be a great game
from<00:07:20.039> the<00:07:20.159> point<00:07:20.309> of<00:07:20.399> view
