00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.409
 you will see 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.750
 and we 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:35.180
 what we are going to do that after salted 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.250
 with 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:49.310
 because I think I have not tried it so 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:49.310
 everything sweet we need for him 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.890
 strange 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.180
 is a battery 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.440
 teach me you can 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.440
 it would be salt 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.030
 no no 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.420
 for the egg it's worth 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.380
 well, they help me, I have things 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.250
 medications 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.250
 yes 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.750
 and another and another 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.990
 the big pastry flour 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.190
 while here there are boys from the wta 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.730
 man 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:54.310
 we buy let's go home and another 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.310
 and a half 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.549
 why 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.430
 it is important that it is half a spoonful 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.520
 has been listening to small because it 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.350
 I have thrown half a big scoop and that 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.459
 has come out super closed all the memory 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.459
 Well, the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.700
 you have to put on heat while I 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.050
 I've put it to 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.160
 to 180 it's worth putting a little bit that when 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.160
 finish what you put 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.280
 well then after my face gives me 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:44.450
 instructions how 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.110
 clean the blender because hunger 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.000
 take a but not 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.510
 and you put it to heat a little energy of 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.510
 Butter 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.330
 and now with the same as this one that has 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.330
 come out important that they put the fire 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.130
 It's nice because we're encouraged by banderillas 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.400
 in the center the best front that has 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.400
 stepped out 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.700
 and separating the fork because neither 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.700
 It seems 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.900
 because if not always there is work very 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.900
 pimp open small cook 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.670
 fifteen 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.820
 same 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.350
 giving them one and another component 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:26.650
 in the morning 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.180
 well then when you have already told 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.430
 after making the clients you can 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.430
 cut what you want to throw from vigo 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.659
 but for now be careful and fire 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.659
 bacon 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.659
 do not 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.889
 in the background we have 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.889
 well, we eat it 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.490
 When I arrive, I enjoy the bank 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.500
 it was not announced either because yes no 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.130
 i 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.130
 yes 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.910
 I do not even have chopsticks but good 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.910
 I have and it is that 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.479
 to taste too 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.840
 and then you make a freak 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.140
 Well, this is the final result 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.240
 I've done here in the middle that looks like a 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.870
 chaos is what has gone wrong but we 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.880
 We have thrown bacon and cheese is quite 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.070
 good and these are the two rolls 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.560
 they have gone well so if they come out 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.750
 very bad you can make a mess with 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.260
 bacon in cheese and now I 'm going to say goodbye 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.260
 video 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.990

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.770
 goodbye let's eat 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.770
 and we go 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.830
 we're going well and we're not going to doubt anything 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.080
 she has a coffee 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.020

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.330

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.140

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.140

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.360
