emotionally<00:02:44.940> unstable<00:02:45.530> throughout<00:02:46.530> that

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
emotionally unstable throughout that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
whole period and he ended up taking his

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.410 
whole period and he ended up taking his
own<00:02:51.840> life<00:02:52.250> one<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.520> main<00:02:53.730> reasons<00:02:54.240> we

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
own life one of the main reasons we

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.160 
own life one of the main reasons we
continued<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.320> carry<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.190> work<00:02:56.430> very<00:02:56.760> hard
