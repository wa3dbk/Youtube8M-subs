wheel the whole way up and the whole way

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.709 
wheel the whole way up and the whole way
back<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.610> lot<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.000> access<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.629> the

fairly simple the top one requires a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.500 
fairly simple the top one requires a
little<00:02:16.140> bit<00:02:16.350> more<00:02:16.530> thought<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:16.830> effort

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
little bit more thought and effort

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.460 
little bit more thought and effort
steering<00:02:18.510> wheel's<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.870> whole<00:02:19.050> layout<00:02:19.170> you

steering wheel's the whole layout you
can<00:02:19.500> see<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:19.980> still<00:02:20.280> kind<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.700> behind<00:02:20.940> there

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
can see it's still kind of behind there

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
so you're gonna have to work on an angle

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.180 
so you're gonna have to work on an angle
I<00:02:23.190> only<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.970> Torx<00:02:24.330> bits<00:02:24.570> on<00:02:24.890> 3/8<00:02:25.890> inch<00:02:26.100> socket

burnt pins on mine but I've been having
an<00:03:24.780> electrical<00:03:25.260> drain<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:25.890> decided<00:03:26.459> that

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
an electrical drain so I decided that

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.160 
an electrical drain so I decided that
changed<00:03:27.030> my<00:03:27.120> initial<00:03:27.480> switch<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:27.870> not<00:03:27.990> that

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
changed my initial switch it's not that

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.280 
changed my initial switch it's not that
expensive<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:30.330> figured<00:03:30.630> it'd<00:03:30.720> be<00:03:30.750> one

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
expensive and I just figured it'd be one

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.750 
expensive and I just figured it'd be one
less<00:03:31.500> thing<00:03:31.770> that<00:03:31.800> would<00:03:32.040> probably<00:03:32.220> fail<00:03:32.580> in

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
less thing that would probably fail in

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.610 
less thing that would probably fail in
the<00:03:32.820> future<00:03:32.940> once<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:33.990> get<00:03:34.140> your<00:03:34.260> ignition

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
the future once you get your ignition

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.140 
the future once you get your ignition
switch<00:03:34.830> out<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.160> car<00:03:35.370> go<00:03:35.580> ahead<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:35.970> set

going<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.490> want<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.730> do<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.270> you<00:03:39.570> can<00:03:39.720> see<00:03:39.870> this

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
going to want to do is you can see this

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.360 
going to want to do is you can see this
is<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.230> old<00:03:40.350> one<00:03:40.470> you're<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.190> want<00:03:41.340> to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
is the old one you're going to want to

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.030 
is the old one you're going to want to
take<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.580> tiny<00:03:41.910> screwdriver<00:03:42.590> one<00:03:43.590> that's<00:03:43.800> not

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
take a tiny screwdriver one that's not

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.820 
take a tiny screwdriver one that's not
too<00:03:44.880> large<00:03:45.060> that'll<00:03:45.780> fit<00:03:45.990> perfectly<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:46.590> here

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
too large that'll fit perfectly in here

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.949 
too large that'll fit perfectly in here
and<00:03:47.010> you're<00:03:47.340> going<00:03:47.490> to<00:03:47.700> want<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:47.970> orient<00:03:48.720> the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
and you're going to want to orient the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.500 
and you're going to want to orient the
new<00:03:49.140> one<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.650> same<00:03:49.920> orientation<00:03:50.550> as<00:03:51.420> the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
new one to the same orientation as the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.750 
new one to the same orientation as the
old<00:03:51.990> one<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.680> when<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:52.980> put<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:53.370> there<00:03:53.490> it

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
old one so when you put it in there it

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.490 
old one so when you put it in there it
fits<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.360> your<00:03:54.510> key<00:03:54.720> actually<00:03:55.080> goes<00:03:55.230> into<00:03:55.440> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
fits and your key actually goes into the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.370 
fits and your key actually goes into the
ignition<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.730> once<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.060> do<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.240> now<00:03:57.690> you're

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
ignition so once you do that now you're

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.949 
ignition so once you do that now you're
going<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.860> want<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.430> just<00:04:00.240> reverse<00:04:00.630> everything

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
going to want to just reverse everything

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.440 
going to want to just reverse everything
we've<00:04:01.410> done<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.890> put<00:04:02.850> everything<00:04:03.180> back

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
we've done and put everything back

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.040 
we've done and put everything back
together

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
together

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.660 
together
the<00:04:04.650> way<00:04:04.740> it<00:04:04.890> should<00:04:04.920> be<00:04:05.160> put<00:04:05.340> back<00:04:05.490> together

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
the way it should be put back together

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.120 
the way it should be put back together
just<00:04:06.030> reverse<00:04:07.020> every<00:04:07.350> step<00:04:07.590> I've<00:04:07.709> told<00:04:07.920> you

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
just reverse every step I've told you

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.430 
just reverse every step I've told you
how<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.610> so<00:04:08.850> far<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:10.050> should<00:04:10.200> get<00:04:10.350> it

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
how to do so far and you should get it

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.979 
how to do so far and you should get it
all<00:04:10.560> back<00:04:10.739> together<00:04:10.920> in<00:04:11.310> no<00:04:11.370> time<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.840> get

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
all back together in no time to get

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.600 
all back together in no time to get
everything<00:04:13.200> back<00:04:13.440> together<00:04:13.620> took<00:04:14.130> me<00:04:14.310> roughly

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
everything back together took me roughly

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.120 
everything back together took me roughly
25<00:04:15.300> minutes<00:04:15.660> I've<00:04:15.840> taken<00:04:16.109> all<00:04:16.380> this<00:04:16.500> apart<00:04:16.919> and

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
25 minutes I've taken all this apart and

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.650 
25 minutes I've taken all this apart and
put<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.280> back<00:04:17.459> together<00:04:17.609> several<00:04:18.060> times<00:04:18.180> now

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
put it back together several times now

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.990 
put it back together several times now
though<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.470> it's<00:04:20.130> probably<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.760> little<00:04:20.790> bit

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
though so it's probably a little bit

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000 
though so it's probably a little bit
faster<00:04:21.540> for<00:04:21.570> me<00:04:21.810> than<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.470> if<00:04:22.650> you're<00:04:22.830> a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
faster for me than you if you're a

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.180 
faster for me than you if you're a
first-timer<00:04:23.760> doing<00:04:24.150> this<00:04:24.410> so<00:04:25.410> now<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.830> can

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
first-timer doing this so now you can

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.050 
first-timer doing this so now you can
look<00:04:26.400> at<00:04:26.640> what

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
look at what

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.280 
look at what
sitting<00:04:27.240> on<00:04:27.360> top<00:04:27.419> of<00:04:27.570> your<00:04:27.720> car<00:04:27.960> or<00:04:28.139> wherever

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
sitting on top of your car or wherever

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.900 
sitting on top of your car or wherever
you<00:04:28.530> have<00:04:28.710> it<00:04:28.830> don't<00:04:29.190> set<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.430> on<00:04:29.580> your<00:04:29.700> paint

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
you have it don't set it on your paint

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.310 
you have it don't set it on your paint
sit<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.210> on<00:04:30.270> your<00:04:30.419> sunroof<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:30.930> won't<00:04:31.110> scratch

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
sit it on your sunroof it won't scratch

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.620 
sit it on your sunroof it won't scratch
it<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:32.430> can<00:04:32.880> tell<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.150> is<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.330> old<00:04:33.510> one

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
it you can tell this is the old one

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.230 
it you can tell this is the old one
because<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:34.110> has<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.830> red<00:04:35.130> dot<00:04:35.400> on<00:04:35.639> it<00:04:35.760> go

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
because it has the red dot on it go
