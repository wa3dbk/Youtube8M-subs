00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
down there so if we start that up you

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.989 
down there so if we start that up you
can<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.039> visuals<00:01:26.490> aren't<00:01:26.700> bad<00:01:26.969> at

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
noticed any motion blur that's because I

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.399 
noticed any motion blur that's because I
don't<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.569> maybe<00:01:48.749> because<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.109> was<00:01:49.229> sitting
