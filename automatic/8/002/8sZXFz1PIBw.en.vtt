the<00:05:18.010> on<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.310> pot<00:05:18.640> there<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:20.820> lot<00:05:21.820> of<00:05:21.910> it<00:05:22.030> is<00:05:22.120> very

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
the on the pot there a lot of it is very

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.810 
the on the pot there a lot of it is very
subtle<00:05:23.790> like<00:05:24.790> the<00:05:24.940> cup<00:05:25.180> for<00:05:25.420> instance<00:05:26.820> they've

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
subtle like the cup for instance they've

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.240 
subtle like the cup for instance they've
managed<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.090> put<00:05:28.300> a<00:05:28.330> base<00:05:28.830> which<00:05:29.830> looks<00:05:30.100> like<00:05:30.160> a

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
managed to put a base which looks like a

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.710 
managed to put a base which looks like a
base<00:05:30.490> on<00:05:30.700> it<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:31.030> I'm<00:05:31.090> scrolling<00:05:31.360> on<00:05:31.600> the

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
base on it so I'm scrolling on the

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:40.160 
base on it so I'm scrolling on the
handle<00:05:32.610> that<00:05:33.610> kind<00:05:33.790> of<00:05:33.940> thing<00:05:35.880> so<00:05:37.830> that's<00:05:38.830> it

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
handle that kind of thing so that's it

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.620 
handle that kind of thing so that's it
that<00:05:41.170> is<00:05:41.500> how<00:05:41.650> to<00:05:41.980> get<00:05:42.160> HTTP<00:05:42.640> mod<00:05:43.210> working

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
that is how to get HTTP mod working

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:50.160 
that is how to get HTTP mod working
