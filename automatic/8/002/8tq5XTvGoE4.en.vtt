earthquake goes around and just just

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.480 
earthquake goes around and just just
barely<00:01:48.210> over<00:01:48.420> 50%<00:01:49.079> around<00:01:49.649> 60%<00:01:50.009> and

thunderous gets the thunder boat off and
I<00:01:52.590> expect<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> ko<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> my<00:01:53.970> surprise<00:01:54.119> it

lucky<00:01:57.540> though<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.680> gets<00:01:58.979> paralyzed<00:01:59.579> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820

gets fully paralyzed in the same turn

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.670 
gets fully paralyzed in the same turn
which<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.369> only<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.610> 2.5<00:02:03.329> percent<00:02:03.719> possibility

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
which is only a 2.5 percent possibility

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.950 
which is only a 2.5 percent possibility
however<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.060> fact<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.450> didn't<00:02:06.689> even<00:02:06.750> get

he won't be able to do any damage with
it<00:02:32.940> anymore<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.510> it'll<00:02:33.629> be<00:02:33.750> dead<00:02:33.959> weight<00:02:34.110> for

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
so he won't be able to do damage this

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.899 
so he won't be able to do damage this
term<00:02:43.620> basically<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.280> I'll<00:02:44.370> be<00:02:44.489> able<00:02:44.579> to<00:02:44.730> get

free damage off no matter what he does

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.369 
free damage off no matter what he does
if<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.819> switches<00:02:48.239> Metagross<00:02:48.629> into<00:02:49.049> something

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
else then I'll get a free earthquake

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.670 
else then I'll get a free earthquake
onto<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.629> if<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.840> decides<00:02:52.139> to<00:02:52.349> leave<00:02:52.530> it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
in then it just faints right away sure

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.170 
in then it just faints right away sure
once<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.319> clock<00:02:55.500> can<00:02:55.829> set<00:02:56.069> up<00:02:56.159> tailwind<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:57.090> you

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.229 
here that he goes for the tailwind just
as<00:03:01.409> I<00:03:01.500> said<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.970> Garchomp<00:03:02.970> gets<00:03:03.120> our

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
as I said and Garchomp gets our

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.670 
as I said and Garchomp gets our
earthquake<00:03:03.389> off<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.959> Metagross<00:03:04.290> does<00:03:04.470> not

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
earthquake off and Metagross does not

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.890 
earthquake off and Metagross does not
protect<00:03:05.069> nor<00:03:05.430> switch<00:03:05.700> out<00:03:05.909> so<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.480> does<00:03:06.750> get

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
protect nor switch out so it does get

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.449 
protect nor switch out so it does get
knocked<00:03:07.109> out<00:03:07.290> this<00:03:07.470> time<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:07.920> think<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.220> was

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
knocked out this time I think that was

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.649 
knocked out this time I think that was
the<00:03:08.549> best<00:03:08.670> play<00:03:08.879> for<00:03:09.060> him<00:03:09.209> too<00:03:09.420> there<00:03:09.599> was

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
the best play for him too there was

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:10.899 
the best play for him too there was
really<00:03:09.840> nothing<00:03:10.049> he<00:03:10.290> could<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.500> done

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
really nothing he could have done

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.920 
really nothing he could have done
because<00:03:11.909> he<00:03:12.090> didn't<00:03:12.329> want<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.480> take<00:03:12.629> any

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
because he didn't want to take any

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.509 
because he didn't want to take any
damage<00:03:13.139> for<00:03:13.620> whatever<00:03:13.799> he<00:03:14.040> had<00:03:14.159> in<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.340> back

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
damage for whatever he had in the back

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.059 
damage for whatever he had in the back
and<00:03:14.870> thunderous<00:03:15.870> gets<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.230> hidden<00:03:16.799> power<00:03:16.950> ice

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
and thunderous gets a hidden power ice

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.280 
and thunderous gets a hidden power ice
off<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.579> at<00:03:17.639> this<00:03:17.760> point<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.389> 4-3<00:03:19.109> in<00:03:19.139> my

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
off and at this point it's 4-3 in my

off and at this point it's 4-3 in my

will knock out my Garchomp so I decide

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
let my best play is probably here to

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.059 
let my best play is probably here to

switch it out I don't want to protect

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.559

know<00:03:59.940> a<00:03:59.970> really<00:04:00.389> strong<00:04:00.599> move<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.109> I<00:04:01.590> was<00:04:01.949> going

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
know a really strong move I I was going

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.589 
know a really strong move I I was going
for<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.340> Thunderbolt<00:04:02.849> on<00:04:02.940> pollito<00:04:03.389> boat

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
for the Thunderbolt on pollito boat

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.210 
for the Thunderbolt on pollito boat
because<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.049> honk<00:04:04.199> for<00:04:04.440> I'm<00:04:04.650> locked<00:04:05.040> into

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
because of the honk for I'm locked into

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.979 
because of the honk for I'm locked into
hitting<00:04:05.489> our<00:04:05.699> ice<00:04:06.000> which<00:04:06.329> those<00:04:06.659> barely

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
hitting our ice which those barely

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.009 
hitting our ice which those barely
anything<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.859> and<00:04:08.129> he<00:04:09.120> goes<00:04:09.269> for<00:04:09.540> an<00:04:09.599> icy

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
anything to it and he goes for an icy

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.629 
anything to it and he goes for an icy
wind<00:04:10.139> on<00:04:10.349> politoed<00:04:10.829> which<00:04:11.040> at<00:04:11.220> first<00:04:11.459> maybe

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
wind on politoed which at first maybe

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.490 
wind on politoed which at first maybe
surprising<00:04:12.150> because<00:04:12.449> he<00:04:12.659> had<00:04:12.840> tailwind<00:04:13.379> up

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
surprising because he had tailwind up

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.979 
surprising because he had tailwind up
but<00:04:13.859> you'll<00:04:14.250> notice<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.609> thunders<00:04:15.569> actually

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
but you'll notice that thunders actually

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.839 
but you'll notice that thunders actually
moved<00:04:16.169> before<00:04:16.650> pollito<00:04:17.070> did<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.669> that

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
moved before pollito did so that

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.420 
moved before pollito did so that
politoed<00:04:18.329> is<00:04:18.510> probably<00:04:18.900> super<00:04:19.320> slow<00:04:19.739> but<00:04:20.310> now

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
politoed is probably super slow but now

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.349 
politoed is probably super slow but now
after<00:04:20.609> icy<00:04:21.030> wind

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
after icy wind

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.879 
after icy wind
he'll<00:04:21.570> be<00:04:21.720> able<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.989> out<00:04:22.109> speedboats<00:04:22.650> my

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
he'll be able to out speedboats my

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.969 
he'll be able to out speedboats my
thunderous<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.520> my<00:04:24.000> Tyranitar<00:04:24.990> now<00:04:25.770> my

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
thunderous and my Tyranitar now my

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.590 
thunderous and my Tyranitar now my
strategy<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.460> know<00:04:26.669> at<00:04:26.909> this<00:04:27.030> point<00:04:27.240> is

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
strategy I know at this point is

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.330 
strategy I know at this point is
to<00:04:27.810> just<00:04:28.020> stall<00:04:28.260> out<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.620> tail<00:04:28.800> in<00:04:28.980> because

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
to just stall out the tail in because

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.340 
to just stall out the tail in because
once<00:04:29.640> tailwind<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.150> over<00:04:30.480> my<00:04:30.810> Garchomp

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
once tailwind is over my Garchomp

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.500 
once tailwind is over my Garchomp
and<00:04:31.500> my<00:04:32.010> scissor<00:04:32.280> my<00:04:32.790> two<00:04:32.850> sweepers<00:04:33.300> in<00:04:33.420> the
