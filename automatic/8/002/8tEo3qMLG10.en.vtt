00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.880 
and then I'll paste into the pan and
we'll<00:01:52.880> start<00:01:53.179> to<00:01:53.420> that<00:01:53.569> but<00:01:54.439> if<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.619> use<00:01:54.709> make

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
we'll start to that but if you use make

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.710 
we'll start to that but if you use make
it<00:01:54.979> about<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:55.340> nice<00:01:55.459> you<00:01:55.520> cook<00:01:55.700> too<00:01:55.849> hot<00:01:56.060> it'll

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
it about so nice you cook too hot it'll

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.480 
it about so nice you cook too hot it'll
burn<00:01:56.959> the<00:01:57.229> key<00:01:57.530> makes<00:01:57.890> that<00:01:58.069> much<00:01:58.159> easier

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
burn the key makes that much easier

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.080 
burn the key makes that much easier
process<00:01:58.700> for<00:01:59.090> that<00:01:59.119> so<00:02:00.700> if<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.819> can<00:02:01.939> keep<00:02:02.030> that

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
process for that so if you can keep that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.699 
process for that so if you can keep that
staring<00:02:02.539> as<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:02.929> fry<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.380> off

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
staring as we fry that off

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.130 
of different ways of cooking rice and
for<00:03:49.010> now<00:03:49.220> we've<00:03:49.430> done<00:03:49.550> it<00:03:49.700> in<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.790> big<00:03:50.030> pan<00:03:50.300> cook

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
for now we've done it in a big pan cook

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.780 
for now we've done it in a big pan cook
it<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.440> then<00:03:51.590> drain<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:52.040> off<00:03:52.130> at<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.370> end<00:03:52.430> yeah

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
it and then drain it off at the end yeah

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.430 
it and then drain it off at the end yeah
okay<00:03:53.150> that's<00:03:53.330> one<00:03:53.510> very<00:03:53.660> simple<00:03:53.930> way<00:03:54.110> this<00:03:54.320> is

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
okay that's one very simple way this is

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.440 
okay that's one very simple way this is
pilau<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.800> you<00:03:54.980> but<00:03:55.190> exactly<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.300> right

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
pilau to you but exactly the right

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.509 
pilau to you but exactly the right
amount<00:03:56.510> of<00:03:56.780> liquid<00:03:57.080> in<00:03:57.200> so<00:03:57.860> twice<00:03:58.250> as<00:03:58.400> much

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
amount of liquid in so twice as much

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.850 
amount of liquid in so twice as much
water<00:03:58.820> to<00:03:59.180> rice<00:03:59.360> and<00:03:59.690> we'll<00:04:00.290> bring<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.620> up<00:04:00.769> to

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
water to rice and we'll bring that up to

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.240 
water to rice and we'll bring that up to
the<00:04:00.890> boil

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
the boil

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.009 
the boil
that's<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.580> your<00:04:01.700> size<00:04:01.910> of<00:04:02.150> it<00:04:02.330> yes<00:04:02.690> you<00:04:02.870> get

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
that's the your size of it yes you get

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.530 
that's the your size of it yes you get
that<00:04:03.110> wrong<00:04:03.320> then<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:05.180> becomes<00:04:05.450> more

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
that wrong then it becomes more

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.880 
that wrong then it becomes more
difficulty<00:04:05.959> comes<00:04:06.140> about<00:04:06.320> Scotty<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:06.800> you

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
difficulty comes about Scotty so you

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.140 
difficulty comes about Scotty so you
want<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.100> kind<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.370> get<00:04:07.580> that<00:04:07.670> balance<00:04:07.910> right

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
want to kind of get that balance right

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.270 
want to kind of get that balance right
and<00:04:08.450> then<00:04:08.600> let<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.750> simmer<00:04:09.050> for<00:04:09.530> about<00:04:09.830> ten

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
and then let it simmer for about ten

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.500 
and then let it simmer for about ten
minutes<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.760> then<00:04:11.090> we'll<00:04:11.180> show<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.450> next

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
minutes and then we'll show you the next

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.920 
minutes and then we'll show you the next
step<00:04:12.550> so<00:04:13.550> you<00:04:13.610> can<00:04:13.850> see<00:04:14.060> now<00:04:16.479> and<00:04:17.479> as<00:04:17.600> soon<00:04:17.810> as

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
step so you can see now and as soon as

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.539 
step so you can see now and as soon as
you<00:04:18.080> can<00:04:18.229> see<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.620> mice<00:04:18.769> on<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:18.979> top<00:04:19.250> yep

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
you can see the mice on the top yep

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.940 
you can see the mice on the top yep
that's<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.030> time<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.330> put<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.720> lid<00:04:20.870> on<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:21.229> put

that's the time to put the lid on I put

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.920 
that's the time to put the lid on I put
it<00:04:22.010> into<00:04:22.250> our<00:04:22.280> oven<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:22.940> others<00:04:23.120> are<00:04:23.240> 180

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
it into our oven so the others are 180

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.930 
it into our oven so the others are 180
degrees<00:04:24.290> and<00:04:24.620> needs<00:04:25.100> another<00:04:25.400> 10<00:04:25.640> minutes

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
degrees and needs another 10 minutes

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.909 
degrees and needs another 10 minutes
just<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.750> carry<00:04:27.020> on<00:04:27.200> cooking<00:04:27.380> in<00:04:27.620> there<00:04:27.770> and
