00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
Windows Vista and Windows 7 there's a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.259 
Windows Vista and Windows 7 there's a
little<00:00:13.530> trick<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.009> do<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.340> there<00:00:14.549> to

little trick you can do in there to
actually<00:00:15.599> repartition<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.470> drive<00:00:16.680> without

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
actually repartition the drive without

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.370 
actually repartition the drive without
losing<00:00:17.310> any<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.730> data<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.869> problem<00:00:19.109> is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
losing any of the data the problem is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.310 
losing any of the data the problem is
with<00:00:19.619> Windows<00:00:20.039> XP<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:21.119> can<00:00:21.150> still<00:00:21.720> do<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.020> but

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
with Windows XP you can still do it but

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.240 
with Windows XP you can still do it but
you<00:00:22.439> would<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.830> use<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> piece<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
you would have to use a piece of

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.340 
you would have to use a piece of
software<00:00:23.670> something<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.359> partitionmagic

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
software something like partitionmagic

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.269 
software something like partitionmagic
that<00:00:25.920> will<00:00:26.070> allow<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:27.140> resize<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.740> drive

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
that will allow you to resize the drive

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.450 
that will allow you to resize the drive
without<00:00:29.699> losing<00:00:30.300> any<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.689> your<00:00:30.869> data<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:32.070> let's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
without losing any of your data so let's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.000 
without losing any of your data so let's

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
to go to Disk Management and then once

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.330 
to go to Disk Management and then once
you<00:01:10.060> get<00:01:10.210> here<00:01:10.450> you've<00:01:10.630> got<00:01:10.840> your<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.979> drives

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
you get here you've got your two drives

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.550 
you get here you've got your two drives
down<00:01:12.610> here<00:01:12.939> you're<00:01:13.149> seeing<00:01:13.360> your<00:01:13.659> ds1<00:01:14.229> Drive

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
down here you're seeing your ds1 Drive

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.190 
down here you're seeing your ds1 Drive
but<00:01:14.799> it's<00:01:14.950> been<00:01:15.070> partitioned<00:01:15.520> now<00:01:16.360> why<00:01:16.899> is<00:01:16.960> the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
but it's been partitioned now why is the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.810 
but it's been partitioned now why is the
reasons<00:01:17.530> why<00:01:17.710> we<00:01:17.890> want<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.220> do<00:01:18.340> this<00:01:18.520> well<00:01:18.729> the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
reasons why we want to do this well the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.240 
reasons why we want to do this well the
good<00:01:19.000> reason<00:01:19.390> for<00:01:19.630> doing<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.140> would<00:01:20.500> be<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
good reason for doing it would be the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.070 
good reason for doing it would be the
case<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:21.759> can<00:01:21.909> keep<00:01:22.060> all<00:01:22.270> your<00:01:22.330> data<00:01:22.720> on

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
case that you can keep all your data on

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.649 
case that you can keep all your data on
one<00:01:23.380> partition<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.190> if<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:24.940> C<00:01:25.119> Drive<00:01:25.330> needs

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
one partition and if the C Drive needs

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.170 
one partition and if the C Drive needs
to<00:01:25.810> be<00:01:25.930> formatted<00:01:26.170> at<00:01:26.590> any<00:01:26.740> time<00:01:27.009> then<00:01:27.789> you<00:01:27.970> can

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
to be formatted at any time then you can

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.389 
to be formatted at any time then you can
format<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.899> maybe<00:01:29.470> a<00:01:29.590> virus<00:01:29.830> or<00:01:30.130> something

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
format it maybe a virus or something

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.130 
format it maybe a virus or something
like<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.789> can<00:01:31.000> format<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.450> put<00:01:31.780> windows

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
like that you can format it put windows

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.350 
like that you can format it put windows
back<00:01:32.380> on<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.799> all<00:01:33.280> your<00:01:33.399> data<00:01:33.610> will<00:01:33.909> be<00:01:33.939> safe

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
back on and all your data will be safe

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.590 
back on and all your data will be safe
still<00:01:34.899> on<00:01:35.170> your<00:01:35.470> D<00:01:35.800> Drive<00:01:36.179> okay<00:01:37.179> that's<00:01:37.390> the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
still on your D Drive okay that's the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.249 
still on your D Drive okay that's the
most<00:01:38.110> important<00:01:38.770> reason<00:01:39.460> why<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.330> another

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
most important reason why and another

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.680 
most important reason why and another
reason<00:01:41.619> why<00:01:41.800> is<00:01:41.860> because<00:01:42.009> PC<00:01:42.819> world<00:01:43.090> curries

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
reason why is because PC world curries

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.719 
reason why is because PC world curries
people<00:01:44.140> like<00:01:44.289> these<00:01:44.500> will<00:01:44.950> build<00:01:45.190> computers

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
people like these will build computers

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.850 
people like these will build computers
nowadays<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.420> put<00:01:46.539> terabyte<00:01:47.050> drives<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.740> them

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
nowadays and put terabyte drives in them

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.510 
nowadays and put terabyte drives in them
and<00:01:48.100> HS<00:01:48.729> won't<00:01:48.970> make<00:01:49.299> one<00:01:49.600> C<00:01:49.929> Drive<00:01:50.200> with<00:01:50.950> you

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.280 
volume this will allow us to shrink this
volume<00:02:18.640> now<00:02:19.390> I'm<00:02:19.480> just<00:02:19.660> going<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.900> do<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.019> quick

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
amount of size to shrink the volume okay

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.190 
amount of size to shrink the volume okay
so<00:02:26.590> we're<00:02:26.860> just<00:02:26.890> going<00:02:27.129> to<00:02:27.190> put<00:02:27.959> 10,000<00:02:28.959> here
