00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
has a link to it so I probably make it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.389 
has a link to it so I probably make it
easier<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.720> but<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.979> install<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> update

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
easier for you but I install the update

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.069 
easier for you but I install the update
it<00:01:47.549> actually<00:01:47.820> slows<00:01:48.000> your<00:01:48.299> tracking<00:01:48.630> speed

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it actually slows your tracking speed

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.429 
it actually slows your tracking speed
and<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.470> kind<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.799> sucks<00:01:51.049> tracking<00:01:52.049> speed<00:01:52.290> is

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and that kind of sucks tracking speed is

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.960 
and that kind of sucks tracking speed is
really<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> only<00:01:52.860> issue<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.700> with

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.389 
really the only issue that I have with
it<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.990> besides<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.950> really<00:01:56.219> nice

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it but besides that it is really nice

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.940
