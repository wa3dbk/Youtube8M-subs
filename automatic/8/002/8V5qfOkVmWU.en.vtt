just in case you're cognizant of that

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.950 
just in case you're cognizant of that
where's<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.130> tape<00:03:47.050> that<00:03:48.050> was<00:03:48.200> your<00:03:48.410> concern

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
where's the tape that was your concern

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.640 
where's the tape that was your concern
fairly<00:03:50.960> standard<00:03:51.620> ports<00:03:52.610> on<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.970> back<00:03:53.650> is

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
fairly standard ports on the back is

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.530 
fairly standard ports on the back is
nice<00:03:54.920> red<00:03:57.760> made<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.660> we<00:03:59.810> got<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.370> DisplayPort

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
nice red made so we got that DisplayPort

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.170 
nice red made so we got that DisplayPort
standard<00:04:02.540> display<00:04:02.870> port<00:04:03.170> HDMI<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:05.740> DVI<00:04:07.180> DVI

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.780 
digital no PCI Express cover shame on
them

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
them

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.650 
them
so<00:04:16.960> it's<00:04:17.960> got<00:04:18.170> a<00:04:18.220> polycarbonate<00:04:19.220> cover<00:04:19.820> that

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
so it's got a polycarbonate cover that

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.250 
so it's got a polycarbonate cover that
actually<00:04:21.440> looks<00:04:21.770> pretty<00:04:21.890> cool

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
actually looks pretty cool

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.620 
actually looks pretty cool
the<00:04:24.260> look<00:04:24.470> is<00:04:24.620> cool<00:04:26.620> now<00:04:27.790> I've<00:04:28.790> read<00:04:29.120> reviews

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
the look is cool now I've read reviews

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.950 
the look is cool now I've read reviews
on<00:04:29.660> Newegg<00:04:30.260> saying<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.600> this<00:04:32.600> is<00:04:32.780> for

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
on Newegg saying that and this is for

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.350 
on Newegg saying that and this is for
the<00:04:33.050> 280x<00:04:33.620> version<00:04:34.130> that<00:04:34.340> they<00:04:34.490> people<00:04:34.970> felt

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
the 280x version that they people felt

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.220 
the 280x version that they people felt
that<00:04:35.600> this<00:04:35.930> was<00:04:36.200> cheap<00:04:36.590> XFX<00:04:37.510> had<00:04:38.510> responded

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
that this was cheap XFX had responded

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.040 
that this was cheap XFX had responded
that<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.440> was<00:04:39.560> made<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:40.340> be<00:04:40.490> light<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:41.150> guess<00:04:41.900> I

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
that it was made to be light I guess I

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.370 
that it was made to be light I guess I
can<00:04:42.230> buy<00:04:42.410> that<00:04:45.940> black<00:04:46.940> PCB<00:04:47.480> on<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.780> back<00:04:47.960> so

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
can buy that black PCB on the back so

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.180 
can buy that black PCB on the back so
that's<00:04:48.590> cool

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
that's cool

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.830 
that's cool
and<00:04:51.130> this<00:04:52.130> is<00:04:52.340> of<00:04:52.580> interest<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.450> me<00:04:53.780> in<00:04:54.560> that

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
and this is of interest to me in that

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.750 
and this is of interest to me in that
there's<00:04:56.840> this<00:04:56.990> one<00:04:57.350> single<00:04:57.980> connector<00:04:58.520> that

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
there's this one single connector that

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.410 
there's this one single connector that
you<00:04:58.910> need

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
you need

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.460 
you need
unlike<00:05:00.350> the<00:05:00.980> 270<00:05:01.670> X<00:05:01.850> and<00:05:02.210> some<00:05:02.660> versions<00:05:03.170> of

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
unlike the 270 X and some versions of

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.090 
unlike the 270 X and some versions of
the<00:05:04.000> 270<00:05:05.000> I<00:05:06.130> believe<00:05:07.780> they<00:05:08.780> require

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
the 270 I believe they require

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.070 
the 270 I believe they require
two<00:05:10.670> of<00:05:10.790> these<00:05:11.920> six<00:05:12.920> pin<00:05:13.100> connectors<00:05:13.930> but<00:05:14.930> it's

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
two of these six pin connectors but it's

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.960 
two of these six pin connectors but it's
nice<00:05:15.320> that<00:05:15.350> only<00:05:16.160> one<00:05:16.610> is<00:05:17.420> needed<00:05:18.400> because<00:05:19.400> you

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
nice that only one is needed because you

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.310 
nice that only one is needed because you
can<00:05:20.150> use<00:05:20.330> a<00:05:20.360> relatively<00:05:22.330> low<00:05:23.330> end<00:05:23.570> or<00:05:23.870> I<00:05:24.110> mean

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
can use a relatively low end or I mean

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.130 
can use a relatively low end or I mean
let's<00:05:24.680> not<00:05:24.770> say<00:05:25.070> that<00:05:25.280> but<00:05:25.700> a<00:05:26.000> power<00:05:26.960> supply

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
let's not say that but a power supply

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.090 
let's not say that but a power supply
that<00:05:27.320> doesn't<00:05:27.740> have<00:05:27.860> a<00:05:27.890> lot<00:05:28.040> of<00:05:28.070> wattage<00:05:28.960> and

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
that doesn't have a lot of wattage and

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.480 
that doesn't have a lot of wattage and
use<00:05:31.100> that<00:05:31.840> so<00:05:32.840> that's<00:05:33.140> kind<00:05:33.530> of<00:05:33.590> cool<00:05:33.650> most

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
use that so that's kind of cool most

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.580 
use that so that's kind of cool most
power<00:05:34.790> supplies<00:05:35.800> will<00:05:36.800> support<00:05:38.230> sly<00:05:39.230> and

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
power supplies will support sly and

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.670 
power supplies will support sly and
crossfire<00:05:40.310> out<00:05:40.550> of<00:05:40.700> the<00:05:40.760> box<00:05:40.970> so<00:05:41.690> it's<00:05:42.560> not

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
crossfire out of the box so it's not

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.350 
crossfire out of the box so it's not
like<00:05:42.830> you're<00:05:42.950> gonna<00:05:43.040> run<00:05:43.310> out<00:05:43.340> but<00:05:43.700> you<00:05:44.240> know

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
like you're gonna run out but you know

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.630 
like you're gonna run out but you know
for<00:05:44.570> some<00:05:44.720> people<00:05:45.020> that<00:05:45.050> might<00:05:45.290> have<00:05:45.640> like

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
for some people that might have like

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.180 
for some people that might have like
really<00:05:46.850> low<00:05:47.120> end<00:05:47.360> power<00:05:47.420> supplies<00:05:48.190> keep

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
really low end power supplies keep

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.220 
really low end power supplies keep
saying<00:05:49.430> low<00:05:49.580> end<00:05:49.820> low<00:05:50.210> wattage<00:05:50.780> power

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
saying low end low wattage power

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.030 
saying low end low wattage power
supplies<00:05:52.570> that<00:05:53.570> might<00:05:54.200> be<00:05:54.320> good<00:05:54.530> so<00:05:54.770> this<00:05:54.980> is

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
supplies that might be good so this is

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.720 
supplies that might be good so this is
of<00:05:55.340> interest<00:05:55.780> this<00:05:56.780> is<00:05:56.930> an<00:05:57.050> interest<00:05:57.320> to<00:05:57.500> me

gonna play games and it's not going to

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.330 
gonna play games and it's not going to
use<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:05.990> lot<00:06:06.200> of<00:06:06.230> power<00:06:06.470> hopefully<00:06:08.470> so<00:06:09.470> that's

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340
