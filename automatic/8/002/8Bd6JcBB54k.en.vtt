00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
team in in lines a few times I was like

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.599 
team in in lines a few times I was like
okay<00:01:39.179> it's<00:01:39.209> time<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.289> time<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.310> do<00:01:41.399> something

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
okay it's time to time to do something

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.470 
okay it's time to time to do something
different<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.270> take<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> next<00:01:43.319> level

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
different and take it to the next level

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.200 
different and take it to the next level
I<00:01:44.560> believe<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:45.920> as<00:01:46.010> I<00:01:46.190> was<00:01:46.430> when<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.670> was<00:01:46.940> at

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
I believe just as I was when I was at

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.600 
I believe just as I was when I was at
that<00:01:47.630> level<00:01:47.840> I'm<00:01:48.470> gonna<00:01:48.680> lead<00:01:48.830> athlete<00:01:48.980> she's

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
that level I'm gonna lead athlete she's

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.220 
that level I'm gonna lead athlete she's
some<00:01:49.760> different<00:01:50.030> sport<00:01:50.300> I'm<00:01:50.900> supposed<00:01:51.200> to

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
some different sport I'm supposed to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.300 
some different sport I'm supposed to
have<00:01:51.350> them<00:01:51.470> actually<00:01:51.650> starting<00:01:51.980> that<00:01:52.070> curve

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
have them actually starting that curve

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.310 
have them actually starting that curve
of<00:01:52.550> learning<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:53.030> know<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.390> guys<00:01:53.660> getting<00:01:54.170> that

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
of learning I know you guys getting that

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.500 
of learning I know you guys getting that
skate<00:01:54.590> position<00:01:55.100> because<00:01:55.370> you<00:01:55.460> did<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:55.880> dry

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
skate position because you did it on dry

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.450 
skate position because you did it on dry
land<00:01:56.540> hardest<00:01:57.500> part<00:01:57.650> for<00:01:57.680> sure<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.040> definitely

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
land hardest part for sure is definitely

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.190 
land hardest part for sure is definitely
being<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:59.150> good<00:01:59.360> on<00:01:59.480> in<00:01:59.630> line<00:01:59.780> like<00:01:59.930> I<00:02:00.020> said

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
being so good on in line like I said

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.900 
being so good on in line like I said
being<00:02:00.380> top<00:02:00.530> five<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:00.920> world<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:01.370> then

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
being top five in the world and then

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.820 
being top five in the world and then
coming<00:02:02.150> out<00:02:02.330> here<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:02.750> being<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.320> nobody<00:02:03.470> I

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
coming out here and being a nobody I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.710 
coming out here and being a nobody I
mean<00:02:04.040> for<00:02:04.670> me<00:02:04.700> it's<00:02:04.970> really<00:02:05.270> really<00:02:05.570> hard

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
mean for me it's really really hard

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.090 
mean for me it's really really hard
because<00:02:05.930> I've<00:02:06.200> worked<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:06.470> hard<00:02:06.560> on<00:02:06.800> in<00:02:06.920> line

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
because I've worked so hard on in line

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.530 
because I've worked so hard on in line
because<00:02:07.580> I've<00:02:07.820> been<00:02:07.850> skiing<00:02:08.060> like<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.270> said<00:02:08.510> for

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
because I've been skiing like I said for

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.690 
because I've been skiing like I said for
14<00:02:08.960> years<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:09.380> it's<00:02:09.950> really<00:02:10.160> hard<00:02:10.400> to<00:02:10.550> throw

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
14 years so it's really hard to throw

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.760 
14 years so it's really hard to throw
everything<00:02:11.000> away<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.930> start<00:02:12.170> start<00:02:12.590> over

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
everything away to to start start over

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.000 
everything away to to start start over
new<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.100> started<00:02:13.730> off<00:02:13.850> on<00:02:14.090> nice<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.020> like<00:02:15.680> there

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
new I started off on nice so like there

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.950 
new I started off on nice so like there
wasn't<00:02:16.190> really<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.490> transitional<00:02:17.270> mainly<00:02:17.810> from

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
wasn't really a transitional mainly from

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.250 
wasn't really a transitional mainly from
ice<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.500> line<00:02:18.710> for<00:02:18.980> me<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.450> don't<00:02:21.140> know<00:02:21.230> I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
ice to in line for me so I don't know I

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.410 
ice to in line for me so I don't know I
was<00:02:21.470> probably<00:02:21.650> like<00:02:22.030> getting<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.150> feel<00:02:23.390> of

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
was probably like getting the feel of

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.890 
was probably like getting the feel of
ice<00:02:23.660> it's<00:02:24.400> easy<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.850> it's<00:02:26.030> difficult<00:02:26.300> at<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
ice it's easy and it's difficult at the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.680 
ice it's easy and it's difficult at the
same<00:02:27.050> time<00:02:27.340> because<00:02:28.340> things<00:02:28.970> are<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.210> similar

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
same time because things are so similar

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.570 
same time because things are so similar
between<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.350> lines<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.710> ice<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.280> yet<00:02:31.430> they're

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
between in lines and ice but yet they're

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.520 
between in lines and ice but yet they're
so<00:02:31.820> different<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.840> push<00:02:33.020> is<00:02:33.050> completely

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
so different the push is completely

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.840 
so different the push is completely
different<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.920> looks<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.160> same<00:02:34.310> naked<00:02:34.700> I've

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
different it looks the same naked I've

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.280 
different it looks the same naked I've
easy<00:02:35.120> an<00:02:35.300> inline<00:02:35.480> skater<00:02:35.720> coming<00:02:36.020> out<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.200> an

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
easy an inline skater coming out to an

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.500 
easy an inline skater coming out to an
ice<00:02:36.440> skater<00:02:36.680> coming<00:02:36.950> at<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:38.180> it's<00:02:38.300> kind

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
ice skater coming at you and it's kind

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.630 
ice skater coming at you and it's kind
of<00:02:38.600> same<00:02:38.840> but<00:02:39.170> there<00:02:39.890> are<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.190> small

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
of same but there are just small

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.430 
of same but there are just small
differences<00:02:41.090> in<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.630> technique<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.260> make<00:02:42.410> a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
differences in the technique that make a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.890 
differences in the technique that make a
huge<00:02:42.830> difference<00:02:43.040> on<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.880> icy<00:02:44.180> glide<00:02:44.390> you

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
huge difference on the icy glide you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.870 
huge difference on the icy glide you
have<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.170> wait<00:02:45.380> for<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.800> that<00:02:46.250> push<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.670> come

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
have to wait for that that push to come

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.550 
have to wait for that that push to come
on<00:02:47.330> in<00:02:47.540> lines<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.900> have<00:02:47.960> friction<00:02:48.260> on<00:02:48.440> your

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
on in lines you have friction on your

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.140 
on in lines you have friction on your
skates<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.400> can<00:02:49.610> your<00:02:49.730> skate<00:02:49.910> hits<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
skates so you can your skate hits the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.730 
skates so you can your skate hits the
ground<00:02:50.270> you<00:02:50.420> got<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.600> push<00:02:50.750> immediately<00:02:51.200> so

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
ground you got to push immediately so

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.860 
ground you got to push immediately so
thus<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.430> tempo<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.910> lot<00:02:53.030> higher<00:02:53.240> on<00:02:53.570> inline

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
thus the tempo is a lot higher on inline

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.590 
thus the tempo is a lot higher on inline
skating<00:02:54.140> it's<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.920> lot<00:02:55.070> more<00:02:55.300> fluent<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.390> more

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
skating it's a lot more fluent and more

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.199 
skating it's a lot more fluent and more
elegant<00:02:57.470> maybe<00:02:57.650> on<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.220> ice<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:58.790> hard

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
elegant maybe on the ice it's hard

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.770 
elegant maybe on the ice it's hard

the<00:03:28.190> only<00:03:28.370> chance<00:03:28.580> I<00:03:28.700> get<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.850> see<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.150> but<00:03:29.510> now

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
the only chance I get to see it but now

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.840 
the only chance I get to see it but now
I<00:03:30.020> skaters<00:03:30.710> from<00:03:30.830> everywhere<00:03:31.220> we<00:03:31.610> have<00:03:31.700> people

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
I skaters from everywhere we have people

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.160 
I skaters from everywhere we have people
from<00:03:31.970> my<00:03:32.240> team<00:03:32.450> from<00:03:32.600> Texas<00:03:32.959> Louisiana

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
from my team from Texas Louisiana

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.690 
from my team from Texas Louisiana
Florida<00:03:34.030> California<00:03:35.860> Seattle<00:03:36.860> so<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:37.340> think

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
Florida California Seattle so I think

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.480 
Florida California Seattle so I think
it's<00:03:37.850> really<00:03:38.740> growing<00:03:39.740> some<00:03:39.950> fingers<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:40.430> to

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
it's really growing some fingers so to

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.520 
it's really growing some fingers so to
speak<00:03:40.760> across<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.840> country<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.230> some

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
speak across the country and some

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.070 
speak across the country and some
branches<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.670> make<00:03:43.819> this<00:03:43.940> ass<00:03:44.480> much<00:03:44.720> stronger

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
branches to make this ass much stronger

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.360 
branches to make this ass much stronger
base<00:03:45.230> for<00:03:45.470> our<00:03:45.560> country<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:45.920> feature<00:03:46.100> the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
base for our country to the feature the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.220 
base for our country to the feature the
biggest<00:03:46.640> thing<00:03:46.760> was<00:03:46.910> definitely<00:03:47.450> being<00:03:47.959> an

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
biggest thing was definitely being an

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.420 
biggest thing was definitely being an
Olympic<00:03:48.530> sport<00:03:48.740> instead<00:03:49.070> of<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:49.220> pending

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
Olympic sport instead of a pending

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.850 
Olympic sport instead of a pending
American<00:03:49.760> sport<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:50.330> I<00:03:50.540> mean<00:03:50.810> it's<00:03:51.290> almost

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
American sport so I mean it's almost

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.410 
American sport so I mean it's almost
like<00:03:52.070> every<00:03:52.610> athlete's<00:03:52.940> dream<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.240> go<00:03:53.330> the
