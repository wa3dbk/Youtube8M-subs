00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.190
 Actually, I was worse looking exactly dated but punished and there me 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.589
 but a little back and forth Rösler will go I hope so 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.690
 raised why I do not pronounce the trade so weird, for example 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.499
 the rules 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.489
 That should not be so 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:20.450
 Oil more is at the latest at Gmünd Braker under coach doubtless man 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:21.499
 noticed 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.670
 Percent at the latest because I would probably have to wear in the long run 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.480
 that sometimes feel like saying Heimelfelf or sometimes even fetching it 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.169
 and then I have so thought of around 1 must set me but the set 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.050
 and so I have also considered the FC St because I have so he has stated 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.560
 they are the real term 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.600
 and that's why English paus so Wendt if not are no yes if I speak 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.780
 think about it if possible 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.940
 Of course, Boyle could be said yes in Germany and our German games 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.010
 and all about medals yes, I can only say if that is of course you can 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.730
 of course, but so see 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.150
 I mean, we're not talking about percent getting warm either way 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.000
 Manon of Sportfreunde Bockum 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.140
 And many say yes nor percent Triforce or has the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.080
 Percent percent had no idea 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.770
 In any case, the gentle way Swallow writes Prof would like to preserve 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.020
 but one 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.260
 some wishes do not predict exactly that yes already meaning of German 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.970
 technical version and the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.229
 but in reality it is called doubt unbelievable but true 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 in tears, Heidel said 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.380
 and yes i do not know if i know that now strength i hope on mine 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.970
 Childhood SV both Eichberg 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.480
 mclaren-partner may seem 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.480
 I hope that I do not and not 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.310
 I hope that is not a serious reason the earthquake is not 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.140
 look on 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.080
 For my opinion, I would already be interested here that is said 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.909
 Make Visagie Race Tell someone Lula or tell her Triforce or 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.100
 she said that the network expansion would interest me one could 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.000
 Commission one who does not ebb for at least 10 comments little 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.360
 Disk as offensive Dekra 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.810
 in Bottrop 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.000
 that was already the little bit around in Bitburg as the song "The Look" no 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.259
 idea 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:13.809
 a little bit around 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.649
 a small topic that already wanted to talk 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:20.989
 and yes it is already the second ride I am a small mini-crash 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.869
 to this, and I still learn back and forth training mother 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:25.490
 his 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.480
 for the next games I hope you are with me I will definitely 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.369
 its safe 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.619
 and until then, I say thank you for watching today and see you next 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.029
