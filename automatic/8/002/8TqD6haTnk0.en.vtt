another grant dip out of 5 video and
finally<00:00:08.160> finally<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.240> found<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.980> ae86<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.790> was

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
finally finally I found that ae86 it was

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.240 
finally finally I found that ae86 it was
just<00:00:12.120> case<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.840> game<00:00:13.019> doesn't<00:00:13.290> call<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> 86

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
just case the game doesn't call the 86

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.490 
just case the game doesn't call the 86
or<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.849> corolla<00:00:15.179> they<00:00:15.389> call<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> food<00:00:16.199> to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
or the corolla they call it the food to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.640 
or the corolla they call it the food to
food<00:00:17.130> food<00:00:17.550> o<00:00:17.670> or<00:00:17.970> whatever<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:19.170> don't

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
food food o or whatever that I don't

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.340 
food food o or whatever that I don't
know<00:00:19.859> whatever<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> game's<00:00:21.060> called<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
know whatever the game's called the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.359 
know whatever the game's called the
reason<00:00:22.619> why<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:22.890> they<00:00:23.220> don't<00:00:23.340> have

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
reason why is because they don't have

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.429 
reason why is because they don't have
the<00:00:23.460> license<00:00:23.939> like<00:00:24.060> Forza<00:00:24.449> 4<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.869> Forza<00:00:25.289> does

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
where they can have the license and they
