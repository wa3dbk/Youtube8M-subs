right<00:00:24.689> now<00:00:24.840> I'm<00:00:25.019> at<00:00:25.140> f-22<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:26.010> only<00:00:26.460> able<00:00:26.880> to

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
right now I'm at f-22 but only able to

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.790

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
shoot at a fifteenth of a second which

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.230 
shoot at a fifteenth of a second which
isn't<00:00:29.039> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.580> slow<00:00:29.730> down<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> motion

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
isn't going to slow down the motion

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.370 
isn't going to slow down the motion
enough<00:00:30.599> right<00:00:31.050> now<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.410> take<00:00:31.560> photo<00:00:33.380> you'll

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
enough right now if I take photo you'll

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.870 
enough right now if I take photo you'll
see<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.920> still<00:00:35.130> freezing<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
see that it's still freezing the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.700 
see that it's still freezing the
waterfall<00:00:36.420> now<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.690> want<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.170> waterfall<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
waterfall now I want that waterfall to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.260 
waterfall now I want that waterfall to
look<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.250> flowing<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.149> we're

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
look like it's flowing so what we're

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.610 
look like it's flowing so what we're
going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.780> put<00:00:40.020> our<00:00:40.140> neutral<00:00:40.440> density

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
going to do is put our neutral density

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.780 
going to do is put our neutral density

I'm now able to shoot at the same f-stop
which<00:01:04.369> is<00:01:04.519> f-22<00:01:05.210> but<00:01:05.750> now<00:01:05.899> reduce<00:01:06.200> my<00:01:06.380> shutter

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
which is f-22 but now reduce my shutter

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.710 
which is f-22 but now reduce my shutter
speed<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:06.979> 1/5<00:01:07.520> of<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.700> second<00:01:08.030> as<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:08.240> can<00:01:08.540> see

here<00:01:11.649> this<00:01:12.649> does<00:01:12.950> make<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.310> photo<00:01:13.520> look<00:01:13.789> a

here this does make the photo look a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.399 
here this does make the photo look a
little<00:01:14.299> bit<00:01:14.420> better<00:01:14.570> but<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:14.840> still<00:01:15.110> want<00:01:15.320> the

little bit better but I still want the

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.200
