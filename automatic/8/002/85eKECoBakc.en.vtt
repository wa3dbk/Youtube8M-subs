the<00:01:33.390> back<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:35.630> steel<00:01:36.630> looking<00:01:36.930> piece

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the back of this steel looking piece

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.640 
the back of this steel looking piece
here<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.400> lets<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.850> pull<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.650> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
here and that lets you pull this this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.760 
here and that lets you pull this this
stop<00:01:41.159> limiter<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.759> off<00:01:42.240> those<00:01:43.079> splines<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
stop limiter out off those splines and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.100 
stop limiter out off those splines and
then<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.100> turn<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.659> however<00:01:45.659> far<00:01:45.869> back

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
then you can turn it however far back

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.450 
then you can turn it however far back
and<00:01:46.290> forth<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.619> want<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.860> set<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.310> that

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and forth you want to set so what that

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.889 
and forth you want to set so what that
does<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.759> when<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.600> when<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.780> turn

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
does is when I you know when you turn

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.340 
does is when I you know when you turn
the<00:01:49.049> valve<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:50.210> here<00:01:51.210> you're<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> crank

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the valve on here you're going to crank

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.870 
the valve on here you're going to crank
it<00:01:52.500> counterclockwise<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it counterclockwise and so it's going to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.810 
it counterclockwise and so it's going to
turn<00:01:54.090> until<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.750> stop<00:01:55.320> limiter<00:01:55.710> hits<00:01:55.920> that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
turn until this stop limiter hits that

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.200 
turn until this stop limiter hits that
white<00:01:57.119> piece<00:01:57.390> right<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.369> I<00:01:59.369> went<00:02:00.090> ahead

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
white piece right there and I went ahead

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.030 
white piece right there and I went ahead
and<00:02:00.450> cranked<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.990> as<00:02:01.259> high<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.799> could<00:02:01.860> get

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
and cranked it to as high as I could get

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.780 
and cranked it to as high as I could get
it<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.250> go<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.950> don't<00:02:04.950> suppose<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.430> need<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it to go now I don't suppose I need the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.900 
it to go now I don't suppose I need the
water<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.390> hot<00:02:06.920> but<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:08.369> wife<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.879> are

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
water that hot but my wife and I are

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.170 
water that hot but my wife and I are
both<00:02:09.060> big<00:02:09.330> kids<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.610> we<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.760> better<00:02:11.970> than<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
both big kids so we know better than to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.330 
both big kids so we know better than to
scald<00:02:12.510> ourselves

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
scald ourselves

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.589 
scald ourselves
so<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.370> did<00:02:14.549> I<00:02:14.610> hope<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.000> held<00:02:15.150> my<00:02:15.269> hand<00:02:15.420> into<00:02:15.569> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
so I did I hope I held my hand into the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.819 
so I did I hope I held my hand into the
water<00:02:15.689> as<00:02:15.930> long<00:02:16.079> as<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.260> could<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.590> got<00:02:16.739> to

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
water as long as I could and it got to

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.050 
water as long as I could and it got to
the<00:02:16.890> point<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.189> it<00:02:17.280> was<00:02:17.370> uncomfortably<00:02:17.879> hot

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
the point that it was uncomfortably hot

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.360 
the point that it was uncomfortably hot
so<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.689> figured<00:02:19.560> that's<00:02:19.650> good<00:02:19.890> enough<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.129> me

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
so I figured that's good enough for me

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.709 
so I figured that's good enough for me
is<00:02:20.519> probably<00:02:20.849> good<00:02:20.969> enough<00:02:21.060> for<00:02:21.299> her<00:02:21.450> she's

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
is probably good enough for her she's

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.509 
is probably good enough for her she's
not<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:21.989> get<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.379> hot<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.829> anyway<00:02:23.489> just

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
not going to get that hot so anyway just

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.589 
not going to get that hot so anyway just
want<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.790> share<00:02:23.939> that<00:02:24.030> with<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.269> guys<00:02:24.329> because

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
want to share that with you guys because

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.000 
want to share that with you guys because
that<00:02:24.719> just<00:02:24.930> about<00:02:25.079> slipped<00:02:25.409> by<00:02:25.530> me<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.829> I<00:02:25.859> was

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
that just about slipped by me and I was

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.770 
that just about slipped by me and I was
already<00:02:26.159> cussing<00:02:26.609> saying<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:27.000> stupid<00:02:27.540> cheap

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
already cussing saying this stupid cheap

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.360 
already cussing saying this stupid cheap
valve<00:02:28.109> doesn't<00:02:28.409> even<00:02:28.620> get<00:02:28.769> hot<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.250> was

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
valve doesn't even get hot I was

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.729 
valve doesn't even get hot I was
thinking<00:02:29.640> about<00:02:29.700> going<00:02:29.909> upstairs<00:02:30.269> and

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
thinking about going upstairs and

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.929 
thinking about going upstairs and
cranking<00:02:31.739> my<00:02:31.829> hot-water<00:02:32.220> heater<00:02:32.519> up<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:32.879> I

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
cranking my hot-water heater up so I

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.699 
cranking my hot-water heater up so I
could<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.209> hotter<00:02:33.390> water<00:02:33.659> like<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.049> fool<00:02:34.349> but

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
could get hotter water like a fool but

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.920 
could get hotter water like a fool but
now<00:02:35.609> just<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.209> simple<00:02:36.480> as<00:02:36.569> pulling<00:02:36.840> that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
now just as simple as pulling that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.720 
now just as simple as pulling that
little<00:02:37.170> o-ring<00:02:37.260> forward<00:02:37.829> there<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.430> just

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
little o-ring forward there and just

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.280 
little o-ring forward there and just
when<00:02:38.879> your<00:02:39.000> stop<00:02:39.180> limiter<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.750> further<00:02:40.049> you

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
when your stop limiter the further you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.800 
when your stop limiter the further you
turn<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.799> stop<00:02:41.010> limiter<00:02:41.450> clockwise<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
turn this stop limiter clockwise the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.140 
turn this stop limiter clockwise the
hotter<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.170> water<00:02:43.200> gets<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.219> good<00:02:45.030> and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
hotter the water gets so it's good and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.709 
hotter the water gets so it's good and
hot<00:02:45.299> now<00:02:45.329> we<00:02:46.079> are<00:02:46.290> done
