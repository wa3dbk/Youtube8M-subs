00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.080
 a new video on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.750
 learn how to install the game until the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.090
 8 tree that has left this day 22 of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.679
 August something quite expected by many 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.080
 of you pretty cool 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.890
 we do not know of races because compatible 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.269
 only with a 97 for range phones 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.599
 medium-high that do not have a processor 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.029
 from a gigahertz onwards more or less 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.819
 then let's do I'll leave you here in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.130
 the description of the video in the freckle and 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:36.120
 those of all the data that are going to not 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.399
 mega link that start 800 megabytes and is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.660
 when we compress and express a giga 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.880
 and medium quite heavy then 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.110
 and the application is upside down 20 megs 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.239
 So the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.740
 let's copy move the folder and the 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.400
 stockpile to the android route 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.579
 in folder 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.070
 vb here I'm going to paste 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.550
 and they are as you can see he has copied but 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.330
 flows into the road very well 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.480
 now we proceed to install and 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.180
 we installed what is the apk 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.370
 are not the servants here are 20 megs 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.440
 obviously good I already have installed in 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.390
 Laughter can obviously already be 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.110
 download it also and pay the play 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.850
 store in which Spain has a cost of 89 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.820
 cents 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.000
 they are more or less an American dollar and 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.940
 let's give it to open and let's see what 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.049
 such a small very small analysis that 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.020
 use green fire to see how 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.230
 it works and they are playing 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.590
 well I can count 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.430
 with 47 80 percent cars are new 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.100
 It also has 19 different scenarios 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.350
 88 seasons and 180 events of very 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.930
 story they have the multiplayer mode in 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.390
 line 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.860
 up to 8 real levels here the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.830
 information of the play store with which 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.320
 it's pretty cool pretty complete and 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.390
 Well finally let's see it here we have 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.170

 what will be with those playing with the wifi 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.659
 to buy cars would be global 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.659
 quite complete for you to distract

 They are pretty cool bodies in a while 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.120
 and it's pretty good 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.120
 as much as to buy cars 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.460
 in harmony 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.440
