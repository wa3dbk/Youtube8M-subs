00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
it lets you do is in software actually

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.439 
it lets you do is in software actually
have<00:00:22.350> essentially<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> whole<00:00:23.519> separate<00:00:24.029> set<00:00:24.090> up

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
have essentially a whole separate set up

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.670 
have essentially a whole separate set up
off<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> side<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.529> whatever

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
off to the side so you can do whatever

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.830 
off to the side so you can do whatever
you<00:00:25.859> want<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.000> screen<00:00:27.269> itself<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
you want to do on the screen itself and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.140 
you want to do on the screen itself and
then<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.650> little<00:00:29.070> menus<00:00:29.699> over<00:00:29.939> here

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
then you have little menus over here

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.849 
then you have little menus over here
sometimes<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.779> apps<00:00:31.019> sometimes<00:00:31.470> folders

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
sometimes it's apps sometimes folders

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.310 
sometimes it's apps sometimes folders
will<00:00:32.009> open<00:00:32.369> sometimes<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.450> contextual

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
will open sometimes it's contextual

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.900 
will open sometimes it's contextual
things<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> camera<00:00:35.520> open

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
things like if you have the camera open

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.060 
things like if you have the camera open
the<00:00:36.630> shutter<00:00:37.200> button<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.649> all<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.739> modes

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the shutter button and all the modes

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.560 
the shutter button and all the modes
come<00:00:38.370> down<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:38.969> basically<00:00:39.059> it's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
come down here so basically it's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.690 
come down here so basically it's
designed<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.500> sort<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> complementary

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
designed to be sort of complementary

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.660 
designed to be sort of complementary
sort<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.290> separate<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:44.070> basically<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
sort of separate and it's basically a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.490 
sort of separate and it's basically a
whole<00:00:45.059> other<00:00:45.450> screen<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.230> choose

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
whole other screen that you can choose

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.930 
whole other screen that you can choose
to<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:46.739> whatever<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.190> want<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.579> Samsung's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
to do whatever you want with Samsung's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.729 
to do whatever you want with Samsung's
on<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.180> before<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> continuum<00:00:49.200> which

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
on this before with the continuum which

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.380 
on this before with the continuum which
was<00:00:49.920> sort<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.370> silly<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.789> actually<00:00:51.149> seems

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
was sort of silly this actually seems

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.450 
was sort of silly this actually seems
much<00:00:52.140> cooler<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.890> customize<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.280> you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
much cooler so you can customize it you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.200 
much cooler so you can customize it you
by<00:00:53.610> adding<00:00:54.000> things<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.190> news<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.640> sports

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
by adding things like news and sports

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.830 
by adding things like news and sports
scores<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.460> Twitter<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.850> things<00:01:00.510> about<00:01:00.690> your

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
scores and Twitter and things about your

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.150 
scores and Twitter and things about your
steps<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.680> stuff<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.980> what's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
steps and all this stuff and what's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.380 
steps and all this stuff and what's
gonna<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.670> interesting<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.210> when

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
gonna be really interesting is when

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.729 
gonna be really interesting is when
developers<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.019> actually<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> hold<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
developers can actually get a hold of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
developers can actually get a hold of
this<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> start<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.909> cool<00:01:06.240> stuff<00:01:06.270> my

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
this and start to do cool stuff my

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.000 
this and start to do cool stuff my
favorite<00:01:06.990> things<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.229> far<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
favorite things so far this is kind of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.760 
favorite things so far this is kind of
small<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.450> alarm<00:01:09.869> clock<00:01:10.140> mode<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
small is the alarm clock mode so the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.350 
small is the alarm clock mode so the
idea<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.159> set<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> down<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:11.850> table<00:01:12.210> as

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
idea is you set it down in your table as

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.690 
idea is you set it down in your table as
you<00:01:12.869> sleep<00:01:13.080> next<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.189> will<00:01:14.460> just

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
you sleep next to it and it will just

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
you sleep next to it and it will just
show<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> time<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.259> scroll

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
show you the time and you can scroll

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.719 
show you the time and you can scroll
through<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.740> notifications<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.610> can

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
through your notifications you can

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.999 
through your notifications you can
scroll<00:01:17.939> through<00:01:18.000> or<00:01:18.450> your<00:01:18.570> news<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:19.259> steps

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
scroll through or your news your steps

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.469 
scroll through or your news your steps

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you're lying in bed looking at it I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.350 
you're lying in bed looking at it I
don't<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:23.580> cool<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:24.030> coming

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
don't know if that's cool I'm coming

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.940 
don't know if that's cool I'm coming
into<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.659> though<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> don't<00:01:25.409> know<00:01:25.590> I'm<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> fan

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
