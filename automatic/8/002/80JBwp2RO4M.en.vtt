00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 they are like pieces of a puzzle 

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.210
 tragedies that are part of if we unite 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.950
 all the pieces a great tragedy 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.710
 national that was what happened for 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.630
 those days of 2001 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.610
 then there are news situations that 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.890
 they have to do with particular facts 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.080
 but that mark us as a society as 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.520
 let's get to know another story that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.250

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.740

 we counted a little tutoring was director of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.279
 a school that happened if I was a director 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.989
 during almost nine years of a school 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.320
 Our Lady of the Valley of the City of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.410
 silver a very small school that does not 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 has more than 230 students this is a 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.780
 state school of private management and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.320
 it depends on the archbishopric it will be silver the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.239
 theme is that on December 30 the father 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.489
 gustavo if chinese that is was the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.489
 legal representative asks me to resign 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.960
 me when he asks for explanations between a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.780
 couple of administrative states that I 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.270
 he says he ends by telling me that I did not meet 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.040
 the profile that he intended when I 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.880
 I ask the profile that he intended 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.789
 was 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.259
 the only thing that tells me that there was not I have 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.850
 made a religious training project 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.280
 being a priest 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.740
 I refuse to resign because I do not 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.899
 found arguments 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.720
 it was almost nine years that I was in 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.900
 this director management then on 6 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.060
 January sends me the letter of dismissal 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.280
 where I said that on January 31 I was 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.400
 know in my functions that letter of 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.920
 speedo did not say any kind of 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.500
 arguments of cause that is legally 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.360
 well it 's fine that you do not need a 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.810
 employer can do without services 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.040
 of an employee in a private field the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.350
 theme is that good for the whole message 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.510
 that has Christianity and the church 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.360
 Catholic I think it deserved a 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.740
 valid explanation wash me so I 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.170
 this content bothered our 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.710
 overcoming progressive profile and maybe 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.600
 you wanted to impose inside the address 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.190
 of the school issues that have to do with 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.229
 our society with our past with 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.360
 our identity with what happened 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.310
 during the military dictatorship as is 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.880
 when we started we actually 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.650
 that I think about myself is to build a 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.209
 identity of secondary school starting 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.340
 of active participation of all 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.410
 agents that we composed teaching students 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.470
 auxiliary family 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.990
 this is an education law that 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.850
 raises all these issues then in 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.260
 actually we did not do anything foreign 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.230
 we have done activities 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.840
 commemorating March 24 at night 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.970
 the labials in what was the week of 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.800
 student had plans and projects 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.990
 the same students and parents will 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.610
 the parents support any move very 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.690
 important that I was surprised 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.460
 pleasantly where they not only ask for my 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.440
 reincorporation but they are 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.900
 claiming and this is the most valid thing that 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.510
 we go beyond my name claudia simone and 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.250
 my office are claiming an education 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.110
 free within Catholic schools 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.120
 that the teacher is comfortable at the time of 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.190
 teach and the student is not a number 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.130
 where the family only deposit one 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.120
 quota have two questions to finalize 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.610
 you look for is that your case is closed yes 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.440
 yes yes yes in that sense if not me no no 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.810
 I can return, so let's be realistic in what 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.270
 context could come back I'm already 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.000
 marked by the catholic church 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.070
 that's why I repeat that claim is another 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.990
 I have to continue with my life search 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.640
 work 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.710
 the important thing of all this is that it 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.890
 know this top-down position of a 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.260
 part of the church that is medieval and 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.210
 there is still that the teachers that was 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.260
 the church constitution the one that does not 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:46.080
 He was allowed a particular character 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.820
 of the church and an authority in 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.080
 particular of the church in this case 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.970
 who ran the school who did not 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.370
 liked to see something more global is a 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.630
 archiepiscopal school so that the already taken 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.490
 of the decision the legal representative 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.500
 he has to have the president's endorsement 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.540
 from the regional Catholic board the father 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.190
 josé álvarez and ultimately and the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.010
 more responsible the archbishop hector 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.760
 agüer 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.790
 no no no is not to continue working 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.250
 I already arranged my departure with 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.799
 with the school 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.789
 but good 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.789
 I have to follow 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.280
 and let this type of situations be known 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.150
 so that they do not happen again 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.010
 thank you for telling us your story has 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.590
 what to see as he said his particular interest 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.030
 is perhaps they encompass him to a group of 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.280
 parents who was happy with this 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.930
 kind of education that they were but that 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.330
 it makes us as a society not like to 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.990
 think a little bit about what our 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:45.020
 destinations and our historical moments 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.980
 let's take a brief pause but in 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.490
 straight new because when we have 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.490
 information
