00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:24.000
 our by the benne bomb okay the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.869
 of the world 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.869
 oh everything you created in 1915 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.090
 question 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.580
 question 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.170

 I maintain ours 6 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.840
 he does not agree, but it's a good match 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.590
 3 3 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:20.680
 the signal woman at 3 033 the miracle 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.530
 okay if you were a coach e 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.240
 time 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.550
 I would say Arsene Wenger is the second 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.620
 top 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.450
 awesome 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.120
 so if you were the most beautiful goal 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.120
 all competitions 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.060
 good it's not really a trap but 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.300
 would have had the chance to score a few 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.300
 goals 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.330
 I like it I like it I like it 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.120
 still 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.450
 the first I forgot with 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.450
 the france team against turkey 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.450
 96 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.299
 Yes 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.939
 if you were 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.069
 technical 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.150
 I had 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.390
 to do on the ball 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.480
 stop going back 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.159
 I believe that 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.159
 what I have 2 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.020
 m 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.360
 and 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.550
 I have always been present clubs 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.850
 what's funny is that I was waiting 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.470
 looking forward to the departure of deschamps 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.620
 are the most famous broken 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.150
 linking this date he left in 2000 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.760
 I jumped on it I took 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.620
 okay we change discipline if they 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.099
 wanted an American basketball club 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.099
 of m 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.980
 because I know I came here you 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.420
 was in London 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.080
 exactly for 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.730
 mx of honor because they stop 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.310
 there are two teams that I like 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.310
 the first is oklahoma city 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.599
 Kevin during and after the new 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.750
 frankly I like the place 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.330
 before jean agree that after 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.120
 particularly 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.120
 frenchy touch let's say tony parker 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.590
 it's perfect then if you were a 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.750
 Olympic champion but all 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.810
 disciplines combined to the past 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.810
 present 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.730
 because the covers 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.280
 it's too late 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.280
 I do not know anymore 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.410
 I end up with maybe three at one 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.680
 movie that deals with the universe on 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.680

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.069
