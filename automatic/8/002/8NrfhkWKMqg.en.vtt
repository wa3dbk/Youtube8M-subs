00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
there we go and as you can tell the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
there we go and as you can tell the
blast<00:01:14.490> radius<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:15.030> absolutely<00:01:15.479> enormous<00:01:15.750> it's

blast radius is absolutely enormous it's
kind<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.070> mix<00:01:17.250> between<00:01:17.340> T<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.020> new

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
kind of like a mix between T and the new

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.100 
kind of like a mix between T and the new
mod<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.680> did<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.100> atomic<00:01:20.400> bomb<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.869> pretty

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
mod I did or atomic bomb so it's pretty

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.190 
mod I did or atomic bomb so it's pretty
big<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.939> well<00:01:23.939> why<00:01:24.689> would<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.900> want<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.080> add

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
big and well why would you want to add

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.590 
big and well why would you want to add
this<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.580> makes<00:01:26.790> peepers<00:01:27.119> bad<00:01:27.330> well

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
this if it just makes peepers bad well

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.330 
this if it just makes peepers bad well
if<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.950> kill<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.430> guy<00:01:29.670> hopefully<00:01:30.600> nope<00:01:31.340> ok

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
if I can kill this guy hopefully nope ok

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.490 
if I can kill this guy hopefully nope ok
so<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:33.210> standard<00:01:33.750> creepers<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> drops<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
so like standard creepers it drops a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
so like standard creepers it drops a
random<00:01:34.860> amount<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.250> things<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.570> things

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
random amount of things and the things

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.870 
random amount of things and the things
that<00:01:36.900> drops<00:01:37.259> hopefully<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.610> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that drops hopefully if I can get it to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.910 
that drops hopefully if I can get it to
do<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.320> come<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.460> rare

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
do one come on it's not really that rare

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.880 
do one come on it's not really that rare
here<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.130> go<00:01:44.280> come<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.960> maybe<00:01:45.960> yes<00:01:46.290> no<00:01:46.560> maybe<00:01:46.740> so

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
here we go come on maybe yes no maybe so

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.510 
here we go come on maybe yes no maybe so
nope<00:01:47.630> okay<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.220> taking<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.310> lot<00:01:50.460> longer

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
nope okay so this is taking a lot longer

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.590 
nope okay so this is taking a lot longer
than<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.909> would<00:01:51.060> hope<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.880> okay<00:01:53.880> I'm<00:01:54.240> gonna<00:01:54.390> see

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
than I would hope so okay I'm gonna see

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.990 
than I would hope so okay I'm gonna see
if<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.229> drop<00:01:55.979> something<00:01:56.280> know

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
if I can get one to drop something know

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.500 
mode geez is ridiculous there we go so
they<00:02:09.899> will<00:02:10.020> drop<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.530> diamond<00:02:11.099> or<00:02:11.250> possibly<00:02:12.209> two

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
they will drop a diamond or possibly two

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.710 
they will drop a diamond or possibly two
actually

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
actually

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.920 
actually
so<00:02:13.840> that's<00:02:14.230> basically<00:02:14.770> why<00:02:15.220> we'd<00:02:15.400> want<00:02:15.460> to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
so that's basically why we'd want to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.450 
so that's basically why we'd want to
install<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.350> is<00:02:17.920> pretty<00:02:18.130> overpowered

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
install this it is pretty overpowered

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.670 
install this it is pretty overpowered
though<00:02:18.880> his<00:02:19.150> creepers<00:02:19.960> honestly<00:02:20.410> aren't<00:02:20.560> that

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
though his creepers honestly aren't that

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.500 
though his creepers honestly aren't that
hard<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.980> kill<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.400> these<00:02:21.850> don't<00:02:22.180> have<00:02:22.360> any

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
hard to kill and these don't have any

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.470 
hard to kill and these don't have any
higher<00:02:23.380> damage<00:02:23.650> or<00:02:23.950> anything<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:25.150> it's<00:02:25.180> just

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
higher damage or anything so it's just

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.820 
higher damage or anything so it's just
kind<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.900> killing<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.200> regular<00:02:26.500> creeper

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
kind of like killing a regular creeper

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.850 
kind of like killing a regular creeper
but<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:28.720> kind<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.050> risky<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.560> kill<00:02:29.740> it

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
but the it's kind of risky to kill it

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.250 
but the it's kind of risky to kill it
because<00:02:30.010> you're<00:02:30.550> almost<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.390> hundred<00:02:32.020> percent

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
because you're almost a hundred percent

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.890 
because you're almost a hundred percent
guaranteed<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.040> die<00:02:33.190> if<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.490> explodes<00:02:33.940> let<00:02:34.810> me

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
guaranteed to die if it explodes let me

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.330 
guaranteed to die if it explodes let me
go<00:02:35.020> down<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.880> see<00:02:36.880> oh<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:37.060> just<00:02:37.180> seek<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.340> it

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
go down and see oh I just seek and it

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.010 
go down and see oh I just seek and it
also<00:02:39.520> dropped<00:02:39.940> tons<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.330> diamonds<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:40.870> if<00:02:40.930> I

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
also dropped tons of diamonds so if I

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.710 
also dropped tons of diamonds so if I
don't<00:02:41.140> go<00:02:41.290> over<00:02:41.440> there<00:02:41.640> I'll<00:02:42.640> probably<00:02:43.360> have<00:02:43.690> a

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
don't go over there I'll probably have a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.260 
don't go over there I'll probably have a
lot<00:02:43.990> of<00:02:44.050> diamonds<00:02:44.350> over<00:02:44.710> there<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:45.270> believe

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
lot of diamonds over there I believe

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.980 
lot of diamonds over there I believe
this<00:02:46.390> is<00:02:46.450> where<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.780> last<00:02:47.320> died<00:02:48.570> yes<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:49.810> there's

this is where I last died yes so there's

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.130 
this is where I last died yes so there's
one<00:02:50.860> two<00:02:51.040> three<00:02:51.190> four<00:02:51.610> five<00:02:51.900> yeah<00:02:52.900> there's
