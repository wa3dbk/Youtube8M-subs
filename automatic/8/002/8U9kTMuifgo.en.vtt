00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
could take one collection and give it

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.830 
could take one collection and give it
three<00:01:14.980> different<00:01:15.370> looks<00:01:15.610> just<00:01:16.360> by<00:01:16.570> changing

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
three different looks just by changing

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.320 
three different looks just by changing
the<00:01:17.110> fabric<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.650> thread<00:01:17.800> now<00:01:18.520> when<00:01:18.940> we<00:01:19.060> chose

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
the fabric and thread now when we chose

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.570 
the fabric and thread now when we chose
the<00:01:19.510> fabric<00:01:19.990> when<00:01:20.800> you<00:01:20.890> buy<00:01:21.010> this<00:01:21.070> collection

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
the fabric when you buy this collection

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.830 
the fabric when you buy this collection
that<00:01:21.700> gives<00:01:21.730> you<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:21.970> fabric<00:01:22.330> guide<00:01:22.450> tells<00:01:22.750> you

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
that gives you a fabric guide tells you

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.900 
that gives you a fabric guide tells you
how<00:01:22.930> much<00:01:23.050> fabric<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.560> need<00:01:23.790> essentially<00:01:24.790> we

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
how much fabric you need essentially we

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.720 
how much fabric you need essentially we
used<00:01:25.150> your<00:01:25.750> white<00:01:25.960> as<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.230> base<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:27.610> need

used your white as the base and you need

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.250 
used your white as the base and you need
a<00:01:27.760> few<00:01:27.910> yards<00:01:28.150> of<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.840> we<00:01:29.080> have

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
a few yards of that and we have

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.990

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
the neat part about this is none of

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.330 
the neat part about this is none of
these<00:01:52.390> blocks<00:01:52.810> actually<00:01:53.770> kind<00:01:53.980> of<00:01:54.070> dragged

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
these blocks actually kind of dragged

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.760 
these blocks actually kind of dragged
into<00:01:54.640> each<00:01:54.790> other<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:55.720> could<00:01:56.020> use<00:01:56.230> totally

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
into each other so you could use totally

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.430 
into each other so you could use totally
random<00:01:57.190> fabrics<00:01:57.730> for<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.450> leaves<00:01:58.690> for<00:01:59.350> the
