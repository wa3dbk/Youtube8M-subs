00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
top of the hard shell and it just looks

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.359 
top of the hard shell and it just looks
like<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.570> cute<00:01:25.930> little<00:01:26.080> butterfly<00:01:26.409> once<00:01:27.040> it's

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
like a cute little butterfly once it's

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.910 
like a cute little butterfly once it's
done<00:01:27.789> you<00:01:28.600> do<00:01:28.899> have<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.229> be<00:01:29.320> careful<00:01:29.799> because

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
done you do have to be careful because

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.160 
done you do have to be careful because
the<00:01:30.189> shell<00:01:30.430> is<00:01:30.549> really<00:01:30.670> hard<00:01:31.149> so<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.899> don't

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
the shell is really hard so you don't

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.660 
the shell is really hard so you don't
want<00:01:32.289> to<00:01:32.350> cut<00:01:32.530> yourself<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.220> that's<00:01:33.460> why<00:01:33.640> I

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
want to cut yourself so that's why I

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.070 
want to cut yourself so that's why I
actually<00:01:33.939> have<00:01:34.360> him<00:01:34.539> do<00:01:34.750> it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
actually have him do it

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.960 
actually have him do it
but<00:01:35.439> this<00:01:35.619> is<00:01:35.830> what<00:01:36.039> it<00:01:36.130> looks<00:01:36.310> like<00:01:36.490> at<00:01:36.640> the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
but this is what it looks like at the

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.929 
but this is what it looks like at the
end<00:01:37.149> and<00:01:37.570> it's<00:01:38.200> nice<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.590> pretty<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.280> split

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
end and it's nice and pretty and split

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.350 
end and it's nice and pretty and split
so<00:01:40.270> we<00:01:40.420> can<00:01:40.659> season<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:43.060> what<00:01:43.270> it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
so we can season it and that's what it

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.210 
so we can season it and that's what it
looks<00:01:43.570> like<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:43.990> we're<00:01:44.110> going<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.350> put<00:01:44.979> all<00:01:45.189> of

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.760 
looks like and we're going to put all of
them<00:01:45.460> in<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.700> tray<00:01:46.210> now<00:01:46.899> basically<00:01:47.259> what<00:01:47.649> I'm

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770
