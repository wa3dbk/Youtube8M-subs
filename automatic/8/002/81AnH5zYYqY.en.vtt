you'll also need for rubber band to life

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.130 
you'll also need for rubber band to life
savers<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:55.199> wouldn't<00:00:55.500> doubt<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.870> first

into a balloon it's stretches the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.330 
into a balloon it's stretches the
balloon<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:55.780> like<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.959> rubber<00:02:56.230> band<00:02:56.530> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
more you stretch it the faster he

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.650 
more you stretch it the faster he
retains<00:02:59.650> its<00:02:59.860> original<00:02:59.950> shape<00:03:00.550> with<00:03:01.480> this
