 you walk alone how are you all welcome 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.939
 will command you we are very good what 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.180
 temperature that always starts saying 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.540
 the temperature that you have here 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.980
 good a very hot 26 degrees day here 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.130
 in this town we are very close 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.779
 of rosary is 26 degrees is an autumn 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.730
 hot as I told them heaven is 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.560
 with some clouds it was more cloudy more 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.810
 early but here we are in this place 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.970
 in this wonderful season for these 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.680
 roads that we see pass some trains each 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.680
 So we are very attentive because there 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.440
 because there are three freighters that go 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.000
 taking the harvest of the fields towards 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.190
 different places and towards different 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.140
 localities we are in this place that 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.510
 Some time we have San Jose says San 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.790
 jose the toads and then when this 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.680
 Pedro Funes bought the land he bought 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.150
 all this good locality one of the 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.470
 conditions was to change the name to 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.020
 funes was very little yesterday or 29 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.780
 the city and has a stable population 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.190
 of approximately 26,000 people per 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.290
 what do I say stable because this is very 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.120
 close to rosario- we could say 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.740
 as it is part of the great rosary that 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.990
 It is 23 kilometers from the center of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.860
 microcentro rosario and that makes possible 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.020
 allow good to have the chance 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.880
 that this is transformed more than anything 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.700
 long weekends or in the summer 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.920
 is that many people have fifths 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.050
 sing and there are neighborhoods including people who 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.510
 live here and work in rosary for the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.160
 closeness of reitero just 23 kilometers 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.369
 it's a wonderful place a place with 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.470
 a lot of history that this 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.450
 hospitalization that is transformed into a 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.090
 museum that has a sample people from 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.130
 pictures of paintings of paintings 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.229
