hi<00:00:11.469> Daniel<00:00:12.309> I'm<00:00:12.430> going<00:00:12.580> to<00:00:12.670> show<00:00:12.820> you<00:00:12.850> how<00:00:13.029> to

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
hi Daniel I'm going to show you how to

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.789 
hi Daniel I'm going to show you how to
use<00:00:13.270> tennis<00:00:13.480> life<00:00:13.750> so<00:00:14.110> tennis<00:00:14.529> flex<00:00:14.709> is

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
use tennis life so tennis flex is

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.980 
use tennis life so tennis flex is
comprised<00:00:15.190> of<00:00:15.340> three<00:00:15.400> clamps<00:00:15.879> 2y<00:00:16.510> clamps

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
comprised of three clamps 2y clamps

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.510 
comprised of three clamps 2y clamps
which<00:00:17.109> are<00:00:17.230> made<00:00:17.619> of<00:00:17.740> hard<00:00:17.890> plastics<00:00:18.430> they

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
which are made of hard plastics they

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.740 
which are made of hard plastics they
won't<00:00:18.699> hurt<00:00:18.760> the<00:00:18.910> racket<00:00:19.240> they<00:00:19.330> can<00:00:19.449> go<00:00:19.539> on<00:00:19.660> the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
won't hurt the racket they can go on the

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.300 
won't hurt the racket they can go on the
racket<00:00:20.050> at<00:00:20.170> any<00:00:20.410> two<00:00:20.620> points<00:00:20.980> to<00:00:21.130> create

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
racket at any two points to create

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.540 
racket at any two points to create
different<00:00:22.060> types<00:00:22.240> of<00:00:22.510> resistance<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:24.430> now

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
different types of resistance right now

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.630 
different types of resistance right now
doing<00:00:24.940> just<00:00:25.180> a<00:00:25.240> basic<00:00:25.630> 3<00:00:25.990> 9<00:00:26.289> pattern<00:00:26.800> really

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
doing just a basic 3 9 pattern really

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.029 
doing just a basic 3 9 pattern really
simple<00:00:28.030> and<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:28.990> third<00:00:29.289> clamp<00:00:29.619> is<00:00:29.800> a<00:00:29.830> base

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
simple and the third clamp is a base

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.350 
simple and the third clamp is a base
claim<00:00:30.340> those<00:00:30.699> at<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:30.970> base<00:00:31.150> of<00:00:31.330> your

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
claim those at the base of your

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.510 
claim those at the base of your
resistance<00:00:31.630> on<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.860> bottom<00:00:33.190> of<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.340> net

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
resistance on the bottom of the net

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.700

really<00:00:34.449> simple<00:00:34.840> really<00:00:35.020> easy<00:00:35.140> it's<00:00:35.590> not

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
really simple really easy it's not

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.259 
really simple really easy it's not
exactly<00:00:36.010> going<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.250> move<00:00:36.399> on<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.640> so<00:00:36.969> now<00:00:37.120> that

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
exactly going to move on you so now that

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:38.610 
exactly going to move on you so now that
I've<00:00:37.480> showed<00:00:37.780> you<00:00:37.870> all<00:00:38.019> the<00:00:38.050> different<00:00:38.170> parts

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
I've showed you all the different parts

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.110 
I've showed you all the different parts
of<00:00:38.679> tennis<00:00:38.949> flux<00:00:39.219> and<00:00:39.399> usually<00:00:39.699> if<00:00:39.760> I<00:00:39.879> actually

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
of tennis flux and usually if I actually

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.779 
of tennis flux and usually if I actually
use<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.659> before<00:00:41.079> you<00:00:41.440> workout<00:00:41.890> make<00:00:42.519> sure<00:00:42.670> that

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
use it before you workout make sure that

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.729 
use it before you workout make sure that
your<00:00:42.940> clamps<00:00:43.239> are<00:00:43.390> securely<00:00:43.809> fastened<00:00:44.409> don't

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
your clamps are securely fastened don't

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:45.450 
your clamps are securely fastened don't
get<00:00:44.949> hurt

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
get hurt

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.569 
get hurt
so<00:00:45.999> I'm<00:00:46.629> going<00:00:46.839> to<00:00:47.140> start<00:00:48.010> off<00:00:48.129> with<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:48.370> right

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
so I'm going to start off with a right

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.389 
so I'm going to start off with a right
hand<00:00:48.729> of<00:00:48.879> 4<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.239> make<00:00:49.989> sure<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.409> before<00:00:50.769> the

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
hand of 4 and make sure that before the

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.579 
hand of 4 and make sure that before the
further<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.420> are<00:00:52.539> away<00:00:52.600> just<00:00:53.170> keep<00:00:53.409> in<00:00:53.559> mind

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
further you are away just keep in mind

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.129 
further you are away just keep in mind
more<00:00:54.100> resistance<00:00:54.670> from<00:00:54.969> the<00:00:55.089> base<00:00:55.239> you<00:00:56.049> want

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.139 
more resistance from the base you want

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.599 
more resistance from the base you want
to<00:00:56.260> already<00:00:56.589> make<00:00:56.829> sure<00:00:56.859> that<00:00:57.429> there's

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
to already make sure that there's

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.369 
to already make sure that there's
resistance<00:00:58.059> in<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.359> band<00:00:58.569> before<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:59.079> start

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
resistance in the band before you start

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.709 
resistance in the band before you start
and<00:00:59.769> when<00:01:00.729> you<00:01:00.940> start<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:01.359> want<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:01.539> make<00:01:01.690> sure

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
and when you start you want to make sure

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.899 
and when you start you want to make sure
that<00:01:02.019> your<00:01:02.229> if<00:01:02.979> your<00:01:03.100> hand<00:01:03.339> is<00:01:03.429> at<00:01:03.549> the<00:01:03.639> throat

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
that your if your hand is at the throat

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.300 
that your if your hand is at the throat
of<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.059> racket<00:01:04.150> just<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:05.680> provides<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.130> least

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
of the racket just it provides the least

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.100 
of the racket just it provides the least
amount<00:01:06.549> of<00:01:06.670> resistance<00:01:06.760> to<00:01:07.240> start<00:01:07.570> as<00:01:07.750> you<00:01:07.990> get

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
amount of resistance to start as you get

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.779 
amount of resistance to start as you get
better<00:01:08.260> you<00:01:08.440> can<00:01:08.619> slide<00:01:08.979> further<00:01:09.250> down<00:01:09.579> the

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
better you can slide further down the

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.899 
better you can slide further down the
throat<00:01:10.420> you<00:01:11.350> know<00:01:11.469> that'll<00:01:11.860> obviously<00:01:12.700> when

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
throat you know that'll obviously when

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.069 
throat you know that'll obviously when
you<00:01:12.969> feel<00:01:13.119> more<00:01:13.270> comfortable<00:01:13.479> it's<00:01:13.990> your

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
you feel more comfortable it's your

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.749 
you feel more comfortable it's your
strength<00:01:14.320> but<00:01:14.500> always<00:01:14.920> start<00:01:15.310> at<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:15.490> throat

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
strength but always start at the throat

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.760 
strength but always start at the throat
so<00:01:16.719> you're<00:01:17.320> exercising<00:01:18.090> simply<00:01:19.090> extend<00:01:19.810> till

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
so you're exercising simply extend till

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.429 
so you're exercising simply extend till
you<00:01:20.829> feel<00:01:21.219> this<00:01:22.090> tension<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.810> this<00:01:22.990> resistance

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
you feel this tension of this resistance

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.830 
you feel this tension of this resistance
it's<00:01:24.250> going<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.549> build<00:01:24.729> muscles<00:01:25.090> for<00:01:25.570> arms

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
it's going to build muscles for arms

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.020 
it's going to build muscles for arms
your<00:01:26.049> shoulders<00:01:26.079> your<00:01:26.710> core<00:01:27.039> your<00:01:27.520> legs<00:01:27.789> all

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
your shoulders your core your legs all

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.880 
your shoulders your core your legs all
at<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.240> same<00:01:28.390> time<00:01:28.450> hold<00:01:29.200> for<00:01:29.380> 5<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.740> 10

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
at the same time hold for 5 to 10

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.450 
at the same time hold for 5 to 10
seconds<00:01:30.369> and<00:01:30.689> then<00:01:31.689> release<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.189> keep

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
seconds and then release and you keep

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.639 
seconds and then release and you keep
doing<00:01:33.759> this<00:01:33.850> just<00:01:34.090> basic<00:01:34.509> isle<00:01:34.750> isometric

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
doing this just basic isle isometric

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.669 
doing this just basic isle isometric
exercises<00:01:36.130> if<00:01:36.820> you<00:01:37.030> want<00:01:37.240> more<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.630> workout

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
exercises if you want more of a workout

exercises if you want more of a workout
obviously<00:01:38.679> you<00:01:39.219> can<00:01:39.460> go<00:01:39.969> further<00:01:40.179> down<00:01:40.450> as<00:01:40.689> I

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
obviously you can go further down as I

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.990 
obviously you can go further down as I
was<00:01:40.929> earlier<00:01:41.200> or<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.429> can<00:01:42.579> try<00:01:42.759> stepping

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
was earlier or you can try stepping

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.910 
was earlier or you can try stepping
further<00:01:43.420> out<00:01:43.659> whatever<00:01:44.350> is<00:01:44.560> good<00:01:44.710> for<00:01:44.740> you

right<00:01:45.219> so<00:01:45.789> let's<00:01:46.000> talk<00:01:46.119> about<00:01:46.179> topspin

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
right so let's talk about topspin

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.929 
right so let's talk about topspin
forehand<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.710> I've<00:01:47.799> got<00:01:47.979> my<00:01:48.070> two<00:01:48.280> wide<00:01:48.520> clamps

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
forehand so I've got my two wide clamps

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.010 
forehand so I've got my two wide clamps
at<00:01:49.060> about<00:01:49.359> maybe<00:01:49.929> 2<00:01:50.740> 4<00:01:51.159> o'clock<00:01:51.659> same<00:01:52.659> set<00:01:52.899> up

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
at about maybe 2 4 o'clock same set up

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.230 
at about maybe 2 4 o'clock same set up
I'm<00:01:53.619> gonna<00:01:53.770> step<00:01:54.460> out<00:01:54.640> so<00:01:54.880> that<00:01:54.999> there's

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
I'm gonna step out so that there's

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.370 
I'm gonna step out so that there's
resistance<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.719> the<00:01:55.810> dance<00:01:55.990> I'm<00:01:56.200> going<00:01:56.320> to

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
resistance to the dance I'm going to

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.800 
resistance to the dance I'm going to
start<00:01:56.590> low<00:01:56.890> because<00:01:57.850> topspin<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.539> want<00:01:58.689> to<00:01:58.749> go

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
start low because topspin you want to go

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.500 
start low because topspin you want to go
from<00:01:58.960> low<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.200> high<00:01:59.259> get<00:01:59.590> under<00:01:59.799> the<00:01:59.890> ball

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
from low to high get under the ball

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.870 
from low to high get under the ball
so<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.680> I've<00:02:01.890> already<00:02:02.010> got<00:02:02.220> resistance<00:02:02.490> I'm

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
so as I've already got resistance I'm

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.150 
so as I've already got resistance I'm
going<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.150> extend<00:02:03.540> out<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.680> see<00:02:04.830> I've<00:02:04.980> got

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
going to extend out you can see I've got

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.800 
going to extend out you can see I've got
it<00:02:05.220> pretty<00:02:05.460> low<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.910> is<00:02:06.090> more<00:02:06.330> resistance

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it pretty low this is more resistance

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.090 
it pretty low this is more resistance
I'm<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.650> to<00:02:07.740> go<00:02:07.860> up<00:02:08.210> as<00:02:09.210> I'm<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.630> up<00:02:09.780> I'm

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
I'm going to go up as I'm going up I'm

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.890 
I'm going to go up as I'm going up I'm
generating<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.490> kind<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.360> path<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
generating that kind of the path the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.500 
generating that kind of the path the
gyms<00:02:13.200> generate<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.830> topspin<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.610> getting

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
gyms generate the topspin I'm getting

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.300 
gyms generate the topspin I'm getting
the<00:02:15.630> aerodynamic<00:02:16.500> approach<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.130> ball

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the aerodynamic approach to the ball

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.490 
the aerodynamic approach to the ball
well<00:02:17.910> exit<00:02:18.270> wall<00:02:18.480> strengthening<00:02:18.960> my<00:02:19.080> muscles

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
well exit wall strengthening my muscles

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.020 
well exit wall strengthening my muscles
so<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:19.950> do<00:02:20.100> this<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.760> know<00:02:20.850> more

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
so that I can do this you know more

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.520 
so that I can do this you know more
easily<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.480> as<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.750> get<00:02:21.900> stronger

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
easily and as I get stronger

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.230 
easily and as I get stronger
I'll<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> motion<00:02:23.520> down<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.000> I'll<00:02:24.120> be

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
I'll have the motion down and I'll be

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.430 
I'll have the motion down and I'll be
able<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.540> generate<00:02:24.660> more<00:02:24.960> racket<00:02:25.290> hits

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
able to generate more racket hits

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.040 
able to generate more racket hits
because<00:02:25.620> I've<00:02:26.010> got<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.330> muscles<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.720> my<00:02:27.750> arts

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
because I've got the muscles in my arts

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
because I've got the muscles in my arts
he<00:02:28.800> says<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.070> can<00:02:29.190> see<00:02:29.400> start<00:02:30.090> love<00:02:30.860> go<00:02:31.860> out

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
he says you can see start love go out

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.610 
he says you can see start love go out
make<00:02:32.490> contact<00:02:33.000> with<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.240> ball<00:02:33.270> rush<00:02:34.140> up

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
make contact with the ball rush up

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.520 
make contact with the ball rush up
that's<00:02:35.310> topspin<00:02:35.790> right<00:02:36.000> there<00:02:36.570> -<00:02:37.170> tapping

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
that's topspin right there - tapping

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
that's topspin right there - tapping
back<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.310> see<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.460> didn't<00:02:38.670> have<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.850> change

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
back in and see I didn't have to change

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.820 
back in and see I didn't have to change
my<00:02:39.210> setup<00:02:39.450> bra<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:39.960> real<00:02:40.140> nice<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.470> simple

my setup bra it's real nice and simple

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.950 
my setup bra it's real nice and simple
same<00:02:41.610> idea<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.150> want<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.450> start<00:02:42.690> at<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
same idea you want to start at the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.940 
same idea you want to start at the
throat<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.500> racket

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
throat of the racket

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.080 
throat of the racket
unless<00:02:44.220> you're<00:02:44.400> more<00:02:44.550> comfortable<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:45.000> which

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
unless you're more comfortable in which

it's<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.140> same<00:02:49.350> idea<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.680> topspin<00:02:50.220> starting

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
it's the same idea of topspin starting

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.640 
it's the same idea of topspin starting
low<00:02:51.210> make<00:02:51.690> sure<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:51.990> there's<00:02:52.170> already<00:02:52.320> some

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
and I've had to redo my set up just a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.120 
and I've had to redo my set up just a
little<00:03:17.340> bit<00:03:17.640> made<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> little<00:03:18.239> wider<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:19.680> for
