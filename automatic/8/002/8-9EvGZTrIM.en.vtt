00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.490
 the wounded of Spanish prison is the 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.249
 first match in which iker squares 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.419
 you are already discharged after your injury 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:12.360
 clear questions is to enter the 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.580
 announcement 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.220
 that you have decided if you will do it as 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.250
 you say you have medical discharge for 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.590
 a week or something like that but we've seen 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.560
 that still competitive high that I 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.079
 I think it is he who is in the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.719
 parties will be available one hundred per 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.669
 a hundred because we still see that it is not like that 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:34.260
 will not come summoned but yes that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.390
 true that good because it is training 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.870
 frankly fine and that's good for 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.870
 everyone 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.660
 Hi, Aitor, what is Álvaro Montero? 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.820
 sports 4 the champions comes the week 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.470
 next I would like to know one if it is 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.730
 usual that between technical bodies 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.440
 because it has been published in l'équipe that 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.460
 you have an ancelotti cable 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.760
 technical staff of paris saint germain 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.500
 to face the barca in ridicule 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.330
 another question that is not usual 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.540
 then that is not usual not what has 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.440
 the ridiculous 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.780
 Alberto does not get her grandson to 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.670
 realmadrid.com back to competition 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.340
 after the elections stop and what 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.870
 you do against a complicated opponent for the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.060
 quality that both have because they play 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.540
 at home 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.899
 if the hours I split them in a 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.090
 complicated position and we of 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.049
 selections but well I think that the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.299
 team is fine now comes the part 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.539
 fundamental of the season and well then 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.150
 we have to follow the line we had 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.430
 before the break and finish like this 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.490
 hello good morning eleonora giovio in 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.450
 direct to land and when will you have 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.820
 and that the competitive discharge when it is at 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.890
 one hundred percent to play as 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.210
 any other player what happens that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.200
 the case that a goalkeeper a position 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.560
 More specific 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.390
 al aitor juan pazos de as television 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.009
 before the continuous insinuations of jose 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.320
 mourinho about his possible departure from 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.020
 club either end of this season or of 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.210
 The next thing you plan to do with you 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.610
 career continue in real madrid and 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.340
 think of another club 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.780
 continue as the first operator I do not think 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.360
 nothing because as you say are innuendo 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.800
 I do not know who and I think he has already 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.100
 said also in this table in other 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.410
 occasions the day that the coach decides 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.060
 leave or decide to do it that what there is 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.590
 you do think about my future but 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.600
 Today I'm with him I am delighted 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.530
 with him with his coaching staff and I do not 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.569
 I pose nothing other than being with him 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.950
 by aitor that such good afternoon anto 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.260
 tomorrow live on radio brand me 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.120
 would like to be able to get us what 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.920
 best of boxes and the best of diego 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.870
 lopez 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.940
 for that answer it's better that you 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.940
 tell of goalkeeper 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.680
 the social author of madridismo punto 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.599
 heretic I wanted to ask you about the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.790
 current player of castilla casemiro 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.989
 because I understand I do not know if it's like that 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.269
 exactly but I understand that he has come 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.890
 to castilla to possibly climb the 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.360
 first team then I wanted to know if 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.150
 of what you had seen of him in the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.250
 castle had the level to climb to the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.739
 first team or from what so 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.629
 we have the 25 right now 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.760
 available players and players 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.549
 a lot of level and then so good with 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.560
 the best both in Castilla and as 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.859
 in which you are in a very large 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.980
 because they are all with being 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.540
 monitored and the day you see that they can 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.780
 debut or stay in the first team 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.060
 it's like everyone 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.670
 aitor tal alberto but make good 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.280
 abandoned afternoons factory entered the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.170
 training said mourinho before 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.110
 stop selection to see if there was 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.430
 luck they were going 17 healthy they returned 17 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.540
 healthy I do not know if you have any problems if 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.910
 will enter the summoned list 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.160
 one delivered and if it's on the list of 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.830
 summoned and well then trips and 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.510
 matches and well then to see how how 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.580
 evolves until tomorrow 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.260
 actor juanjo cubero de nacional 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.819
 I suppose the club is already there 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.849
 preparing the next season I 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.370
 I would like to know what position you think it is 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.709
 which would have to be renewed in the face of 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.140
 the next campaign I think it's 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.599
 thinking the coaching staff and the coach 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.390
 central Madrid match tomorrow 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.390
 and on Wednesday and the next 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.729
 and everyone is talking about a game of 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.759
 champions since Wednesday before the 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.610
 galatasaray but first there is a match 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:32.490
 important league before zaragoza as 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.919
 you do not see if what I was saying before I think 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.219
 what an important match because we came 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:41.909
 of a good very good line and with 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:45.120
 this with this stop of selections for 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:47.759
 luck there have been no injuries like so 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.789
 serious as those that were the other 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.889
 time and the important thing is to win and continue 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.789
 that path of victories and games that 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.789
 what we had before 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:00.379
 I wanted to ask you if tomorrow will be 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.300
 many changes or have a very eleven 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.369
 different many rotations facing 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.279
 galatasaray and especially the virus 

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:09.939
 did not wait a bit to see how 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:12.259
 I said before is not fabio with 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:14.509
 problems and the players have had 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:16.520
 many long trips and some have played 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:20.229
 two games and until tomorrow we will see 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.229
 to see how I evolve all
