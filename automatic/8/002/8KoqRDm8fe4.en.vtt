into<00:00:23.130> train<00:00:23.490> stuff<00:00:23.880> Lego<00:00:24.300> train<00:00:24.660> stuff<00:00:24.900> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
into train stuff Lego train stuff and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.750 
into train stuff Lego train stuff and
trying<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.470> make<00:00:25.590> like<00:00:25.770> a<00:00:25.800> track<00:00:26.190> and<00:00:26.490> my<00:00:26.610> own

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
is make your own train track out of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.100 
is make your own train track out of
basic<00:00:52.620> piece<00:00:52.920> basic<00:00:53.670> plates<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.780> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
basic piece basic plates that is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
basic piece basic plates that is
compatible<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.130> stuff<00:00:56.399> too<00:00:56.670> so

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
compatible with this stuff too so

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.500 
compatible with this stuff too so
basically<00:00:59.130> this<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.760> regular<00:01:00.210> straight

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
basically this is a regular straight

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.790 
basically this is a regular straight
track<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.110> here<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:03.050> train<00:01:04.050> track<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
track and here is my train track that I

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.160 
track and here is my train track that I
made<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.399> it<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.940> not<00:01:06.149> color<00:01:06.509> aligned<00:01:06.960> or

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
made so it is not color aligned or

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.020 
made so it is not color aligned or
anything<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.950> tried<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.220> make<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.850> just

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
anything I just tried to make it I just

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.060 
anything I just tried to make it I just
made<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.240> real<00:01:09.600> quick<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.830> see

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
made it real quick but as you can see

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.130 
made it real quick but as you can see
it's<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.340> same<00:01:11.670> length<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.750> definitely

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
it's the same length so it's definitely

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.270 
it's the same length so it's definitely
compatible<00:01:13.800> like<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.550> it<00:01:15.149> also<00:01:15.360> has

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
compatible like that and it also has

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.539 
compatible like that and it also has
just<00:01:17.930> these<00:01:18.930> converters<00:01:19.530> allow<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
just these converters allow it to

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.240 
just these converters allow it to
connect<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.690> I<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> little<00:01:22.530> cart<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
connect so I have a little cart here to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.810 
connect so I have a little cart here to
show<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:26.299> girl<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.510> very<00:01:27.630> smooth

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.120 

little<00:01:32.820> nourishment<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:34.020> long<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.830> my

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
little nourishment it's long with my

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.820 
little nourishment it's long with my
homemade<00:01:35.729> train<00:01:36.119> track<00:01:36.390> holes<00:01:36.840> very<00:01:37.409> smooth

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
homemade train track holes very smooth

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.640 
homemade train track holes very smooth
too<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.090> rolls<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:39.990> regular<00:01:40.380> train

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
too so it rolls just like regular train

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.640 
too so it rolls just like regular train
track<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.270> very<00:01:42.540> nice<00:01:42.900> because<00:01:43.260> we

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
track so this is very nice because we

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.520 
track so this is very nice because we
can<00:01:43.830> do<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.189> sit<00:01:44.759> them<00:01:44.970> together<00:01:45.259> take<00:01:46.259> this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
can do is sit them together take this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.690 
can do is sit them together take this
and<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:48.030> connect<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.650> I<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.670> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and just connect it and I do have a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.039 
and just connect it and I do have a
piece<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.390> middle<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> make<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.140> sturdy<00:01:52.470> so

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
piece in the middle to make it sturdy so

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.010 
piece in the middle to make it sturdy so
yeah<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.590> basically

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
yeah but basically

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.889 
yeah but basically
you<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.770> do<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.600> there<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.750> your

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
you just do that and there is your

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.840 
you just do that and there is your
straight<00:02:01.320> train<00:02:01.649> track<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.429> definitely

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
straight train track and it's definitely

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
straight train track and it's definitely
compatible<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.020> other<00:02:04.140> train<00:02:04.439> tracks

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
compatible with the other train tracks

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.199 
compatible with the other train tracks
now<00:02:05.549> there<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> bump<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:08.340> shouldn't<00:02:09.060> it

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
now there is a bump so it shouldn't it

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.029 
now there is a bump so it shouldn't it
doesn't<00:02:09.569> really<00:02:09.690> mess<00:02:09.959> up<00:02:09.989> trains<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.830> stuff

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
doesn't really mess up trains and stuff

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.520 
doesn't really mess up trains and stuff
test<00:02:11.519> it<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.030> yeah<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.230> slight

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
test it but yeah it's just a slight

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.360 
test it but yeah it's just a slight
little<00:02:13.560> pump<00:02:14.549> height<00:02:15.150> wise<00:02:15.390> but<00:02:16.220> because<00:02:17.220> it

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
little pump height wise but because it

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.650 
little pump height wise but because it
doesn't<00:02:17.519> really<00:02:17.670> have<00:02:17.879> any<00:02:18.060> weight<00:02:18.239> on<00:02:18.450> this

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
doesn't really have any weight on this

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.820 
doesn't really have any weight on this
think<00:02:18.989> cart<00:02:19.260> right<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:21.410> yeah<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.590> works

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
think cart right now so yeah it works

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.160 
think cart right now so yeah it works
pretty<00:02:23.099> good<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.910> also<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:24.480> straight

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
pretty good and I also have straight

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.830 
pretty good and I also have straight
track<00:02:25.470> over<00:02:25.680> here<00:02:25.769> which<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.090> mean<00:02:27.569> curved

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
track over here which I mean curved

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.630 
track over here which I mean curved
track<00:02:28.170> over<00:02:28.349> here<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.799> it's<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.220> like<00:02:29.459> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
track over here so it's just like the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.030 
track over here so it's just like the
curved<00:02:29.819> track<00:02:30.209> same<00:02:31.170> size<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.860> everything

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
curved track same size and everything

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.600 
curved track same size and everything
and<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:33.420> also<00:02:33.630> works<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.709> let<00:02:34.920> me<00:02:35.040> connect<00:02:35.430> it

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
and it also works so let me connect it

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.949 
and it also works so let me connect it
just<00:02:37.069> it's<00:02:38.069> very<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.790> tracks<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.239> easy<00:02:39.660> to

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
just it's very this tracks very easy to

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.789 
just it's very this tracks very easy to
connect<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:41.400> literally<00:02:41.849> just<00:02:42.150> put<00:02:42.799> pretty

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
connect you literally just put pretty

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.180 
connect you literally just put pretty
much<00:02:43.860> any<00:02:44.280> plate<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:45.360> have<00:02:45.390> around<00:02:45.950> just<00:02:46.950> on

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
much any plate you have around just on

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.509 
much any plate you have around just on
there<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.670> kind<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.910> hard<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.540> one<00:02:48.810> hand

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
there it's kind of hard with one hand

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.350 
there it's kind of hard with one hand
okay<00:02:50.519> so<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.120> good<00:02:51.440> okay<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.060> there<00:02:54.060> we<00:02:54.150> go

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
okay so it's good okay so there we go

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.660 
okay so it's good okay so there we go
just<00:02:56.150> rolls<00:02:57.150> right<00:02:57.329> on<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:59.459> that's

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
just rolls right on that and that's

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.199 
just rolls right on that and that's
curved<00:03:00.150> track<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:04.370> yeah<00:03:05.370> more<00:03:05.880> straight

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
curved track and then yeah more straight

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.050 
curved track and then yeah more straight
track<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.720> finally<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.190> cross<00:03:08.760> way

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
track and finally I have this cross way

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.349 
track and finally I have this cross way
intersection<00:03:10.220> basically<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:11.400> homemade

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
intersection basically is just homemade

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:23.509 
intersection basically is just homemade
so<00:03:12.989> here's<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:14.120> LEGO<00:03:15.120> version<00:03:22.220> kind<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.310> hard

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
so here's the LEGO version kind of hard

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.520 
so here's the LEGO version kind of hard
to<00:03:23.579> line<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.030> tracks<00:03:24.329> over<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.959> camera<00:03:25.170> but

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
to line the tracks over the camera but

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.080 
to line the tracks over the camera but
basically<00:03:26.040> here's<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.750> Lego<00:03:27.750> version

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.080 

and<00:03:33.050> I'm<00:03:33.709> using<00:03:33.920> this<00:03:34.130> leg<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:34.489> cart<00:03:34.730> just<00:03:35.000> to

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
and I'm using this leg of cart just to

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.059 
and I'm using this leg of cart just to
show<00:03:35.270> it's<00:03:35.450> compatible<00:03:35.900> with<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.500> trains<00:03:36.830> and

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
show it's compatible with the trains and

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.360 
show it's compatible with the trains and
stuff<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:38.030> yeah<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.230> here<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.709> basically<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
stuff so yeah so here is basically the

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.290 
stuff so yeah so here is basically the
leg<00:03:40.489> of<00:03:40.640> intersection<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:42.280> for<00:03:43.280> this<00:03:43.670> stuff<00:03:43.940> I

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
leg of intersection and for this stuff I

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.570 
leg of intersection and for this stuff I
don't<00:03:44.720> really<00:03:45.140> I'm<00:03:45.680> not<00:03:45.739> going<00:03:46.069> to<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.340> don't

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
plate two 1 by 6 plates and then you

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.080 
plate two 1 by 6 plates and then you
need<00:04:03.489> 4<00:04:04.489> 2<00:04:05.120> by<00:04:05.390> 8<00:04:05.660> plates<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:06.620> then<00:04:06.980> of<00:04:07.280> just<00:04:07.940> a

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
need 4 2 by 8 plates and then of just a

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.870 
need 4 2 by 8 plates and then of just a
long<00:04:08.330> plate<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.930> any<00:04:09.080> kind<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.709> just<00:04:09.880> connect

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
long plate of any kind you just connect

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.690 
long plate of any kind you just connect
it<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.150> sturdy<00:04:11.480> it<00:04:11.690> so<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.019> doesn't<00:04:12.230> like<00:04:12.890> bend

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
it and sturdy it so it doesn't like bend

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.449 
it and sturdy it so it doesn't like bend
and<00:04:13.970> stuff<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.420> come<00:04:14.660> apart<00:04:14.989> now<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.830> can<00:04:16.190> work

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
and stuff and come apart now it can work

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.210 
and stuff and come apart now it can work
without<00:04:16.639> that<00:04:17.030> plate<00:04:17.329> but<00:04:17.690> this<00:04:18.200> really<00:04:18.799> helps

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
without that plate but this really helps

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.379 
without that plate but this really helps
it<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.489> be<00:04:19.609> sturdy<00:04:19.970> like<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.540> Lego<00:04:20.959> stuff<00:04:22.389> see

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
it to be sturdy like the Lego stuff see

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.719 
it to be sturdy like the Lego stuff see
doesn't<00:04:24.020> Bend<00:04:24.320> or<00:04:24.470> anything<00:04:24.680> so<00:04:25.310> yeah<00:04:25.490> the

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
doesn't Bend or anything so yeah the

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.320 
doesn't Bend or anything so yeah the
converters<00:04:26.330> are<00:04:26.570> also<00:04:26.750> very<00:04:27.260> simple<00:04:27.800> just<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.850> 1

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
converters are also very simple just a 1

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.700 
converters are also very simple just a 1
by<00:04:29.479> 2<00:04:29.540> plate<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:31.479> 1<00:04:32.479> by<00:04:32.690> 8<00:04:33.020> plate<00:04:33.500> with<00:04:33.860> two<00:04:33.889> of

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
by 2 plate on a 1 by 8 plate with two of

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.510 
by 2 plate on a 1 by 8 plate with two of
these<00:04:36.710> pieces<00:04:37.010> so<00:04:37.750> yeah<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:39.140> then<00:04:39.289> the<00:04:39.560> this

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
these pieces so yeah and then the this

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.090 
these pieces so yeah and then the this
track<00:04:40.940> this<00:04:41.300> thing<00:04:41.630> right<00:04:42.140> here<00:04:42.169> is<00:04:42.530> simple

then 2 4 by 8 plates just making a
square<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.360> then<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.840> just<00:04:57.050> align<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.590> up

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
square and then you just align it up

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.680 
square and then you just align it up
like<00:04:57.890> that<00:04:57.919> can<00:04:58.789> pause<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.210> video<00:04:59.330> if<00:04:59.539> you

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
like that can pause the video if you

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.090 
like that can pause the video if you
want<00:04:59.780> just<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.289> make<00:05:01.070> your<00:05:01.340> own<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:03.100> yeah

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
want just to make your own and yeah

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.980 
want just to make your own and yeah
that's<00:05:04.310> also<00:05:04.760> very<00:05:04.789> simple<00:05:05.450> then<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.720> curved

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
that's also very simple then the curved

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.750 
that's also very simple then the curved
track<00:05:06.380> this<00:05:06.620> one<00:05:06.800> was<00:05:07.010> really<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.430> hardest

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
track this one was really the hardest

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.690 
track this one was really the hardest
part<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:09.260> is<00:05:09.470> very<00:05:09.770> it's<00:05:10.160> kind<00:05:10.430> of<00:05:10.490> bumpy

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
part and it is very it's kind of bumpy

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.029 
part and it is very it's kind of bumpy
it's<00:05:11.180> not<00:05:11.389> as<00:05:11.539> smooth<00:05:11.870> as<00:05:12.110> my<00:05:12.320> straight<00:05:12.740> and

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
it's not as smooth as my straight and

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.270 
it's not as smooth as my straight and
that<00:05:13.760> but<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:15.020> definitely<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:16.130> definitely

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
that but it definitely it definitely

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.719 
that but it definitely it definitely
does<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.729> job<00:05:16.910> I've<00:05:17.479> actually<00:05:17.660> used<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:18.320> so<00:05:18.729> so

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
does the job I've actually used it so so

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.240 
does the job I've actually used it so so
basically<00:05:20.180> what<00:05:20.419> you<00:05:20.539> do<00:05:20.780> is<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:21.530> take<00:05:21.800> these

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
basically what you do is you take these

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.590 
basically what you do is you take these
bending<00:05:23.000> pieces<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:24.650> are<00:05:25.090> that<00:05:26.090> create<00:05:26.389> a<00:05:26.450> 1

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
bending pieces that are that create a 1

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.110 
bending pieces that are that create a 1
by<00:05:26.750> 4<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:27.289> you<00:05:27.320> take<00:05:27.650> C<00:05:28.580> on<00:05:29.180> 2<00:05:29.600> 3<00:05:30.260> 4<00:05:30.889> 5<00:05:31.100> 5<00:05:31.400> of<00:05:32.000> them

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
by 4 and you take C on 2 3 4 5 5 of them

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.040 
by 4 and you take C on 2 3 4 5 5 of them
and<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.479> stack<00:05:32.870> them<00:05:33.310> kind<00:05:34.310> of<00:05:34.400> like<00:05:35.020> you<00:05:36.020> can

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
and you stack them kind of like you can

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.730 
and you stack them kind of like you can
tell<00:05:36.530> just<00:05:36.860> one<00:05:37.669> on<00:05:38.000> top<00:05:38.450> of<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:38.780> other<00:05:38.960> then

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
tell just one on top of the other then

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.130 
tell just one on top of the other then
you<00:05:39.889> bend<00:05:40.190> them<00:05:40.430> slightly<00:05:40.789> and<00:05:41.210> you<00:05:41.300> have<00:05:41.450> 2<00:05:41.990> by

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
you bend them slightly and you have 2 by

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.760 
you bend them slightly and you have 2 by
8<00:05:42.320> plates<00:05:42.650> you<00:05:43.010> need<00:05:43.159> 1<00:05:43.430> 2

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
8 plates you need 1 2

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.119 
8 plates you need 1 2
three<00:05:44.129> four<00:05:44.550> five<00:05:44.580> six<00:05:44.879> of<00:05:45.660> them<00:05:45.840> six<00:05:46.650> two<00:05:46.919> body

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129
