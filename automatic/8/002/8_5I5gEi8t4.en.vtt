00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
that you're able to print on your

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.660 
that you're able to print on your
computer<00:03:28.110> on<00:03:28.290> your<00:03:28.440> printer<00:03:28.710> but<00:03:29.370> every

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
computer on your printer but every

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.410 
computer on your printer but every
printer<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.180> different<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.930> want<00:03:31.890> my<00:03:32.420> date

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
printer is different I want my date

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.300 
printer is different I want my date
ideas<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.050> be<00:03:34.200> on<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.500> white<00:03:34.710> side<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.220> the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
ideas to be on the white side of the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.400 
ideas to be on the white side of the
paper<00:03:35.490> so<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.910> have<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.390> put<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.690> design<00:03:37.020> face

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
paper so I have to put the design face

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.830 
paper so I have to put the design face
up<00:03:37.710> in<00:03:37.860> my<00:03:38.040> printer<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:38.790> your<00:03:39.030> printer<00:03:39.420> may<00:03:39.780> be

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
up in my printer but your printer may be

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.660 
up in my printer but your printer may be
different<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.560> just<00:03:40.770> check<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.160> out<00:03:41.310> I

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
different so just check it out I

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.700 
different so just check it out I
experiment<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.660> little<00:03:42.810> with<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.320> see<00:03:43.530> how

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
experiment a little with it to see how

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.220 
experiment a little with it to see how
that<00:03:43.920> works<00:03:44.160> we<00:03:44.460> see<00:03:44.730> when<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.420> put<00:03:45.660> mine<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:46.020> the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
that works we see when I put mine in the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.700 
that works we see when I put mine in the
design<00:03:46.500> head<00:03:46.740> up<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.100> flips<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.520> over<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.240> the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
design head up it flips it over so the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.160 
design head up it flips it over so the
print<00:03:49.710> is<00:03:49.950> on<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.490> other<00:03:50.670> side<00:03:51.000> which<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:51.870> what

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
print is on the other side which is what

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.290 
print is on the other side which is what
we<00:03:52.350> want<00:03:55.340> now<00:03:56.340> I'm<00:03:56.490> just<00:03:56.640> kind<00:03:56.880> of<00:03:56.970> scanning

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
we want now I'm just kind of scanning

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.330 
we want now I'm just kind of scanning
through<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.720> few<00:03:58.020> of<00:03:58.050> my<00:03:58.230> ideas<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:59.190> guys

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:25.379 
so here comes the not-so-fun part

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:27.420 
so here comes the not-so-fun part
single-handedly<00:04:26.379> cutting<00:04:26.770> out<00:04:26.889> all<00:04:27.099> of<00:04:27.129> those

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
single-handedly cutting out all of those

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.249 
single-handedly cutting out all of those
was<00:04:27.879> seriously<00:04:28.750> not<00:04:29.020> fun<00:04:29.349> at<00:04:29.500> all<00:04:29.710> just<00:04:30.370> saying

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
was seriously not fun at all just saying

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.300 
was seriously not fun at all just saying
there<00:04:32.259> are<00:04:32.289> many<00:04:32.560> different<00:04:32.889> ways<00:04:32.919> that<00:04:33.069> you

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
there are many different ways that you

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.219 
there are many different ways that you
can<00:04:33.430> put<00:04:33.639> this<00:04:33.729> in<00:04:33.969> your<00:04:34.120> jar<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:35.020> don't<00:04:35.139> have

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
can put this in your jar you don't have

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.570 
can put this in your jar you don't have
to<00:04:35.349> do<00:04:35.439> anything<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.979> it<00:04:36.069> you<00:04:36.159> can<00:04:36.280> just<00:04:36.310> put

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
to do anything to it you can just put

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.939 
to do anything to it you can just put
them<00:04:36.729> in<00:04:36.759> there<00:04:37.000> randomly<00:04:37.479> I<00:04:37.810> rolled<00:04:38.469> mine<00:04:38.740> off

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
them in there randomly I rolled mine off

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.189 
them in there randomly I rolled mine off
and<00:04:38.979> then<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:39.340> put<00:04:39.639> some<00:04:39.669> tape<00:04:40.150> on<00:04:40.389> it<00:04:40.689> but<00:04:41.169> I

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
and then I put some tape on it but I

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.869 
and then I put some tape on it but I
didn't<00:04:41.530> want<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.710> tape<00:04:41.919> adhesive<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.759> be

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
didn't want the tape adhesive to be

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.339 
didn't want the tape adhesive to be
really<00:04:43.180> strong<00:04:43.479> so<00:04:43.659> it<00:04:43.719> would<00:04:43.810> rip<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.199> paper

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
really strong so it would rip the paper

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.170 
really strong so it would rip the paper
so<00:04:44.680> I<00:04:44.710> kind<00:04:44.979> of<00:04:45.069> put<00:04:45.189> it<00:04:45.280> on<00:04:45.370> my<00:04:45.520> finger<00:04:45.580> a<00:04:45.909> few

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
so I kind of put it on my finger a few

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.719 
so I kind of put it on my finger a few
times<00:04:46.509> and<00:04:46.870> then<00:04:47.409> I<00:04:47.439> I<00:04:47.830> taped<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.490> but<00:04:48.669> the

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
times and then I I taped it but the

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.050 
times and then I I taped it but the
other<00:04:48.849> ideas<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.659> can<00:04:50.169> use<00:04:50.310> stickers<00:04:51.310> you

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
other ideas you can use stickers you

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.839 
other ideas you can use stickers you
could<00:04:52.330> use<00:04:52.770> lots<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:53.919> other<00:04:54.069> things<00:04:54.159> with<00:04:54.849> that

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
could use lots of other things with that

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.520 
could use lots of other things with that
so<00:04:57.849> to<00:04:57.909> make<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.449> key<00:04:58.659> you<00:04:58.780> want<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.080> take<00:04:59.259> your

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
so to make the key you want to take your

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.260 
so to make the key you want to take your
lid<00:04:59.800> and<00:04:59.830> then<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.280> piece<00:05:00.550> of<00:05:00.699> paper<00:05:00.879> and<00:05:01.180> just

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
lid and then a piece of paper and just

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.420 
lid and then a piece of paper and just
trace<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.259> around<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.680> piece<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:02.979> paper<00:05:03.159> and

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
trace it around the piece of paper and

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.700 
trace it around the piece of paper and
then<00:05:03.580> cut<00:05:03.819> it<00:05:03.849> out<00:05:04.060> so<00:05:04.750> it<00:05:04.960> will<00:05:05.110> fit<00:05:05.319> your<00:05:05.469> lid

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
then cut it out so it will fit your lid

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.520 
then cut it out so it will fit your lid
perfectly<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:10.090> here<00:05:11.020> I'm<00:05:11.169> cutting<00:05:11.469> out

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
perfectly and here I'm cutting out

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.010 
perfectly and here I'm cutting out
little<00:05:11.830> scraps<00:05:12.250> of<00:05:12.520> paper<00:05:12.879> that<00:05:13.330> was<00:05:13.479> leftover

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
little scraps of paper that was leftover

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.439 
little scraps of paper that was leftover
from<00:05:14.229> the<00:05:14.830> scrap<00:05:15.069> paper<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:15.969> know<00:05:16.210> which

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
from the scrap paper so I know which

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.089 
from the scrap paper so I know which
colors<00:05:16.810> to<00:05:16.840> use<00:05:17.229> and<00:05:17.529> then<00:05:17.949> I'm<00:05:18.069> just

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
colors to use and then I'm just

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.279 
colors to use and then I'm just
outlining<00:05:18.610> them<00:05:18.879> and<00:05:19.240> putting<00:05:19.719> down<00:05:20.050> what

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289
