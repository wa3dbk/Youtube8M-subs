00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello to all these ag team and mc we get 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.330
 found for a presentation of 8 dps 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.000
 magical veteran in 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.590
 two colonels so for this build one has 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.869
 chosen for the first light bar 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.880
 interior in merville does it blow 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.490
 fiery ramparts elementary greenhouse 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.900
 flying and the banner for the second 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.270
 bar that is dedicated to survival we have 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.370
 chosen charged flat shield 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.830
 refractory unstable flame whip in 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.629
 melting blood of the green dragon is from 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.980
 again the banner so we will make a 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.550
 little trick in a solo instance 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.570
 finally public instances not solo for 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.040
 see a little bit what are the sites 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.040
 dps and how does it work 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.899
 so we'll go room by room for 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.399
 well dissect all the first so 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.710
 inner light the little firefly that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.500
 you see on my side so increases from 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.320
 20% at the maximum level the rate of 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.650
 spell reviews the second aspect 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.909
 to use these fiery women's breaths 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.190
 sales per month are 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.290
 improvements so the devouring man who 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.970
 actually saves 10% 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.280
 additional damage on attacks 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.509
 of fire there we just saw him and the wall 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.119
 and the hands the elemental bulwark so 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.229
 elementary wall improvement 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.380
 do not hesitate to abuse you can 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.630
 laid several times satik several times 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.390
 in a row that we will review the cycle 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.770
 firefly the flying greenhouse blows him the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.289
 Spell referral very important especially 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.550
 that it 's fire patterns here I am 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.530
 vampire so that makes me very bad 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.229
 see the switch and the liver behind 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.960
 that's for the second bar dedicated to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.830
 survival we will start a little more 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.509
 slowly the firefly always lÃ©vy 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.550
 attack so the heavy task for 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.220
 start the road to be safe 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.039
 with sync to body the breath and the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.110
 wall a small attack from behind 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.580
 nickel so that that corresponds to the cycle of 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.989
 base to chain the mobs 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.149
 quietly their way is very 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:09.869
 important listening to this manna did 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.810
 be careful, see the wind 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.340
 and the best 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.640
 what is not enough a small and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.240
 vistre attack behind mikel so there 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.170
 I have friends that's good our 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.690
 dragon knight melee this one there 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.210
 we will begin the removal spells 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.440
 to not die we see the cast 50% 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.290
 additional damage in vampire must 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.690
 be careful when wade really comes out 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.810
 really good the charge to the shield that's 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.370
 always convenient especially in the mono 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.280
 unstable flames also posing a dowry 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:50.380
 in mono very important here and the liver 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:55.060
 behind mikel their road the wall 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.260
 and the perfect reign lists you see 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.880
 there is a way to go on even if the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.970
 sick dangerously lowers the means 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.890
 to chain the furniture fairly quickly 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.540
 especially accompanied so be careful 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.960
 to light and inner light 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.430
 she tends to popes so 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.810
 it will systematically be removed when 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.010
 you change bars and on all your 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.260
 loading screens we need the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.540
 reactivate each time if you speak 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.040
 bonus we're going to rock the elite to see 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.410
 what we can move the banner 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.850
 from up the banner very very important 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.350
 the power banner improve so 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.000
 35 % at the max level of damage 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.670
 additional and reduction 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.580
 damage to you and your allies and the 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.920
 synergy sailing began with a first 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.950
 cycle to use a little man to the 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.960
 banner regenerates synergy so my 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.280
 teammate did a synergy on it and 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.540
 could swoon the walls on the site 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.950
 it's very important to first make the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.540
 breath and then the wall for 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.580
 actually benefit from the 10% of 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.540
 additional fire damage 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.810
 So that's a lot to say 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.120
 on the on this specialization worse to 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.890
 editors I wish you a very good 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.160
 day and soon for the guides by mx 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.160
