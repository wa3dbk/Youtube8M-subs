then develop our for our foundational
movement<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.619> step<00:00:19.890> using<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> TRX<00:00:20.640> let's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
movement the step using the TRX let's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.330 
movement the step using the TRX let's
get<00:00:21.210> started<00:00:21.539> for<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> step<00:00:22.920> you've<00:00:23.100> heard<00:00:23.220> us

get started for the step you've heard us

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
get started for the step you've heard us
talk<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.550> lot<00:00:23.789> about<00:00:23.820> maintaining<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> plank<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
talk a lot about maintaining a plank and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.540 
talk a lot about maintaining a plank and
really<00:00:25.289> engaging<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.800> posterior<00:00:26.340> chain

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
really engaging that posterior chain

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.040 
really engaging that posterior chain
these<00:00:26.970> first<00:00:27.269> two<00:00:27.420> movements<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:27.869> really

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
these first two movements are really

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.540 
these first two movements are really
going<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> help<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.529> get<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> know<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.460> that

going to help you get to know what that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.279 
going to help you get to know what that
feels<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.539> laying<00:00:30.750> position<00:00:30.960> that

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
feels like in the laying position that

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.179 
feels like in the laying position that
we're<00:00:31.380> gonna<00:00:31.470> bring<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.890> standing

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
we're gonna bring it to a standing

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.910 
we're gonna bring it to a standing
position<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:33.059> first<00:00:33.270> move<00:00:33.620> Steve's<00:00:34.620> gonna<00:00:34.710> go

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
position the first move Steve's gonna go

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.410 
position the first move Steve's gonna go
ahead<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.160> put<00:00:35.250> his<00:00:35.340> heels<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.790> he's<00:00:36.300> gonna

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
doing just the hip press hands will go

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.959 
doing just the hip press hands will go
flat<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> ground<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.520> then<00:00:41.820> he's<00:00:41.910> just

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
flat on the ground and then he's just

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.080 
flat on the ground and then he's just
going<00:00:42.239> into<00:00:42.510> hip<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.989> B<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.890> deduction<00:00:44.550> here

going into hip a B and a deduction here
you're<00:00:45.210> gonna<00:00:45.300> notice<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> plank<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.350> really

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
you're gonna notice that plank is really

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.869 
you're gonna notice that plank is really
getting<00:00:46.800> challenged<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.250> he<00:00:47.550> opens

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
getting challenged because he opens

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.880 
getting challenged because he opens
those<00:00:48.059> legs<00:00:48.329> his<00:00:48.870> body<00:00:49.170> wants<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> move<00:00:49.710> into

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
those legs his body wants to move into

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500 
those legs his body wants to move into
flexion<00:00:50.250> he's<00:00:50.550> got<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> keep<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.030> posterior

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
flexion he's got to keep that posterior

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.180 
flexion he's got to keep that posterior
chain<00:00:51.719> turned<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> exist<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.710> flexion

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
chain turned on to exist that flexion

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
chain turned on to exist that flexion
he's<00:00:53.610> giving<00:00:53.940> some<00:00:54.090> activation<00:00:54.510> into<00:00:54.899> those

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
he's giving some activation into those

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.049 
he's giving some activation into those
lateral<00:00:55.680> hips<00:00:55.949> which<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.430> don't<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> lot

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
lateral hips which you don't get a lot

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.510 
lateral hips which you don't get a lot
when<00:00:57.270> you're<00:00:57.390> running<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:57.840> cycling<00:00:58.520> from

when you're running in your cycling from

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.830 
when you're running in your cycling from
this<00:00:59.760> move<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.239> we're<00:01:00.359> gonna<00:01:00.449> take<00:01:00.690> them

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
this move here we're gonna take them

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.959 
this move here we're gonna take them
into<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> hamstring<00:01:01.649> runner<00:01:01.890> notice<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
into the hamstring runner notice on the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.609 
into the hamstring runner notice on the
hamstring<00:01:03.390> runner<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.110> legs<00:01:04.350> aren't<00:01:04.559> moving

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
hamstring runner the legs aren't moving

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.890 
hamstring runner the legs aren't moving
simultaneously<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.790> always<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.659> leg

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
simultaneously you always have one leg

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600 
simultaneously you always have one leg
in<00:01:07.110> full<00:01:07.439> extension<00:01:07.860> while<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> other<00:01:08.430> one

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
in full extension while the other one

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.700 
in full extension while the other one
comes<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.119> out<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.020> you'll<00:01:10.170> notice<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
comes in and out so you'll notice at the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.410 
comes in and out so you'll notice at the
top<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.010> each<00:01:11.250> movement<00:01:11.729> he<00:01:11.850> looks<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.240> he's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
top of each movement he looks like he's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.480 
top of each movement he looks like he's
performing<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.990> step<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.130> got<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
performing a step so now we got that

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.730 
performing a step so now we got that
posterior<00:01:15.119> chain<00:01:15.360> turned<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.900> we're<00:01:16.380> thinking

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
posterior chain turned on we're thinking

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.070 
posterior chain turned on we're thinking
knee<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.130> Toa<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:18.030> course<00:01:18.360> turned<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.300 
right knee comes up so now you always
have<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.170> leg<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.530> extension<00:01:38.040> while<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
have one leg in extension while the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
have one leg in extension while the
other<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.610> does<00:01:38.820> flexion<00:01:39.299> bring<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.960> right

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
other one does flexion bring this right

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.889 
other one does flexion bring this right
leg<00:01:40.380> down<00:01:41.030> bring<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> other<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.720> more

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
leg down bring the other one up one more

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.289 
leg down bring the other one up one more
time<00:01:43.140> he<00:01:44.040> looks<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.340> he's<00:01:44.490> doing<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.790> march<00:01:45.090> on

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
time he looks like he's doing a march on

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.550 
time he looks like he's doing a march on
his<00:01:45.479> back<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.200> we're<00:01:46.320> looking

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
his back and that's what we're looking

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.260 
his back and that's what we're looking
for<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:46.920> our<00:01:47.130> next<00:01:47.310> move<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.820> bring<00:01:48.149> those

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
for because our next move is bring those

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.620 
for because our next move is bring those
heels<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:49.189> stand<00:01:50.189> up<00:01:50.460> he's<00:01:51.000> gonna<00:01:51.149> adjust<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
heels out stand up he's gonna adjust the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.300 
heels out stand up he's gonna adjust the
t-rex<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.170> mid<00:01:52.409> length<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.920> we're<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
t-rex to mid length and we're going to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.880 
t-rex to mid length and we're going to
take<00:01:53.520> our<00:01:53.790> Tareq's<00:01:54.390> March<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:55.740> we're

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
take our Tareq's March so now we're

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.410 
take our Tareq's March so now we're
gonna<00:01:55.979> take<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.369> exact<00:01:56.759> same<00:01:56.790> movement

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
gonna take that exact same movement

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.819 
gonna take that exact same movement
pattern<00:01:57.750> he<00:01:57.840> had<00:01:58.079> while<00:01:58.259> he<00:01:58.290> was<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.680> the

pattern he had while he was on the
ground<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.549> make<00:01:59.670> sure<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.909> posterior<00:02:00.450> chain

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
ground to make sure that posterior chain

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.600 
ground to make sure that posterior chain
was<00:02:00.869> lit<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.049> we're<00:02:01.680> gonna<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.130> standing

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
rotational forces in his hip we're

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.720 
rotational forces in his hip we're
giving<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.320> great<00:02:24.560> motor<00:02:24.860> pattern<00:02:25.280> here<00:02:25.460> we<00:02:25.580> got

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
giving a great motor pattern here we got

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.640 
giving a great motor pattern here we got
that<00:02:25.880> posterior<00:02:26.390> chain<00:02:26.660> turned<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:27.110> but<00:02:27.560> we're

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
that posterior chain turned on but we're

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.170 
that posterior chain turned on but we're
also<00:02:27.770> giving<00:02:28.190> him<00:02:28.310> good<00:02:28.670> core<00:02:29.000> stability

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
also giving him good core stability

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.300 
also giving him good core stability

the<00:02:31.820> last<00:02:32.060> thing<00:02:32.300> we're<00:02:32.390> gonna<00:02:32.480> do<00:02:32.630> is<00:02:32.720> we're

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
the last thing we're gonna do is we're

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.910 
the last thing we're gonna do is we're
going<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:32.960> take<00:02:33.140> them<00:02:33.320> back<00:02:33.350> into<00:02:33.830> that

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
going to take them back into that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.590 
going to take them back into that

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
talking about all week with this

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.990 
talking about all week with this
stepping<00:02:42.260> pattern<00:02:42.620> but<00:02:42.980> now<00:02:43.220> we've<00:02:43.790> really

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
stepping pattern but now we've really

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.390 
stepping pattern but now we've really
set<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.690> foundation<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:45.410> stability<00:02:45.950> in<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400

set the foundation of stability in the
hip<00:02:46.580> stability<00:02:46.850> in<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.360> core<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.810> now<00:02:48.200> as<00:02:48.350> he

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
hip stability in the core and now as he

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.870 
hip stability in the core and now as he
starts<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:48.800> move<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.520> out<00:02:49.580> of<00:02:49.640> this

extension that posterior chain feels

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.430 
extension that posterior chain feels
like<00:02:55.250> he<00:02:56.000> can<00:02:56.120> add<00:02:56.270> a<00:02:56.300> little<00:02:56.510> tempo<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.960> it<00:02:57.260> a

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
little faster going into full extension

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.660 
little faster going into full extension
every<00:03:00.020> time<00:03:00.320> and<00:03:00.620> once<00:03:01.100> he<00:03:01.190> gets<00:03:01.370> really<00:03:01.640> good

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
every time and once he gets really good

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.700 
every time and once he gets really good
