on<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:45.330> recent<00:00:45.600> video<00:00:46.200> about<00:00:46.890> how<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.220> couldn't

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
on my recent video about how I couldn't

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.720 
on my recent video about how I couldn't
get<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> stock<00:00:48.180> tank<00:00:48.480> through<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.930> door<00:00:49.290> and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
get the stock tank through that door and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.400 
get the stock tank through that door and
he<00:00:50.730> offered<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.390> really<00:00:51.720> good<00:00:51.900> suggestion

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
he offered a really good suggestion

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
he offered a really good suggestion
which<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.220> use<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.430> couple<00:00:53.730> ratchet<00:00:54.329> straps

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
which was to use a couple ratchet straps

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.790 
which was to use a couple ratchet straps
here<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.820> wrap<00:00:56.820> him<00:00:56.970> around<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.750> ratchet<00:00:58.470> it

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
here and wrap him around and ratchet it

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.819 
here and wrap him around and ratchet it
down<00:00:59.040> to<00:00:59.430> kind<00:00:59.910> of<00:00:59.970> bend<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:01.050> edges<00:01:01.560> of<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
down to kind of bend the edges of the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.800 
down to kind of bend the edges of the
stock<00:01:02.130> tank<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.850> enough<00:01:03.150> to<00:01:03.360> slip<00:01:03.630> it

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
stock tank just enough to slip it

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.080 
stock tank just enough to slip it
through<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.170> door<00:01:04.410> and<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:05.550> glad<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.880> say

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
through the door and I'm glad to say

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.240 
through the door and I'm glad to say
that<00:01:06.660> actually<00:01:07.110> worked<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.979> worked

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that actually worked it worked

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.270 
that actually worked it worked
beautifully<00:01:08.750> what<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.780> did<00:01:10.110> was<00:01:10.530> these

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
beautifully what I did was these

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.510 
beautifully what I did was these
actually<00:01:12.030> these<00:01:12.149> straps<00:01:12.600> were<00:01:12.960> too<00:01:13.290> short<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
actually these straps were too short to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.359 
actually these straps were too short to
make<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.450> way<00:01:15.600> around<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:17.009> had<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
make it all the way around so I had to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.700 
make it all the way around so I had to
use<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.970> had<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> use<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.810> doubled<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.410> so<00:01:19.649> I

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
use I had to use them doubled up so I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
use I had to use them doubled up so I
did<00:01:19.890> two<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.430> attached<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:21.720> another

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
did two of them attached to one another

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.130 
did two of them attached to one another
but<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.440> I<00:01:22.470> did<00:01:22.649> was<00:01:22.770> three<00:01:23.130> sets<00:01:23.900> one<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
but what I did was three sets one of the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.320 
but what I did was three sets one of the
sets<00:01:25.409> was<00:01:25.710> was<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.310> edge<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:26.909> another

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
sets was was on the edge here another

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.750 
sets was was on the edge here another
was<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.930> other<00:01:28.080> edge<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.130> another

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
was on the other edge here and another

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.610 
was on the other edge here and another
was<00:01:29.970> directly<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> middle<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.080> I

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
was directly in the middle and I

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.680 
was directly in the middle and I
ratcheted<00:01:32.250> them<00:01:32.400> all<00:01:32.580> down<00:01:32.820> at<00:01:33.210> an<00:01:33.330> even<00:01:33.540> rate

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
ratcheted them all down at an even rate

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.820 
ratcheted them all down at an even rate
and<00:01:34.430> it<00:01:35.430> actually<00:01:35.790> allowed<00:01:36.090> me<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.390> take<00:01:37.140> 2<00:01:37.680> or

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
and it actually allowed me to take 2 or

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.330 
and it actually allowed me to take 2 or
3<00:01:38.100> inches<00:01:38.640> off<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.900> width<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.440> this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
3 inches off of the the width of this

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.200 
3 inches off of the the width of this
stock<00:01:41.729> tank<00:01:42.060> by<00:01:42.810> bowing<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.770> these<00:01:44.369> edges<00:01:44.700> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
stock tank by bowing so these edges just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.690 
stock tank by bowing so these edges just
kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.630> bowed<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.409> even<00:01:47.280> though<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
kind of like bowed up even though the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.600 
kind of like bowed up even though the
the<00:01:48.450> bottom<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.080> this<00:01:49.260> has<00:01:49.710> whoops

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
the bottom of this has whoops

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.050 
the bottom of this has whoops
I<00:01:51.670> can<00:01:52.540> show<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:54.040> bottom<00:01:54.430> of<00:01:54.580> this<00:01:54.790> has<00:01:55.030> a

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
I can show you the bottom of this has a

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.200 
I can show you the bottom of this has a
nice<00:01:55.420> little<00:01:55.690> honeycomb<00:01:56.200> here<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.400> that's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
nice little honeycomb here and that's

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.080 
nice little honeycomb here and that's
why<00:01:58.510> it's<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:58.990> rigid<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.950> actually<00:02:00.550> hard<00:02:00.880> to

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
why it's so rigid and actually hard to

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.720 
why it's so rigid and actually hard to
bend<00:02:01.330> but<00:02:02.170> these<00:02:02.380> ratchet<00:02:02.950> clamp

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
bend but these ratchet clamp

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.950 
bend but these ratchet clamp
straps<00:02:04.660> are<00:02:05.550> really<00:02:06.550> good<00:02:06.790> at<00:02:07.090> doing<00:02:07.810> their

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
straps are really good at doing their

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.880 
straps are really good at doing their
job<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:09.520> was<00:02:09.700> actually<00:02:09.880> able<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.620> to<00:02:11.620> bend

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
job so it was actually able to to bend

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.610 
job so it was actually able to to bend
and<00:02:12.370> bow<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:13.120> plastic<00:02:13.780> tank<00:02:14.050> even<00:02:14.380> though

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
and bow this plastic tank even though

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.330 
and bow this plastic tank even though
it's<00:02:14.830> designed<00:02:15.280> not<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:16.360> do<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:18.250> know

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
it's designed not to do that so you know

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.220 
it's designed not to do that so you know
it<00:02:18.490> was<00:02:18.610> only<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.850> couple<00:02:19.000> inches<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:20.050> only

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
it was only a couple inches and I only

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.550 
it was only a couple inches and I only
had<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.910> attached<00:02:21.910> for<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.330> few<00:02:22.570> minutes<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.530> I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
had it attached for a few minutes so I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.120 
had it attached for a few minutes so I
don't<00:02:23.950> think<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.490> did<00:02:24.700> any<00:02:25.060> structural<00:02:25.780> damage

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
don't think it did any structural damage

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.580 
don't think it did any structural damage
to<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:27.310> tank<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.910> think<00:02:28.540> since<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.350> such<00:02:29.560> a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
to this tank I think since it is such a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.630 
to this tank I think since it is such a
large<00:02:29.890> tank

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
large tank

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.540 
large tank
it<00:02:30.940> definitely<00:02:31.180> has<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:32.080> in<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.470> too<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:33.400> be

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
it definitely has it in it too to be

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.610 
it definitely has it in it too to be
able<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.880> bend<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.390> for<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.470> know<00:02:35.590> a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
able to bend like that for you know a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.770 
able to bend like that for you know a
little<00:02:35.980> while<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.610> wouldn't<00:02:37.209> recommend<00:02:37.360> doing

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
little while I wouldn't recommend doing

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.740 
little while I wouldn't recommend doing
it<00:02:38.260> for<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> long<00:02:38.770> period<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:39.250> time<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.540> only

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
it for a long period of time and I only

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.440 
it for a long period of time and I only
ratcheted<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.770> just<00:02:42.280> enough<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.180> get<00:02:43.390> it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
ratcheted it just enough to get it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.360 
ratcheted it just enough to get it
through<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.810> door<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:44.110> didn't<00:02:44.650> over<00:02:44.980> tighten

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
through the door I didn't over tighten

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.100 
through the door I didn't over tighten
it<00:02:45.459> because<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.270> didn't<00:02:46.570> want<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.930> start

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
it because I didn't want to start

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.370 
it because I didn't want to start
splitting<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:48.010> cracking<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:49.330> plastic<00:02:50.140> here

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
splitting and cracking the plastic here

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.060 
splitting and cracking the plastic here
so<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:51.220> think<00:02:51.820> it's<00:02:52.209> it's<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.930> good<00:02:53.140> shape<00:02:53.200> I'll

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
so I think it's it's in good shape I'll

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.580 
so I think it's it's in good shape I'll
do<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.489> I'll<00:02:54.640> do<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> test<00:02:55.090> fill<00:02:55.420> at<00:02:55.660> some<00:02:56.350> point

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
do it I'll do a test fill at some point

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.500 
do it I'll do a test fill at some point
to<00:02:56.830> make<00:02:57.010> sure<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.250> didn't<00:02:57.640> cause<00:02:57.910> any<00:02:57.940> cracks

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
to make sure I didn't cause any cracks

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.180 
to make sure I didn't cause any cracks
or<00:02:58.780> leaks<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.350> I'll<00:02:59.440> definitely<00:02:59.890> check<00:02:59.920> it

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
or leaks and I'll definitely check it

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.600 
or leaks and I'll definitely check it
over<00:03:00.489> before<00:03:01.170> before<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.200> do<00:03:02.320> that<00:03:02.709> but<00:03:03.070> it's<00:03:03.400> in

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
over before before I do that but it's in

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.420
