00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
cover so what I have is layers of the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.980 
cover so what I have is layers of the
design<00:01:28.700> paper<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.270> eight<00:01:29.420> by<00:01:29.570> eight<00:01:29.600> paper

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
design paper the eight by eight paper

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.230 
design paper the eight by eight paper
and<00:01:30.409> I'll<00:01:30.979> have<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.250> measurements<00:01:31.400> up<00:01:31.940> on<00:01:32.119> my

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
and I'll have the measurements up on my

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.789 
and I'll have the measurements up on my
blog<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:32.600> don't<00:01:32.840> have<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.020> tutorial<00:01:33.409> for<00:01:33.590> this

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
blog I don't have a tutorial for this

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.380 
blog I don't have a tutorial for this
but<00:01:34.220> i'm<00:01:34.340> thinking<00:01:34.369> i'm<00:01:34.790> probably<00:01:35.000> going<00:01:35.299> to

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
but i'm thinking i'm probably going to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.929 
but i'm thinking i'm probably going to
create<00:01:35.659> one<00:01:35.780> soon<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.040> put<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.369> up<00:01:37.549> on<00:01:37.700> my

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
create one soon and put that up on my

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.800 
create one soon and put that up on my
blog<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:38.210> you'll<00:01:38.630> have<00:01:38.780> that<00:01:40.360> but<00:01:41.360> i<00:01:41.390> have<00:01:41.689> the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
blog so you'll have that but i have the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.899 
blog so you'll have that but i have the
design<00:01:42.080> paper<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.650> then<00:01:42.740> i<00:01:42.860> said<00:01:43.100> the

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
design paper and then i said the

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.730 
design paper and then i said the
signature<00:01:44.330> series<00:01:44.450> paper<00:01:44.869> compliments

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
signature series paper compliments

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.560 
signature series paper compliments
nicely<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:46.310> i<00:01:46.340> actually<00:01:46.670> added<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.330> there

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
nicely so i actually added it there

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.719 
nicely so i actually added it there
layered<00:01:48.049> it<00:01:48.260> and<00:01:48.500> then<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.130> have<00:01:49.310> another<00:01:49.340> layer

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
layered it and then I have another layer

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.609 
layered it and then I have another layer
of<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:50.210> design<00:01:50.450> paper<00:01:50.689> here<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.290> this<00:01:51.409> design

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
of the design paper here and this design

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.800 
of the design paper here and this design
papers<00:01:52.159> coming<00:01:52.549> from<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.060> patterns<00:01:53.630> and

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
papers coming from the patterns and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.780 
papers coming from the patterns and
solid<00:01:54.110> set<00:01:54.380> what<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:54.920> like<00:01:55.130> about<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.490> patterns

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
solid set what I like about the patterns

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.899 
solid set what I like about the patterns
in<00:01:55.970> solid<00:01:56.299> set<00:01:56.540> is<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.770> patterns<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.850> the

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
in solid set is the patterns and the

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.090 
in solid set is the patterns and the
colors<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.479> have<00:01:59.780> here<00:02:00.470> are<00:02:00.710> different

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
colors that you have here are different

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.429 
colors that you have here are different
from<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.729> patterns<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:02.720> actually<00:02:03.049> get<00:02:03.200> here

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
from the patterns you actually get here

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.080 
from the patterns you actually get here
but<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.710> colors<00:02:03.979> are<00:02:04.220> complimentary<00:02:04.820> hope

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
but the colors are complimentary hope

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.550 
but the colors are complimentary hope
that<00:02:05.240> makes<00:02:05.390> sense<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:05.930> won't<00:02:06.110> see<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.380> lot

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
that makes sense so you won't see a lot

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.319 
that makes sense so you won't see a lot
of<00:02:06.590> duplicates<00:02:07.130> which<00:02:07.790> is<00:02:07.939> really<00:02:08.060> nice

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.329 
of duplicates which is really nice

the measurements for this on my blog I

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.280 
the measurements for this on my blog I
kept<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.330> back<00:03:53.480> simple<00:03:53.900> but<00:03:54.049> i'm<00:03:54.140> probably

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
kept the back simple but i'm probably

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.940 
kept the back simple but i'm probably
going<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.560> put<00:03:54.650> my<00:03:54.769> stamp<00:03:55.010> black<00:03:55.280> car<00:03:55.720> ok<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.620> i

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
going to put my stamp black car ok so i

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.500 
going to put my stamp black car ok so i
used<00:03:58.160> some<00:03:58.250> may<00:03:58.489> arts<00:03:58.640> ribbon<00:03:59.090> so<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.390> may

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
used some may arts ribbon so the may

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.180 
used some may arts ribbon so the may
arts<00:03:59.660> ribbon<00:04:00.049> of<00:04:00.140> course<00:04:00.410> went<00:04:00.709> under<00:04:01.040> the

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
arts ribbon of course went under the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.220 
arts ribbon of course went under the
layers<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.850> i<00:04:02.030> use<00:04:02.180> score<00:04:02.510> tape<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.930> hold<00:04:03.049> it

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
layers and i use score tape to hold it

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.580 
layers and i use score tape to hold it
down<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:04.400> um<00:04:04.820> so<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:05.660> basically<00:04:06.019> is<00:04:06.350> not<00:04:06.500> going

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
down so um so it basically is not going

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.560 
down so um so it basically is not going
to<00:04:06.650> go<00:04:06.769> anywhere<00:04:07.010> ok<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:07.760> i<00:04:08.000> just<00:04:08.180> untie<00:04:08.510> is

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
to go anywhere ok so i just untie is

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.620 
to go anywhere ok so i just untie is
like<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.019> and<00:04:09.260> then<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:09.769> opens<00:04:10.010> up<00:04:10.100> like<00:04:10.280> so

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
like that and then it opens up like so

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.620 
like that and then it opens up like so
ok<00:04:11.630> really<00:04:12.200> fun<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:13.280> there's<00:04:13.459> a<00:04:13.549> space<00:04:13.790> here<00:04:14.239> to

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
score tape so it's not going to go

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.700 
score tape so it's not going to go
anywhere<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:53.720> just<00:04:53.870> opens<00:04:54.140> up<00:04:54.260> like<00:04:54.440> so
