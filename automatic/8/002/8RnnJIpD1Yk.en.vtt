00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
them obviously you can see decayed space

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660 
them obviously you can see decayed space
there<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.869> looks<00:00:25.109> really<00:00:25.380> nice<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.279> get<00:00:26.519> this

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
you do not need a driver for they all

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.500 
you do not need a driver for they all
are<00:00:35.130> accessed<00:00:35.460> from<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.670> button<00:00:36.030> meaning

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
are accessed from this button meaning

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.880 
are accessed from this button meaning
when<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.750> press<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.559> doesn't<00:00:37.710> even

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
when you press this up it doesn't even

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.069 
when you press this up it doesn't even
make<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> noise<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.760> will<00:00:39.300> show<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.840> does<00:00:39.989> in

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
make a noise I will show what it does in

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.049 
make a noise I will show what it does in
the<00:00:40.170> driver<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:41.010> too<00:00:41.370> much<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.760> because

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the driver but not too much just because

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.850 
the driver but not too much just because
it<00:00:42.239> will<00:00:42.360> make<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> same<00:00:42.809> noise<00:00:43.050> regardless

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it will make the same noise regardless

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
it will make the same noise regardless
if<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.040> put<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> driver<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.649> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
if you put this in the driver or the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
if you put this in the driver or the
sword<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.250> it'll<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> mess<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
sword and it'll just be a mess and the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.819 
sword and it'll just be a mess and the
other<00:00:48.629> things<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.140> there's<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.620> no

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
other things so there's really no

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.130 
other things so there's really no
changes<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.730> main<00:00:51.239> bulk<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> sounds

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
changes to it so main bulk of the sounds

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
changes to it so main bulk of the sounds
will<00:00:52.320> actually<00:00:52.620> come<00:00:52.949> from<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.030> when<00:00:54.149> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
will actually come from this so when you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
will actually come from this so when you
open<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> picture<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> DK

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
open it up you get a picture of the DK

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.189 
open it up you get a picture of the DK
driver<00:00:56.699> right<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:57.870> neat

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
driver right here so it's really neat

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.319 
driver right here so it's really neat
and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.680> decades<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> card<00:00:59.609> right<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.149> as

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
go over the noises by pressing this

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.740 
go over the noises by pressing this
button<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> back<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.880> ad<00:01:12.150> cage<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
button on the back so this ad cage and

button on the back so this ad cage and
then<00:01:12.930> now<00:01:13.080> its<00:01:13.229> arms<00:01:13.470> change<00:01:13.740> noise

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:33.250 

and<00:01:23.660> that's<00:01:23.810> first<00:01:24.080> attack<00:01:24.380> noise<00:01:31.930> so<00:01:32.930> now<00:01:33.080> by

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
and that's first attack noise so now by

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.840 
and that's first attack noise so now by
pressing<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.740> an<00:01:33.860> additional<00:01:34.220> time<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:34.610> four

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
pressing it an additional time so four

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.670 
pressing it an additional time so four
times<00:01:35.030> total<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.540> a<00:01:35.630> row<00:01:35.780> you'll<00:01:36.080> unlock<00:01:36.530> it

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
times total in a row you'll unlock it

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:46.000 
times total in a row you'll unlock it
second<00:01:36.980> attack<00:01:37.220> noise<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:44.740> then<00:01:45.740> by<00:01:45.860> pressing

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
second attack noise and then by pressing

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.800 
second attack noise and then by pressing
an<00:01:46.280> additional<00:01:46.670> time<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.060> five<00:01:47.270> times<00:01:47.510> total

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
an additional time so five times total

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.210 
an additional time so five times total
in<00:01:47.960> succession<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:48.560> will<00:01:48.680> get<00:01:48.800> its<00:01:48.890> final

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
in succession you will get its final

00:01:49.220 --> 00:02:00.700 
in succession you will get its final
attack<00:01:49.460> noise<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:59.300> very<00:01:59.600> neat<00:01:59.870> so<00:02:00.560> then

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
attack noise so very neat so then

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.380 
attack noise so very neat so then
because<00:02:00.830> this<00:02:01.130> works<00:02:01.340> on<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.490> cycling<00:02:01.940> system

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
because this works on a cycling system

here as if you were pressing this open
to<00:02:08.390> get<00:02:08.540> it<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.690> work<00:02:08.840> properly

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.860 

all<00:02:24.550> right<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:24.940> then<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.180> will<00:02:25.330> cycle<00:02:25.570> through

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
all right and then it will cycle through

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.080 
all right and then it will cycle through
the<00:02:25.960> noises<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:30.310> then<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.610> will<00:02:30.700> actually<00:02:30.760> go

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
the noises and then it will actually go

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.780 
the noises and then it will actually go
back<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.710> saying<00:02:32.710> decayed<00:02:33.100> because<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.580> works

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
back to saying decayed because it works

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.420 
back to saying decayed because it works
on<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.480> cycle<00:02:35.170> system<00:02:35.590> all<00:02:35.860> right<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.310> that's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
on the cycle system all right so that's

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.400 
on the cycle system all right so that's
about<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.850> very<00:02:37.390> cool<00:02:37.630> in<00:02:37.810> particular<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.320> this

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
about it very cool in particular on this

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.960 
about it very cool in particular on this
one<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.650> thought<00:02:38.830> they<00:02:38.950> did<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.160> great<00:02:39.280> mix<00:02:39.670> of

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
one I thought they did a great mix of

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.630 
one I thought they did a great mix of
decayed<00:02:40.540> sort<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:40.930> style<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.320> noises<00:02:41.770> with<00:02:42.520> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
decayed sort of style of noises with the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.610 
decayed sort of style of noises with the
current<00:02:42.880> game<00:02:43.030> noises<00:02:43.270> very<00:02:43.720> very<00:02:43.930> cool<00:02:44.170> but

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
current game noises very very cool but

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.810 
current game noises very very cool but
ultimately<00:02:45.010> it's<00:02:45.160> up<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.490> whether<00:02:45.640> you

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
ultimately it's up to you whether you

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.880 
ultimately it's up to you whether you
like<00:02:45.850> decayed<00:02:46.330> or<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> noises<00:02:46.750> are<00:02:46.930> not<00:02:47.200> now

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
like decayed or the noises are not now

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.260
