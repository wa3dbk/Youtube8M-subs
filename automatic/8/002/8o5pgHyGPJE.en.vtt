00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hello, here are the bones of marmalade 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.270
 foxes and today we will cook 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.580
 biscuit without eggs 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.530
 such a basic recipe that can be 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.839
 change to your own taste and yes 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.750
 so first of all we need 50 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.699
 grams of oil placed at room 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.699
 temperature and bank condensed milk 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.939
 I have a 400 gram pot 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.630
 but if you have a bank for 380 such 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.910
 There are also nothing to worry about these 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.100
 20 grams will not play a special weather and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.210
 now we need to beat all this with a mixer 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.489
 until smooth consistency 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.010
 turned out such a very good cream 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.640
 whipped a little bit and now we need 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.649
 add 250 milliliters of liquid and not 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.260
 Depending on what the fluid 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.559
 your taste will depend 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.140
 biscuit for example if you want such 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.260
 standard for example vanilla biscuit 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.170
 add 250 milliliters of milk and 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.570
 let's say vanillin for smell i will add 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.930
 juice from 2 oranges it just will 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.549
 somewhere around 250 milliliters can also 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.830
 add 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.040
 for example, don't make a glass of coffee too 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.200
 strong coffee in general, you can taste 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.990
 cook cocoa , too, then add 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.970
 chocolate sponge but I'll take off first 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.670
 center of their oranges just because 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.990
 that so even tastier if more zest 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.909
 add on a fine grater just natra and 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.909
 they are of course very well washed with me 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.560
 let's first 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.770
 he studied 250 milliliters of juice if u 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.280
 you will allow small oranges 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.659
 maybe you need three of them and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.640
 now we pour our liquid 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.640
 little bit here beating up 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.640
 just be sure to note that 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.459
 this liquid is milk it will be coffee juice 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.519
 or cocoa it should be room 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.200
 temperature or slightly warmer if it 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.870
 will be with the fridge then the oil immediately 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.209
 will roll up and turn into cold buttons 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.170
 temperatures because everything will deteriorate and 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:34.260
 now the last step 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.900
 dry ingredients 250 grams of flour 1 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.170
 a teaspoon of soda and a half a teaspoon 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:46.130
 citric acid without slides can 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.130
 just use a baking powder bag 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:57.530
 Stir flour I sifted to 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.530
 our biscuit turned out to be more airy and 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:10.049
 pour all the flour right here if you want 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:13.500
 can leave a little bit to 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:17.070
 look at the consistency to guess 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.760
 Exactly to what happens different consistency 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.209
 there must be one between thick sour cream 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:30.420
 and fat sour cream is so hard to explain 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:33.480
 now see you can beat it 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.160
 I like a mixer for some reason 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.049
 spoon flour in 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.450
 I think it's better 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.150
 mixer just these bubbles 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:50.989
 from baking powder they form very 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.989
 strongly breaks a little more on the bubble 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:04.209
 here is a thick dough 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.209
 but it still dripping from the spoon 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.849
 now we take a very convenient baking tray 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.069
 if this is a split form I have 24 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.920
 centimeter diameter if it is 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.380
 smaller then the pie will turn out high you 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:24.080
 can cut it into 3 cakes my 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:27.740
 most likely two cakes will be cut I 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.720
 the shape is smeared with butter and not 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.000
 sprinkled with flour like mine 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.949
 non-stick coating but if you 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.600
 such a pan and very reliable 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:41.199
 sprinkle with flour so it doesn't stick. 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:45.440
 neatly spread 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:48.849
 bake in the oven at 180 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:54.130
 degrees 30 minutes or until ready 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.130
 check with a wooden stick as usual 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.229
 I had a cupcake for 40 minutes 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.930
 first sign that he baked it 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.240
 Of course the fact that he reddens the second is 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.300
 the fact that he had already begun to move away from 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.760
 the walls of the form and the third is to 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.130
 finally check we omit 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.510
 toothpick and see that it is perfect 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:23.710
 dry so it is still mine enough 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:27.020
 hot neatly take off the tap form 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.090
 let 5-7 minutes sit and a little bit 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.690
 cool and then we will shift to 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.690
 lattice 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.110
 and leave to cool the cake 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.740
 already cooled and you can cut let's 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:03.060
 let's see what's inside there I'll cut it 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.780
 horizontally so much better 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.650
 visible tender lips clean structure 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.150
 very clearly seen here are all the holes 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.100
 breathtakingly smells like oranges everything 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.280
 now it remains only to grease it 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.200
 we wish you the most delicious cream for you 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.180
 you bon appetit and all the most 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.180
 good meet in new videos bye
