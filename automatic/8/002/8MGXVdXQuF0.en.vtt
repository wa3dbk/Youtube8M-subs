00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
backs of your nails well actually it

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.280 
backs of your nails well actually it
doesn't<00:00:59.360> matter<00:00:59.570> what<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.780> first<00:00:59.960> chord<00:01:00.170> is

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
doesn't matter what the first chord is

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.720 
doesn't matter what the first chord is
because<00:01:00.530> it's<00:01:00.650> really<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.860> two<00:01:01.010> bar<00:01:01.190> phrase<00:01:01.489> and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
because it's really a two bar phrase and

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.790 
because it's really a two bar phrase and
the<00:01:01.790> Harmony<00:01:02.120> changes<00:01:02.510> depending<00:01:02.930> but<00:01:03.590> let's

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
the Harmony changes depending but let's

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.700 
the Harmony changes depending but let's
count<00:01:04.009> it<00:01:04.100> together<00:01:05.350> one<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.649> two<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.100> three

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
count it together one and two and three

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.950 
count it together one and two and three
23

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
three so it's in this first one I start

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.400 
three so it's in this first one I start
with<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.880> M<00:01:19.030> finger<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.630> of<00:01:20.110> course<00:01:20.290> we're

with the M finger and of course we're

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.330 
with the M finger and of course we're
always<00:01:20.440> alternating<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.720> rhythm<00:01:22.990> is

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.840 

followed<00:01:27.340> by<00:01:27.370> a<00:01:27.460> short<00:01:27.670> loss<00:01:27.880> scale

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
followed by a short loss scale

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.450 
followed by a short loss scale
okay<00:01:31.250> second<00:01:32.250> one
