I<00:01:47.810> think<00:01:47.840> by<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.170> Santos<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.009> when<00:01:49.399> Thaler

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
I think by the Santos and when Thaler

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.430 
I think by the Santos and when Thaler
took<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.179> and<00:01:50.360> he<00:01:50.390> fender<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.990> line<00:01:51.170> but

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
took it and he fender on the line but

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.460 
took it and he fender on the line but
the<00:01:51.530> goalkeeper<00:01:51.770> was<00:01:52.220> ahead<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:52.520> him<00:01:53.289> so<00:01:54.289> it's

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
the goalkeeper was ahead of him so it's

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.969 
the goalkeeper was ahead of him so it's
fine<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.860> complaints

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
fine the complaints

it<00:01:57.070> will<00:01:57.369> not<00:01:57.610> stand<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.710> think<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.100> was

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
it will not stand and I think that was

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.910 
it will not stand and I think that was
the<00:02:00.460> right<00:02:00.640> decision

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the right decision
