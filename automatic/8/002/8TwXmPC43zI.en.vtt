I'll<00:00:32.099> hit<00:00:32.489> ctrl<00:00:32.910> end<00:00:33.120> clear<00:00:34.100> now<00:00:35.100> if<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.280> look

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
I'll hit ctrl end clear now if you look

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.370 
I'll hit ctrl end clear now if you look
up<00:00:35.610> here<00:00:35.640> at<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:35.970> top<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.870> notice<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
up here at the top you notice that you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.950 
up here at the top you notice that you
have<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.620> option<00:00:37.860> called<00:00:38.190> trawl<00:00:38.520> size<00:00:38.960> draw

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
have this option called trawl size draw

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
have this option called trawl size draw
size<00:00:40.260> will<00:00:40.560> affect<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> diameter<00:00:41.580> of<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
size will affect the diameter of the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
size will affect the diameter of the
brush<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.600> slide<00:00:42.900> this<00:00:42.960> slider<00:00:43.470> over<00:00:43.740> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
brush so if I slide this slider over to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.450 
brush so if I slide this slider over to
the<00:00:43.890> right<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.310> get<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:44.820> very<00:00:45.030> large<00:00:45.360> brush<00:00:45.900> I

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
the right I get a very large brush I

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.040 
the right I get a very large brush I
slide<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.490> over<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> left<00:00:48.240> I<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
slide this over to the left I get a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.200 
slide this over to the left I get a
small<00:00:49.320> stroke<00:00:51.470> above<00:00:52.470> draw<00:00:52.770> size<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.640> focal

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
small stroke above draw size is focal

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.770 
small stroke above draw size is focal
shift<00:00:54.980> focal<00:00:55.980> shift<00:00:56.010> allows<00:00:56.940> us<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.300> soften

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
shift focal shift allows us to soften

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.170 
shift focal shift allows us to soften
the<00:00:57.870> edges<00:00:57.990> of<00:00:58.170> our<00:00:58.380> brush<00:00:58.820> you'll<00:00:59.820> notice

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the edges of our brush you'll notice

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.020 
the edges of our brush you'll notice
that<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.660> cursor<00:01:01.290> has<00:01:01.710> two<00:01:02.100> circles<00:01:02.550> an<00:01:02.730> inner

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that my cursor has two circles an inner

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.600 
that my cursor has two circles an inner
and<00:01:03.329> an<00:01:03.420> outer<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.739> distance<00:01:05.129> between<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and an outer the distance between the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.999 
and an outer the distance between the
two<00:01:05.759> is<00:01:05.790> how<00:01:06.030> soft<00:01:06.360> your<00:01:06.570> brush<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.259> for

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
two is how soft your brush is so for

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.649 
two is how soft your brush is so for
instance<00:01:08.070> if<00:01:08.460> i<00:01:08.550> take<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.880> focal<00:01:09.240> shift<00:01:09.300> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
instance if i take my focal shift and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.660 
instance if i take my focal shift and
push<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:11.250> notice<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
push it to the right you notice that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.980 
push it to the right you notice that
there's<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> greater<00:01:12.090> distance<00:01:12.360> between<00:01:12.840> those

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
there's a greater distance between those

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.890 
there's a greater distance between those
two<00:01:13.170> circles<00:01:13.620> and<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.550> softer<00:01:15.060> stroke<00:01:15.390> or

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
two circles and I get a softer stroke or

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.640 
two circles and I get a softer stroke or
a<00:01:16.170> softer<00:01:16.650> edge<00:01:16.770> i<00:01:16.950> should<00:01:17.130> say<00:01:18.320> if<00:01:19.320> i<00:01:19.440> take

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
a softer edge i should say if i take

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.260 
a softer edge i should say if i take
this<00:01:19.800> focal<00:01:20.190> shift<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.610> push<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.940> over<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
this focal shift and push it over to the

left those two circles move closer

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.680 
left those two circles move closer
together<00:01:23.640> giving<00:01:24.570> me<00:01:24.690> a<00:01:24.720> much<00:01:24.990> harder<00:01:25.290> edge
