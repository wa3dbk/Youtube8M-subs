00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
and the reason that I do the area behind

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.319 
and the reason that I do the area behind
the<00:00:46.200> edge<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> knife<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.760> allows<00:00:48.059> me<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the edge of the knife is it allows me to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.189 
the edge of the knife is it allows me to
see<00:00:48.629> when<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:48.930> angle<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> too<00:00:49.770> low<00:00:50.449> so<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:52.020> that

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
see when my angle is too low so if that

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.930 
see when my angle is too low so if that
when<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> color<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> edge<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.789> only

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
when I color in just the edge it only

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.340 
when I color in just the edge it only
tells<00:00:54.210> me<00:00:54.360> whether<00:00:54.510> I'm<00:00:54.660> hitting<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> edge<00:00:55.110> or

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
tells me whether I'm hitting the edge or

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.290 
tells me whether I'm hitting the edge or
not<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> color<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> also<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> area

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
not but when I color in also the area

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
not but when I color in also the area
behind<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> edge<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.410> see<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.039> my<00:00:59.160> angle

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
behind the edge I can see when my angle

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.670 
behind the edge I can see when my angle
has<00:00:59.609> dropped<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.570> wobbling<00:01:01.469> or

where<00:01:33.630> marker<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.140> being<00:01:34.409> removed<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.490> I'm

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
where marker is being removed so I'm

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.590 
where marker is being removed so I'm
going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.909> again<00:01:36.290> in<00:01:37.939> this<00:01:38.939> case<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.450> can

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
going to do again in this case you can

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.469 
going to do again in this case you can
see<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> removed<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.619> lot<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.860> marker<00:01:41.369> up<00:01:41.700> in

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
see that I removed a lot of marker up in

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.690 
see that I removed a lot of marker up in
this<00:01:42.630> area<00:01:42.899> but<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.890> isn't<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.310> area<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
this area but this isn't the area that I

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.039 
this area but this isn't the area that I
want<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.030> sharpening<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.600> means<00:01:45.840> that

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
want to be sharpening which means that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.280 
want to be sharpening which means that
my<00:01:46.110> angle<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.560> severely<00:01:47.340> too<00:01:47.729> low<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.110> is

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
my angle is severely too low so this is

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.690 
my angle is severely too low so this is
not<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.920> sharpening<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.520> want

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
not the kind of sharpening that I want

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.100 
not the kind of sharpening that I want
to<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:50.909> unless<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.420> course<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.780> trying<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
to do unless of course I'm trying to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.710 
to do unless of course I'm trying to
thin<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> knife<00:01:52.610> in<00:01:53.610> which<00:01:53.850> case<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.600> would

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
thin the knife in which case that would

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600 
thin the knife in which case that would
be<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:55.020> bit<00:01:55.200> better<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.490> I'm

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
be a little bit better but here I'm

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.510 
be a little bit better but here I'm
trying<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.909> sharpen<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> knife<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.340> I'm<00:01:59.340> going

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
trying to sharpen the knife so I'm going

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.880 
trying to sharpen the knife so I'm going
to<00:01:59.579> color<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.060> again<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.710> one<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
to color it in again and one of the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.139 
to color it in again and one of the
things<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> think<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.610> very<00:02:02.640> important

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
things that I think is very important

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.389 
things that I think is very important
about<00:02:03.210> utilizing<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> Sharpie<00:02:04.290> trick<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
about utilizing the Sharpie trick is to

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.069 
about utilizing the Sharpie trick is to
color<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.090> your<00:02:06.180> knife<00:02:06.360> again<00:02:06.780> when<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
color in your knife again when the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.529 
color in your knife again when the
Sharpie<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.530> gone<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.239> once

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
Sharpie is gone so that you can see once

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.940 
Sharpie is gone so that you can see once
you've<00:02:09.750> removed<00:02:10.020> all<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.379> Sharpie<00:02:10.709> again

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you've removed all the Sharpie again

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.440 
you've removed all the Sharpie again
it's<00:02:11.099> very<00:02:11.280> difficult<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.849> see<00:02:12.030> what's<00:02:12.239> going

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it's very difficult to see what's going

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.430 
it's very difficult to see what's going
on

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
on

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.840 
on
so<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.530> can<00:02:14.680> color<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.130> as<00:02:15.250> many<00:02:15.430> times<00:02:15.730> as

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
so you can color it in as many times as

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.190 
so you can color it in as many times as
you<00:02:15.970> need<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.390> can<00:02:16.510> always<00:02:16.630> stop<00:02:17.020> in

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you need to and you can always stop in

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.240 
you need to and you can always stop in
the<00:02:17.260> middle<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.530> your<00:02:17.620> sharpening<00:02:18.040> and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
the middle of your sharpening and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.060 
the middle of your sharpening and
recolor<00:02:18.580> things<00:02:18.910> in<00:02:19.150> all<00:02:20.050> right<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.170> here<00:02:20.950> we

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
recolor things in all right so here we

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.040 
recolor things in all right so here we
are<00:02:21.100> we're<00:02:21.340> going<00:02:21.460> to<00:02:21.490> try<00:02:21.700> again<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.690> time

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
are we're going to try again this time

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.780 
are we're going to try again this time
you<00:02:26.530> can't<00:02:26.800> really<00:02:26.980> see<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.490> well<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
you can't really see so well in the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.250 
you can't really see so well in the
video<00:02:28.000> but<00:02:28.180> I've<00:02:28.300> only<00:02:28.390> removed<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.960> thin

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
video but I've only removed the thin

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.140 
video but I've only removed the thin
line<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.530> Sharpie<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.130> along<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.700> edge<00:02:30.850> and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
line of Sharpie it along the edge and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.320 
line of Sharpie it along the edge and
that<00:02:31.690> tells<00:02:31.900> me<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.080> my<00:02:32.260> angle<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.680> too<00:02:33.010> high

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
that tells me that my angle is too high

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.570 
that tells me that my angle is too high
so<00:02:34.330> I'm<00:02:34.420> going<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.600> make<00:02:34.810> an<00:02:34.930> adjustment<00:02:35.050> and

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.210 

now<00:02:39.580> I've<00:02:40.170> removed<00:02:41.170> Sharpie<00:02:41.530> from<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.920> entire

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
now I've removed Sharpie from the entire

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.740 
now I've removed Sharpie from the entire
bevel<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.760> I'm<00:02:42.880> looking<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.240> remove<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.660> from

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
bevel that I'm looking to remove it from

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.390 
bevel that I'm looking to remove it from
that<00:02:43.990> tells<00:02:44.230> me<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.500> my<00:02:44.650> angle<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.100> correct

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
that tells me that my angle is correct

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.210 
that tells me that my angle is correct
for<00:02:46.360> what<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.050> manufacturer<00:02:47.770> has<00:02:47.920> set<00:02:48.190> on

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
sharpening job has done this is a good

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.550 
sharpening job has done this is a good
way<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.090> follow<00:02:52.510> an<00:02:52.660> angle<00:02:52.930> it's<00:02:53.050> also<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.320> good

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
way to follow an angle it's also a good

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.080 
way to follow an angle it's also a good
way<00:02:53.740> to<00:02:53.800> know<00:02:54.160> when<00:02:54.370> you're<00:02:54.490> being<00:02:54.640> consistent

way to know when you're being consistent
and<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:56.020> see<00:02:56.200> when<00:02:56.440> problems<00:02:56.830> are<00:02:56.950> occurring

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
and to see when problems are occurring

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.220 
and to see when problems are occurring

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
near the tip or if you miss an area this

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.449 
near the tip or if you miss an area this
just<00:03:01.870> adds<00:03:02.050> one<00:03:02.410> more<00:03:02.650> level<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:03.040> feedback

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
just adds one more level of feedback

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.210 
just adds one more level of feedback
that<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.760> can<00:03:03.880> get<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.570> can<00:03:04.810> see<00:03:05.220> what's

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
that you can get so you can see what's

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.350 
that you can get so you can see what's
going<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.580> you're<00:03:06.760> sharpening<00:03:07.150> where

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
going on you're sharpening where

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.270 
going on you're sharpening where
sharpening<00:03:07.630> is<00:03:07.930> taking<00:03:08.230> place<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.740> so<00:03:08.800> on<00:03:09.010> and
