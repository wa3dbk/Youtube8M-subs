00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
would have left it that way because it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.880 
would have left it that way because it
give<00:01:41.360> look<00:01:41.630> good<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:42.050> way<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.500> just<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:42.860> know

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
once I put that stripe on it it looked

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.859 
once I put that stripe on it it looked
good<00:01:44.930> like<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.680> I<00:01:45.860> will<00:01:46.070> concede<00:01:46.580> that

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
but it's just not my style

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.570 
but it's just not my style
and<00:01:50.649> because<00:01:51.649> I'm<00:01:51.860> committed<00:01:52.160> to<00:01:52.429> keeping

this is just made out of that vinyl
stuff<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:36.130> looks<00:02:37.130> like<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.340> leather<00:02:37.629> so<00:02:38.629> it

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
stuff that looks like a leather so it

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.030 
stuff that looks like a leather so it
needs<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.959> bit<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:39.110> trimming<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:39.920> it's

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
needs a bit of trimming so that it's

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.520 
needs a bit of trimming so that it's
nice<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.250> straight<00:02:40.550> here<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:42.170> yeah<00:02:42.319> I'm<00:02:42.500> just

rocket so when you look around at how

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.190 
rocket so when you look around at how
I've<00:03:01.760> done<00:03:01.970> it

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
I've done it

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.860 
I've done it
there's<00:03:04.200> also<00:03:04.430> this<00:03:05.430> stuff<00:03:05.700> also<00:03:05.910> actually

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
there's also this stuff also actually

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.110 
there's also this stuff also actually
for<00:03:07.080> me<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.620> suits<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.280> bit<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.580> purpose

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
for me that suits a bit of a purpose

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.660 
for me that suits a bit of a purpose
this<00:03:09.390> actually<00:03:10.050> believe<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.740> or<00:03:10.800> not<00:03:10.950> makes<00:03:11.460> it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
this actually believe it or not makes it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.190 
this actually believe it or not makes it
much<00:03:12.120> easier<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:13.680> sit<00:03:13.890> down<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.280> play<00:03:14.430> with

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
much easier to sit down and play with

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.690 
much easier to sit down and play with
having<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.290> little<00:03:16.440> tiny<00:03:16.830> little<00:03:17.160> bevel<00:03:17.520> cut

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
having that little tiny little bevel cut

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.010 
having that little tiny little bevel cut
on<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.910> back<00:03:18.030> end<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:18.420> then<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:18.840> sort<00:03:18.990> of

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
on the back end and then I just sort of

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.480 
on the back end and then I just sort of
like<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.350> look<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.770> so<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:19.950> threw<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:20.370> the

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
like the look of it so I threw it on the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.370 
like the look of it so I threw it on the
front<00:03:20.700> end<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.540> back<00:03:21.690> end<00:03:21.990> that

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
front end but that on the back end that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.520 
front end but that on the back end that
that<00:03:22.650> for<00:03:23.130> me<00:03:23.160> serves<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.790> purpose<00:03:24.030> that

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
that for me serves a purpose that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.870 
that for me serves a purpose that
actually<00:03:25.530> makes<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.950> guitar<00:03:26.070> comfortable<00:03:26.790> to

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
actually makes the guitar comfortable to

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.600 
actually makes the guitar comfortable to
sit<00:03:27.180> down<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.600> play<00:03:27.830> because<00:03:28.830> before<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.460> was

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
sit down and play because before it was

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.580 
sit down and play because before it was
just<00:03:29.640> rolling<00:03:30.390> off<00:03:30.510> my<00:03:30.810> knee<00:03:30.870> would<00:03:31.140> just<00:03:31.350> roll

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
just rolling off my knee would just roll

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.860 
just rolling off my knee would just roll
off<00:03:31.830> my<00:03:31.860> knee<00:03:32.100> but<00:03:33.000> now<00:03:33.180> when<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.480> actually<00:03:33.690> put

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
off my knee but now when I actually put

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.810 
off my knee but now when I actually put
it<00:03:34.170> on<00:03:34.350> my<00:03:34.560> knee<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.040> play<00:03:35.460> it

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
it on my knee and play it

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.360 
it on my knee and play it
it's<00:03:35.940> it'll<00:03:36.540> stay<00:03:36.990> there<00:03:37.230> it'll<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.160> won't

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
it's it'll stay there it'll it won't

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.980 
it's it'll stay there it'll it won't
move<00:03:38.610> around<00:03:38.880> because<00:03:39.240> before<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.660> put<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:39.930> on

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
move around because before you put it on

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.990 
move around because before you put it on
your<00:03:40.170> knee<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.440> just<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:41.280> locker<00:03:41.490> just<00:03:41.730> makes

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
your knee and just the locker just makes

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.050 
your knee and just the locker just makes
it<00:03:42.800> so<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:43.860> wouldn't<00:03:44.160> stay<00:03:44.370> on<00:03:44.490> my<00:03:44.670> knee<00:03:44.730> but

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
it so it wouldn't stay on my knee but

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.210 
it so it wouldn't stay on my knee but
now<00:03:45.240> it<00:03:45.510> stays<00:03:45.720> there<00:03:45.930> perfectly<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.709> for

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220
