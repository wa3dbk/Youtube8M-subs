Steve: Hi, it's Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.760
Today we're going to show you how to change
the drain pump on your washer.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.760
It's a really easy job.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.719
All you are going to need is a quarter inch
nut driver, a ratchet, and a 5/16th socket

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.740
with a short extension, and a pair of slip
joint pliers.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.669
Let me show you how we do.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.990
Now, before we begin this repair, the first
thing we want to do is disconnect the power

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.320
to the washer, simply pull the plug.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.300
Next, we're going to remove the two quarter
inch hex head screws that secure the bottom

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.340
access panel to the cabinet.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:41.989
Once you remove the screws you can tilt out
on the bottom of the panel and let it drop

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:51.079
down, just a couple of plastic alignment pegs
that will fit up into the bottom of the main

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.520
front panel.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.829
We will set that aside.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.949
Now the drain pump is located over in right
hand front corner and we have an outlet hose

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.920
that runs to your drain and an inlet hose
at the backside.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.930
We need to remove both of those and there
will be some water that will escape from both

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.159
of those hoses, so you will need an old towel
or two to sop that up.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:28.300
Now with your slip joint pliers we will squeeze
that clamp together, slide it down onto the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:38.149
hose, the one in behind we'll do the same
thing to it.

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:46.630
At this point, you can pull those hoses off.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.430
As I said, there will be some water that will
escape.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:59.789
It would be a single wire harness that connects
to it.

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.880
Unlock the connector tab and pull that off.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.610
Now with both hoses removed, we'll next remove
the two 5/16th hex head screws that secure

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.610
the pump to the base.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:31.580
So we use our short extension and ratchet.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.230
Now we can just lift the pump away from the
base and discard that.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.140
Now we'll take our new pump and set that in
on the base.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.940
We'll line up the holes in the mounting bracket
of the pump, with the two holes in the base

00:02:48.940 --> 00:03:06.440
frame and we will tighten those up to secure
them.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:21.690
Next, we'll line up the inlet hose to the
back of the pump.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:32.700
Make sure it's pulled fully on to the pump
and then with our slip joint pliers we'll

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:45.480
pull that clamp ahead to make sure it's seated
firmly.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.790
Check to make sure that that hose stayed in
its proper position.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.550
Next, we'll install the drain hose.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:06.550
Again, make sure it's seated firmly against
the pump flange.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:18.690
We'll slide the clamp into position.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:36.590
Next, we'll reconnect the wire harness; make
sure it locks into place.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.520
Now, we're ready to reinstall the front panel.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:53.020
Make sure the locating pins are still intact
and line them up with the openings at the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:03.080
bottom of the front panel, pull the panel
up tight and it helps to start these long

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:14.350
screws by hand.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.660
Make sure both of those screws are secure.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.200
Now we're ready to reconnect the power and
our repair is complete.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.340
I told you it was an easy job.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.630
Thanks for watching and good luck with your
repair.
