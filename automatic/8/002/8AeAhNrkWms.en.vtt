cuff works well the cool cuff is a
device<00:00:10.110> that's<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.799> line<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.519> mixes<00:00:11.940> cold

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
device that's in line that mixes cold

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.999 
device that's in line that mixes cold
air<00:00:12.450> with<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.839> hot<00:00:13.019> exhaust<00:00:13.200> coming<00:00:13.829> out<00:00:13.980> of

air with the hot exhaust coming out of
the<00:00:14.190> DPF<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.329> suit<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.830> know<00:00:16.950> you've<00:00:17.160> got

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
the DPF I suit and you know you've got

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.260 
the DPF I suit and you know you've got
vents<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:19.230> our<00:00:19.440> mixers<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.730> cuff<00:00:20.970> that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
vents that our mixers and the cuff that

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.140 
vents that our mixers and the cuff that
directs<00:00:21.750> air<00:00:21.900> into<00:00:22.350> those<00:00:22.500> vents<00:00:23.010> okay<00:00:23.640> what

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
directs air into those vents okay what

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.940 
directs air into those vents okay what
we<00:00:24.240> did<00:00:24.420> was<00:00:24.450> we<00:00:24.660> put<00:00:24.960> thermal<00:00:25.350> couples<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
we did was we put thermal couples in the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.010 
we did was we put thermal couples in the
exhaust<00:00:26.250> amount<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.030> stock<00:00:27.240> truck<00:00:27.600> all<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
exhaust amount of stock truck all the

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.020 
exhaust amount of stock truck all the
way<00:00:28.140> along<00:00:28.320> exactly<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.340> imagine<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
way along exactly and imagine this a

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.080 
way along exactly and imagine this a
very<00:00:30.539> hot<00:00:30.840> exhaust<00:00:31.230> gas<00:00:31.500> coming<00:00:31.890> out<00:00:32.129> of<00:00:32.400> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
very hot exhaust gas coming out of the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
very hot exhaust gas coming out of the
diesel<00:00:33.450> particulate<00:00:33.540> filter<00:00:33.990> you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.710> see

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
diesel particulate filter you can see

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.430 
diesel particulate filter you can see
how<00:00:35.160> hot<00:00:35.340> maybe<00:00:35.610> 11<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.120> around<00:00:36.450> 1100<00:00:37.110> degrees

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
how hot maybe 11 to around 1100 degrees

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.190 
how hot maybe 11 to around 1100 degrees
ok<00:00:37.860> let's<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.370> regen<00:00:38.820> once<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.810> reaches<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
ok let's do in regen once it reaches the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.950 
ok let's do in regen once it reaches the
cool<00:00:40.560> cuff<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.310> outside<00:00:41.670> air<00:00:41.910> comes<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.720> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
cool cuff the outside air comes in and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.069 
cool cuff the outside air comes in and
mixes<00:00:43.470> with<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.220> hot<00:00:44.430> exhaust<00:00:44.930> cooling<00:00:45.930> it

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
mixes with that hot exhaust cooling it

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.040 
mixes with that hot exhaust cooling it
down<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.460> we're<00:00:47.970> measuring<00:00:48.149> temperature<00:00:48.540> six

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050

would<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.260> exactly<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:26.610> didn't<00:01:26.820> want<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
would that exactly we didn't want to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
would that exactly we didn't want to
produce<00:01:27.210> anything<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.260> banks<00:01:28.650> we

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
produce anything like that from banks we

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
produce anything like that from banks we
don't<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.460> we're<00:01:29.729> scientists<00:01:30.360> ok<00:01:30.840> so

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
don't do that we're scientists ok so

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.800 
don't do that we're scientists ok so
that's<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.890> cool<00:01:32.100> cuff<00:01:32.400> how<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> made<00:01:33.420> well

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
that's the cool cuff how is it made well

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
that's the cool cuff how is it made well
it's<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.860> generated<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> shape<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:37.200> air

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
it's we generated the shape of the air

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.370 
it's we generated the shape of the air
inlets<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.420> computer<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.140> just

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
inlets in the computer it's not just

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.340 
inlets in the computer it's not just
stamped<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.220> bent<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.760> riyadh<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
stamped and then bent in riyadh so you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.620 
stamped and then bent in riyadh so you
see<00:01:43.619> we've<00:01:43.799> got<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> unique<00:01:44.369> shape<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.119> ok

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
see we've got a unique shape here ok

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.700 
see we've got a unique shape here ok
then<00:01:46.400> using<00:01:47.400> this<00:01:47.600> engineering<00:01:48.600> die<00:01:48.900> we<00:01:49.350> bend

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
then using this engineering die we bend

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.190 
then using this engineering die we bend
the<00:01:50.009> men<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> correct<00:01:51.060> angle<00:01:51.330> as<00:01:51.720> dictated

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the men to the correct angle as dictated

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.170 
the men to the correct angle as dictated
in<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> computer<00:01:52.950> design<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.850> course<00:01:54.030> all

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
in the computer design and of course all

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.289 
in the computer design and of course all
this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.619> validated<00:01:55.619> by<00:01:56.280> measuring<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
this is validated by measuring in the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
this is validated by measuring in the
field<00:01:57.570> right<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.530> an<00:01:58.710> error<00:01:58.890> stuff<00:01:59.220> so

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
field right so then is an error stuff so

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.740 
field right so then is an error stuff so
what<00:01:59.850> happens<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.210> put<00:02:00.240> them<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.540> too

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
what happens if you put them in too

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420 
what happens if you put them in too
macho<00:02:00.900> too<00:02:01.380> much<00:02:01.560> well<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> doesn't<00:02:02.130> work

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
macho too much well then it doesn't work

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.760 
macho too much well then it doesn't work
right<00:02:02.759> hi<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.299> angle<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.869> critical<00:02:04.350> ok

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
right hi so this angle is critical ok

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.069 
right hi so this angle is critical ok
and<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> shape<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.490> critical<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:06.960> you

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
and the shape is critical so here you

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.260 
and the shape is critical so here you
see<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.320> device<00:02:07.829> welded<00:02:08.369> into<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.759> pipe<00:02:08.970> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
see the device welded into the pipe and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.780 
see the device welded into the pipe and
then<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> cuff<00:02:09.989> slides<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.550> facing

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
then the cuff slides on and is facing

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.790 
then the cuff slides on and is facing
forward<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> air<00:02:12.599> enters

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
forward the air enters

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.920 
forward the air enters
flows<00:02:14.160> into<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.550> exhaust<00:02:14.790> stream<00:02:15.090> out<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
flows into the exhaust stream out the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.710 
flows into the exhaust stream out the
tip<00:02:16.170> nice<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.070> cool<00:02:17.250> great<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.120> I'm<00:02:18.300> imagine

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
tip nice and cool great and I'm imagine

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.660 
tip nice and cool great and I'm imagine
that<00:02:18.870> your<00:02:19.050> dual<00:02:19.290> exhaust<00:02:19.710> system<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.280> even

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
that your dual exhaust system is even

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.700 
that your dual exhaust system is even
cooler<00:02:20.790> than<00:02:21.060> yeah<00:02:21.240> yeah<00:02:21.660> 40<00:02:22.050> or<00:02:22.140> 50<00:02:22.380> degrees

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
cooler than yeah yeah 40 or 50 degrees

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.980 
cooler than yeah yeah 40 or 50 degrees
cooler<00:02:22.920> than<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.000> single<00:02:24.180> exhaust<00:02:24.600> is

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
cooler than the single exhaust is

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.530 
cooler than the single exhaust is
amazing<00:02:25.440> stuff
