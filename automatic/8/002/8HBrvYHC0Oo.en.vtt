00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.339
 and also that they are getting closer or going 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.319
 approaching the great event that is the cup 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.929
 of the world in the same average is growing 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.789
 it grows by interests 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:18.109
 personal interests or companies and in that 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:21.210
 minority begin to exercise veiled or 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.060
 not also to mind pressure so that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.760
 which player or which player goes to the selection 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.610
 so that this or that trainers 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.040
 for what they want me to do and there it is 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.710
 where the technician starts and if 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.080
 over then you do not get some good 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.590
 result in the previous then there 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.000
 where they begin to exert pressure or 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.080
 responsibility lies with a single 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.719
 person and good is no longer done it becomes a 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:57.579
 little bit and if not making decisions 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.579
 and what has happened to names 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.260
 leave us the same 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.869
 and you are going to mention the cali journalist of 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.590
 capabilities category or you do not have the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.970
 intelligence to know who is how 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.130
 you decide why you speak you do not know why 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.540
 say let's see an example in the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.950
 public security secretariat of 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.950
 federal district there is corruption 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.369
 the case of south africa there is much talk of 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.020
 Baptist boofo not of bofa was spoken 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.479
 even that there were no sponsors that 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.310
 sometimes even a team owner 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.360
 where he played the Baptist boob in those 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.069
 moments that chivas jorge vergara 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.619
 that he had requested that he would have to 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.569
 play because they wanted to sell it but here 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.710
 lets us see that the sponsors 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:56.710
 they influence something that has already been commented 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.130
 personal interests and of companies and 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.110
 companies also says it textually that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.170
 javier aguirre would have to be what 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.259
 sufficiently clear on this subject the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.050
 this was accomplice then of this of 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.690
 imposition of players by interests 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.069
 normal commercial all technicians 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.680
 that there has been since the last 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.030
 last calls in the last 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.030
 all have been accomplices 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.310
 louis credo 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:35.930
 called to such because they establish a 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.489
 technical micro to which the conadi gives because 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.959
 they told him doing they chose the volpe 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.120
 for example they did not choose the fragment to 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.720
 the volpe will be that I liked to blow 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.020
 I hugo 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.830
 lapuente not because they went to 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.360
 global is to say I hear you I do not know what 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.460
 so good that it's so bad to me 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.960
 makes it extraordinary that a people with no 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.790
 I know if you consider it with 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.140
 credibility or not to me it seems to me with 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.940
 a lot of credibility has two 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.290
 world has come to take the ox out of 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.420
 the canyon twice 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.750
 and today he says of course that he has the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.519
 subject and has the credibility has now 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.709
 after this I do not know if I have the 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.230
 moral quality to talk about this topic 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.959
 because he became an accomplice in the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.599
 authority has it moral I do not think that the 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.620
 have because he was an accomplice and because in his 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.780
 moment he did not denounce it and now they are 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.519
 half truths is that mean that I 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.980
 it seems that there is also 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.510
 raise it not what javier aguirre says 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.939
 it's something that has already been handled as 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.769
 I do not insist the important thing here would 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.019
 been that I said they imposed me until the 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.709
 player and I imposed it such person or such 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.419
 sponsor there if there would not want 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.010
 say that you washed your image because it follows 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.139
 being an accomplice when saying it so far 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.530
 but if I had opened another kind of 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.530
 situation
