the<00:00:37.739> neon<00:00:37.920> orange<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:39.170> as<00:00:40.170> compared<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> just

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the neon orange here as compared to just

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.670 
the neon orange here as compared to just
a<00:00:41.250> regular<00:00:41.910> red<00:00:42.140> coverage<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.260> way<00:00:43.379> better<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
a regular red coverage is way better I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.930 
a regular red coverage is way better I
think<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.920> took<00:00:44.040> me<00:00:44.190> three<00:00:44.430> fourths<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
think it took me three fourths of a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.330 
think it took me three fourths of a
bottle<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.350> spoon<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.010> kind

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
bottle just to do this spoon that kind

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.670 
bottle just to do this spoon that kind
of<00:00:47.399> coverage<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.480> great<00:00:48.680> when

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
of coverage on it it's not so great when

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.540 
of coverage on it it's not so great when
this<00:00:49.890> took<00:00:50.250> me<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.760> don't<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:52.100> an<00:00:53.100> 8<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
this took me I don't know an 8 for the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.459 
this took me I don't know an 8 for the
bottle<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> coverage<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.260> way

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
bottle you know so the coverage is way

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.200 
bottle you know so the coverage is way
different<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.100> you're<00:00:56.190> gonna<00:00:56.280> go<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.789> the
