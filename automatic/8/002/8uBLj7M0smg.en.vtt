Scrolls<00:00:17.670> as<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.449> can<00:00:18.570> see<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.810> sense<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
Scrolls as you can see the sense on the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.560 
Scrolls as you can see the sense on the
weapon<00:00:19.680> there<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.189> now<00:00:20.880> i'm<00:00:21.060> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> scroll

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
weapon there and now i'm going to scroll

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.609 
weapon there and now i'm going to scroll
it<00:00:23.330> the<00:00:24.330> miracle<00:00:24.539> scrolls<00:00:24.960> are<00:00:25.199> one<00:00:25.560> hundred

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
it the miracle scrolls are one hundred

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.580 
it the miracle scrolls are one hundred
percent<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:27.269> are<00:00:27.390> thus<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.810> gain<00:00:28.230> give

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
percent and they are thus a gain give

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.220 
percent and they are thus a gain give
the<00:00:28.769> same<00:00:28.949> stats<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> 10-percent<00:00:30.269> scroll<00:00:30.570> so

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the same stats as a 10-percent scroll so

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.400 
the same stats as a 10-percent scroll so
there<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.500> kind<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.750> kinda<00:00:33.750> expensive<00:00:34.050> i
