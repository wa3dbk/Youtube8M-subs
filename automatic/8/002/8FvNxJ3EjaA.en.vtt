 lack of care with the fate of the 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.460
 and the population growth of the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.699
 cities contributes to the increase of 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.949
 floods and floods 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.989
 sewage and rainwater need 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.760
 Free flow channels which in 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.969
 are often interrupted by the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.800
 accumulation of garbage thrown in the streets

 to expedite if necessary 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.340
 abandon the house of zizi energy and 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.220
 electrical equipment close the registration

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.930
 chance of accidents worsening the situation 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.750

 knees immediately 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.950
 It's current can drag it out too. 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.560
 if you notice cracks or cracks 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.599

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.909
 Tournament drive signals 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.340
 in case the band is not possible 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.299
 house went up on the roof and the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.670

 take the necessary steps 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.079
 in the rural area the procedure changes 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.579
 sure is to cut the droughts and 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.980
 open doorways for creations 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.349
 to escape the flood 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.689
 just the pets 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:55.810
 and something else warns the neighbors of the danger 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:57.790
 the tension on the street until the nice cleto never 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.159
 pass through flooded areas 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.739
 only through extreme situations if 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.689
 there is no other possibility since 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.090
 there may be holes and culverts without 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.069
 lids or masked by water and becomes 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.439
 away from the water currents because they 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.909
 have great speed and volume and yet 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.849
 carries objects that can cause 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.370
 injuries before walls and walls 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.500
 preferably rope-safe or 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.959
 being helped by other people 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.840
 water strength at sites in the 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.159
 uncontrollable 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.620
 whenever possible improvisation material 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:32.079
 fluctuation to have with you can be a 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.579
 piece by an empty patio enclosed with 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.829
 cover or a float if you are lucky 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.019
 if caught by the current flows with the 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.659
 belly up and feet forward 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.519
 in order to protect the head in this 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.010
 any moment in this region 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.959
 increases the risk of drowning 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.209
 if it is to help save someone with the use 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.250
 of a rope always uses in the sense 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.739
 taking advantage of the direction of 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.409
 and do not forget to tie the 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.659
 end of rope elite cross bridges 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.939
 where the level of the river rose keep 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.770
 poles apart since the energy wires 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.980
 others may 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.960
 electrical shock if you can choose 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.970
 non-motorized vessels and 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.430
 possible to wear life jackets 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.140
 even if you know how to swim do not let your 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.980
 child play in the rainy waters and 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.870
 floods 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.120
 never take advantage of flood water and 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.810
 drink boiled bottled water only or 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.700
 chlorinated 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.920
 during floods it is common to 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.920
 contaminations such as leptospirosis and 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.490
 cholera and hepatitis 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.260
 skin 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.800
 the first symptom of vomiting fever 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.570
 diarrhea abdominal pain in the legs or 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.700
 If injuries occur seek unit 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.770
 health department informing you that 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.200
 had contact with the flood water 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.520
 all these precautions are preventive 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.980
 for your health 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.050
 if it has been withdrawn or abandoned 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.000
 your residence does not come home until 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.790
 the water is down and the site is 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.430
 released by the civil defense in case of 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.410
 doubt call 193 immediately warns 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.120
 numbers and you never have to save 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.330
 there is a risk to your safety 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.010
 many people die in this way 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.150
 care also continues after the 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.730
 floods 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.470
 even before entering your home has 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.730
 care and see if there is no risk 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.990
 it blows off 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.730
 to prevent fires and shocks 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.350
 or explosions 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.450
 check the conditions of the 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.150
 electricity and gas pipelines 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.370
 before turning them only return to home 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.960
 during the day the boots and gloves to 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.200
 avoid contact with water and mud 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.790
 cleaning the affected areas immediately 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.920
 to decontaminate the carton locations 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.540
 water at the time of cleaning uses a 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.670
 teaspoon of bleach for soup 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.080
 every liter of water 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.240
 if your residence was destroyed 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.580
 during the flood do not return to 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.710
 build in the same place because early or 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.990
 later a new flood will occur and the 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.810
 probability of repeating everything is very 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.389
 great 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.639
 When we build, we do not turn off the 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.860
 drainpipe and consultation of civil defense your 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.870
 safe places 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.790
 we are responsible for the 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.250
 floods that increase the risk of 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.380
 tragedies notes diseases 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.669
 but we are also the solution to reduce 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.530
 this problem 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.930
 if you each contribute your small 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.730
 but important attitudes that we will have 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.160
 immense positive result 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.350
 prevention can reduce by 85 percent 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.780
 of these occurrences 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.450
 so my friends do not flood 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.520
 risk their lives for material goods 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.860
 your life is worth more than anything 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:29.440
 transmit these messages to all 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:31.630
 people you know about prevention 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.440
 avoids 20,000 deaths from drowning 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.419
 every year 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.580
 but Brazil is responsible for the union of 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.860
 all those who live in Brazil and 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.940
 prevention means to reduce even 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.940
 plus the number of drownings 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.180
 ae
