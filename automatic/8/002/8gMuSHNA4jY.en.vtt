 supposed battlefield 5 regarding the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.660

 event are the words of the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.699
 Mr. byte one of the producers 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.649
 battlefield executives you already know that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.170
 battlefield 4 will be available to 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.280
 from the next day 29 of this same 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.650
 month on pc playstation 3 and xbox 360 and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.690
 playstation 4 and xbox one will arrive more 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 late when the consoles are 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.650
 in the market you already know playstation 4 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.390
 November 29 and xbox one on the 22nd 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.400
 week before but it's fine this 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.770
 that is already sounding the name of 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.410
 battlefield 5 in the minds of his 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.450
 creators although I as always I suppose 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.640
 that will depend on the success of the fourth 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.030
 part I think that this year it is going to 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.010
 have a lot of success is the most 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.810
 spectacular as far as you get cash peli 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.530
 I believe that for everything we have seen 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.660
 of Battlefield 4 clearly exceeds what 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.510
 what could be that call of duty ghosts 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.710
 which today I do not want to demean anything 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.540
 but yes it is true that to me 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.140
 I personally have been quite impressed 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.850
 plus 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250
 battlefield 4 and everything that has been 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.979
 shown so I have no doubt that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.630
 all these words that say about 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.540
 an impossible assumption 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.130
 battlefield 5 are correct are certain 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.130
 and that of course will come true
