everybody<00:00:01.530> want<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.800> gather<00:00:02.010> around<00:00:02.240> I'd<00:00:03.240> like

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
everybody want to gather around I'd like

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.749 
everybody want to gather around I'd like
to<00:00:03.510> show<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.750> guys<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.230> another<00:00:05.220> application

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
to show you guys the another application

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.670 
to show you guys the another application
that<00:00:06.060> I<00:00:06.089> have<00:00:06.330> written<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:07.109> determine<00:00:07.589> the

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
that I have written to determine the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.310 
that I have written to determine the
states<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.160> solenoids<00:00:08.610> basically<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.510> have

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
states of the solenoids basically I have

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.669 
states of the solenoids basically I have
all<00:00:10.530> three<00:00:10.800> fret<00:00:11.070> locations<00:00:12.679> represented

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
all three fret locations represented

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.730 
all three fret locations represented
with<00:00:14.089> checkboxes<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.330> if<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.780> can<00:00:15.960> if<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.500> click

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
with checkboxes in if I can if I click

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.590 
with checkboxes in if I can if I click
on<00:00:16.920> any<00:00:17.190> one<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.580> locations<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.420> can

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
on any one of the locations I can

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.779 
on any one of the locations I can
analyze<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.289> solenoids<00:00:19.800> independently

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.130 

that<00:00:26.789> was<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.179> means<00:00:27.419> of<00:00:27.599> writing<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.960> file

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
that was one means of writing the file

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.900 
that was one means of writing the file
takes<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.529> long<00:00:28.710> time<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.130> do<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.519> way<00:00:29.730> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
takes a long time to do it this way and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.659 
takes a long time to do it this way and
I<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.599> Quincy<00:00:31.199> through<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.250> address

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
I can see Quincy through the address

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.310 
I can see Quincy through the address
locations

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.440 

so<00:00:42.320> that's<00:00:42.829> that<00:00:43.070> application<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:44.180> this<00:00:44.300> is

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
so that's that application that this is

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.119 
so that's that application that this is
the<00:00:44.570> application<00:00:45.050> that's<00:00:45.350> actually<00:00:45.770> sending

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
the application that's actually sending

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:59.530 
the application that's actually sending
the<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.210> song<00:00:47.449> file<00:00:47.750> out<00:00:56.559> I'm<00:00:57.559> gonna<00:00:57.710> go<00:00:58.540> this

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
the the song file out I'm gonna go this

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.110 
the the song file out I'm gonna go this
the<00:01:00.079> switching<00:01:00.559> of<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:00.920> solenoids<00:01:01.460> is<00:01:01.670> that

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
the switching of the solenoids is that

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.549 
the switching of the solenoids is that
kind<00:01:02.329> of<00:01:02.420> loud<00:01:02.600> because<00:01:02.899> of<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.199> metal<00:01:03.440> on

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
kind of loud because of the metal on

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.469 
kind of loud because of the metal on
metal<00:01:03.589> contact<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:04.550> couldn't<00:01:04.850> eliminate<00:01:05.269> that

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
metal contact I couldn't eliminate that

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.960 
metal contact I couldn't eliminate that
so<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:06.050> decided<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.009> make<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.369> guitar<00:01:07.520> louder

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
so I decided to make the guitar louder

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.480 
so I decided to make the guitar louder
by<00:01:08.270> amplifying<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:10.369> guys<00:01:10.550> will<00:01:10.759> love<00:01:10.940> that

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
by amplifying it you guys will love that

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.730 
by amplifying it you guys will love that
okay<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:13.550> I<00:01:14.360> basically<00:01:14.810> just<00:01:15.229> hit<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.500> stop

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
okay so I basically just hit the stop

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.290 
okay so I basically just hit the stop
button<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.160> alls<00:01:16.340> it's<00:01:16.550> going<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:16.759> do<00:01:16.910> is<00:01:17.060> stop

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
button and alls it's going to do is stop

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.240 
button and alls it's going to do is stop
reading<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.229> sequential<00:01:18.590> lines<00:01:18.979> of<00:01:19.190> the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
reading in the sequential lines of the

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.160 
reading in the sequential lines of the
file<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.509> first<00:01:20.750> thing<00:01:20.869> it<00:01:20.990> does<00:01:21.020> is

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
file and the first thing it does is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.320 
file and the first thing it does is
sequence<00:01:21.710> through<00:01:21.979> each<00:01:22.130> solenoid<00:01:22.729> toggling

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
sequence through each solenoid toggling

00:01:23.330 --> 00:02:25.290 
sequence through each solenoid toggling
at<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.630> resolution<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.560> system

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:52.160 

and<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:27.170> one<00:02:27.350> has

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.170 

okay<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.350> data<00:02:53.710> has<00:02:53.920> been<00:02:54.180> hopefully

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
okay the data has been hopefully

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.970 
okay the data has been hopefully
successfully<00:02:55.900> stored<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.470> memory<00:02:56.650> now

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
successfully stored in the memory now

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.860 
successfully stored in the memory now
we're<00:02:57.100> going<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.250> play<00:02:57.460> back<00:02:57.730> without<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.330> PC

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
we're going to play back without the PC

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:35.700 
we're going to play back without the PC
being<00:02:59.110> connected<00:03:34.170> it's<00:03:35.170> like<00:03:35.380> on<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.530> back

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
being connected it's like on the back

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.260 
being connected it's like on the back
through<00:03:35.980> because<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.280> didn't<00:03:36.520> hit<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.790> reset

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
through because I didn't hit the reset

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.450 
through because I didn't hit the reset
to<00:03:37.570> stop<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.930> count<00:03:38.140> at<00:03:38.290> zero<00:03:38.590> I<00:03:38.710> originally

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
to stop the count at zero I originally

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:53.910 
to stop the count at zero I originally
started<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.630> record

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:44.190 

you

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:54.730 

and<00:04:45.200> that's<00:04:45.500> pretty<00:04:45.710> much<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:53.320> it's<00:04:54.320> just<00:04:54.500> like

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
and that's pretty much it it's just like

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.800 
and that's pretty much it it's just like
went<00:04:55.010> back<00:04:55.190> through<00:04:55.460> old<00:04:55.520> data<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.720> was

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
went back through old data that was

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.790 
went back through old data that was
present<00:04:57.170> in<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.380> memory<00:04:59.200> now<00:05:00.200> are<00:05:00.440> there<00:05:00.650> any

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
present in the memory now are there any

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:13.870 
present in the memory now are there any
questions<00:05:06.070> never<00:05:07.070> before<00:05:07.670> attempted<00:05:12.880> well

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
questions never before attempted well

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.490 
questions never before attempted well
