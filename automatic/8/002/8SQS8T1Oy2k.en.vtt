00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.470
 in a video after a long absence 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.430
 you know very well that runners of 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.899
 price of a lot of time in my life 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.389
 short clean had found Thursday in 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.769
 a little video related to christmas 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.490
 because we are today 10 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.219
 December 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.520
 and since my name I started the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.980
 challenge to succeed in holding a series for 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.910
 go through defeat and I start 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.590
 today by a video gift idea if 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.990
 you are not sure what to buy 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.369
 while partnering with a website 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.309
 lille plays with whom i did well 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.290
 a partnership since the year and has shown 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.579
 suggest a contact for you 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.450
 to make a partnership precisely by 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.420
 relation to these assaults of gift 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.649
 jack it was for people who do not 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.930
 did not see the video that knew 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.730
 not yet the website etc felioune follow 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.350
 super good quality is super pretty 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.809
 feather by the site sales a bit in 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.600
 general so souf ippon like that it's 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.690
 of jewelry that is specialized elsewhere 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 in the iss you create pandora bracelet 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.449
 motivating the bracelets and all the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.769
 pendants for who go with 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.840
 you have a wide choice but coming 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.130
 Huge pendants personally 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.760
 it's not my style of jewelry 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.070
 I do not like that so I'm 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.640
 woke up on normal jewelry in 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.280
 somehow 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.030
 and so they sell everything they go 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.670
 take off we are drastic 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.799
 ring of torreilles sells any moment 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.750
 even jewelry for men 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.040
 so that's so it's not that intended 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.479
 to women I received my order 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.280
 in a week what is enough 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:37.450
 reasonable after a thousand back 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.880
 are possible for 365 days will arrive 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.360
 never to say returns are possible 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.909
 up for 365 days so it's a little 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.850
 crazy but that's possible 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.630
 that's if you have a concern over 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.330
 outside even if you laugh 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.679
 three months after receiving it it's 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.229
 possible we manage watches and the 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.670
 jewels that I ordered so good there 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.380
 it's not for me it's for my mother 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.729
 it is that those who chose them 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.340
 so if you hear speak Basque 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.709
 we are lacking yeah it's small 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.119
 or golden super Belgian moment odorless my 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.940
 beautiful area because they are more 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.610
 left behind a bit hanging but 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.900
 not too much with a big blue traces 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.600
 and 82 rectangle always rhinestones shelter 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.790
 it's super pretty for especially the 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.480
 brown it looks really good for 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.150
 I am more folded on rings 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.769
 so I ordered 3 so I 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.760
 ordered this one which is 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.000
 unfortunately a little too cheap 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.950
 Moreover, it pays pension to the sizes of 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.760
 debates who knows too much if it's not 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.350
 possible 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.290
 systran will happen either because 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.000
 that they fall so inquire 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.250
 really of course the state is what 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.280
 the state will be on the site on mountain 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.230
 American so try to see on 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.799
 sites convert your size 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.239
 french et cetera in american size 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.269
 that really took off and many masaya 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.590
 because I unfortunately but that I 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.410
 thought to have taken the same size but 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.360
 finally 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.130
 it's too small this straw and a 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.360
 time makes a ring all saints full of 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.330
 small facets made a rug 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.120
 then I also ordered her too 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.660
 little a ring this time silvery with 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.970
 Ben Briand line always why 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.510
 shines and where unfortunately she is 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.900
 too small 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.940
 finally this so she and she is going so 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.770
 it's a ring always a ring a 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.260
 little watered with 20 turow rhinestones and 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.120
 so has the white traces he traces the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.450
 blue then I grew up a gorgeous 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.350
 bracelet but here it is the brass tdd fac 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.450
 of pau that here we are the raf is not 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.970
 Too beautiful a bit kitsch but I love 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.130
 that really super pretty 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.890
 so always rhinestones always 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.170
 rhinestones or there in purple tones 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.460
 orange green red and finally not really 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.860
 beautiful capital goes on the wrist 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.420
 these sweets with enough white jeans 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.040
 good points at most for going out like this 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.020
 it's sabine held her beautiful and 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.160
 I like it a lot and so much that I 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.280
 like to match there but I still have 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.420
 never except that I think of it a 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.489
 maybe for Christmas 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.489
 we'll see he offered a small gift to 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.280
 from 30 euros of purchase and lower 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:26.120
 in two years more the order is expensive 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.010
 more welmant a nice gift so voila 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.169
 I was entitled to a pair 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.760
 like this says it's a 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.290
 choice of color but it's rather 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.580
 not bad 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.590
 so these two guys you will have like this 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.140
 to green because it is my sister who 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.460
 did they choose because the wine 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.900
 it is for her actually I was paying 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.940
 the test is unleashed various so I have not 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.840
 understood what a blue was pink 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.130

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.560

 think do you know the common sense 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.850
 even if not too related to christmas 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.450
 it was connected with the end of the year 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.670
 petanque balls 2013 which was 1 year the 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.020
 feminine and that I found super nice 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.480
 so tell me if it would please me 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.830

 I do not know yet maybe a mix of 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.970
 two but you know it's long 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:50.430

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.919
 edit no it's going to mean that means the 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.460
 thing rather that it's very long to 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:58.229
