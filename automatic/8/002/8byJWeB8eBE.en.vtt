00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
key this is the sake bottles very tight

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.749 
key this is the sake bottles very tight
so<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> gotta<00:01:15.390> use<00:01:15.900> two<00:01:16.229> keys<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.799> my<00:01:17.040> kiss<00:01:17.400> will

so I gotta use two keys so my kiss will

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.929 
so I gotta use two keys so my kiss will
not<00:01:18.570> burn<00:01:18.900> too<00:01:19.229> much<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.130> stick<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.759> like

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
not burn too much so you stick it like

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.899 
not burn too much so you stick it like
that<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.750> hand<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:23.009> open<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> just

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
like that so the idea is here that they

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.960 
like that so the idea is here that they
are<00:01:30.090> hard<00:01:30.540> over<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.520> will<00:01:32.700> fly

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
are hard over here and so it will fly

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.010 
are hard over here and so it will fly
out<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:34.070> let<00:01:35.070> those<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.600> kind<00:01:36.900> of
