00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.349 
background and with me Dan and today
we'll<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.710> talking<00:00:16.980> about<00:00:17.250> what<00:00:17.880> happens<00:00:17.910> in

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
we'll be talking about what happens in

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.510 
we'll be talking about what happens in
front<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.690> combine<00:00:19.109> mainly<00:00:19.949> pickup

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
front of the combine mainly pickup

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.550 
front of the combine mainly pickup
headers<00:00:20.820> straight<00:00:21.300> cut<00:00:21.480> headers<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
headers straight cut headers and the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.800 
headers straight cut headers and the
feederhouse<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.220> we'll<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> look<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
feederhouse and we'll have a look at the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.210 
feederhouse and we'll have a look at the
settings<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.410> should<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.800> doing<00:00:25.949> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
settings that we should be doing to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.740 
settings that we should be doing to
optimize<00:00:26.730> our<00:00:27.029> field<00:00:27.390> performance<00:00:29.570> okay

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
optimize our field performance okay

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.260 
optimize our field performance okay
so<00:00:31.320> now<00:00:31.679> we're<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> John<00:00:32.430> Deere<00:00:32.640> pickup<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
so now we're in a John Deere pickup and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.360 
so now we're in a John Deere pickup and
we're<00:00:34.140> basically<00:00:34.290> looking<00:00:34.890> at<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.100> main

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
we're basically looking at the main

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
we're basically looking at the main
component<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.690> conveyor

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
component here which is the conveyor

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.979 
component here which is the conveyor
auger<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.100> what's<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:39.120> important<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.930> that

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
auger and what's very important is that

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.319 
auger and what's very important is that
we<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.800> correct<00:00:41.040> setting<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.760> height

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
we have the correct setting of height

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.200 
we have the correct setting of height
and<00:00:42.629> for<00:00:43.140> aft<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.879> usually

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and for aft on it which is usually

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.840 
and for aft on it which is usually
adjusted<00:00:45.719> by<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.960> guys<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.289> PD<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> pre<00:00:47.550> deliver

these<00:00:48.090> things<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:49.020> pretty<00:00:49.280> people<00:00:50.280> ever

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
these things are pretty people ever

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.819 
these things are pretty people ever
inspect<00:00:50.969> these<00:00:51.120> things<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.690> what's<00:00:52.649> very

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
inspect these things and what's very

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520 
inspect these things and what's very
important<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.910> even<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> small<00:00:55.079> stocks

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
important is that even the small stocks

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.130 
important is that even the small stocks
can<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.039> conveyed<00:00:56.670> which<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.870> case

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
can be conveyed which in this case

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.979 
can be conveyed which in this case
doesn't<00:00:58.949> happen<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.120> product

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
doesn't happen so we get product

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.950 
doesn't happen so we get product
bunching<00:01:01.590> which<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.340> not<00:01:02.520> good<00:01:02.809> part<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> that

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
bunching which is not good part of that

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.530 
bunching which is not good part of that
is<00:01:04.080> also<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.400> called<00:01:05.640> floor<00:01:06.000> strippers

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
is also the so called floor strippers

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.200 
is also the so called floor strippers
which<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> funny<00:01:07.619> word<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:07.920> basically<00:01:08.880> just

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
which is a funny word for basically just

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.140 
which is a funny word for basically just
the<00:01:09.420> bars<00:01:09.630> across<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.350> floor<00:01:10.590> here<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.150> we

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the bars across the floor here and we

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.690 
the bars across the floor here and we
get<00:01:12.299> into<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.990> detail<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.830> well

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.250 

okay<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:21.760> now<00:01:22.090> we<00:01:22.150> got<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.630> pickup<00:01:23.050> header

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
okay so now we got the pickup header

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.860 
okay so now we got the pickup header
removed<00:01:23.680> from<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.400> feederhouse<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.360> we<00:01:25.630> can

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
removed from the feederhouse and we can

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.520 
removed from the feederhouse and we can
see<00:01:26.230> the<00:01:26.620> back<00:01:26.980> side<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.610> so<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.900> can<00:01:29.140> see

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
see the back side of it so we can see

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.270 
see the back side of it so we can see
that<00:01:30.370> the<00:01:30.910> strippers<00:01:31.390> right<00:01:32.020> here<00:01:32.320> extend

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
that the strippers right here extend

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.700 
that the strippers right here extend
into<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:33.850> fairly<00:01:34.720> big<00:01:34.870> opening<00:01:35.410> that<00:01:35.680> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
into the fairly big opening that the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.370 
into the fairly big opening that the
header<00:01:36.070> actually<00:01:36.250> has<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.030> what<00:01:37.960> matters

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
header actually has and what matters

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.550 
header actually has and what matters
here<00:01:38.680> is<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.670> width<00:01:40.090> between<00:01:40.720> those<00:01:41.140> two

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
here is that the width between those two

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.610 
here is that the width between those two
strippers<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:43.570> width<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.080> feeder

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
strippers is the width of the feeder

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.860 
strippers is the width of the feeder
chain<00:01:44.920> no<00:01:45.520> more<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.060> not<00:01:46.270> less

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
chain no more and not less

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.200 
chain no more and not less
we<00:01:47.230> don't<00:01:47.470> want<00:01:47.710> product<00:01:48.190> go<00:01:48.430> into<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.940> side

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
we don't want product go into the side

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.150 
we don't want product go into the side
of<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.480> feeder<00:01:49.720> drum<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.200> we<00:01:50.650> don't<00:01:50.860> want

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
of the feeder drum and we don't want

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.310 
of the feeder drum and we don't want
product<00:01:51.610> just<00:01:51.850> going<00:01:52.300> into<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.690> middle<00:01:53.020> of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
product just going into the middle of

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.490 
product just going into the middle of
the<00:01:53.650> feeder<00:01:53.860> chain<00:01:54.160> conveyor<00:01:54.820> chain<00:01:55.440> okay<00:01:56.440> so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
the feeder chain conveyor chain okay so

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.130 
the feeder chain conveyor chain okay so
here<00:01:56.920> we<00:01:57.070> have<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.640> rear<00:01:58.120> strippers<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.660> can

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
here we have the rear strippers that can

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.040 
here we have the rear strippers that can
be<00:01:59.350> adjusted<00:01:59.950> with<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.670> slotted<00:02:01.420> holes<00:02:01.750> we

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
be adjusted with the slotted holes we

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.920 
be adjusted with the slotted holes we
can<00:02:02.080> slide<00:02:02.710> this<00:02:03.460> top<00:02:03.790> end<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.540> stripper

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
can slide this top end of the stripper

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.500 
can slide this top end of the stripper
towards<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.650> auger<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.190> create<00:02:07.060> less<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.450> a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
towards the auger and create less of a

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.610 
towards the auger and create less of a
gap<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:08.649> floor<00:02:09.100> strippers<00:02:09.700> can<00:02:10.179> also<00:02:10.450> be<00:02:11.020> slid

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
gap the floor strippers can also be slid

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.340 
gap the floor strippers can also be slid
forward<00:02:12.010> but<00:02:12.820> that<00:02:13.150> change<00:02:13.570> is<00:02:13.750> very<00:02:13.930> little

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
forward but that change is very little

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.760 
forward but that change is very little
the<00:02:14.980> bigger<00:02:15.220> impact<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.330> by<00:02:16.780> moving<00:02:17.410> the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
the bigger impact you have by moving the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.830 
the bigger impact you have by moving the
auger<00:02:17.980> up<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.580> down<00:02:19.890> okay<00:02:20.890> there<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.910> repair

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
auger up and down okay there is a repair

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.070 
auger up and down okay there is a repair
procedure<00:02:23.380> or<00:02:23.770> adjust<00:02:24.520> procedure<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.720> this

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
procedure or adjust procedure for this

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.250 
procedure or adjust procedure for this
system<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.190> your<00:02:27.820> operator's<00:02:28.360> manual<00:02:28.390> which

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
system in your operator's manual which

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.540 
system in your operator's manual which
is<00:02:29.290> highly<00:02:29.830> recommended<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.670> read<00:02:30.880> and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
is highly recommended to read and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.580 
is highly recommended to read and
basically<00:02:33.550> we<00:02:34.360> got<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.600> height<00:02:34.989> adjustment

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
basically we got a height adjustment

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.410 
basically we got a height adjustment
here<00:02:36.150> for<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.300> auger<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:39.700> got<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:39.940> timing

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
here for the auger we got a timing

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.390 
here for the auger we got a timing
adjustment<00:02:41.019> here<00:02:41.640> for<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.150> auger<00:02:43.330> fingers<00:02:44.400> we

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
adjustment here for the auger fingers we

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.500 
adjustment here for the auger fingers we
got<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.730> four<00:02:46.060> aft<00:02:46.530> right<00:02:47.530> here<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.239> the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
got the four aft right here this is the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.940 
got the four aft right here this is the
right<00:02:49.690> side<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.560> pickup<00:02:52.950> fairly

that<00:02:59.739> always<00:03:00.070> leak<00:03:00.390> well<00:03:01.390> some<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.750> them<00:03:01.900> do

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
that always leak well some of them do

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.890 
that always leak well some of them do
some<00:03:02.080> of<00:03:02.320> them<00:03:02.410> don't<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:04.090> adjustment<00:03:04.720> is

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
some of them don't and the adjustment is

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.850 
some of them don't and the adjustment is
explained<00:03:05.650> on<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.910> side<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.510> these<00:03:08.380> linkages

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
explained on the side of these linkages

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.320 
explained on the side of these linkages
and<00:03:09.480> basically<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.810> want<00:03:11.080> this<00:03:11.350> edge<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
and basically you want this edge of the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.680 
and basically you want this edge of the
linkage<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:14.709> line<00:03:15.100> up<00:03:15.340> with<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:16.590> slot<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:18.690> at

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
linkage to line up with this slot and at

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.009 
linkage to line up with this slot and at
least<00:03:20.140> get<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.830> within<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:22.420> range<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.870> this

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
least get it within the range of this

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.759 
least get it within the range of this
slot<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:25.150> it

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
slot and that's it

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.099 
slot and that's it
okay<00:03:26.769> so<00:03:26.830> if<00:03:27.639> you<00:03:27.820> can't<00:03:28.030> imagine<00:03:28.150> we<00:03:28.720> have<00:03:28.930> our

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
okay so if you can't imagine we have our

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.820 
okay so if you can't imagine we have our
pickup<00:03:29.620> attached<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.310> the

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
pickup attached to the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.800 
pickup attached to the
I was<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.280> front<00:03:31.460> here<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:31.970> we<00:03:32.720> were

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
I was in the front here and we were

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.630 
I was in the front here and we were
talking<00:03:33.140> about<00:03:33.230> those<00:03:33.560> strippers<00:03:33.950> if<00:03:34.340> they

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
talking about those strippers if they

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.180 
talking about those strippers if they
were<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:35.150> be<00:03:35.390> too<00:03:36.170> far<00:03:36.410> in<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.710> future<00:03:36.740> house

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
were to be too far in the future house

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.700 
were to be too far in the future house
our<00:03:37.730> product<00:03:38.270> flows<00:03:38.780> around<00:03:39.200> them<00:03:39.470> and

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
our product flows around them and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.700 
our product flows around them and
basically<00:03:39.980> hits<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:41.720> center<00:03:42.050> section<00:03:42.260> we're

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
basically hits the center section we're

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.790 
basically hits the center section we're
not<00:03:42.890> using<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.460> full<00:03:43.670> width<00:03:44.270> of<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:45.410> conveyor

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
not using the full width of the conveyor

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.970 
not using the full width of the conveyor
chain<00:03:45.830> so<00:03:46.670> not<00:03:46.820> only<00:03:47.150> does<00:03:47.390> that<00:03:47.420> strain<00:03:48.080> the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
chain so not only does that strain the

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.660 
chain so not only does that strain the
slats<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.870> chain<00:03:51.110> itself<00:03:51.530> but<00:03:52.250> also<00:03:52.460> the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
slats and the chain itself but also the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.060 
slats and the chain itself but also the
drum<00:03:53.090> we<00:03:53.600> just<00:03:53.810> get<00:03:53.990> bunching<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.680> product

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
drum we just get bunching of the product

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.650 
drum we just get bunching of the product
in<00:03:55.220> front<00:03:55.520> of<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.270> cylinder<00:03:56.600> or<00:03:57.410> in<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.740> rope

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
in front of the cylinder or in the rope

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.220 
in front of the cylinder or in the rope
with<00:03:59.660> roller<00:03:59.990> probably<00:04:00.530> takes<00:04:00.770> it<00:04:00.920> better<00:04:02.230> if

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
with roller probably takes it better if

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.920 
with roller probably takes it better if
we<00:04:03.530> had<00:04:03.830> our<00:04:04.250> strippers<00:04:04.970> too<00:04:05.240> far<00:04:05.570> on<00:04:05.600> the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
we had our strippers too far on the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.800 
we had our strippers too far on the
outside<00:04:06.700> some<00:04:07.700> people<00:04:08.090> don't<00:04:08.330> even<00:04:08.450> have

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
outside some people don't even have

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.080 
outside some people don't even have
these<00:04:09.020> shrouds<00:04:09.410> anymore<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.190> poor<00:04:10.640> panda

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
these shrouds anymore and poor panda

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.020 
these shrouds anymore and poor panda
ends<00:04:11.480> up<00:04:11.600> happening<00:04:12.130> we<00:04:13.130> get<00:04:13.280> product<00:04:13.760> in<00:04:13.910> the

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
ends up happening we get product in the

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.560 
ends up happening we get product in the
sides<00:04:14.330> of<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.660> drum<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:16.180> basically<00:04:17.180> we<00:04:17.390> don't

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
sides of the drum and basically we don't

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.380 
sides of the drum and basically we don't
have<00:04:17.780> conveying<00:04:18.410> an<00:04:18.680> action<00:04:19.310> as<00:04:19.519> we<00:04:20.090> do<00:04:20.239> it

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
have conveying an action as we do it

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.410 
have conveying an action as we do it
have<00:04:20.600> a<00:04:20.900> world<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.799> we<00:04:22.490> are<00:04:22.520> they<00:04:22.760> get<00:04:22.910> product

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
have a world and we are they get product

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.870 
have a world and we are they get product
that<00:04:23.570> wraps<00:04:23.810> around<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.380> drum<00:04:24.650> or<00:04:25.070> plugs<00:04:25.640> the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
that wraps around the drum or plugs the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.950 
that wraps around the drum or plugs the
corners<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.650> again<00:04:27.650> it's<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:29.150> disturbs<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
corners and again it's it disturbs the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.770 
corners and again it's it disturbs the
product<00:04:30.350> flow<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:30.830> therefore<00:04:31.010> lowers<00:04:31.520> your

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
product flow and therefore lowers your

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.920 
product flow and therefore lowers your
efficiency<00:04:33.820> okay<00:04:34.820> so<00:04:34.880> here<00:04:35.360> we're<00:04:35.510> looking<00:04:35.630> at

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
efficiency okay so here we're looking at

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.860 
efficiency okay so here we're looking at
what<00:04:36.140> I<00:04:36.169> call<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.590> faceplate<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.600> it's<00:04:38.600> part

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
what I call the faceplate and it's part

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.600 
what I call the faceplate and it's part
of<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.080> feeder<00:04:39.320> house<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:39.830> is<00:04:40.160> the

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
of the feeder house and is the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.480 
of the feeder house and is the
connection<00:04:41.260> to<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.410> pickup<00:04:42.680> header<00:04:43.160> or

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
connection to the pickup header or

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.600 
connection to the pickup header or
straight<00:04:43.880> cut<00:04:44.060> header<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:45.220> basically<00:04:46.220> what

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
straight cut header and basically what

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.760 
straight cut header and basically what
is<00:04:46.730> very<00:04:46.970> important<00:04:47.450> about<00:04:47.540> this<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.200> we<00:04:48.740> can

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
is very important about this is we can

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.290 
is very important about this is we can
change<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:50.210> angle<00:04:50.240> now<00:04:51.820> when<00:04:52.820> we<00:04:52.940> change<00:04:53.210> the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
change the angle now when we change the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.200 
change the angle now when we change the
angle<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:53.840> this<00:04:54.140> we<00:04:54.770> basically<00:04:55.370> change<00:04:56.000> the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
angle of this we basically change the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.659 
angle of this we basically change the
angle<00:04:56.510> of<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:56.720> feederhouse<00:04:57.140> when<00:04:58.130> our

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
angle of the feederhouse when our

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.900 
angle of the feederhouse when our
especially<00:04:59.480> pickup<00:04:59.930> header<00:05:00.110> hits<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.530> ground

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
especially pickup header hits the ground

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.710 
especially pickup header hits the ground
that<00:05:01.910> means<00:05:02.150> we<00:05:03.080> imagined<00:05:04.000> this<00:05:05.000> is<00:05:05.300> tilted

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
that means we imagined this is tilted

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.680 
that means we imagined this is tilted
back<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:06.620> means<00:05:06.860> your<00:05:07.310> arms<00:05:07.610> tilted<00:05:08.060> back<00:05:08.270> if

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
back that means your arms tilted back if

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.380 
back that means your arms tilted back if
this<00:05:08.990> is<00:05:09.140> tilted<00:05:09.590> forward<00:05:10.100> or<00:05:10.669> arms<00:05:11.150> tilt

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
this is tilted forward or arms tilt

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.750 
this is tilted forward or arms tilt
afford<00:05:11.810> now<00:05:12.320> if<00:05:12.590> our<00:05:12.680> fingertips<00:05:13.160> had<00:05:13.640> the

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
afford now if our fingertips had the

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.110 
afford now if our fingertips had the
pickup<00:05:14.090> belts<00:05:14.479> on<00:05:14.660> it<00:05:14.840> then<00:05:15.620> this<00:05:16.580> tilted

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
pickup belts on it then this tilted

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.020 
pickup belts on it then this tilted
forward<00:05:17.620> means<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.860> pickup<00:05:19.190> belts<00:05:19.550> hit<00:05:19.850> the

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
forward means the pickup belts hit the

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.260 
forward means the pickup belts hit the
ground<00:05:20.270> earlier<00:05:20.810> then<00:05:21.770> they<00:05:22.370> would<00:05:22.700> with<00:05:23.090> this

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
ground earlier then they would with this

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.020 
ground earlier then they would with this
tilted<00:05:23.720> back<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.290> the<00:05:24.770> feet<00:05:24.950> I<00:05:24.979> was<00:05:25.280> always<00:05:25.580> at

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
tilted back and the feet I was always at

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.630 
tilted back and the feet I was always at
the<00:05:26.180> same<00:05:26.419> height<00:05:27.280> this<00:05:28.280> is<00:05:28.310> why<00:05:29.210> we<00:05:29.840> want<00:05:30.110> to

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
the same height this is why we want to

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.659 
the same height this is why we want to
tilt<00:05:31.640> this<00:05:31.910> forward<00:05:32.419> as<00:05:32.780> much<00:05:33.140> as<00:05:33.290> possible

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
tilt this forward as much as possible

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.239 
tilt this forward as much as possible
not<00:05:35.569> as<00:05:35.719> much<00:05:35.870> as<00:05:35.930> possible<00:05:36.590> there<00:05:36.770> is<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:36.949> limit

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:37.249 
not as much as possible there is a limit

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.570 
not as much as possible there is a limit
to<00:05:37.280> it<00:05:37.430> but<00:05:38.349> fairly<00:05:39.349> far<00:05:39.710> forward<00:05:40.189> because

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
to it but fairly far forward because

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.850 
to it but fairly far forward because
then<00:05:40.909> we<00:05:41.449> keep<00:05:41.659> our<00:05:41.840> feet<00:05:42.139> our<00:05:42.259> house<00:05:42.379> fairly

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
then we keep our feet our house fairly

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.550 
then we keep our feet our house fairly
level<00:05:43.069> and<00:05:43.810> product<00:05:44.810> that<00:05:44.990> tends<00:05:45.199> to<00:05:45.289> fall

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
level and product that tends to fall

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.369 
level and product that tends to fall
apart<00:05:46.249> on<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.610> touch<00:05:46.819> like<00:05:47.330> canola<00:05:47.960> when<00:05:48.229> it's

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:48.379 
apart on the touch like canola when it's

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.100 
apart on the touch like canola when it's
dry<00:05:48.680> you<00:05:48.949> can<00:05:49.370> actually<00:05:49.819> convey<00:05:50.479> much<00:05:50.779> better

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
dry you can actually convey much better

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.339 
dry you can actually convey much better
and<00:05:51.319> quicker<00:05:51.499> and<00:05:52.090> if<00:05:53.090> it<00:05:53.360> was<00:05:53.599> to<00:05:53.840> fall<00:05:54.050> apart

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
and quicker and if it was to fall apart

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.769 
and quicker and if it was to fall apart
it<00:05:54.620> doesn't<00:05:54.949> just<00:05:55.069> all<00:05:55.279> roll<00:05:56.029> down<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.509> slope

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:56.779 
it doesn't just all roll down the slope

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.040 
it doesn't just all roll down the slope
and<00:05:57.460> again<00:05:58.460> product<00:05:58.969> flow<00:05:59.240> into<00:05:59.599> the<00:05:59.689> machine

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
and again product flow into the machine

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.010 
and again product flow into the machine
is<00:06:00.229> always<00:06:00.409> important<00:06:01.069> and<00:06:01.279> so<00:06:02.029> when<00:06:02.719> you<00:06:02.810> have

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
is always important and so when you have

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.649 
is always important and so when you have
low<00:06:03.289> angles<00:06:03.830> you<00:06:04.610> can<00:06:04.939> imagine<00:06:05.419> you<00:06:05.479> don't

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
low angles you can imagine you don't

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.279 
low angles you can imagine you don't
have<00:06:05.810> to<00:06:06.020> pull<00:06:06.469> it<00:06:06.499> up<00:06:06.740> it<00:06:07.189> just<00:06:07.550> flows<00:06:08.289> nicely

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
have to pull it up it just flows nicely

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.189 
have to pull it up it just flows nicely
into<00:06:09.710> the<00:06:09.800> machine<00:06:10.479> what<00:06:11.479> we<00:06:11.599> also<00:06:11.750> want<00:06:11.960> to

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
into the machine what we also want to

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.230 
into the machine what we also want to
look<00:06:12.379> at<00:06:12.590> here<00:06:12.830> is<00:06:13.099> the<00:06:13.310> theater<00:06:13.610> house<00:06:13.789> speed

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
look at here is the theater house speed

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.179 
look at here is the theater house speed
according<00:06:14.779> to<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:15.020> product<00:06:15.439> you<00:06:15.529> have<00:06:15.620> you

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:16.189 
according to the product you have you

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.779 
according to the product you have you
need<00:06:16.430> to<00:06:16.580> speed<00:06:16.939> up<00:06:16.969> or<00:06:17.300> slow<00:06:17.360> down<00:06:17.840> your<00:06:18.409> house

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
need to speed up or slow down your house

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.339 
need to speed up or slow down your house
what<00:06:19.789> that<00:06:19.969> also<00:06:20.150> does<00:06:20.389> is<00:06:20.870> it<00:06:21.110> slightly

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
what that also does is it slightly

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.890 
what that also does is it slightly
changes<00:06:21.979> the<00:06:22.129> torque<00:06:22.430> so<00:06:23.060> when<00:06:23.240> you<00:06:23.330> go<00:06:23.479> slow

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
changes the torque so when you go slow

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.230 
changes the torque so when you go slow
small<00:06:24.529> sprocket<00:06:25.099> you<00:06:25.580> get<00:06:25.759> a<00:06:25.789> little<00:06:26.089> more

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
small sprocket you get a little more

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.579 
small sprocket you get a little more
toward<00:06:26.569> go<00:06:27.289> big<00:06:27.560> big<00:06:28.219> sprocket<00:06:28.779> you<00:06:29.779> have<00:06:30.349> less

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:30.589 
toward go big big sprocket you have less

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:34.480 
toward go big big sprocket you have less
toy<00:06:30.919> however<00:06:31.699> most<00:06:32.569> products<00:06:33.439> require<00:06:34.129> a<00:06:34.159> high

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
toy however most products require a high

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.990 
toy however most products require a high
speed<00:06:34.909> that<00:06:35.569> prevents<00:06:36.490> flogging<00:06:37.490> as<00:06:38.089> well<00:06:38.419> as

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
speed that prevents flogging as well as

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.170 
speed that prevents flogging as well as
too<00:06:41.000> much<00:06:41.150> strain<00:06:41.569> on<00:06:41.599> the<00:06:41.930> feeder<00:06:42.139> chain<00:06:43.180> you

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
too much strain on the feeder chain you

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.829 
too much strain on the feeder chain you
do<00:06:44.330> have<00:06:44.569> a<00:06:44.599> slip<00:06:44.960> clutch<00:06:45.250> but<00:06:46.360> yeah<00:06:47.360> it<00:06:47.599> only

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:47.839 
do have a slip clutch but yeah it only

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:50.889 
do have a slip clutch but yeah it only
protects<00:06:48.469> to<00:06:48.680> a<00:06:48.710> point<00:06:48.979> and<00:06:49.729> eventually<00:06:50.659> with

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:50.899 
protects to a point and eventually with

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:53.320 
protects to a point and eventually with
the<00:06:51.169> adjustments<00:06:52.009> down<00:06:52.159> wrong<00:06:52.460> you<00:06:53.149> will

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
the adjustments down wrong you will

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.610 
the adjustments down wrong you will
either<00:06:53.509> break<00:06:53.899> your<00:06:54.110> chain<00:06:54.349> or<00:06:55.099> yeah<00:06:56.029> just

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
either break your chain or yeah just

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.430 
either break your chain or yeah just
like<00:06:57.620> the<00:06:57.830> med<00:06:58.039> machine<00:06:58.460> all<00:06:58.610> the<00:06:58.639> time

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
like the med machine all the time

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.280 
like the med machine all the time
and<00:06:59.590> so<00:07:00.220> we<00:07:00.490> need<00:07:00.820> to<00:07:00.970> make<00:07:01.150> sure<00:07:01.180> here<00:07:01.840> on<00:07:01.990> the

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.290 
and so we need to make sure here on the

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.070 
and so we need to make sure here on the

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
a small sprocket we cannot leave the

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.010 
a small sprocket we cannot leave the
guide<00:07:17.710> in<00:07:18.040> the<00:07:18.310> high<00:07:18.430> position<00:07:18.640> because<00:07:19.300> that

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.020 
guide in the high position because that

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.460 
guide in the high position because that
will<00:07:20.350> break<00:07:20.920> it<00:07:21.100> as<00:07:22.090> you<00:07:22.270> can<00:07:22.420> imagine<00:07:22.630> it<00:07:23.080> put

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470 
will break it as you can imagine it put

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.940 
will break it as you can imagine it put
a<00:07:23.500> steeper<00:07:24.400> angle<00:07:24.490> on<00:07:24.820> that<00:07:25.090> just<00:07:25.620> which<00:07:26.620> is<00:07:26.650> no

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:26.950 
a steeper angle on that just which is no

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.820 
a steeper angle on that just which is no
good<00:07:27.190> and<00:07:28.030> so<00:07:28.900> we<00:07:29.050> need<00:07:29.200> to<00:07:29.320> make<00:07:29.470> sure<00:07:29.530> we

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.830 
good and so we need to make sure we

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.330 
good and so we need to make sure we
change<00:07:30.100> that<00:07:30.720> okay<00:07:31.720> maybe<00:07:32.050> one<00:07:32.320> more<00:07:32.500> thing

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:33.340

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 
sometimes people point out that they

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:38.530 
lift their feet and drum up which you

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.370 
lift their feet and drum up which you
have<00:07:38.710> these<00:07:38.920> levers<00:07:39.340> on<00:07:39.490> the<00:07:39.610> side<00:07:39.820> for<00:07:40.120> um<00:07:40.990> but

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.380

what it basically does is it brings the

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.650 
what it basically does is it brings the
feeder<00:07:43.990> to<00:07:44.260> conveyor<00:07:44.620> chain<00:07:44.650> up<00:07:45.220> so<00:07:45.760> you<00:07:45.820> ya
