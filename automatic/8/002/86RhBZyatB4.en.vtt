00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:09.970
 hello good today I will explain how 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:14.050
 regulate the tps in the descent 135 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:17.350
 this is the tps that I'm pointing to 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:21.670
 tps has three cables down 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.040
 we click with pink pins and 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.650
 that is next that is black with 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.950
 yellow once we click it 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:34.110
 we put the tips of the tester and we put 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.110
 the tester in in 20 volts 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.970
 this has to give approximately 0 67 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.809
 goal being in contact with the bike only in 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:49.370
 contact him with the accelerator 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.210
 closed in the case of what 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.730
 there are not the values here we have a 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.660
 screw thor 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.440
 of 25 that screw is loosened and goes 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.470
 turning the tps until we find the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.330
 value here we are not here we show the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.740
 value that is in mine is 0 67 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:18.610
 what the tps does here is that I do not know 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.910
 the revolutions do not escape and when 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.980
 you walk the bike a lot that sometimes 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.620
 revolutions are going in turns and not 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.220
 they go down well when putting these values 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.980
 correct the motorcycle is good 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.680
 I hope you understand now we are going to 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.370
 regulate the mixing screw that is 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.370
 this one that is here 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.090
 well this has to be in three 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.659
 one and a half times what we do is 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.110
 turn it that screw until it reaches the 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.850
 background without squeezing once it arrived it 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.950
 it is rotating 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.659
 loosen half a turn and we already have 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 half a turn until you reach three 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.580
 and a half turns once we have the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.130
 three and a half turns and that's the value 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.130
 correct for low 135 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.619
 well let's unplug what 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.670
 and let's take out the needles 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.610
 yes
