00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
hey everyone thought I'd post up a

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.720 
hey everyone thought I'd post up a
comparison<00:00:09.599> video<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:10.110> know<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.130> lot<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.460> people

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
comparison video I know a lot of people

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.089 
comparison video I know a lot of people
are<00:00:12.179> kind<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.480> probably<00:00:12.750> wondering<00:00:13.110> what<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
are kind of probably wondering what the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.849 
are kind of probably wondering what the
main<00:00:14.340> differences<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.660> Chinese<00:00:16.619> knockoff

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
main differences of the Chinese knockoff

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.900 
main differences of the Chinese knockoff
mags<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.359> authentic<00:00:18.869> mags<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.910> compared

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
mags and the authentic mags and compared

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.540 
mags and the authentic mags and compared
to<00:00:20.970> even<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.330> how<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.840> can<00:00:22.020> mod<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
to even like how you can mod the the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.950 
to even like how you can mod the the
Chinese<00:00:23.939> knockoffs<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.510> make<00:00:24.630> them<00:00:24.779> more

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
Chinese knockoffs to make them more

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.109 
Chinese knockoffs to make them more
authentic<00:00:25.470> looking<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.670> thought<00:00:27.000> I'd<00:00:27.090> give

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
authentic looking but I thought I'd give

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.849 
authentic looking but I thought I'd give
you<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.420> little<00:00:27.630> comparison<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.560> how<00:00:28.680> they

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
you a little comparison of just how they

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.580 
you a little comparison of just how they
can<00:00:29.010> pick<00:00:29.220> how<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> knockoffs<00:00:30.420> compared<00:00:30.869> to

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
can pick how the knockoffs compared to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.930 
can pick how the knockoffs compared to
the<00:00:31.710> Authentics<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:33.270> right<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> box

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
the Authentics like right out of the box

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.220 
the Authentics like right out of the box
obviously<00:00:35.940> there's<00:00:36.630> things<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.930> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
obviously there's things that you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
obviously there's things that you
already<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.520> already<00:00:38.989> such<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:41.450> toast

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
already know already such as the toast

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.660 
already know already such as the toast
limine<00:00:43.040> the<00:00:44.040> e<00:00:44.070> L<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:45.600> LEDs<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.160> strap

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
limine the e L the LEDs the the strap

limine the e L the LEDs the the strap
not<00:00:47.879> lighting<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:49.350> lace<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:49.860> being

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
not lighting up the lace is not being

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490 
not lighting up the lace is not being
flattened<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.660> button<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.110> being<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
flattened the button not being in the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610 
flattened the button not being in the
right<00:00:52.620> place<00:00:53.840> but<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.899> thought<00:00:55.050> also<00:00:55.350> give<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
right place but I thought also give you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.760 
right place but I thought also give you
kind<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.480> idea<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> how<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:58.109> compare<00:00:58.530> just

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
kind of a idea of how they compare just

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.040 
kind of a idea of how they compare just
and<00:00:59.609> how<00:00:59.760> they're<00:00:59.910> made<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> fabrics

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and how they're made like the fabrics

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.479 
and how they're made like the fabrics
used<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.390> other<00:01:03.510> things<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
used the other things you like the

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.070 
used the other things you like the
midsole<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:08.630> Authentics<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.810> very

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
midsole here on the Authentics it's very

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.570 
midsole here on the Authentics it's very
spongy<00:01:10.820> much<00:01:11.820> more<00:01:12.060> spongy<00:01:12.540> than<00:01:13.010> then<00:01:14.010> these

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
spongy much more spongy than then these

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
spongy much more spongy than then these
this<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> more<00:01:15.689> rubbery<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> fabric

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
this is the more rubbery and the fabric

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200 
this is the more rubbery and the fabric
on<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> Authentics<00:01:19.580> is<00:01:20.580> almost<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
on the Authentics is almost like a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.280 
on the Authentics is almost like a
chainmail

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
chainmail

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.620 
chainmail
type<00:01:23.150> fabric<00:01:24.150> coming<00:01:24.330> good<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.390> got<00:01:27.509> like

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
type fabric coming good so it's got like

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.460 
type fabric coming good so it's got like
a<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.810> bit<00:01:27.990> more<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.939> that's<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:31.170> only

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
a little bit more of a that's the only

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
a little bit more of a that's the only
way<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:32.009> describe<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> chainmail<00:01:33.659> like

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
way I would describe is a chainmail like

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.370 
way I would describe is a chainmail like
much<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.420> smooth<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.590> also<00:01:39.380> I'm

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
much you know very smooth but also I'm

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.999 
much you know very smooth but also I'm
not<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.799> interesting<00:01:41.490> fabric<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.829> one

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
not just interesting fabric and the one

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.120 
not just interesting fabric and the one
on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> knockoff<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.780> ribbed<00:01:47.899> nylon

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
on the knockoff is just a ribbed nylon

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.179 
on the knockoff is just a ribbed nylon
it<00:01:50.420> doesn't<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.509> give<00:01:51.750> much<00:01:52.189> doesn't

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
it doesn't really give much doesn't

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.770 
it doesn't really give much doesn't
stretch<00:01:54.500> since<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.799> whole<00:01:56.250> shoe<00:01:56.780> even

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
stretch since the whole shoe even

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.179 
stretch since the whole shoe even
Authentics<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:59.630> like<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> shell<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.860> know<00:02:01.920> very

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
Authentics is like a shell you know very

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.010 
Authentics is like a shell you know very
much<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.509> probably

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
much like this one it's a probably

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.889 
much like this one it's a probably
almost<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.409> same<00:02:05.119> under<00:02:06.119> material<00:02:06.630> this

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
almost the same under material this

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.869 
almost the same under material this
feels<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.229> little<00:02:07.259> bit<00:02:07.500> more<00:02:07.560> spongy<00:02:08.220> up<00:02:08.489> here

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
feels a little bit more spongy up here

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.710 
feels a little bit more spongy up here
than<00:02:09.179> missed

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
than missed

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.710 
than missed
this<00:02:10.229> feels<00:02:10.470> much<00:02:10.650> more<00:02:10.890> rigid<00:02:11.540> that's<00:02:12.540> right

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
this feels much more rigid that's right

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.780 
this feels much more rigid that's right
keeps<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.140> on<00:02:13.200> focus<00:02:18.950> but<00:02:19.950> things<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.400> you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
keeps going on focus but things like you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.920 
keeps going on focus but things like you
know<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> leather<00:02:22.520> tongue<00:02:23.750> versus<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
know this is a leather tongue versus the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.800 
know this is a leather tongue versus the
fabric<00:02:25.590> tongue<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:28.320> know<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.590> guess<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
fabric tongue you know I guess a the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.020 
fabric tongue you know I guess a the
strap<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:32.670> done<00:02:32.970> pretty<00:02:33.210> well<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:34.470> this

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
strap is done pretty well on on this

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.860 
strap is done pretty well on on this
compared<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.210> Authentics<00:02:37.610> it's

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
compared to the Authentics it's

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.270 
compared to the Authentics it's
obviously<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:40.050> don't<00:02:40.620> get<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.800> light<00:02:40.980> up<00:02:41.130> but

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
obviously we don't get the light up but

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.410 
obviously we don't get the light up but
it's<00:02:41.430> still<00:02:41.970> done<00:02:42.210> pretty<00:02:42.420> well<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.410> laces

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
it's still done pretty well the laces

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.880 
it's still done pretty well the laces
are<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.480> bit<00:02:45.660> thicker<00:02:46.850> on<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.260> knockoffs<00:02:49.260> then

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
are a bit thicker on the knockoffs then

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.220 
are a bit thicker on the knockoffs then
the<00:02:50.010> Authentics<00:02:50.460> just<00:02:50.790> very<00:02:51.180> slightly<00:02:51.630> and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the Authentics just very slightly and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.690 
the Authentics just very slightly and
they're<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.950> little<00:02:53.160> bit<00:02:53.340> different<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.090> a

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
they're just a little bit different of a

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.870 
they're just a little bit different of a
the<00:02:56.700> type<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:58.220> elastic<00:03:01.400> other<00:03:02.400> things<00:03:02.670> like

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
the type of elastic other things like

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.450 
the type of elastic other things like
the<00:03:03.150> stitching<00:03:04.050> where<00:03:04.650> they<00:03:04.770> have<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> where

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
the stitching where they have a where

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.090 
the stitching where they have a where
they<00:03:05.610> did<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.390> stitching<00:03:07.050> together<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.950> is

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
they did the stitching together this is

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.280 
they did the stitching together this is
after<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.460> first<00:03:08.670> lace<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.630> Authentics

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
after the first lace on the Authentics

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.060 
after the first lace on the Authentics
it's<00:03:11.250> after<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.670> second<00:03:12.060> lace<00:03:13.070> what's

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
it's after the second lace what's

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.920 
it's after the second lace what's
interesting<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.580> they<00:03:14.700> there's<00:03:15.330> all<00:03:15.660> mostly<00:03:15.900> a

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
interesting is they there's all mostly a

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.120 
interesting is they there's all mostly a
little<00:03:16.170> bit<00:03:16.290> cleaner<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.400> stitch<00:03:17.640> line<00:03:18.020> then

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
little bit cleaner of a stitch line then

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.310 
little bit cleaner of a stitch line then
on<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.250> Authentics<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:23.850> know<00:03:24.140> it's<00:03:25.140> kind

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
on the Authentics and you know it's kind

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.140 
on the Authentics and you know it's kind
of<00:03:25.380> tuned<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.650> have<00:03:25.860> how<00:03:26.370> they<00:03:26.520> kind<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:27.000> got

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
of tuned you have how they kind of got

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.020 
of tuned you have how they kind of got
certain<00:03:27.600> things<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.870> little<00:03:27.959> bit<00:03:28.170> better<00:03:29.030> but

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
certain things a little bit better but

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.630 
certain things a little bit better but
now<00:03:30.180> think<00:03:30.450> takes<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:32.390> icy<00:03:33.390> souls<00:03:34.459> they<00:03:35.459> don't

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
now think takes the icy souls they don't

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.520 
now think takes the icy souls they don't
protrude<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.180> all<00:03:36.300> like<00:03:36.630> even<00:03:36.900> on<00:03:36.989> these<00:03:37.230> on

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
protrude it all like even on these on

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.000 
protrude it all like even on these on
the<00:03:38.430> Authentics<00:03:39.030> on<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.390> inside<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.890> have

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
the Authentics on the inside you have

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.479 
the Authentics on the inside you have
like<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.370> little<00:03:42.090> bit<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.450> protrusion<00:03:43.489> they

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
like a little bit of a protrusion they

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.090 
like a little bit of a protrusion they
stick<00:03:44.760> out<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:44.940> little<00:03:45.180> bit<00:03:45.390> more<00:03:45.680> around<00:03:46.680> here

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
stick out a little bit more around here

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.910 
stick out a little bit more around here
they're<00:03:47.430> just<00:03:47.459> completely<00:03:48.209> concaved

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.090 

he'll<00:03:53.870> drop<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.080> lights<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:57.480> heel<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.739> pretty

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
he'll drop the lights the heel is pretty

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.360 
he'll drop the lights the heel is pretty
close<00:03:59.550> but<00:04:00.269> still<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:01.620> one<00:04:01.860> sticks<00:04:02.190> out<00:04:02.310> a

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
close but still this one sticks out a

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.780 
close but still this one sticks out a
little<00:04:02.489> bit<00:04:02.760> further<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.180> this<00:04:03.600> side<00:04:03.870> and

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
little bit further on this side and

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.690 
little bit further on this side and
maybe<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:06.060> this<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.420> endi<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:08.310> bottom

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
maybe on this and endi the bottom

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.120 
maybe on this and endi the bottom
midsole<00:04:09.470> there's<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.530> little<00:04:10.709> bit<00:04:10.860> steadier

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
midsole there's a little bit steadier

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.349 
midsole there's a little bit steadier
and<00:04:11.880> here<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.239> hear<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:15.140> logo<00:04:16.140> on<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.320> back

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
and here to hear the logo on the back

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.379 
and here to hear the logo on the back
is<00:04:18.019> slightly<00:04:18.500> smaller<00:04:20.799> on<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:22.159> on<00:04:22.389> the

is slightly smaller on the on the

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.129 
is slightly smaller on the on the
knock-offs

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139

the ankle bubble doesn't protrude at all
it<00:04:31.819> does<00:04:32.120> on<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.330> Authentics<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.860> as<00:04:37.219> we

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
it does on the Authentics and as we

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.929 
it does on the Authentics and as we
stated<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:39.080> delights<00:04:40.069> but<00:04:40.879> um<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:42.610> swoosh<00:04:43.610> is

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:43.939 
stated the delights but um the swoosh is

stated the delights but um the swoosh is
a<00:04:44.000> bit<00:04:44.419> fatter<00:04:45.729> it's<00:04:46.729> not<00:04:46.879> too<00:04:47.300> bad<00:04:47.599> but<00:04:47.990> still

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
a bit fatter it's not too bad but still

a bit fatter it's not too bad but still
it's<00:04:49.280> not<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:50.210> know<00:04:50.300> they<00:04:50.509> could<00:04:50.689> have<00:04:50.779> got

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
it's not you know they could have got

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.929 
it's not you know they could have got
that<00:04:51.080> closer<00:04:51.379> though<00:04:52.129> there's<00:04:52.460> no<00:04:52.610> reason<00:04:52.819> why

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:52.939 
that closer though there's no reason why

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.420 
that closer though there's no reason why
they<00:04:53.060> couldn't<00:04:53.240> have<00:04:53.419> got<00:04:53.750> that<00:04:53.930> better<00:04:54.430> I'm

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
they couldn't have got that better I'm

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.510 
they couldn't have got that better I'm
actually<00:04:55.639> really<00:04:55.879> happy<00:04:56.150> with<00:04:56.539> with<00:04:57.139> the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
actually really happy with with the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.570 
actually really happy with with the
ankle<00:04:58.840> buckle<00:04:59.979> however<00:05:00.979> you<00:05:01.039> want<00:05:01.189> to<00:05:01.250> call<00:05:01.400> it

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
ankle buckle however you want to call it

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.260 
ankle buckle however you want to call it
it's<00:05:01.939> pretty<00:05:02.300> close<00:05:02.659> there<00:05:03.110> are<00:05:03.199> some<00:05:04.270> some

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
it's pretty close there are some some

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.420 
it's pretty close there are some some
things<00:05:05.449> that<00:05:05.629> are<00:05:05.719> not<00:05:05.900> 100%<00:05:06.860> but<00:05:07.039> they<00:05:07.250> got

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
things that are not 100% but they got

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.529 
things that are not 100% but they got
pretty<00:05:08.000> well<00:05:08.439> you<00:05:09.439> will<00:05:09.620> then<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:10.729> stitching

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
pretty well you will then the stitching

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.110 
pretty well you will then the stitching
obviously<00:05:12.020> is<00:05:12.139> horrible<00:05:12.620> in<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:13.009> sense<00:05:13.250> of<00:05:13.400> it

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
obviously is horrible in the sense of it

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.700 
obviously is horrible in the sense of it
stitched<00:05:14.509> together<00:05:15.020> really<00:05:15.409> well

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
stitched together really well

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.339 
stitched together really well
it's<00:05:15.979> just<00:05:16.219> you<00:05:16.849> there<00:05:17.330> is<00:05:17.419> no<00:05:17.569> stitching<00:05:17.779> my

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
it's just you there is no stitching my

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.969 
it's just you there is no stitching my
Authentics<00:05:18.919> and<00:05:19.689> you<00:05:20.689> don't<00:05:20.900> see<00:05:21.110> stitching

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
Authentics and you don't see stitching

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.749 
Authentics and you don't see stitching
anywhere<00:05:22.490> on<00:05:22.789> the<00:05:23.060> Authentics<00:05:24.430> here<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.610> see

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
anywhere on the Authentics here you see

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:31.059 
anywhere on the Authentics here you see
it<00:05:25.849> all<00:05:25.940> over<00:05:28.930> other<00:05:29.930> than<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.259> the<00:05:30.589> shape<00:05:30.889> is

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
it all over other than that the shape is

time<00:06:58.599> and<00:06:59.599> I<00:06:59.690> try<00:06:59.990> I<00:07:00.199> don't<00:07:00.440> really<00:07:00.590> even<00:07:00.770> keep

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 
time and I try I don't really even keep

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.659 
time and I try I don't really even keep
these<00:07:01.160> often<00:07:01.370> in<00:07:01.699> in<00:07:02.479> the<00:07:03.199> light<00:07:03.680> at<00:07:03.830> all<00:07:03.949> so

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669 
these often in in the light at all so

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.680 
these often in in the light at all so
and<00:07:05.300> he's<00:07:06.050> never<00:07:06.289> seen<00:07:06.560> do<00:07:07.070> you<00:07:07.160> like<00:07:07.690> but

and he's never seen do you like but

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.499 
and he's never seen do you like but
anyways<00:07:09.849> that<00:07:10.849> people<00:07:11.090> would<00:07:11.210> want<00:07:11.240> to<00:07:11.419> know

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:11.509 
anyways that people would want to know

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.980 
anyways that people would want to know
what<00:07:11.900> the<00:07:12.110> differences<00:07:13.039> are<00:07:13.220> and<00:07:13.630> just<00:07:14.630> kind

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:14.990 
what the differences are and just kind

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.170 
what the differences are and just kind
of<00:07:15.020> how<00:07:15.169> they<00:07:15.349> compare<00:07:15.710> I'd<00:07:16.639> say<00:07:16.849> for<00:07:17.060> the<00:07:17.090> most

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180 
of how they compare I'd say for the most

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.300 
of how they compare I'd say for the most
part<00:07:17.539> these<00:07:17.810> are<00:07:18.050> you<00:07:18.560> know<00:07:18.620> out<00:07:18.949> of<00:07:19.009> the<00:07:19.099> box

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310 
part these are you know out of the box

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.439 
part these are you know out of the box
there<00:07:19.789> are<00:07:20.259> 60%<00:07:21.259> close<00:07:22.130> I<00:07:22.430> think<00:07:23.300> with<00:07:23.419> a

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:23.449 
there are 60% close I think with a

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:24.999 
there are 60% close I think with a
little<00:07:23.750> bit<00:07:23.870> of<00:07:23.990> time<00:07:24.320> and<00:07:24.560> patience<00:07:24.889> and

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:25.009 
little bit of time and patience and

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:28.900 
little bit of time and patience and
money<00:07:25.220> you<00:07:25.400> can<00:07:25.610> make<00:07:25.880> them<00:07:26.800> 99<00:07:27.800> well<00:07:28.639> five

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:28.910 
money you can make them 99 well five

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.159 
money you can make them 99 well five
ninety<00:07:29.210> five<00:07:29.300> percent<00:07:29.509> close<00:07:29.840> so<00:07:30.970> and<00:07:32.169> people

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
ninety five percent close so and people

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:35.320 
ninety five percent close so and people
don't<00:07:33.320> even<00:07:33.470> know<00:07:33.710> that<00:07:33.740> these<00:07:34.010> are<00:07:34.220> not<00:07:34.460> the

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330
