00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.760
 hello, everybody decided to take another one off 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.849
 video in this video let's say let's say so 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.139
 creation experience 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.900
 knife do it yourself is my first experience 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.350
 work in general with metal as such in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.090
 in such volumes, moreover, we are 1 job 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.279
 experience with high speed steel brand 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.529
 High-speed steels I will lay out in the description 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.920
 video 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.340
 Here I did such a knife 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.320
 Of course there are a lot of tanks here. 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.390
 principle and I myself see the first block this 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.329
 of course i burned the cutting edge here 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.670
 because of the tools unfortunately 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.059
 only cheap sharpener and screwdriver 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.309
 so that's what I did 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.780
 the form of slavery was taken as a basis 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.809
 alpha hunter mini 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.890
 but for some reason I liked the node 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.979
 his feet were made such legs of steel 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.510
 here from the blade the myth is still saudi 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:18.479
 notation is attached below because i'm 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:21.330
 they don't really mean that 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.790
 wanted to point out about this knife if 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.369
 honestly the knife turned out enough for me 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.030
 cool despite a lot of different 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.240
 shortcomings that is not quite 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:38.939
 downhill the same turned out to something 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:41.549
 Unfortunately, not exactly exactly bred 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:47.040
 descending into this most likely because of this 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:49.619
 here are knife shapes 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.860
 because unfortunately not even descents 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:02:01.979
 I have already been installed after sharpening 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:04.890
 sharpened and that's 35 degrees in principle 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.600
 already I spent quite a lot here 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.099
 literally yesterday peretochil already 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.280
 sewage with exact fixation year savik then 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.280
 there is 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:26.780
 well enough cuts principle even 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.780
 I almost have two fingers 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:35.330
 he chains everything he found good without 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.940
 without any lint 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.830
 so much principle is very good but minus 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.630
 this little table is that it 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:51.209
 On 1 very strongly in the second the fact that 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.670
 given so much first of all she is very 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.920
 heavy in handling especially if someone 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.470
 decide to make yourself the first knife then I 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.630
 Of course a little drowned that I took 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.030
 it was necessary to take some more easy 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.840
 100 because what was steamed by 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.500
 Internet it became fast cut made of 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.450
 such as with Artyomovskaya table 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:22.109
 which is not only high strength no 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:25.410
 presumably 6263 rockwell but she 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.870
 and another one on the plus good enough 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.970
 hardened that is here here even i don't 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.459
 I was able to shoot who was probably shooting one 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.310
 downhill did approximately one day 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.049
 three in a row for a few hours because 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.600
 I was really overheated 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.920
 There is but not that there on millimeter 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.190
 filmed memory 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.500
 well, it was just a murder 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:56.549
 some but I finished him off let's say so though 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.069
 let's say in the heat of the heat 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:03.209
 here it is of course I burned cutting here 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.880
 the edge but had to be like this 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:10.400
 film to make but nevertheless this new 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.400
 seemed to do for nature 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.690
 boards tore and meat cut tomatoes if 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.570
 honestly, well, that he rusts it of course 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.630
 yes it is god god he is good now 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.180
 I think maybe try it for harrow 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.790
 where are n't you anything but to this I still 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.130
 until I came here so small 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.710
 review honestly as a worker can he 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.590
 I really liked the sharpening he keeps 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.100
 just great of course your own 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.950
 features in high-speed steel 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.340
 moments of use but that angle 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.790
 which I chose 35 degrees to 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.780
 The initial 40 is now 30 40 degrees 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.890
 before it drove long enough not 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.290
 looking at that 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:03.690
 Well, how did you come to the company? 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.030
 kebabs everything else there said that he 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.890
 did he did can give it 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:15.510
 Well, unfortunately, there was no 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:17.730
 let's say such video recording we are above it 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.710
 mocked very well of course but those 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:24.270
 no less did he really survive really 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.820
 works as a working man he is very me 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.229
 like it though it can be visually 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.540
 someone does not like 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.570
 in this i repeat this is my first 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.000
 a knife from my tools in this 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.370
 the time period was only a screwdriver 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.169
 and cheap then man who 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.510
 shimmer literally in 5 minutes 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.600
 work and with standard disks 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.970
 nickname no diamond there either else 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.060
 some in me was not all the more for 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:57.150
 Indira here but nevertheless finished him off and 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.520
 pretty pleased with this here if there is 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.680
 what suggestion is there remarks sneakers 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.470
