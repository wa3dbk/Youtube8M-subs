but or you can just use completely flat

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.850 
but or you can just use completely flat
also<00:02:43.300> but<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.390> doesn't<00:02:44.690> look<00:02:44.780> as<00:02:44.990> good<00:02:46.660> um<00:02:47.860> so

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
also but it doesn't look as good um so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.140 
also but it doesn't look as good um so
what<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.100> do<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.250> place<00:02:49.730> them<00:02:49.970> on<00:02:51.340> like<00:02:52.340> this

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
what you do is place them on like this

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:09.310 
what you do is place them on like this
all<00:02:56.350> along<00:02:57.350> all<00:02:57.740> along<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.270> then<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:08.320> eat

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
all along all along it and then you eat

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.100 
all along all along it and then you eat
one<00:03:09.650> should<00:03:09.890> have<00:03:10.420> six<00:03:11.420> on<00:03:11.660> them<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:14.660> can<00:03:14.930> use

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
one should have six on them you can use

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.200 
one should have six on them you can use
different<00:03:15.350> size<00:03:15.800> but<00:03:16.220> this<00:03:16.490> is<00:03:16.670> good<00:03:16.820> but<00:03:16.940> it's

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
different size but this is good but it's

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.960
