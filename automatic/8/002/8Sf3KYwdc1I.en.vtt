and<00:00:10.530> now<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:10.830> come<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.429> very<00:00:11.960> exciting<00:00:12.960> piece

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
and now we come to a very exciting piece

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.129 
and now we come to a very exciting piece
of<00:00:13.349> technology<00:00:13.980> within<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.610> xc2<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.900> called

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
of technology within the xc2 it's called

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.109 
of technology within the xc2 it's called
the<00:00:16.289> lens<00:00:16.529> modulation<00:00:17.190> optimizer

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the lens modulation optimizer

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.939 
the lens modulation optimizer
and<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.359> might<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.810> seen<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.230> before<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
and you might have seen it before in the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.230 
and you might have seen it before in the
x100s<00:00:21.109> but<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.830> case<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.580> got<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> do<00:00:24.029> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
x100s but in this case it's got to do a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.529 
x100s but in this case it's got to do a
whole<00:00:24.390> lot<00:00:24.630> more<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.070> exactly<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.150> LM

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
whole lot more so what exactly is the LM

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.179 
whole lot more so what exactly is the LM
oh<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.019> have<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.310> Ken<00:00:30.179> Hayashi<00:00:30.599> father<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.890> the

perfect<00:00:52.110> example<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.829> why<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.420> want<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.199> have

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
perfect example of why you want to have

the<00:00:55.800> lens<00:00:56.010> modulation<00:00:56.579> optimizer<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:58.050> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the lens modulation optimizer it's a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.380 
the lens modulation optimizer it's a
landscape<00:00:58.559> scene<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.550> naturally<00:01:00.000> you'd<00:01:00.210> be

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
landscape scene but naturally you'd be

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.110 
landscape scene but naturally you'd be
using<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.780> small<00:01:01.109> aperture<00:01:01.730> with<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> small

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
using a small aperture with a small

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.630 
using a small aperture with a small
aperture<00:01:03.589> you<00:01:04.589> think<00:01:04.949> you're<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
aperture you think you're going to get a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.760 
aperture you think you're going to get a
greater<00:01:06.030> depth<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.420> field<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.110> therefore

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
greater depth of field and therefore

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.190 
greater depth of field and therefore
more<00:01:08.100> detail<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> greater<00:01:09.930> depth

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
more detail you do get the greater depth

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.590 
more detail you do get the greater depth
of<00:01:10.320> field<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.130> actually<00:01:11.430> lose<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> lot<00:01:12.570> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
of field but you actually lose a lot of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
of field but you actually lose a lot of
fine<00:01:12.900> detail<00:01:12.930> due<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.040> an<00:01:14.130> effect<00:01:14.250> called

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
fine detail due to an effect called

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.679 
fine detail due to an effect called
diffraction<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.979> fraction<00:01:17.430> occurs<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
diffraction the fraction occurs as the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.020 
diffraction the fraction occurs as the
light<00:01:19.170> passes<00:01:19.770> through<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.070> aperture<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
light passes through the aperture and of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.910 
light passes through the aperture and of
course<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> smaller<00:01:21.780> aperture<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.650> greater

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
course the smaller aperture the greater

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
course the smaller aperture the greater
the<00:01:23.130> diffraction<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.150> greater<00:01:24.420> your

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the diffraction and the greater your

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 
the diffraction and the greater your
loss<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.170> fine<00:01:25.409> detail<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> picture<00:01:27.030> like

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
loss of fine detail so in a picture like

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.749 
loss of fine detail so in a picture like
this<00:01:27.409> where<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.710> your<00:01:28.860> fine<00:01:29.340> detail

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
this where you have your fine detail

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.640 
this where you have your fine detail
such<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.270> aerials<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.960> spires<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.560> the

such as the aerials and spires in the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.249 
such as the aerials and spires in the
image<00:01:31.890> you'll<00:01:32.490> find<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.939> tends<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.630> soften

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
image you'll find that tends to soften

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.830 
image you'll find that tends to soften
sometimes<00:01:34.920> even<00:01:35.250> fade<00:01:35.490> away<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.600> lens

modulation optimizer has brought this
back<00:01:39.680> it's<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.799> unique<00:01:41.159> feature<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.790> it's

back it's a unique feature and it's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.539 
back it's a unique feature and it's
something<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.110> as<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.770> said<00:01:43.829> work<00:01:44.220> very<00:01:44.490> well

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
something that as I said work very well

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.230 
something that as I said work very well
in<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.850> x100s<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> xc2<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.700> has<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.149> be

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
in the x100s but in the xc2 it has to be

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.139 
in the x100s but in the xc2 it has to be
customized<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.259> each<00:01:49.350> lens<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.790> fitted
