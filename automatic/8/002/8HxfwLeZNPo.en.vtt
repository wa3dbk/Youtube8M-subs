00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.970
 the little ivo plays to make the bold 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.980
 with her new right calender her sister 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.450
 greater yaris certainly does not remain a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.460
 look and allow yourself a nice restyling 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 half career that brings more Libya 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 aggressive and sharp and look a little 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.640
 also a new grille on the right from outside 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.109
 it might seem like a simple restyling 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.210
 but in reality they have invested in toyota 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.670
 85 million euros in this 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.630
 facelift redesigning from zero more than 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.269
 thousand components 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.830
 the purpose is to improve design 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.809
 but also the pleasure of driving e 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.260
 efficiency let's see how it is 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.260
 changed 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.610
 beyond outside where new ones arrive 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.360
 more LED headlights and color combinations 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.250
 whimsical 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.050
 the material interiors also change 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.330
 soft touch unpublished larger display e 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.000
 Japanese technician redesigned dashboard 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.160
 they have also made substantial interventions 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.050
 but redesigning the shock absorbers e 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.270
 power steering but also improving 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.550
 the overall soundproofing with 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.500
 thicker sound absorbing materials e 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.809
 installing new gaskets ei 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.940
 results are heard because at the wheel 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.220
 of yaris restyling you travel wrapped 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.120
 in a really unusual silence on 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.120
 a car of this category 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.300
 the renewed three-cylinder thousand petrol engine 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.460
 it's a real gem 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.770
 certainly not an engine with smoking wheels 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.690
 at the traffic light but is meant to consume 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.450
 little and keeps the promises is 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.160
 incredibly elastic and already 50 km goes 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.050
 there you can graft the fifth like 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.119
 suggests the change indicator 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.270
 the result in our test we have 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.190
 route more than 17 km with a liter without 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.290
 not even drive with the new classic 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.450
 under the accelerator a whole other 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.100
 the hybrid world that seems thought of 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.750
 on purpose to transform a journey into 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.179
 a challenge to the last drop of 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.280
 pleasant silent fuel makes 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.740
 forget about services of a cvt exchange 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.509
 continuously variable thanks to the lively 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.270
 sprint guaranteed by the electric motor 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.429
 in restarts on a non- route 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.350
 mi vida ideal for traveling for long 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.850
 traits at a constant speed where it works 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.649
 only the 1500 on petrol 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.960
 however we managed to go 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.060
 almost 20 km with a liter 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.250
 but in the city where the bruise gives its best 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.250
 of himself one can certainly do better
