and there you have a piece of delays now
I<00:04:30.380> don't<00:04:30.830> know<00:04:30.919> if<00:04:31.039> you<00:04:31.160> can<00:04:31.340> see<00:04:31.729> I<00:04:32.060> didn't

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
I don't know if you can see I didn't

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.890 
I don't know if you can see I didn't
clean<00:04:33.169> the<00:04:33.199> top<00:04:33.560> office<00:04:34.069> as<00:04:34.599> good<00:04:35.599> as<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.870> should

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
clean the top office as good as I should

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.040 
clean the top office as good as I should
have<00:04:36.169> so<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:37.430> looks<00:04:38.180> like<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.569> lace<00:04:38.780> has<00:04:39.020> a

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
have so it looks like the lace has a

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.370 
have so it looks like the lace has a
back<00:04:39.410> in<00:04:39.620> which<00:04:39.800> is<00:04:39.979> just<00:04:40.160> a<00:04:40.340> thin<00:04:40.940> film<00:04:41.449> but

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
back in which is just a thin film but

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.180 
back in which is just a thin film but
once<00:04:42.860> you<00:04:43.039> start<00:04:43.099> working<00:04:43.699> with<00:04:43.729> it<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.180> can

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
once you start working with it you can

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.650 
once you start working with it you can
get<00:04:46.190> perfect<00:04:46.699> that<00:04:46.819> I'm<00:04:47.000> still<00:04:47.300> not<00:04:47.449> perfect

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
get perfect that I'm still not perfect

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.820 
get perfect that I'm still not perfect
at<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.139> and<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:48.860> can<00:04:49.340> always<00:04:49.490> just<00:04:50.560> start<00:04:51.560> over

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
at it and you can always just start over

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.010 
at it and you can always just start over
from<00:04:52.039> scratch<00:04:52.330> until<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.419> get<00:04:53.599> it<00:04:53.720> right<00:04:53.750> and

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
from scratch until you get it right and

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.349 
from scratch until you get it right and
