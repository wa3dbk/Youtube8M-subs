 we take out our tables, this is a 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.500
 good wood is good quality we try 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.550
 that the brand spreads to more places 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.350

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.239
 We also do not know with life are 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.070

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.070
 offered his support and well look at this 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.040
 it has been given right now what we 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.500
 is we have the skaters that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.100
 they entered our brand, not because they are 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.740
 top 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.570
 not for being the ones who are also 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.700
 giving him but we trust in 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.860
 they know they are good 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.869
 quality they will go far 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.190
 hey, it's very important to you 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.150
 as brands 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.060
 look at how important this is that 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.190
 the skate scene as it excels in 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.740
 reality is that what of what 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.300
 try because then there are times you have to 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.520
 a brand just think of the mud and 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.780
 others and well that's not cool what 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.600
 you must think is first in the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.300
 skaters that the skaters start 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.460
 to know about you web so you know that you 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.650
 you are supporting them prepare in what way 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.830
 you can not get good merchandise wii 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.800
 and at an accessible web cost for all 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.340
 I do not know what else I could tell you that 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.620
 I do not care 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.280
 mainly have fun throwing all 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.010
 the desire and more than anything to enjoy very 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.830
 well there is future in a brand that is of 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.760
 skaters for skaters 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.500
 Well, yes, look, because when I started the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.000
 marks the start between 4 valedores 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.460
 then skated said it all 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.020
 let's put together the wii but then in 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.430
 actually we can not skate see 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.200
 why because then we have other 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.540
 occupations but this mark we made it 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.280
 us well so that it is cool for 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.530
 the other skaters because we 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.030
 we know when when you need something that 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.100
 when you need something vara when 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.870
 you need something of good quality then 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.420
 we think of a good brand we 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.280
 we thought about doing it and then spread the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.470
 web so that everyone else can then 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.990
 can skate lake, good philosophy 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.760

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.200
