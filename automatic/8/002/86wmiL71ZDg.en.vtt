of<00:04:47.889> like<00:04:48.039> for<00:04:48.340> me<00:04:48.460> sometimes<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.389> don't

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
of like for me sometimes and I don't

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.219

necessarily<00:04:49.750> enjoy<00:04:50.530> too<00:04:51.010> much<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:52.780> I<00:04:52.810> just<00:04:53.050> go

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
necessarily enjoy too much so I just go

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.150 
necessarily enjoy too much so I just go
in<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:55.240> just<00:04:55.539> dust<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.200> little<00:04:56.530> bit<00:04:56.800> not<00:04:57.130> a

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
in and just dust it a little bit not a

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.190 
in and just dust it a little bit not a
lot<00:04:57.370> because<00:04:57.760> otherwise<00:04:58.150> it<00:04:58.510> gets<00:04:58.780> too<00:04:59.169> late

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
lot because otherwise it gets too late

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.310 
lot because otherwise it gets too late
on<00:04:59.729> your<00:05:00.729> under<00:05:01.120> eye<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.900> doesn't<00:05:02.289> look

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
on your under eye and it doesn't look

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.730 
on your under eye and it doesn't look
natural<00:05:02.650> really<00:05:03.660> but<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:04.840> does<00:05:05.050> give<00:05:05.350> you<00:05:05.500> a

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
natural really but it does give you a

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.089 
natural really but it does give you a
little<00:05:06.840> boost<00:05:07.840> and<00:05:08.260> you<00:05:08.349> can<00:05:08.470> also<00:05:08.560> have<00:05:08.889> the

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
little boost and you can also have the

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.010 
little boost and you can also have the
summer<00:05:09.550> bisque<00:05:09.880> some<00:05:10.210> once<00:05:10.360> then<00:05:10.539> while<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.870> go

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.870 
face to write on my cheek Milan and I
bring<00:05:29.500> it<00:05:29.650> down<00:05:29.830> to<00:05:30.039> my<00:05:30.160> chin<00:05:30.190> of<00:05:31.060> my<00:05:31.360> tempo

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.650 

nothing<00:05:36.880> too<00:05:37.120> heavy<00:05:37.780> for<00:05:38.740> everyday<00:05:39.010> wear

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
nothing too heavy for everyday wear

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.279 
nothing too heavy for everyday wear
really<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:42.310> then<00:05:42.430> just<00:05:42.610> as<00:05:42.760> an<00:05:42.880> example<00:05:43.289> blush

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
really and then just as an example blush

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.400 
really and then just as an example blush
I<00:05:44.470> have<00:05:44.680> mac<00:05:45.310> Lovejoy<00:05:45.940> obviously<00:05:46.599> I<00:05:46.630> switch<00:05:47.200> my

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
I have mac Lovejoy obviously I switch my

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:55.529 
I have mac Lovejoy obviously I switch my
blushes<00:05:50.729> up<00:05:51.729> a<00:05:52.150> little<00:05:52.660> I<00:05:53.700> don't<00:05:54.700> wear<00:05:55.360> the

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
blushes up a little I don't wear the

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:04.559 
blushes up a little I don't wear the
same<00:05:55.870> thing<00:05:56.169> every<00:05:56.470> day<00:05:57.630> but

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:09.450 

so<00:06:05.199> this<00:06:05.409> would<00:06:05.589> most<00:06:05.979> likely<00:06:06.300> be<00:06:07.300> my<00:06:08.460> facial

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
so this would most likely be my facial

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.899 
so this would most likely be my facial
routine<00:06:09.879> and<00:06:10.149> then<00:06:10.300> I<00:06:11.139> do<00:06:11.439> go<00:06:11.740> in<00:06:11.919> with<00:06:12.159> my<00:06:12.339> NYX

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
routine and then I do go in with my NYX

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.199 
routine and then I do go in with my NYX
powder<00:06:13.270> foundation<00:06:14.050> in<00:06:14.550> natural<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:15.909> as<00:06:16.119> you

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:16.209 
powder foundation in natural and as you

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.570 
powder foundation in natural and as you
can<00:06:16.360> see<00:06:16.389> I've<00:06:16.659> been<00:06:16.839> using<00:06:17.379> this<00:06:17.619> a<00:06:17.770> lot<00:06:17.800> and<00:06:18.189> I

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
can see I've been using this a lot and I

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.689 
can see I've been using this a lot and I
just<00:06:18.789> dust<00:06:19.089> it<00:06:19.300> all<00:06:19.509> over<00:06:19.839> my<00:06:19.990> forehead<00:06:20.050> and<00:06:23.699> my

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
just dust it all over my forehead and my

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.799 
just dust it all over my forehead and my
face<00:06:24.969> just<00:06:25.300> to<00:06:25.749> kind<00:06:25.990> of<00:06:27.179> set<00:06:28.179> everything<00:06:28.419> in

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:28.809 
face just to kind of set everything in

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:31.769 
face just to kind of set everything in
place<00:06:29.520> like<00:06:30.520> I<00:06:30.669> said<00:06:30.879> this<00:06:31.029> foundation<00:06:31.599> has<00:06:31.749> a

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:31.779 
place like I said this foundation has a

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:33.929 
place like I said this foundation has a
very<00:06:32.020> nice<00:06:32.199> staying<00:06:32.649> power<00:06:32.889> and<00:06:33.039> lasts<00:06:33.520> long

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:33.939 
very nice staying power and lasts long

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:37.889 
very nice staying power and lasts long
time<00:06:34.240> so<00:06:34.860> this<00:06:35.860> is<00:06:35.919> pretty<00:06:36.189> much<00:06:36.309> it<00:06:36.429> for<00:06:36.729> my<00:06:36.999> my

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:37.899 
time so this is pretty much it for my my

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:40.139 
time so this is pretty much it for my my
