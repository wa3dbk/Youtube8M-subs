00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.870 

this<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.290> perfect<00:00:16.710> example<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.370> an<00:00:17.610> upper

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
this is a perfect example of an upper

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.570 
this is a perfect example of an upper
structure<00:00:18.150> triad<00:00:18.600> voicing<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> left<00:00:20.340> hand

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
structure triad voicing in the left hand

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.160 
structure triad voicing in the left hand
I'm<00:00:20.820> playing<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:22.020> lower<00:00:22.350> structure<00:00:22.970> which<00:00:24.170> is

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
I'm playing the lower structure which is

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.560 
I'm playing the lower structure which is
usually<00:00:25.740> guide<00:00:26.310> tones<00:00:26.580> three<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.180> seven<00:00:27.330> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
usually guide tones three and seven to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.500 
usually guide tones three and seven to
the<00:00:27.660> root<00:00:28.850> and<00:00:29.850> in<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.240> hand<00:00:30.420> I'm

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the root and in the right hand I'm

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.240 
the root and in the right hand I'm
playing<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.900> upper<00:00:31.170> structure<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:31.890> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
playing the upper structure which is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.270 
playing the upper structure which is
defined<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> triad<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.780> has<00:00:34.680> at<00:00:34.830> least<00:00:34.980> one

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
defined as a triad that has at least one

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940 
defined as a triad that has at least one
tension<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.879> it<00:00:35.970> and<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.960> dried<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.830> this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
tension in it and this dried so in this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.549 
tension in it and this dried so in this
lesson<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.580> talk<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.150> you<00:00:39.330> about<00:00:39.660> all

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
upper structure triad voicing if I build

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.760 
upper structure triad voicing if I build
a<00:01:04.860> triad<00:01:05.100> major<00:01:05.489> triad<00:01:05.820> off<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.270> 13<00:01:06.770> gives

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
a triad major triad off of that 13 gives

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.190 
a triad major triad off of that 13 gives
me<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> nice<00:01:08.070> flat<00:01:08.430> 9<00:01:08.670> sound<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
me a nice flat 9 sound I'm just going to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840 
me a nice flat 9 sound I'm just going to
invert<00:01:10.620> it<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.130> my<00:01:11.250> melody<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.670> order

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
invert it so that my melody in order

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.719 
invert it so that my melody in order
something<00:01:12.030> only<00:01:12.210> thinking<00:01:12.570> myself<00:01:12.950> what<00:01:13.950> am<00:01:14.640> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
something only thinking myself what am I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.820 
something only thinking myself what am I
gonna<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.120> to<00:01:15.810> make<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.110> sound<00:01:16.320> better<00:01:16.560> well

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
gonna do to make this sound better well

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.020 
gonna do to make this sound better well
if<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.040> throw<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.430> some<00:01:17.610> upper<00:01:17.820> structure

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
if you throw on some upper structure

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.990 
if you throw on some upper structure
triad<00:01:18.360> voicings<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.900> got<00:01:19.020> an<00:01:19.110> immediate

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
triad voicings you got an immediate

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.660 
triad voicings you got an immediate
infusion<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.360> color<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.649> played<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> d750

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
infusion of color so I played the d750

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
infusion of color so I played the d750
minor<00:01:24.000> 7<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.420> my<00:01:24.659> standard<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.469> odd<00:01:25.619> voicing

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
minor 7 with my standard so odd voicing

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.160 
minor 7 with my standard so odd voicing
and<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.149> I<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.689> play<00:01:28.439> g7<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.750> my<00:01:30.750> 9<00:01:30.960> flat

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and then I I can play g7 with my 9 flat

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.980 
and then I I can play g7 with my 9 flat
5<00:01:31.439> throwing<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.210> flat<00:01:33.210> 5<00:01:33.479> upper<00:01:33.719> structure

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
5 throwing in my flat 5 upper structure

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.700 
5 throwing in my flat 5 upper structure
voicing

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
voicing

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.620 
voicing
and<00:01:35.799> then<00:01:36.460> going<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.729> my<00:01:36.880> one<00:01:37.090> chord<00:01:37.360> C<00:01:37.479> major

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
and then going to my one chord C major

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.380 
and then going to my one chord C major
seven<00:01:38.080> throw<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.100> an<00:01:39.250> infrastructure<00:01:39.820> voicing

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
seven throw in an infrastructure voicing

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:58.109 
seven throw in an infrastructure voicing
on<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:56.290> can<00:01:56.500> give<00:01:56.680> you<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.700> know<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.820> lot<00:01:58.060> of
