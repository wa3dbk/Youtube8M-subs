00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.249
 the numbers are they have to 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.859
 at that time was called 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.460
 Koenigstein 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.780

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.630
 that they are here 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.000

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 not allowed 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.070

 the dialect 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.630
 Landshut 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.630

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.070
