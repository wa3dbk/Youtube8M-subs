00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hi, people today I'm going to talk about a product. 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.630
 of hair that I bought and that I have 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.059
 I liked enough that this one is the cream 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.540
 to comb the miracle of the lula brand 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.320
 cosmetics and this cream that it is very 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.260
 good 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.330
 I bought thinking that he really was 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.650
 a cream without rinsing a cream to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.109
 to comb 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:31.230
 without xavi but here in the back mode 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.829
 to use in the usage mode is saying that it 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.540
 It is a combing cream but with the 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.370
 so that's the way I've been using 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.579
 He uses shampoo and then I pass the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 cream leaves a few minutes the 35 minutes 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.079
 in hair and shot is that cream he is 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.590
 very good is great for those who have hair 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.680
 desiccated you nursed good it is that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.180
 it is a crime that is not oily and if the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.159
 person she may use up to 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.680
 daily I do not use daily 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.909
 because my hair is very dry and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.369
 dried up is it if I wash my hair 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.549
 every day in the hair will tend to stay 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.860
 five more is still so I always use 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.860
 When I'm going to wash my hair, it's not 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.310
 It means that I go every day but he is 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.570
 A super cream is an environment when you 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.759
 is going to take hair down, it's gone 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.150
 getting away with being a good grinder and he 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.119
 has a more liquid consistency and is well 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.009
 Mole knows and there are people who say that 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.170
 when the cream is thus conscious 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.390
 more liquid and lasts less than those 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.450
 which are more consistent 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.130
 durinha I think the opposite to me 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.220
 cream that has more liquid awareness 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.259
 It lasts longer I use well less than that 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.829
 another in the other that has the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.159
 The harder I need to get more 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.880
 product to pass on hair than this 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.710
 here is more liquid wines so is he 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.660
 It smells very strange when he 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.770
 arrived i found it until i was spoiled 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.000
 because I 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.580
 people saying he has the smell 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.450
 Wonderful and I did not find it 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.590
 It's even a girl who commented that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.560
 Look at his scent that's the way it is and I saw 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.560
 he has citrus and then 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.620
 suddenly it is only this cyclic smell that 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:37.050
 mixture with coconut that mixes with 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:41.730
 vanilla that has in it that leaves that 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:45.510
 I smell a little sour 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.090
 and I wanted to make a comparison of him 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.300
 What is a cream with his name? 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.460
 miracle cream to comb in miracle 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.170
 I wanted to make a comparison with this 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:00.810
 here is another cream that promises to make 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:07.010
 The miracle is that it's 3 minutes miraculous 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:10.920
 What is that al whether this is he comes here 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.820
 236 ml and if it happens right here it is of a 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.240
 kilo 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.970
 I think it's worth it a lot more if 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.920
 not only because it is bigger but not 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.790
 it's because it's a lot cheaper than 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.030
 that 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.730
 This one cost $ 16 and went to bed. 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.420
 thirty-nine reais and this one is very 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.640
 best 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.250
 it is much better than this because the 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.500
 What I feel for him is what he does. 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.920
 instant hydration had a 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.400
 cinderella effect you use it today it 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.260
 Looks great on hair but hard only. 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.390
 to the next and never washed 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.600
 hydration does not stay time 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.160
 You have to always use the smell of it. 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.980
 much more delicious he has a smell 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.280
 coconut water its existence is also 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.170
 more durinha is what I do not think so 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.650
 interferes in nothing more 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.240
 harder liquid is to make the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.140
 product be better with them and more 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.810
 hard 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.420
 since that wave of the galley 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.450
 turn a cut of the world muraca noy to 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.190
 otherwise not drop what people think 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.140
 we do not want the pot to my 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.930
 name I think this is myth right 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.609
 So this one from here I think has a 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.030
 instantaneous effect is not 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.539
 so long not long term 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.689
 a hydration that is one more thing 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:35.889
 Instant three minutes if you go there 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:38.020
 the hair looks beautiful lake where new back 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.500
 had at least that's how my 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.349
 Hair is how it behaves 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.240
 I always like it when I want it. 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.000
 get my hair is the most beautiful 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.819
 I use it but I think it's better 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.400
 Because this one from here I think he 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:57.039
 hydration really gets in your hair 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.039
 not only has that momentary hydration 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.750
 and it is much cheaper and moreover 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:07.629
 also in Brazilian and is a product 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:11.139
 Brazilian and he also says that if you 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:13.479
 use the dryer and the flat iron after 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.930
 you use it further optimizes the 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.419
 result gives more shine and the hair stays 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.279
 softer also wrote very good 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.050
 I think it's worth it 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:26.110
 I think it's better than this one. 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:30.940
 although I really like you but this 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.949
 is that I think hydration is 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.000
 more hair on that thing right 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.919
 momentary 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.289
 so this is what people expect these 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.029
 have enjoyed the video you subscribe to 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.659
 still writing and up to the 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:42.659
 next christmas
