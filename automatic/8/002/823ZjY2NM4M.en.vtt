00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.890
 then on one side we have deforestation 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.529
 massive in the four corners of the planet 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.619
 on the other side we have truth about 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.359
 grain intentions with in chemistry or 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.449
 chemical etc which are in the process 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.180
 to approve drastically our soils so 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.460
 we have to act together to 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.960
 try to offset c is I do 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.809
 am very influenced by the work of 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.420
 robert art who is the pioneer of the garden 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.100
 forest and that explains that if everyone 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.610
 of us are planting a dozen 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.129
 trees 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.680
 we can really create a real 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.170
 urban forest that should compensate all 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.219
 the damage that is done to the other 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.070
 end of the world so that means that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.859
 should we have a power to do 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.530
 something fights fight of 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.840
 patrick winfield how to create a garden 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 times he does it on a scale of one 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.080
 garden even a very small garden 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.200
 it's fascinating 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.360
 so me here as I rent I can not 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.820
 so much planting trees I have not 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.439
 right against 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.829
 green power hip hop terrace 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.030
 assimilated then I propose to you as the 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.750
 most of you had balconies 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.240
 and terraces 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.890
 I propose to do together deposit 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.959
 large pots of flowers in celebration of 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.009
 potted fruit forest in your father 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:36.170
 mathieu so the goal is to plant a 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.869
 maximum of before our scale for 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.810
 boosting biodiversity protect 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.729
 insects bees the birds to create 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.640
 new oxygen wells for the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.640
 planet to revive 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.120
 and at the same time to take a step towards 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.650
 food self-sufficiency 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.650
 goal for this year morning 10am
