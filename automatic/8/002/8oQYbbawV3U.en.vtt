00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.510 

it's<00:05:59.470> got<00:05:59.680> the<00:05:59.919> diff<00:06:00.370> lock<00:06:00.570> right<00:06:01.570> there

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.320 

manual<00:06:06.520> lift<00:06:07.919> but<00:06:08.919> the<00:06:09.100> shoe<00:06:09.400> control<00:06:09.880> for<00:06:10.210> the

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
manual lift but the shoe control for the

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.689 
manual lift but the shoe control for the
snowblower<00:06:10.720> is<00:06:11.050> electric<00:06:11.650> electronic<00:06:12.370> I

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
snowblower is electric electronic I

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:21.930 
snowblower is electric electronic I
guess<00:06:12.940> electric<00:06:14.759> and<00:06:18.660> that's<00:06:19.660> it<00:06:19.870> I<00:06:20.850> talked<00:06:21.850> to

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
guess electric and that's it I talked to

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.659 
guess electric and that's it I talked to
the<00:06:22.440> Vanguard<00:06:23.440> people<00:06:23.770> today<00:06:23.979> and<00:06:24.340> they<00:06:24.460> said

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
the Vanguard people today and they said

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.460 
the Vanguard people today and they said
the<00:06:24.789> only<00:06:24.940> difference<00:06:25.330> between<00:06:25.449> this<00:06:25.750> 21<00:06:26.169> on

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
the only difference between this 21 on

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:37.560 
the only difference between this 21 on
the<00:06:26.560> 23<00:06:28.199> is<00:06:34.139> the<00:06:35.139> carburetor<00:06:36.210> looks<00:06:37.210> like<00:06:37.389> that

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
the 23 is the carburetor looks like that

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:44.750 
the 23 is the carburetor looks like that
fuel<00:06:37.870> filter<00:06:38.169> small<00:06:38.470> IQ<00:06:43.410> supposedly<00:06:44.410> there's

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
fuel filter small IQ supposedly there's

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.560 
fuel filter small IQ supposedly there's
the<00:06:45.760> gasket<00:06:47.430> there's<00:06:48.430> a<00:06:48.550> smaller<00:06:48.910> gasket<00:06:49.449> it's

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
the gasket there's a smaller gasket it's

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.740 
the gasket there's a smaller gasket it's
almost<00:06:49.780> like<00:06:50.050> a<00:06:50.849> NASCAR<00:06:51.849> engine<00:06:52.120> with<00:06:52.570> the

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
almost like a NASCAR engine with the

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.839 
almost like a NASCAR engine with the
restrictor<00:06:53.260> plates<00:06:53.530> he<00:06:53.770> said<00:06:54.010> basically<00:06:54.460> it's

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849 
restrictor plates he said basically it's

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:00.420 
restrictor plates he said basically it's
a<00:06:55.000> smaller<00:06:55.889> smaller<00:06:56.889> area<00:06:57.310> gasket<00:06:58.050> and<00:06:59.430> the

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
a smaller smaller area gasket and the

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.510 
a smaller smaller area gasket and the
carb<00:07:00.699> has<00:07:01.030> a<00:07:01.060> slightly<00:07:01.419> smaller<00:07:02.520> apparently

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
carb has a slightly smaller apparently

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.750 
carb has a slightly smaller apparently
slightly<00:07:03.880> smaller<00:07:04.150> I<00:07:05.490> don't<00:07:06.490> know<00:07:06.550> what<00:07:06.669> he'd

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760 
slightly smaller I don't know what he'd

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.400 
slightly smaller I don't know what he'd
call<00:07:06.820> it<00:07:09.300> but<00:07:10.300> but<00:07:10.599> basically<00:07:10.780> he<00:07:11.110> said<00:07:11.320> you

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.410 
call it but but basically he said you

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.060 
call it but but basically he said you
could<00:07:11.560> put<00:07:12.310> the<00:07:12.520> carb<00:07:13.419> from<00:07:13.630> the<00:07:13.720> 23<00:07:14.260> on<00:07:14.289> to<00:07:14.590> 21

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.070 
could put the carb from the 23 on to 21

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.529 
could put the carb from the 23 on to 21
and<00:07:15.389> it'll<00:07:16.389> be<00:07:16.479> just<00:07:16.510> like<00:07:16.690> a<00:07:16.780> 23<00:07:17.289> again<00:07:17.560> so<00:07:17.860> I

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 
and it'll be just like a 23 again so I

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.550 
and it'll be just like a 23 again so I
might<00:07:19.539> do<00:07:19.690> that<00:07:19.720> as<00:07:20.020> well

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.960 

so<00:07:23.560> that's<00:07:24.190> part<00:07:25.150> one<00:07:25.389> of<00:07:25.419> this<00:07:26.610> this<00:07:27.610> project

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970 
so that's part one of this this project

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.180 
so that's part one of this this project
or<00:07:28.720> I<00:07:28.750> should<00:07:28.990> I<00:07:29.169> know<00:07:29.260> if<00:07:29.440> it's<00:07:29.530> part<00:07:29.800> one<00:07:29.949> but

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.190 
or I should I know if it's part one but

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.560 
or I should I know if it's part one but
it's<00:07:30.340> the<00:07:30.460> beginning<00:07:32.460> and<00:07:33.460> that's<00:07:34.180> all<00:07:34.360> for

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:34.570 
it's the beginning and that's all for

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.400 
it's the beginning and that's all for
now<00:07:35.099> talk<00:07:36.099> to<00:07:36.190> you<00:07:36.280> later
