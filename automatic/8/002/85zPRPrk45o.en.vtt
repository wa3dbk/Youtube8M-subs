there kind of losing hope we were losing
hope<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:26.010> no<00:00:26.430> more<00:00:26.609> geo<00:00:26.789> brakes<00:00:26.970> were<00:00:27.090> going

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
hope that no more geo brakes were going

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.849 
hope that no more geo brakes were going
to<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.359> developed<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.080> was<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> room<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> while

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
to be developed it was a room or a while

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.339 
to be developed it was a room or a while
ago<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.160> jailbreakers<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.929> natural

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
ago that jailbreakers and natural

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.260 
ago that jailbreakers and natural
hackers<00:00:31.710> would<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.399> stopped<00:00:32.850> making

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
hackers would have stopped making

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.120 
hackers would have stopped making
jailbreaks<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.020> they<00:00:34.410> weren't<00:00:34.620> doing<00:00:34.920> any

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
jailbreaks and they weren't doing any

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.889 
jailbreaks and they weren't doing any
more<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.579> there<00:00:35.969> was<00:00:36.120> no<00:00:36.300> other<00:00:36.480> way<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> make

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
more and there was no other way to make

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.360 
more and there was no other way to make
jailbreaks<00:00:37.500> ton<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.070> people<00:00:38.280> actually

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
jailbreaks ton of people actually

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.560 
jailbreaks ton of people actually
started<00:00:38.790> believing<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.450> know

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
started believing that and you know

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.139 
started believing that and you know
because<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.770> 06<00:00:41.129> has<00:00:41.219> been<00:00:41.340> up<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> long<00:00:41.850> time

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
because I 06 has been up for a long time

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.360 
because I 06 has been up for a long time
there's<00:00:42.510> still<00:00:43.110> no<00:00:43.320> untethered<00:00:43.829> jailbreak<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
there's still no untethered jailbreak I

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.010 
there's still no untethered jailbreak I
kind<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.789> started<00:00:45.000> thinking<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.480> maybe<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
kind of started thinking that maybe the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.470 
kind of started thinking that maybe the
geo<00:00:46.170> brakes<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.789> stopped<00:00:47.789> being<00:00:48.059> published

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
geo brakes have stopped being published

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.470 
geo brakes have stopped being published
for<00:00:48.899> good<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.219> actual<00:00:50.610> known<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
for good but one of the actual known and

for good but one of the actual known and
one<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> better<00:00:52.020> respected<00:00:52.800> developers

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
one of the better respected developers

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.740

Joe<00:02:39.220> record<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.610> think<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:40.090> give<00:02:40.840> them

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
Joe record I think that give them

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.500 
Joe record I think that give them
positive<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.920> those<00:02:42.580> kind<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:42.940> good<00:02:43.120> tweets

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
positive and those kind of good tweets

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.180 
positive and those kind of good tweets
and<00:02:43.750> messages<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.470> emails<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:44.950> stuff<00:02:45.010> like

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
and messages and emails and stuff like

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.949 
and messages and emails and stuff like
that<00:02:45.250> I'm<00:02:45.520> sure<00:02:45.790> they<00:02:45.940> would<00:02:46.120> love<00:02:46.240> those<00:02:46.450> and

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
that I'm sure they would love those and

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.240 
that I'm sure they would love those and
that<00:02:47.320> would<00:02:47.470> make<00:02:47.590> them<00:02:47.800> work<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.100> little

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
that would make them work a little

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.460 
that would make them work a little
faster<00:02:48.459> than<00:02:48.940> giving<00:02:49.180> them<00:02:49.360> hateful<00:02:49.840> tweets

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
faster than giving them hateful tweets

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.860 
faster than giving them hateful tweets
and<00:02:50.860> emails<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.520> hate<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.360> suck

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.050 
and emails and I hate you and you suck
that<00:02:53.709> kind<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.010> stuff<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.400> basically<00:02:54.880> this<00:02:54.970> is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
that kind of stuff so basically this is

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.430
