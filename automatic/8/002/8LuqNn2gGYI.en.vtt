00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.460
 throughout the history of the 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.200
 sciences has been done thousands of 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.940
 experiments with the objective of testing 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.160
 a wide variety of products all 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.520
 type before employing them with beings 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.750
 humans yes to the server of the animals 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.520
 many of these trials have been 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.260
 strongly criticized for its doubtful 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.910
 ethics the possible suffering that 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.580
 provoked in the creatures that were 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.070
 used by lots with reason every time 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.930
 this type of practice is questioned today 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.610
 we want to show you the 5 experiments that 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.469
 have been made with the animals in 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.589
 different moments of history and have 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.120
 been cruel and heartbreaking reminds him 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.940
 to the public that the video will be for you 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.579
 see has a high content so if 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.499
 are sensitive please I ask you 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.440
 close the video and do not see beyond 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:49.389
 what he really does not want is to see if 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.879
 have you decided to stay, then get ready 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:56.010
 because you're about to see five 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.010
 Bizarre experiments on animals 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.199
 in position number 5 we have some 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.070
 experiment called the love of the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.380
 turkeys in the 1970s biologists from 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.260
 the university of pennsylvania placed 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.659
 to a female turkey the males tried 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.700
 mate with her intrigued the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.229
 researchers wanted to know what was 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.270
 the minimum stimulus needed to 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.000
 excite the birds and for that they were 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.430
 gradually removing parts of the power 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.259
 so they will make you progressively the tail 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.659
 the wings the legs and even the body 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.490
 until only the head and a stick remained 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.259
 to his surprise 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.360
 even so the males tried to mate 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.039
 with her then they concluded that the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.619
 head of the female was the focus of the 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.840
 erotic desires of the male and that when 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.520
 mounts and covers it completely is the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.289
 head just the only part of the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.929
 body of her that he can see 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.600
 continually simply the turkeys will 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.300
 they wanted to put out with a corpse for them 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.900
 the only thing that matters is the head is 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.770
 dead or not 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.770
 children 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.930
 i 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.170
 in position number 4 we have before the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.450
 soccer a kitten that was subjected to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.820
 several experiments this post not what 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.700
 I will explain without further tvc news 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.650
 giving a more complete report of what 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.170
 what happened to the poor kitten 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.269
 for decades the rumor that innumerable 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.310
 cats had died at the university of 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.069
 wisconsin after being subjected to 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.640
 cruel experiments was finally 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.110
 revealed to the public light photographs of 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.299
 these absurd and useless 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.299
 investigations were made known 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.040
 by peta in them the 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.160
 suffering that lived double trouble 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.470
 during months of stormy operations 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.380
 double oak was subjected to several 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.810
 invasive surgeries in the eyes ears and 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.200
 brain was fitted with steel coils 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.570
 and implant in ocular foci poles 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.400
 of stainless steel were bolted 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.280
 to his skull and he was installed 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.170
 electrodes in your brain in addition to 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.320
 apply a toxic substance in their 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.810
 internal ears to cause deafness and 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.570
 well put electronic implants in the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.330
 inside of both ears after all 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.180
 this torture the feline suffered a serious 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.860
 bacterial infection was sacrificed and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.140
 showed that the experiment of the 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.720
 University of Wisconsin was quite a 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.700
 failure these images have caused 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.170
 indignation around the world the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.880
 prestigious researchers 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.670
 institutions in other parts of the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.130
 planet already use modern methods with 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.800
 human volunteers to investigate how 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.440
 the brain determines the location of a 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.130
 sound without the need to martyrize 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.470
 an animal as was the case of double the 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.050
 Cat suffering double trouble has 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.750
 stopped but we do not know how strong 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.830
 it was his hell and how many more 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.140
 they suffered 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.630
 at number 3 we have the 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.760
 head transplant a group of 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.310
 scientists from the medical school of 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.790
 the university case western in cleba 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.830
 ohio directed by robert white realized 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.810
 a highly controversial operation 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.090
 to transport the head of a monkey in 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.670
 the body of another the procedure was 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.070
 a success to some extent with the animal 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.740
 being able to smell like to hear and see the 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.260
 world around him in the operation 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.670
 arteries and veins participated 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.860
 cauterized with care while the 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.860
 head was being cut to avoid 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.960
 hypovolemia because the nerves 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.790
 they were totally impacts are 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.760
 connected in brain to a supply of 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.380
 blood keeping chemically alive 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.050
 the animal survived for some 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.820
 time after the operation even 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.670
 there were times when he indicated biting 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.950
 some of the employees a true 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.770
 suffering to be alive in the body 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.230
 of someone else bleeding out little by little 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.950
 while you're still alive or 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.950
 good only 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.330
 in position number 2 we have the 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.639
 multi bear experiment 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.009
 this aberrant experiment was realized 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.349
 in the 1950s by a scientist 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.490
 Soviet pioneer in the field of 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.830
 organ transplants 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.080
 employing dogs his experiment 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.490
 It consisted in mutilating a puppy 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.979
 he only left his head and legs 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.050
 front attached to the neck of a 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.449
 adult dog the operation was a success 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.370
 in principle and when they both woke up 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.770
 dogs were united for their own 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.300
 perplexity although in principle it is not 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.069
 they took well they ended up by 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.069
 get used and everyone kept their 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:37.930
 personality until after six days in 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.800
 that both heads and the common body 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.740
 called multi dog ended up dying 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.599
 these scientists have no heart 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.090
 do this to some poor souls not 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.740
 have forgiveness join with another body 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.379
 for the purpose of an experiment 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.389
 failed the dogs and hate oxy more and 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:58.180
 they ended up dying knowing what the 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.310
 scientists is something a lot of money hurry 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.639
 of ubisoft abortion will be and dramatic 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.289
 marching with seigner obama purple niell 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.870
 and from a line they saw as James 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.940
 howard and better would arrive in cars will have 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.039
 searched experienced cases of 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.910
 experiments players apart from those 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.250
 hundreds of miles 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.160
 in the number 1 position you do not need much 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.270
 explanation these scientists were trying 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.250
 to prove that it could be maintained 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.260
 artificially alive the head of a 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.900
 animal through a pretty apparatus 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.600
 simple that pumps the blood as if the 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.160
 own heart it was tried with 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.170
 the head of a dog connected this 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.950
 system and the result then certainly 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.950
 unsettle him 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.660
 the animal responded as if 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.060
 I live opening and closing my eyes and 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.680
 suffering from external stimuli what 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.190
 which showed that he also had 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.570
 sensitivity 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.500
 so much torture for them is understandable 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.960
 help science 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.850
 there will be medicines no matter how many 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.400
 tragic experiments have to do 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.710
 they will continue to do so for their advancement in 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.990
 science does not matter how much news 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:07.080
 there is ahead when for them their 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:10.110
 only desire that there is to die nothing else 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.510
 that makes them suffer just by dying think about it 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.000
 so think as if you were one of 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.430
 the five animals that have passed them 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.710
 have suffered maybe you do not care 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.500
 but let me tell you something when you 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.090
 you are the victim, things change 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.280
 louis fruits of life without fear of anything 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.590
 now what would happen if you knew what 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.870
 they suffered from suffering several 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.790
 days of pain without several parts of the 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.550
 body and good where to you as if you were 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.530
 an object of study I hope that this 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.170
 serve in reasoning because some 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.740
 day of these animal cruelty will happen to 

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.289
 the most unimaginable limits 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:48.560
 this has been five bizarre experiments 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:50.599
 the animals I hope you've reasoned 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.430
 the video and that this changes your way of 

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:54.430
 think until then
