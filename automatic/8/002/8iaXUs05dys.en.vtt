pattern<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> microfiber<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.200> text

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
pattern on the microfiber just this text

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.980 
pattern on the microfiber just this text
it<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.829> says<00:01:41.130> Oakley<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.119> that's

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it just says Oakley on it so that's

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.020 
it just says Oakley on it so that's
really<00:01:43.229> cool<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.460> my<00:01:44.579> opinion<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.000> think

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
really cool I'm in my opinion I think

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.249 
really cool I'm in my opinion I think
the<00:01:45.240> microfiber<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.810> probably<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> coolest

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the microfiber is probably the coolest

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.380 
the microfiber is probably the coolest
thing<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:50.000> here<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> go

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
thing so here you go

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.350 
thing so here you go
so<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.470> Ruby<00:01:52.740> iridium<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.909> Ruby<00:01:54.180> does

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so it's Ruby iridium and the Ruby does

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.030 
so it's Ruby iridium and the Ruby does
like<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:54.869> bit<00:01:54.990> different<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> PD

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
like a little bit different like be a PD

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.370 
like a little bit different like be a PD

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
looks a lot more just red just it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.109 
looks a lot more just red just it
doesn't<00:02:01.229> look<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:01.680> any<00:02:02.399> kind<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.729> ruby<00:02:03.090> or

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
