looked at did not have old capacity and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.680 
looked at did not have old capacity and
wrench<00:00:14.250> sizes<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:14.940> figured<00:00:15.269> I'd<00:00:15.330> go<00:00:15.509> over

this is what I'm using is a maximum 20
50<00:02:28.750> max<00:02:29.750> was<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.020> best<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.350> best<00:02:30.560> so

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
50 max was the best of the best so

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.750 
50 max was the best of the best so
they're<00:02:31.970> calls<00:02:32.150> for<00:02:32.360> one<00:02:32.480> full<00:02:32.690> quart<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.830> is

they're calls for one full quart so is

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.780 
they're calls for one full quart so is
she<00:02:34.940> pull<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.300> for<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.900> whole<00:02:36.020> court<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.350> there
