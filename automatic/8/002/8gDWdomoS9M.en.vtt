 of maximum there and 50 seconds showing 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.040
 some characters they have placed 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.340
 how to render as main characters 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.160
 on tv and places wins team m is lazy 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.439
 tv rba adil nikkei that I like best 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.119
 a nerd nerd I do not know how to pronounce it 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.420
 right but at last they all showed 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.240
 Something around them was still the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.010
 who showed the world more and everything 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.780
 hadzic was where it showed ability that the 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.790
 people will have to build things with 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.920
 wood and everything else I did not forget the name 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.210
 of skill is made good and the nerd 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.070
 showed a little more about the plant 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.320
 cow but what I liked the most was nikkey 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.800
 because it showed a little more than 8 x lens 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.390
 huh 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.340
 still showed a lot about 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.540
 these leandrinho have cool things that 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.490
 I'll show you 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.950
 more ahead than in the video but admits 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.140
 which showed a little more style more 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.299
 trailer even knows that looking like movie 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.890
 even and for you who likes machine 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.710
 more like to make movies as well as 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.080
 dj rita and many other apes like to 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.810
 make movies and series is not much 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.210
 easy as well because it showed you the game 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.100
 of cameras and everything else you can do 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.380
 series and the movies still when we have 4 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.360
 it looks very well designed 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.580
 so how in 2003 the same right 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.619
 three have a facility to do what 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.450
 we make the movies and series that with 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.850
 this game cameras and animations that 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.650
 people have to do 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.660
 it's very easy for you to make movies with 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.430
 the sims now train 2004 to follow 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.180
 this same line was the trailer that I 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.830
 more like 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.540
 and it also gives me that I liked the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.640
 marketing is of richness that accompanied 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.989
 in the fanpage were following 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.270
 I was fine, brothers. 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.160
 anyway even taking only 50 seconds I am 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.050
 liking at least they're holding 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.989
 tracks daily in this working 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.430
 so they put it is the trailer a bit 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.800
 more for from the night they lay 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.560
 a poster of the video that will come out on 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.390
 another day, they put the theme there 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.130
 It will be and the five that will be there. 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.110
 featuring in which you are starring there 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.940
 the rail and they can after another day 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.220
 and does the same thing the night after 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.810
 trailer of the other is he can 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.459
 Your trailer for tomorrow I do not know if this 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.890
 will continue to be in the next 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.660
 week because we had four videos 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.489
 or five did not have five videos even in 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.110
 last week the second had a trailer 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.780
 talking about the new emotions after 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.730
 had started this one of characters is 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.769
 every day having do not know can be that 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.390
 continue next week of Monday 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.590
 until Friday because there are other characters 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.600
 that many people want to know who 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.330
 even I had a cesinha aside cowboy is 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.090
 everyone y'know right here O 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.340
 and then you may have to continue on 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.989
 rock trailer this much 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.340
 interesting this picture you are 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.660
 seeing deep inside I realized that I had 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.070
 a train passing right 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.930
 it is obvious that if the decor we go 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.519
 be able to have a train but leave a little 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.260
 neighborhood but I saw you can see it has 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.910
 there on the horizon below we can 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.100
 see things moving and everything 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.019
 more has even boring business shake of 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.030
 Everyone knows that, but that does not 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.410
 will disrupt the horizon where the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.299
 people can see everything will be very much 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.100
 greater in this neighborhood is more alive 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.720
 this point and also has this other 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.600
 image showing a bit of the buildings 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.670
 background had gone over is one more 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.620
 evidence that they are sometimes more alive and 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.810
 also that we will have all of this 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.209
 heart at first may be that later 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.799
 We have a neighborhood that 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.329
 these buildings these buildings for us 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.670
 can enter them and everything else is a 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.920
 expansion in the end we'll have this 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.500
 further confirmed by ie or 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.410
 that can be gained to the other neighboring 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.930
 other worlds with open neighborhoods 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.819
 with buildings with airplanes and we had 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.950
 much in 2002 that was only activated 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.670
 after the game is released after its 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.370
 base can be when the same 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.260
 in 2004 I said this on twitter and 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.600
 committees a bit in fanpage also in 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.889
 2002 came a little raw at the beginning and 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.240
 then when you put all the 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.770
 situations he has with all the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.900
 updates and everything else 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.100
 he turns a fantastic game is many 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.200
 interactions a lot you have to 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.860
 make four betting this month 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.660
 in that 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.400
 A lot is missing in the base but 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.770
 then there may be expansions and 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.730
 can be to meet this need to 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.400
 some things 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.870
 we made four not already come in the base game 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.790
