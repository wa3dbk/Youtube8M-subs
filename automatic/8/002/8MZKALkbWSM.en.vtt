and<00:01:47.729> whatnot<00:01:48.090> maybe<00:01:48.630> even<00:01:49.049> turn<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.799> into<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100

modern<00:02:18.780> transformers<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:19.860> they're<00:02:20.040> really

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
modern transformers but they're really

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.160 
modern transformers but they're really
an<00:02:20.550> 80s<00:02:21.000> icon<00:02:21.709> or<00:02:23.030> iconic<00:02:24.030> feature<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.690> old<00:02:24.840> g1

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
an 80s icon or iconic feature the old g1

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.820 
an 80s icon or iconic feature the old g1
toys<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:27.090> effect<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.170> very<00:02:28.349> difficult<00:02:28.560> to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
toys and the effect is very difficult to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.040 
toys and the effect is very difficult to
demonstrate<00:02:29.430> because<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.420> warm<00:02:30.720> right<00:02:31.019> now

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
demonstrate because it is warm right now

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.199 
demonstrate because it is warm right now
in<00:02:31.319> manila<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.010> lights<00:02:32.400> are<00:02:32.640> pretty<00:02:32.910> warm

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
in manila and the lights are pretty warm

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.869 
in manila and the lights are pretty warm
but<00:02:34.140> really<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.709> all<00:02:34.890> black<00:02:35.220> when<00:02:35.760> it

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
but really it's it's all black when it

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.970 
but really it's it's all black when it
begins<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.569> then<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.170> sort<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.530> rub<00:02:37.800> it

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
begins and then you you sort of rub it

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.509 
begins and then you you sort of rub it
and<00:02:38.910> then<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.300> will<00:02:39.450> reveal<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.140> shield<00:02:40.890> as<00:02:41.340> it

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
and then it will reveal the shield as it

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.210 
and then it will reveal the shield as it
were<00:02:41.670> or<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.120> faction<00:02:42.870> symbol<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.379> this<00:02:43.980> case

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
were or the faction symbol in this case

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.890 
were or the faction symbol in this case
since<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.640> already<00:02:44.819> been<00:02:45.120> revealed<00:02:45.599> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
since it's already been revealed the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.449 
since it's already been revealed the
more<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.260> rub<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.680> more<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.069> turns

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
more you rub it the more it just turns

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.380 
more you rub it the more it just turns
darker<00:02:49.640> yeah<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:53.700> pretty<00:02:53.910> cool<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.180> a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
darker yeah so it's pretty cool it's a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.290 
darker yeah so it's pretty cool it's a
nice<00:02:54.629> gimmick<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.050> what's<00:02:55.230> nice<00:02:55.379> about<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.769> is

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
nice gimmick and what's nice about it is

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.000 
nice gimmick and what's nice about it is
even<00:02:57.300> if<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:57.659> legends<00:02:58.019> figure<00:02:58.409> they've

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
even if it's a legends figure they've

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.070 
even if it's a legends figure they've
actually<00:02:59.280> made<00:02:59.489> smaller<00:02:59.970> stickers<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.780> them

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
actually made smaller stickers for them

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.050 
actually made smaller stickers for them
that<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.739> looks<00:03:01.920> class<00:03:02.159> figures<00:03:02.550> or<00:03:02.700> Voyager

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
that it looks class figures or Voyager

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.399 
that it looks class figures or Voyager
Class<00:03:03.209> figures<00:03:03.540> will<00:03:03.659> have<00:03:03.780> bigger<00:03:03.959> stickers

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
Class figures will have bigger stickers

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.899 
Class figures will have bigger stickers
conversely<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:06.409> let<00:03:07.409> me<00:03:07.580> show<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.610> how<00:03:08.849> to

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
conversely so let me show you how to

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.149 
conversely so let me show you how to
transform<00:03:09.510> him<00:03:09.750> very<00:03:10.140> easy<00:03:10.409> it's<00:03:10.860> actually

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
transform him very easy it's actually

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.280 
transform him very easy it's actually
it's<00:03:11.400> actually<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.790> very<00:03:12.090> nice<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.810> involved

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
it's actually a very nice and involved

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.839 
it's actually a very nice and involved
transformation<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> legends<00:03:14.580> class

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
transformation for a legends class

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.979 
transformation for a legends class
figure<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.450> pretty<00:03:16.349> amazed<00:03:17.480> very<00:03:18.480> well<00:03:18.750> done

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
figure and pretty amazed very well done

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.369 
figure and pretty amazed very well done
on<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.349> engineering<00:03:19.709> side<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:20.220> this<00:03:20.340> figure

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
on the engineering side of this figure

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.259 
on the engineering side of this figure
go<00:03:22.379> ahead<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.650> fold<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.519> arms<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.849> way<00:03:24.150> and

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
go ahead and fold the arms that way and

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.780 
go ahead and fold the arms that way and
the<00:03:24.360> chest<00:03:24.629> move<00:03:24.900> out<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.430> position<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.580> gun

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
the chest move out and position the gun

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.770 
the chest move out and position the gun
barrel<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.390> way<00:03:28.760> okay<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.060> then<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.299> fold

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
barrel that way okay and then just fold

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.330 
barrel that way okay and then just fold
up<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:32.150> legs<00:03:36.049> so<00:03:37.049> it's<00:03:37.319> pretty<00:03:37.560> cool<00:03:37.739> it's<00:03:38.010> a

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
up the legs so it's pretty cool it's a

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.580 
up the legs so it's pretty cool it's a
great<00:03:38.730> transformation<00:03:39.090> it's<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.870> great<00:03:40.170> aunt

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
great transformation it's a great aunt

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.030 
great transformation it's a great aunt
Maude<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:42.209> orange<00:03:42.569> tip<00:03:43.200> barrel<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.799> still

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
Maude and the orange tip barrel is still

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.880 
Maude and the orange tip barrel is still
there<00:03:44.330> I<00:03:45.330> was<00:03:45.810> expecting<00:03:46.110> something<00:03:46.440> else

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
there I was expecting something else

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.890 
there I was expecting something else
with<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.370> handle<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.909> was<00:03:48.150> expecting<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.720> be<00:03:48.810> a

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
with the handle I was expecting to be a

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.850 
with the handle I was expecting to be a
little<00:03:49.200> bit<00:03:49.409> narrower<00:03:49.860> but<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.819> is<00:03:51.860> it's

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
little bit narrower but it is it's

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.640 
little bit narrower but it is it's
pretty<00:03:53.069> big<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.580> mean<00:03:53.730> it's<00:03:54.060> not<00:03:54.180> as<00:03:54.650> realistic

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
pretty big I mean it's not as realistic

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.679 
pretty big I mean it's not as realistic
as<00:03:55.830> I'd<00:03:56.430> expect<00:03:56.909> it<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.239> be<00:03:59.150> but<00:04:00.150> what<00:04:00.450> can<00:04:00.599> you

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
as I'd expect it to be but what can you

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.610 
as I'd expect it to be but what can you
do<00:04:00.840> right<00:04:00.870> but<00:04:01.620> it's<00:04:01.920> okay<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.400> like<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:03.140> as<00:04:04.140> a

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
do right but it's okay I like it as a

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.309 
do right but it's okay I like it as a
toy<00:04:05.010> it's<00:04:05.430> pretty<00:04:05.700> cool<00:04:06.709> yeah

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
yeah me can you really mistake it for a

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.110 
yeah me can you really mistake it for a
real<00:04:11.530> gun<00:04:12.239> well<00:04:13.239> maybe<00:04:14.310> anyway<00:04:15.310> I'm<00:04:15.819> sure<00:04:15.999> you

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
real gun well maybe anyway I'm sure you

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.999 
real gun well maybe anyway I'm sure you
can<00:04:16.239> just<00:04:16.389> get<00:04:16.539> bash<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:17.019> repaint<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.620> silver

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:18.009 
can just get bash and repaint the silver

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.180 
can just get bash and repaint the silver
or<00:04:18.250> however<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:19.359> prefer<00:04:19.509> now<00:04:20.440> some<00:04:21.400> people

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
or however you prefer now some people

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.350 
or however you prefer now some people
right<00:04:24.190> well<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:25.720> said<00:04:26.199> that<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.620> know<00:04:26.740> the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
right well it said that you know the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.610 
right well it said that you know the
Starscream<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.570> masterpiece<00:04:29.110> torsion<00:04:29.500> can

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
Starscream the masterpiece torsion can

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.800 
Starscream the masterpiece torsion can
actually<00:04:29.919> hold<00:04:30.099> it<00:04:30.280> here's<00:04:30.820> my<00:04:31.000> dusty<00:04:31.599> very

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810

dusty Starscream I haven't actually had
a<00:04:33.940> chance<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.300> clean<00:04:34.509> my<00:04:34.630> transformer<00:04:35.259> so<00:04:35.470> this

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
a chance to clean my transformer so this

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.189 
a chance to clean my transformer so this
one<00:04:36.520> is<00:04:36.669> just<00:04:36.699> full<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.120> dust<00:04:37.479> so<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:37.870> do

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
one is just full of dust so I do

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.909 
one is just full of dust so I do
apologize<00:04:39.099> for<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.430> but<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:41.410> thumb<00:04:41.650> will

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
apologize for that but the thumb will

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.520 
apologize for that but the thumb will
fit<00:04:42.160> here<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:43.570> rest<00:04:43.780> of<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:43.960> fingers<00:04:44.169> will

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
fit here the rest of the fingers will

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.930 
fit here the rest of the fingers will
fit<00:04:44.770> in<00:04:44.979> between<00:04:45.099> these<00:04:45.460> two<00:04:45.729> tabs<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:48.639> guess

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
fit in between these two tabs so I guess

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.600 
fit in between these two tabs so I guess
he<00:04:49.060> can<00:04:49.210> only<00:04:49.539> hold<00:04:49.840> Megatron<00:04:50.680> with<00:04:51.009> his<00:04:51.250> right

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
he can only hold Megatron with his right

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.810 
he can only hold Megatron with his right
hand<00:04:52.120> obviously<00:04:53.699> let<00:04:54.699> me<00:04:54.849> just<00:04:55.380> show<00:04:56.380> you<00:04:56.410> that

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
hand obviously let me just show you that

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.110 
hand obviously let me just show you that
that's<00:04:57.820> pretty<00:04:58.030> cool<00:04:58.300> very<00:04:59.169> interesting<00:05:00.120> it's

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
that's pretty cool very interesting it's

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.629 
that's pretty cool very interesting it's
too<00:05:01.389> big<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:02.080> think<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.710> think<00:05:02.949> it's<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.220> forced

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
too big I think I think it's a forced

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.850 
too big I think I think it's a forced
thing<00:05:05.220> not<00:05:06.220> quite<00:05:06.550> sure<00:05:06.580> I<00:05:07.560> don't<00:05:08.560> really<00:05:08.740> like

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860

it that whole idea of a mat of this

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.820 
it that whole idea of a mat of this
scale<00:05:12.310> holding<00:05:12.729> and<00:05:12.849> it's<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.930> gun<00:05:14.169> it<00:05:14.349> the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
scale holding and it's to the gun it the

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.589 
scale holding and it's to the gun it the
alt<00:05:14.979> one<00:05:15.159> is<00:05:15.280> just<00:05:15.430> way<00:05:15.639> too<00:05:15.699> big<00:05:16.120> I<00:05:16.300> mean<00:05:16.509> they

surprised at staying on right now so in

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.360 
surprised at staying on right now so in
a<00:06:30.199> way<00:06:31.539> maybe<00:06:32.539> it'll<00:06:33.110> fit<00:06:33.169> a<00:06:33.349> scale<00:06:33.680> but<00:06:33.889> he's

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
a way maybe it'll fit a scale but he's

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.189 
a way maybe it'll fit a scale but he's
like<00:06:34.729> still<00:06:35.599> holding<00:06:36.020> a<00:06:36.139> huge<00:06:36.409> gun<00:06:36.800> which<00:06:38.199> in

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
terms of scale this gun looks small

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.210 
terms of scale this gun looks small
compared<00:06:42.530> to<00:06:42.650> this<00:06:42.800> big-ass<00:06:43.250> pistol<00:06:44.050> so<00:06:45.220> Annie

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220
