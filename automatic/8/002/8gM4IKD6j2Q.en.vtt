00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
with an update video it's been a long

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.120 
with an update video it's been a long
time<00:00:03.090> since<00:00:03.360> I've<00:00:03.840> done<00:00:04.080> one<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.319> these<00:00:04.470> so

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
time since I've done one of these so

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.880 
time since I've done one of these so
this<00:00:05.759> update<00:00:06.210> 0.8<00:00:06.839> point<00:00:07.080> zero<00:00:07.350> which<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
this update 0.8 point zero which is the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.860 
this update 0.8 point zero which is the
next<00:00:08.189> major<00:00:08.429> update<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.570> going<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.750> be

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
next major update it's going to be

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.709 
next major update it's going to be
packed<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.650> bunch<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.160> stuff<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.730> honestly

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
packed with a bunch of stuff I honestly

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.150 
packed with a bunch of stuff I honestly
think<00:00:12.960> most<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.380> things<00:00:13.620> are<00:00:13.799> like<00:00:13.920> for<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
think most of things are like for a

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.799 
think most of things are like for a
creative<00:00:14.400> mode<00:00:14.670> but<00:00:15.240> there<00:00:15.420> are<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.599> lot<00:00:15.780> of

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
creative mode but there are a lot of

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.330 
creative mode but there are a lot of
things<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.260> survivor<00:00:16.529> mode<00:00:16.710> as<00:00:16.859> well<00:00:16.890> so

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
things for a survivor mode as well so

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.380 
things for a survivor mode as well so
i'm<00:00:17.460> probably<00:00:17.640> going<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.910> be<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.150> over

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
i'm probably going to be going over

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.510 
i'm probably going to be going over
things<00:00:18.810> quick<00:00:19.289> because<00:00:19.619> there's<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.189> lot<00:00:20.490> of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
things quick because there's a lot of

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.340 
things quick because there's a lot of
things<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.000> are<00:00:21.150> brand<00:00:21.420> new<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.199> not<00:00:22.320> a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
things that are brand new and it's not a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.019 
things that are brand new and it's not a
lot<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.590> pictures<00:00:22.859> because<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.519> lot<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.760> things

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
lot of pictures because a lot of things

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.880 
lot of pictures because a lot of things
show<00:00:24.240> up<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.539> same<00:00:24.720> picture<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.380> i<00:00:25.619> think

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
show up in the same picture so i think

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.320 
show up in the same picture so i think
that's<00:00:26.130> way<00:00:26.340> better<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> get

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
that's way better so it's going to get

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.790 
that's way better so it's going to get
started<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.230> i<00:00:28.320> said<00:00:28.349> i'm<00:00:28.619> probably

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
started so like i said i'm probably

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.140 
started so like i said i'm probably
going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.189> going<00:00:29.279> over<00:00:29.490> things<00:00:29.789> i<00:00:29.970> already

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
going to be going over things i already

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.640 
going to be going over things i already
have<00:00:30.300> said<00:00:30.599> because<00:00:30.900> i<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.349> want<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> keep

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
have said because i just want to keep

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.380 
have said because i just want to keep
you<00:00:31.769> guys<00:00:31.859> updated<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.700> what's<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.270> on

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you guys updated on like what's going on

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.510 
you guys updated on like what's going on
with<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> new<00:00:33.899> update<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.920> let's<00:00:35.190> go<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
with the new update so let's go in and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.610 
with the new update so let's go in and
begin<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.840> already<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.320> got<00:00:37.440> mine

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
begin so we already know we got mine

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.650 
begin so we already know we got mine
cards<00:00:37.950> rails<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.610> minable<00:00:38.820> red<00:00:39.059> stones<00:00:39.390> mine

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
cards rails and minable red stones mine

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420 
cards rails and minable red stones mine
cards<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.230> rails<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.680> always<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.129> powered

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
cards and rails will always be powered

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.100 
cards and rails will always be powered
because<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.820> course<00:00:42.059> there<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.480> no<00:00:42.629> redstone

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
because of course there is no redstone

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.990 
because of course there is no redstone
you<00:00:43.590> only<00:00:43.800> mine<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.250> right<00:00:44.430> now<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.550> can't<00:00:44.850> use

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
you only mine it right now you can't use

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
you only mine it right now you can't use
it<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.539> think<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:45.930> actually<00:00:46.079> good

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it but I think that's actually good

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.720 
it but I think that's actually good
because<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.160> actually<00:00:47.190> start

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
because you can actually start

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.060 
because you can actually start
collecting<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.570> mine<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.739> that's

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
collecting it and mine it so that's

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.529 
collecting it and mine it so that's
really<00:00:50.309> cool<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:50.879> mine<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.300> but

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
really cool that you can now mine it but

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
really cool that you can now mine it but
you<00:00:51.660> can't<00:00:51.840> use<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.140> yet<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.530> we're<00:00:53.430> gonna<00:00:53.520> have

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you can't use it yet so we're gonna have

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.209 
you can't use it yet so we're gonna have
to<00:00:53.760> wait<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.120> next<00:00:55.110> thing<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.649> had<00:00:55.770> 3d

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
to wait for that next thing we had 3d

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.189 
to wait for that next thing we had 3d
clouds<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> picture<00:00:57.539> 3d

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
clouds you can see in the picture 3d

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.900 
clouds you can see in the picture 3d
clouds<00:00:58.440> were<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:58.949> probably<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
clouds were was probably like one of the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.939 
clouds were was probably like one of the
first<00:01:00.180> things<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.539> were<00:01:00.719> added<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.590> also<00:01:01.739> got

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
first things that were added we also got

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.429 
first things that were added we also got
sideways<00:01:02.250> logs<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.000> sponges<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> whole

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
sideways logs and sponges and a whole

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.990 
sideways logs and sponges and a whole
bunch<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.739> other<00:01:04.799> cool<00:01:05.280> blocks<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.939> are

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
bunch of other cool blocks that are

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.820 
bunch of other cool blocks that are
added<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.450> creative<00:01:06.810> mode<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.439> sure<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
added to creative mode not sure if you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.140 
added to creative mode not sure if you
can<00:01:07.890> craft<00:01:08.189> them<00:01:08.400> yet<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.610> survival<00:01:09.119> mode

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
can craft them yet in survival mode

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.490 
can craft them yet in survival mode
because<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.990> jungle<00:01:10.260> wood

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
because we don't have like jungle wood

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
because we don't have like jungle wood
and<00:01:10.650> stuff<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.280> survival<00:01:11.640> mode<00:01:11.670> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and stuff like that in survival mode so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.130 
and stuff like that in survival mode so
we'll<00:01:12.180> probably<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.810> wait<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:12.990> see

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
we'll probably just have to wait and see

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
we'll probably just have to wait and see
so<00:01:13.890> next<00:01:14.040> feature<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.549> was<00:01:14.640> added<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:15.180> also

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
so next feature that was added we also

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.899 
so next feature that was added we also
got<00:01:15.570> pumpkins<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.290> pumpkin<00:01:17.250> pie<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
got pumpkins and pumpkin pie so that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
got pumpkins and pumpkin pie so that

halloween<00:01:21.900> update<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> don't<00:01:22.680> think<00:01:22.799> that's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
halloween update so I don't think that's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.020 
halloween update so I don't think that's
really<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.460> happening<00:01:23.640> because

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
really going to be happening because

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.080 
really going to be happening because
Halloween<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.259> close<00:01:25.590> so

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
Halloween is like you know close so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.859 
Halloween is like you know close so
we're<00:01:27.090> probably<00:01:27.270> not<00:01:27.479> gonna<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
we're probably not gonna have a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.109 
we're probably not gonna have a
halloween<00:01:28.259> update<00:01:28.520> they<00:01:29.520> also<00:01:29.700> added<00:01:29.970> some

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
halloween update they also added some

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.359 
halloween update they also added some
new<00:01:30.270> crops<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.960> carrots<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> potatoes<00:01:31.619> so

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
new crops like carrots and potatoes so

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.800 
new crops like carrots and potatoes so
you<00:01:32.460> actually<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:33.180> crops<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> plant

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you actually have more crops to plant

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
you actually have more crops to plant
instead<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.829> wheat<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.549> finally

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
instead of just wheat so you can finally

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.730 
instead of just wheat so you can finally
have<00:01:36.030> more<00:01:36.240> crops<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.750> your<00:01:36.900> farm<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.409> farms

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
have more crops in your farm so farms

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.929 
have more crops in your farm so farms

render<00:01:50.130> distance<00:01:50.250> has<00:01:50.640> been<00:01:50.850> improved<00:01:51.270> or

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
render distance has been improved or

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.450 
render distance has been improved or
increase<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.500> actually<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:53.009> more

farther<00:01:53.790> down<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> map<00:01:54.600> also<00:01:54.840> this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
farther down in the map also this

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.840 
farther down in the map also this
picture<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.829> pretty<00:01:56.040> interesting<00:01:56.280> because<00:01:56.640> if

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
picture is pretty interesting because if

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.069 
picture is pretty interesting because if
you<00:01:56.939> look<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.240> hot<00:01:57.450> bar<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.960> actually

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
you look in a hot bar we can actually

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.990 
you look in a hot bar we can actually
see<00:01:58.409> barbed<00:01:58.799> wire<00:01:59.070> fence<00:01:59.399> which<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.759> very

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
see barbed wire fence which is very

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670 
see barbed wire fence which is very
unexpected<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:00.930> them<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.170> add<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.530> update

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
unexpected for them to add and update

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.709 
unexpected for them to add and update
also<00:02:02.310> another<00:02:02.729> thing<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.540> see

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
also another thing is you can see

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.899 
also another thing is you can see
carpets<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.649> think<00:02:04.950> carpets<00:02:05.610> are<00:02:05.729> going<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
carpets so I think carpets are going to

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.980 
carpets so I think carpets are going to
look<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.180> cool<00:02:06.479> when<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.689> put<00:02:06.869> them<00:02:06.960> in

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
look really cool when you put them in

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.660 
look really cool when you put them in
the<00:02:07.079> house<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> guess<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.459> cool<00:02:08.610> to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the house so I guess it's really cool to

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
the house so I guess it's really cool to
be<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> update<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.050> I'll<00:02:10.200> find<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.440> picture

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.440 
be in the update so I'll find a picture
we<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:11.009> we<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.819> cool<00:02:12.030> view<00:02:12.239> of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
interesting part of the picture is

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.410 
interesting part of the picture is
actually<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.680> hot<00:02:17.890> bar<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:19.060> different

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.460 
there's a better picture so that is
really<00:02:27.850> cool<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.330> they<00:02:28.450> added<00:02:28.570> more<00:02:28.870> that

they added different leaf colors so also

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.330 
they added different leaf colors so also
let's<00:02:31.810> go<00:02:31.930> back<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.290> hotbar<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.190> see

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.160 
let's go back to the hotbar you can see
the<00:02:33.490> added<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.820> haystack<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.510> compass<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.110> a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
haystack not sure why it's there it's

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.980 
haystack not sure why it's there it's
probably<00:02:39.310> going<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.670> be<00:02:39.730> useless<00:02:40.120> unless<00:02:40.540> they

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
probably going to be useless unless they

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.050 
probably going to be useless unless they
did<00:02:41.230> add<00:02:41.410> horses<00:02:41.950> but<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.460> don't<00:02:42.700> see<00:02:42.820> how<00:02:42.940> they

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
did add horses but I don't see how they

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.240 
did add horses but I don't see how they
could<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.270> added<00:02:43.540> horses<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.410> mean<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.070> it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
could have added horses I mean like it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.680 
could have added horses I mean like it
doesn't<00:02:45.460> even<00:02:45.580> make<00:02:45.790> sense<00:02:45.850> them<00:02:46.390> adding

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
doesn't even make sense them adding

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.180 
doesn't even make sense them adding
horses<00:02:47.080> at<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.350> point<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.830> game<00:02:47.860> because

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
horses at this point in the game because

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.100 
horses at this point in the game because
you<00:02:48.610> know<00:02:48.700> there's<00:02:48.940> nothing<00:02:49.150> there's<00:02:49.930> not<00:02:50.080> a

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
you know there's nothing there's not a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.990 
you know there's nothing there's not a
lot<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.290> things<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.710> game<00:02:50.890> yet<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.370> they

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
lot of things in the game yet and they

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.730 
lot of things in the game yet and they
already<00:02:52.120> have<00:02:52.300> haystack<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.900> horse<00:02:53.260> but<00:02:53.590> out

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
already have haystack and horse but out

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.530 
already have haystack and horse but out
even<00:02:54.010> though<00:02:54.130> we<00:02:54.820> still<00:02:55.060> don't<00:02:55.240> know<00:02:55.300> if<00:02:55.420> they

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
even though we still don't know if they

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.150 
even though we still don't know if they
had<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.660> horse's<00:02:56.080> staff<00:02:56.290> said<00:02:56.650> nothing<00:02:57.070> about

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
had a horse's staff said nothing about

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.100 
had a horse's staff said nothing about
horses<00:02:57.490> so<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.270> we're<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.510> even<00:02:58.630> sure<00:02:58.930> if<00:02:59.020> the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
horses so so we're not even sure if the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.870 
horses so so we're not even sure if the
haystack<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.830> going<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.070> be<00:03:00.190> in<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.460> game<00:03:00.610> or

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
haystack is going to be in the game or

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.130 
haystack is going to be in the game or
it<00:03:01.120> probably<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.720> be<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.990> game

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
it probably is going to be in the game

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.320 
it probably is going to be in the game
just<00:03:02.440> no<00:03:02.650> horses<00:03:03.070> or<00:03:03.250> probably<00:03:03.670> horses<00:03:04.090> we

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
just no horses or probably horses we

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.460 
just no horses or probably horses we
don't<00:03:04.480> really<00:03:04.600> know<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.050> we're<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.260> gonna

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
don't really know so we're just gonna

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.780 
don't really know so we're just gonna
have<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.680> wait<00:03:05.740> and<00:03:06.010> find<00:03:06.070> out<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.550> see<00:03:06.730> if

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
have to wait and find out and see if

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.880 
have to wait and find out and see if
they<00:03:06.910> had<00:03:07.030> horses<00:03:07.360> I<00:03:07.810> honestly<00:03:08.290> think<00:03:08.620> they

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
they had horses I honestly think they

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.590 
they had horses I honestly think they
did<00:03:09.070> not<00:03:09.160> add<00:03:09.340> horses<00:03:09.790> they<00:03:10.060> just<00:03:10.090> added<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
did not add horses they just added the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.210 
did not add horses they just added the
haystack<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:11.050> they're<00:03:11.320> thinking<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:12.070> adding

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
haystack and they're thinking of adding

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.550 
haystack and they're thinking of adding
horses<00:03:12.820> in<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.510> future<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.020> that's<00:03:14.200> why<00:03:14.380> they

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
horses in the future so that's why they

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.560 
horses in the future so that's why they
probably<00:03:14.770> added<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.190> haystack<00:03:15.580> also<00:03:16.450> they

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
probably added the haystack also they

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.150 
probably added the haystack also they
did<00:03:16.750> fix<00:03:16.960> a<00:03:17.080> lot<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.380> bugs<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.710> were<00:03:17.890> in<00:03:18.040> the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
did fix a lot of bugs that were in the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.640 
did fix a lot of bugs that were in the
game<00:03:18.310> such<00:03:18.910> as<00:03:19.090> fire<00:03:19.390> can<00:03:19.690> now<00:03:19.810> ignite<00:03:20.140> tnt

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
game such as fire can now ignite tnt

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.110 
game such as fire can now ignite tnt
which<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:21.010> really<00:03:21.250> cool<00:03:21.490> a<00:03:21.550> lot<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.820> people<00:03:21.940> are

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
which is really cool a lot of people are

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.450 
which is really cool a lot of people are
waiting<00:03:22.270> for<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.690> for<00:03:23.110> fire<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.650> ignite<00:03:23.980> TNT

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
waiting for that for fire to ignite TNT

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.400 
waiting for that for fire to ignite TNT
and<00:03:24.760> also<00:03:25.450> not<00:03:25.600> sure<00:03:25.660> if<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.930> guys<00:03:26.050> notice
