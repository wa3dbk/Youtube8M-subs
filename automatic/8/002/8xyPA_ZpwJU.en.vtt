to your arm and then the headphones but
the<00:00:51.239> headphones<00:00:51.600> would<00:00:51.780> always<00:00:52.020> fall<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the headphones would always fall out and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.630 
the headphones would always fall out and
I'd<00:00:53.280> always<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.980> lacking<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I'd always be like lacking them out of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.700 
I'd always be like lacking them out of
the<00:00:56.820> way<00:00:56.969> when<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.360> was<00:00:57.539> doing<00:00:57.690> burpees<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.440> star

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the way when I was doing burpees or star

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.529 
the way when I was doing burpees or star
jumps<00:00:59.039> or<00:00:59.160> whatever<00:00:59.430> because<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.300> like

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
jumps or whatever because you know like

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.240 
jumps or whatever because you know like
your<00:01:01.050> arm<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.469> gets<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.859> way<00:01:01.949> because

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
your arm just gets in the way because

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.410 
your arm just gets in the way because
you're<00:01:02.399> doing<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.640> these<00:01:02.789> whole<00:01:03.149> body

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you're doing all these whole body

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.859 
you're doing all these whole body
exercises<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> basically<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.330> gave<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.720> on

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
exercises so I basically just gave up on

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.289 
exercises so I basically just gave up on
listening<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.470> music<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.880> never<00:01:09.030> really

before Christmas it's just gonna take

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.150 
before Christmas it's just gonna take
maybe<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.880> guess<00:04:32.090> five<00:04:32.390> days<00:04:32.660> longer<00:04:33.010> unless<00:04:34.010> I

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
maybe I guess five days longer unless I

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.520 
maybe I guess five days longer unless I
you<00:04:34.370> know<00:04:34.460> don't<00:04:35.180> have<00:04:35.300> any<00:04:35.630> rest<00:04:35.930> days<00:04:36.170> but<00:04:36.500> I

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
you know don't have any rest days but I

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.080 
you know don't have any rest days but I
think<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.950> still<00:04:37.010> want<00:04:37.370> to<00:04:37.400> have<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.580> few<00:04:37.880> rest

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
think I still want to have a few rest

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.480 
think I still want to have a few rest
days<00:04:38.300> in<00:04:38.540> between<00:04:38.740> so<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:40.690> injured<00:04:41.690> myself<00:04:41.840> and

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
days in between so I injured myself and

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.910 
days in between so I injured myself and
couldn't<00:04:43.490> work<00:04:43.580> out<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:44.720> it<00:04:45.530> was<00:04:45.680> really

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
couldn't work out so it was really

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.290 
couldn't work out so it was really
frustrating<00:04:46.130> for<00:04:46.670> me<00:04:46.820> because<00:04:46.850> that's<00:04:47.090> like

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
frustrating for me because that's like

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.540 
frustrating for me because that's like
you<00:04:47.450> come<00:04:48.020> in<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.290> really<00:04:48.650> lose<00:04:49.160> all<00:04:49.430> this

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
you come in you really lose all this

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.700 
you come in you really lose all this
weight<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.330> weighed<00:04:50.660> myself<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.470> even

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
weight so I weighed myself and even

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.310 
weight so I weighed myself and even
though<00:04:51.980> today<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.760> it's<00:04:53.000> been<00:04:53.210> two<00:04:53.810> weeks<00:04:53.840> now

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
though today and it's been two weeks now

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.670 
though today and it's been two weeks now
I've<00:04:54.650> lost<00:04:54.830> two<00:04:55.190> pounds<00:04:55.400> which<00:04:56.390> like<00:04:57.110> you<00:04:57.560> know

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
I've lost two pounds which like you know

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.500 
I've lost two pounds which like you know
I'm<00:04:57.860> happy<00:04:58.220> with<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:58.970> kind<00:04:59.240> of<00:04:59.300> thought<00:04:59.450> I

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
I'm happy with but I kind of thought I

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.510 
I'm happy with but I kind of thought I
would<00:04:59.720> lose<00:04:59.900> more<00:05:00.350> within<00:05:00.770> this<00:05:01.040> look<00:05:01.280> this

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
would lose more within this look this

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.180 
would lose more within this look this
first<00:05:01.820> two<00:05:02.030> weeks<00:05:02.590> but<00:05:03.590> maybe<00:05:03.890> it's<00:05:04.100> because

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
first two weeks but maybe it's because

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.770 
first two weeks but maybe it's because
I've<00:05:04.430> been<00:05:04.460> gaining<00:05:04.940> muscle

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
I've been gaining muscle

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.170 
I've been gaining muscle

I don't really know we'll see I'm just

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.560 
I don't really know we'll see I'm just

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.910 
weeks I'm sure the results will be good
I<00:05:14.030> mean<00:05:14.180> I'm<00:05:14.330> already<00:05:14.480> looking<00:05:14.900> leaner<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.860> I

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
I mean I'm already looking leaner and I

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.890 
I mean I'm already looking leaner and I
can<00:05:16.130> already<00:05:16.310> see<00:05:16.670> the<00:05:16.750> muscle<00:05:17.750> definition

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
can already see the muscle definition

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.050 
can already see the muscle definition
especially<00:05:18.830> on<00:05:18.950> my<00:05:19.070> stomach<00:05:19.340> popping<00:05:19.880> out<00:05:20.030> a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
especially on my stomach popping out a

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.730 
especially on my stomach popping out a
lot<00:05:20.390> more<00:05:20.690> than<00:05:20.960> when<00:05:21.110> I<00:05:21.140> first<00:05:21.410> came<00:05:21.590> back

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
lot more than when I first came back

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.530 
lot more than when I first came back
from<00:05:22.070> India

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
from India

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.480 
from India
I'll<00:05:23.750> show<00:05:24.140> you<00:05:24.200> hang<00:05:24.860> on

so<00:05:30.490> yeah<00:05:30.699> I<00:05:31.360> think<00:05:31.449> I<00:05:31.690> see<00:05:31.870> a<00:05:31.900> difference<00:05:32.259> from

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
so yeah I think I see a difference from

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.770 
so yeah I think I see a difference from
the<00:05:32.620> before<00:05:32.979> photo<00:05:33.310> stuck<00:05:33.790> to<00:05:33.970> you<00:05:34.090> I<00:05:34.360> think<00:05:34.690> I

the before photo stuck to you I think I

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.420
