 the thyme and a cube of beef broth 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.950
 we will save the meat from all sides 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.800
 and we will put the pepper also with 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.130
 all sides 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.950
 this leads to taste 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.170
 we will put a casserole on the fire more or 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.290
 less than the size of the meat 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.200
 we will add oil when the oil 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.750
 it is very hot we will donate the meat 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.740
 so that he is left with nothing we put the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.740
 meat in the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.470
 looking for the return 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.470
 Hello 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.820
 we will take them out we will reserve 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.540
 we have cut all the vegetables in 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.700
 small pieces 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.840
 Above all you have to look at the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.840
 tomato that is peeled 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.260
 When the onion is transparent , 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.580
 let's put the tomatoes we will move it and 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.580
 we will let him suffer all 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.340
 are subscribed we'll see you 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.520
 and we understand white wine 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.990
 we will let 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.879
 I forgot I put you now 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.970
 next 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.290
 the meat rubito is very expensive 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.430
 and we have put the water to boil because 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.040
 whenever we add water to the stews 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.560
 of meat 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.250
 you have to put the hot water and so the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.250
 meat does not harden 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.980
 we remove a little everything 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.660
 and now already always in the fire well under 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.660
 we'll cover and let the pooch 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.640
 it's been 30 minutes and now we're going to 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.720
 turn the meat around so that it goes 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.720
 knowing with my picture 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.630
 the sauce is bleeding us we 're going to 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.630
 put a little more boiling water 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.000
 as we will see a little bit 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.000
 again of the chucha 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.930
 it's been an hour and a quarter since we have 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.960
 practically the finished meat in addition 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.960
 they left super super low and now we're going to 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.870
 download the plums with a little bit of 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.639
 boiling water in a boat we will throw the 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.070
 plums and when I go back to elvis 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.070
 we will extinguish the fire and the tails 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.780
 in a pan we are going to fry the 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.780
 mushrooms 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:56.520
 we put the mushrooms in the pan 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.520
 d 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.840
 so much salt 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.270
 and kidnap 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.460
 ah 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.639
 well we try to discover 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.150
 we have not put salt on the roast now what 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.150
 let's try 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.000
 a little 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:45.320
 and as you will see the sauce I did not pass it 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:51.860
 the masher can be shredded or if not 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:54.319
 it can be left with the waste 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.240
 onion and leather is now also 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.330
 the moment to incorporate many 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.349
 millions 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.349
 and the plums 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.170
 and let it cook for 10 minutes 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.170
 as much 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.600
 and all together if he lacks if I saw him 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:16.130
 and make the sauce you put a little 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.130
 of water always hot 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.490
 at 10 minutes 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.160
 and we 're going and we 're going to leave the meat that 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.490
 cool to be able to cut the in 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.490
 slices 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.110
 the thread 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.800
 we will cut the meat as finely as 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.800
 we can 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.659
 this veal dish can be taken 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:14.479
 cold if you're going to take it cold then it's 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:16.939
 better cut in the last in the last 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:19.400
 moment before serving him and putting the 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:21.700
 very hot sauce on top but the 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.220
 another option is now 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.500
 I'm going to put the pieces of meat inside 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.800
 of the sauce and heat it and this dish does not 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.420
 you can always prepare in advance 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.840

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:38.270
