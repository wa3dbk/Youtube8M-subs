stomach was fert was was working

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
stomach was fert was was working
perfectly<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:13.080> would<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.350> loss<00:01:13.619> of

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
perfectly it would have loss of

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.520 
perfectly it would have loss of
digestive<00:01:14.369> enzyme<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.170> with<00:01:16.170> lots<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
digestive enzyme and with lots of

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.719 
digestive enzyme and with lots of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
digestive enzyme it has lots of mucus to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.749 
digestive enzyme it has lots of mucus to
protect<00:01:21.060> itself<00:01:21.390> from<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> acid<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.759> they've

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
protect itself from the acid and they've

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.060 
protect itself from the acid and they've
established<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.390> by<00:01:24.840> age<00:01:25.080> eight<00:01:25.470> many

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
established that by age eight many

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.649 
established that by age eight many
children<00:01:26.549> stomachs<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.119> already<00:01:27.479> gone<00:01:27.600> into

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
crap and it really does have an effect

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.560 
crap and it really does have an effect
because<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> lot<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.030> people<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.540> can

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
because a lot of people think they can

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.780 
because a lot of people think they can
just<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.290> know<00:01:43.350> II<00:01:43.590> crappy<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.159> day<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.579> then

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
just you know II crappy one day and then

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.889 
just you know II crappy one day and then
the<00:01:44.820> next<00:01:44.970> day<00:01:45.210> they're<00:01:45.450> told<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the next day they're told you get a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.270 
the next day they're told you get a
brand<00:01:46.110> new<00:01:46.229> starting<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> doesn't<00:01:47.159> happen

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
brand new starting but it doesn't happen

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.510 
brand new starting but it doesn't happen
that<00:01:47.490> way<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.820> an<00:01:47.880> accumulation<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.340> by<00:01:50.340> age

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
that way it's an accumulation and by age

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.590 
that way it's an accumulation and by age
40<00:01:51.350> most<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.590> us<00:01:52.680> are<00:01:53.070> right<00:01:53.729> down<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.210> very

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
40 most of us are right down with very

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.830 
40 most of us are right down with very
very<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:54.990> digestive<00:01:55.619> enzyme<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.390> with

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
very little digestive enzyme and so with

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.399 
very little digestive enzyme and so with
the<00:01:57.930> less<00:01:58.140> acid<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.719> the<00:02:00.719> stomach<00:02:00.990> makes

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the less acid you have the stomach makes

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.800 
the less acid you have the stomach makes
less<00:02:01.710> mucus<00:02:02.130> why<00:02:03.090> make<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> whole<00:02:03.570> bunch<00:02:03.719> of

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
less mucus why make a whole bunch of

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.359 
less mucus why make a whole bunch of
mucus<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.649> hit<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.860> piddly<00:02:05.250> little

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
mucus you just hit this piddly little

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.600 
mucus you just hit this piddly little
bit<00:02:05.640> acid<00:02:06.060> your<00:02:06.210> stomach<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.829> for<00:02:08.009> years<00:02:08.220> I

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
bit acid your stomach and so for years I

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.790 
bit acid your stomach and so for years I
used<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.360> had<00:02:09.509> an<00:02:09.599> over<00:02:09.869> acid<00:02:10.229> stomach

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
used to think I had an over acid stomach

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.830 
used to think I had an over acid stomach
and<00:02:11.040> this<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.310> what<00:02:11.460> was<00:02:11.580> happening<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.720> you've

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
and this is what was happening so you've

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.170 
and this is what was happening so you've
got<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.110> little<00:02:13.650> bit<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.860> acid<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.610> little<00:02:15.090> bit

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
got this little bit of acid a little bit

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.510 
got this little bit of acid a little bit
of<00:02:15.270> mucus<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.050> then<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:16.680> some<00:02:17.100> charcoal

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
of mucus and then you have some charcoal

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.070 
of mucus and then you have some charcoal
you'll<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> beer<00:02:18.150> you'll<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.690> coffee

you'll have a beer you'll have a coffee
you'll<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:21.150> know<00:02:21.180> an<00:02:21.660> orange<00:02:22.170> or<00:02:22.350> tomato

you'll have you know an orange or tomato
something<00:02:24.210> that's<00:02:24.360> acidic<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.250> it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
something that's acidic and it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.580 
something that's acidic and it
immediately<00:02:26.460> dries<00:02:26.970> up<00:02:27.300> stomach<00:02:27.600> acid<00:02:28.110> but

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
immediately dries up stomach acid but

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.980 
immediately dries up stomach acid but
then<00:02:28.740> there's<00:02:28.890> no<00:02:29.040> protection<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
then there's no protection so it

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.190 
then there's no protection so it
irritates<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.560> walls<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:32.070> your<00:02:32.100> stomach<00:02:33.200> and

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
irritates the walls of your stomach and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.120 
irritates the walls of your stomach and
your<00:02:34.280> stomach<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:36.000> spasms<00:02:36.960> so<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.200> tightens<00:02:37.440> it

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
your stomach it spasms so it tightens it

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.150 
your stomach it spasms so it tightens it
squishes<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.960> squishes<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.590> solution<00:02:40.890> up

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
squishes so it squishes this solution up

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.530 
squishes so it squishes this solution up
into<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> esophagus<00:02:41.700> where<00:02:42.210> there's<00:02:42.390> no

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
into the esophagus where there's no

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.030 
into the esophagus where there's no
mucus<00:02:42.900> at<00:02:43.020> all<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.710> we<00:02:43.830> feel<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
mucus at all and so that we feel the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.490 
mucus at all and so that we feel the
burning<00:02:44.430> up<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.240> here<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:46.200> at<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.440> moment

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
burning up in here so at that moment

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.260 
burning up in here so at that moment
just<00:02:47.130> like<00:02:47.250> wow<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.430> have<00:02:47.670> an<00:02:47.760> over<00:02:47.970> acid

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
just like wow I have an over acid

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.910 
just like wow I have an over acid
stomach<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.720> I'm<00:02:48.900> reaching<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.320> an<00:02:49.560> antacid

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
stomach so I'm reaching for an antacid

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.670 
stomach so I'm reaching for an antacid
so<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:50.880> had<00:02:51.030> tongues<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.480> rolaids<00:02:51.750> everywhere

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
so I had tongues and rolaids everywhere

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
wash machine was folding they're

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.950 
wash machine was folding they're
everywhere<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.550> had<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.270> happen<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.630> survive

everywhere I had to happen to survive
and<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:59.340> I<00:03:00.120> saw<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.630> had<00:03:00.690> struggled<00:03:01.440> with<00:03:01.560> this

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
and and I saw I had struggled with this

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.260 
and and I saw I had struggled with this
now<00:03:02.640> your<00:03:02.820> stomach<00:03:03.210> is<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:05.760> goes<00:03:05.940> through<00:03:06.180> your

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
now your stomach is it goes through your

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.850 
now your stomach is it goes through your
diaphragm<00:03:06.600> which<00:03:06.960> is<00:03:07.080> fastened<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.560> your<00:03:07.590> ribs

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
diaphragm which is fastened to your ribs

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.830 
diaphragm which is fastened to your ribs
and<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.910> kind<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.090> pulls<00:03:09.330> up<00:03:09.510> through<00:03:09.690> there

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
and it kind of pulls up through there

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.320 
and it kind of pulls up through there
and<00:03:10.050> your<00:03:10.370> esophagus<00:03:11.370> here<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.730> fastened<00:03:12.210> to

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
and your esophagus here is fastened to

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.130 
and your esophagus here is fastened to
your<00:03:12.360> lips<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.950> as<00:03:14.390> it<00:03:15.390> tightens<00:03:15.900> it

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
your lips and so as it tightens it

your lips and so as it tightens it
struggling<00:03:17.130> against<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.670> diaphragm<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
struggling against this diaphragm and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.510 
struggling against this diaphragm and
the<00:03:19.140> whole<00:03:19.320> thing<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.620> tightening<00:03:20.340> so

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
the whole thing is tightening so

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.460 
the whole thing is tightening so
something<00:03:20.850> needs<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.180> be<00:03:21.360> in<00:03:21.450> here<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:21.930> it's

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
something needs to be in here so it's

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.440 
something needs to be in here so it's
like<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:23.610> know<00:03:23.640> it's<00:03:23.880> either<00:03:24.060> going<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.239> suck

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
like you know it's either going to suck

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.600 
like you know it's either going to suck
your<00:03:24.480> head<00:03:24.750> down<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.920> know<00:03:26.070> which<00:03:26.280> doesn't

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
your head down you know which doesn't

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.580 
your head down you know which doesn't
usually<00:03:26.700> happen<00:03:27.030> or<00:03:27.450> your<00:03:27.989> stomach<00:03:28.350> starts

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
usually happen or your stomach starts

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.220 
usually happen or your stomach starts
pulling<00:03:29.010> up<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.720> diaphragm<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:31.200> I

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
pulling up to this diaphragm and so I

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.590 
pulling up to this diaphragm and so I
get<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.470> bulge<00:03:31.800> up<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.220> there<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.670> that's<00:03:33.450> what

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
get to bulge up in there and that's what

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.410 
get to bulge up in there and that's what
a<00:03:33.630> hiatus<00:03:33.989> hernia<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.940> stretches<00:03:36.150> that

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
a hiatus hernia is and it stretches that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.330 
a hiatus hernia is and it stretches that
valve<00:03:36.720> out<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:37.050> place<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.440> there<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.070> the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
valve out of place in there so to the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.040 
valve out of place in there so to the
point<00:03:38.370> where<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.910> can<00:03:39.060> lay<00:03:39.209> down<00:03:39.239> an<00:03:39.540> item<00:03:39.870> the

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
point where you can lay down an item the

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.540 
point where you can lay down an item the
ass<00:03:40.260> he<00:03:40.530> can<00:03:40.680> run<00:03:40.800> right<00:03:40.980> into<00:03:41.010> your<00:03:41.280> throat

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
ass he can run right into your throat

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.729 
ass he can run right into your throat
and<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.020> where<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:43.230> problem<00:03:43.560> comes

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
and so this is where this problem comes

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.800 
and so this is where this problem comes
from<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.160> now<00:03:44.280> some<00:03:44.820> people<00:03:44.940> could<00:03:45.180> say<00:03:45.360> well<00:03:45.780> I

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
from so now some people could say well I

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.780 
from so now some people could say well I
have<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.170> genetically<00:03:46.709> short<00:03:46.920> esophagus<00:03:47.520> so<00:03:47.700> it

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
have a genetically short esophagus so it

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.430 
have a genetically short esophagus so it
had<00:03:47.910> my<00:03:48.270> stomach<00:03:48.600> had<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.900> stretch<00:03:49.170> up<00:03:49.410> through

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
had my stomach had to stretch up through

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.530 
had my stomach had to stretch up through
this<00:03:49.770> diaphragm<00:03:50.130> for<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.330> work<00:03:51.510> but

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
this diaphragm for it to it to work but

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.530 
this diaphragm for it to it to work but
of<00:03:51.930> course<00:03:52.110> that's<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:52.500> true<00:03:53.120> people<00:03:54.120> did<00:03:54.420> it

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
of course that's not true people did it

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.500 
of course that's not true people did it
on<00:03:54.660> their<00:03:54.780> own<00:03:54.930> with<00:03:55.230> with<00:03:55.500> their<00:03:55.680> diet<00:03:56.510> now

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
on their own with with their diet now

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.600 
on their own with with their diet now
sometimes<00:03:58.410> people<00:03:58.709> don't<00:03:58.770> experience<00:03:59.220> this

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
sometimes people don't experience this

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.940 
sometimes people don't experience this
to<00:03:59.940> a<00:04:00.180> great<00:04:00.570> extent<00:04:00.989> but<00:04:01.260> they<00:04:01.380> do<00:04:01.440> notice<00:04:01.800> a

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
to a great extent but they do notice a

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.560 
to a great extent but they do notice a
pressure<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.550> here<00:04:02.730> but<00:04:02.940> they<00:04:03.060> notice<00:04:03.330> more

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
pressure in here but they notice more

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.900 
pressure in here but they notice more
problems<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.350> elsewhere<00:04:04.800> because<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
problems and elsewhere because the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.370 
problems and elsewhere because the
biggest<00:04:06.270> problem<00:04:06.630> that<00:04:06.690> comes<00:04:06.900> from<00:04:07.140> this

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
biggest problem that comes from this

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.520 
biggest problem that comes from this
from<00:04:08.220> low<00:04:08.370> digestive<00:04:08.880> enzyme<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:10.320> you're

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
from low digestive enzyme is is you're

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.830 
from low digestive enzyme is is you're
not<00:04:10.590> digesting<00:04:11.100> your<00:04:11.130> food<00:04:11.250> properly<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.120> so

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
not digesting your food properly and so

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.810 
not digesting your food properly and so
what<00:04:12.989> happens<00:04:13.410> then<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.890> your<00:04:14.070> food<00:04:14.400> start

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
what happens then is your food start

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.840 
what happens then is your food start
passing<00:04:15.000> down<00:04:15.560> undigested<00:04:16.730> especially<00:04:17.730> your

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
passing down undigested especially your

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.590 
passing down undigested especially your
proteins<00:04:18.299> are<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.020> hardest<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.440> break<00:04:19.710> down

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
proteins are the hardest to break down

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.629 
proteins are the hardest to break down
so<00:04:21.600> as<00:04:21.750> they<00:04:21.870> start<00:04:22.080> passing<00:04:22.260> down<00:04:22.710> into<00:04:23.340> the

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
so as they start passing down into the

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.320 
so as they start passing down into the
test<00:04:23.789> times<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.900> your<00:04:25.050> liver<00:04:25.259> is<00:04:26.330> absorbing

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
test times and your liver is absorbing

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.550 
test times and your liver is absorbing
these<00:04:27.449> nutrients<00:04:28.050> up<00:04:28.699> into<00:04:29.699> itself<00:04:30.530> so<00:04:31.530> that

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
these nutrients up into itself so that

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.189 
these nutrients up into itself so that
it<00:04:31.770> can<00:04:31.919> transfer<00:04:32.340> into<00:04:32.490> your<00:04:32.699> bloodstream

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
it can transfer into your bloodstream

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.499 
it can transfer into your bloodstream
and<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:35.340> will<00:04:35.430> pick<00:04:35.580> up<00:04:35.699> these<00:04:35.879> chunks<00:04:36.419> of

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
and it will pick up these chunks of

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:37.879 
and it will pick up these chunks of
protein<00:04:37.020> they<00:04:37.229> were<00:04:37.289> supposed<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.800> be

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
protein they were supposed to be

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.379 
protein they were supposed to be
emulsified<00:04:38.219> but<00:04:38.849> now<00:04:38.999> they<00:04:39.150> were<00:04:39.210> being

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
emulsified but now they were being

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.929 
emulsified but now they were being
observed<00:04:39.629> up<00:04:39.930> in<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.139> chunk<00:04:40.469> and<00:04:40.740> that's<00:04:41.729> where

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:41.939 
observed up in a chunk and that's where

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.700 
observed up in a chunk and that's where
your<00:04:42.029> food<00:04:42.210> allergies<00:04:42.659> come<00:04:42.870> from<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.319> a<00:04:43.529> food

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
your food allergies come from and a food

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.649 
your food allergies come from and a food
allergy<00:04:44.029> specialist<00:04:45.029> will<00:04:45.150> tell<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:45.449> that

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
allergy specialist will tell you that

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.269 
allergy specialist will tell you that
it's<00:04:45.870> always<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.259> protein<00:04:46.710> in<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.919> food<00:04:47.129> that

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:47.279 
it's always the protein in the food that

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.369 
it's always the protein in the food that
your<00:04:47.430> body<00:04:47.580> reacts<00:04:47.969> to<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.479> why<00:04:49.080> is<00:04:49.139> your<00:04:49.289> body

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
your body reacts to and why is your body

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.709 
your body reacts to and why is your body
reacting<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.159> a<00:04:50.189> protein<00:04:50.639> because<00:04:51.419> you<00:04:51.539> don't

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
reacting to a protein because you don't

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:53.179 
reacting to a protein because you don't
have<00:04:51.749> the<00:04:51.930> digestive<00:04:52.379> enzyme<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:52.860> break<00:04:52.889> it

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:53.189 
have the digestive enzyme to break it

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.340 
have the digestive enzyme to break it
down
