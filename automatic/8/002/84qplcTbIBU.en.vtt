a hundred years old and leveling a house
like<00:00:11.059> this<00:00:11.089> can<00:00:11.539> run<00:00:11.690> into<00:00:11.869> the<00:00:11.989> thousands<00:00:12.619> of

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:12.739 
like this can run into the thousands of

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.379 
like this can run into the thousands of
dollars<00:00:12.799> but<00:00:13.400> it's<00:00:13.549> something<00:00:13.909> in<00:00:13.999> an<00:00:14.089> economy

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
dollars but it's something in an economy

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.269 
dollars but it's something in an economy
like<00:00:14.599> this<00:00:15.019> that<00:00:15.289> you<00:00:15.409> might<00:00:15.559> consider<00:00:15.829> doing

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
like this that you might consider doing

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.060 
like this that you might consider doing
yourself<00:00:16.880> it's<00:00:17.660> not<00:00:17.900> rocket<00:00:18.199> science<00:00:18.380> it<00:00:18.890> just

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
yourself it's not rocket science it just

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.859 
yourself it's not rocket science it just
requires<00:00:19.460> some<00:00:19.580> common<00:00:20.119> sense<00:00:20.330> and<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.660> little

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
requires some common sense and a little

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.900 
requires some common sense and a little
know-how<00:00:21.109> this<00:00:22.039> is<00:00:22.189> something<00:00:22.580> I've<00:00:22.730> done

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
know-how this is something I've done

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.239 
know-how this is something I've done
several<00:00:23.390> times<00:00:23.509> and<00:00:24.169> I<00:00:24.230> decided<00:00:24.619> you<00:00:24.769> know<00:00:24.890> I

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:25.249 
several times and I decided you know I

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.460 
several times and I decided you know I
might<00:00:25.519> as<00:00:25.640> well<00:00:25.789> just<00:00:26.089> make<00:00:26.599> a<00:00:26.660> video<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.259> show

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
might as well just make a video and show

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.900 
might as well just make a video and show
some<00:00:27.679> people<00:00:27.949> how<00:00:28.039> to<00:00:28.070> do<00:00:28.279> this<00:00:28.429> because<00:00:28.789> I've

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
some people how to do this because I've

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.249 
some people how to do this because I've
got<00:00:29.089> on<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.300> internet<00:00:29.659> and<00:00:29.839> tried<00:00:30.019> to<00:00:30.140> learn

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
got on the internet and tried to learn

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.989 
got on the internet and tried to learn
and<00:00:30.499> there's<00:00:30.619> there<00:00:31.279> are<00:00:31.310> a<00:00:31.400> few<00:00:31.519> good<00:00:31.669> videos

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
and there's there are a few good videos

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.939 
and there's there are a few good videos
out<00:00:32.239> there<00:00:32.270> but<00:00:32.689> for<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:33.170> most<00:00:33.230> part<00:00:33.469> it's

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
out there but for the most part it's

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.189 
out there but for the most part it's
kind<00:00:34.070> of<00:00:34.340> hard<00:00:34.550> to<00:00:34.640> find<00:00:35.210> a<00:00:35.360> video<00:00:35.629> on<00:00:35.809> YouTube

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
kind of hard to find a video on YouTube

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.060 
kind of hard to find a video on YouTube
that<00:00:36.469> really<00:00:36.710> breaks<00:00:36.949> it<00:00:37.190> down<00:00:38.559> step<00:00:39.559> by<00:00:39.739> step

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
that really breaks it down step by step

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.069 
that really breaks it down step by step
and<00:00:40.370> some<00:00:40.609> do<00:00:40.820> they<00:00:41.059> do<00:00:41.120> a<00:00:41.239> great<00:00:41.390> job<00:00:41.719> I'm<00:00:41.899> not

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
and some do they do a great job I'm not

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.049 
and some do they do a great job I'm not
going<00:00:42.260> to<00:00:42.350> dog<00:00:42.680> them<00:00:43.010> but<00:00:43.309> I<00:00:43.430> decided<00:00:43.820> I'll

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
going to dog them but I decided I'll

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.759 
going to dog them but I decided I'll
throw<00:00:44.329> a<00:00:44.359> video<00:00:44.719> into<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.079> mix<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:47.769> I'm

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
throw a video into the mix and so I'm

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.479 
throw a video into the mix and so I'm
right<00:00:49.010> outside<00:00:49.629> this<00:00:50.629> is<00:00:51.109> was<00:00:51.679> originally<00:00:51.800> you

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
blocks sunk in the mud you can see them

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.800 
blocks sunk in the mud you can see them
the<00:01:19.910> mud<00:01:20.150> line<00:01:20.420> here<00:01:20.870> they<00:01:21.560> just<00:01:22.690> set<00:01:23.690> them

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
the mud line here they just set them

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.230 
the mud line here they just set them
like<00:01:23.990> this<00:01:24.260> on<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.830> ground<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.370> all<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.120> way

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
like this on the ground and all the way

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.060 
like this on the ground and all the way
to<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.420> house<00:01:26.600> basically<00:01:27.230> push<00:01:27.530> them<00:01:27.770> into

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
to the house basically push them into

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.120 
to the house basically push them into
the<00:01:28.250> dirt<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:30.020> that<00:01:30.320> tells<00:01:30.590> me<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:31.010> the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
the dirt and so that tells me that the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.710 
the dirt and so that tells me that the
last<00:01:31.340> person<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.820> level<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:32.150> house<00:01:32.390> was<00:01:32.600> an

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
last person to level this house was an

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.220 
last person to level this house was an
amateur<00:01:33.050> because<00:01:33.620> it<00:01:33.860> only<00:01:34.130> makes<00:01:34.460> sense<00:01:34.580> that

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
amateur because it only makes sense that

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.780 
amateur because it only makes sense that
something<00:01:36.230> with<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.380> small<00:01:36.740> end<00:01:37.040> like<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.370> pin

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
something with a small end like a pin

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.450 
something with a small end like a pin
will<00:01:38.270> go<00:01:38.680> into<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.770> ground<00:01:39.980> when<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.310> put

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
will go into the ground when you put

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.740 
will go into the ground when you put
weight<00:01:40.610> on<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:40.820> what<00:01:41.090> happens<00:01:41.450> when<00:01:41.660> an

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
weight on it what happens when an

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.690 
weight on it what happens when an
elephant<00:01:41.990> stands<00:01:42.470> on<00:01:42.620> a<00:01:42.650> nail<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.160> punches<00:01:43.550> it

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
elephant stands on a nail it punches it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.500 
elephant stands on a nail it punches it
into<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.060> ground

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
into the ground

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.230 
into the ground
so<00:01:44.990> what<00:01:45.590> I've<00:01:45.710> done<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:46.010> put<00:01:46.510> 16<00:01:48.130> inch<00:01:49.130> by<00:01:49.460> 16

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
so what I've done is put 16 inch by 16

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.590 
so what I've done is put 16 inch by 16
inch<00:01:50.480> pads<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.560> are<00:01:51.620> four<00:01:51.920> inches<00:01:52.280> thick

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
inch pads that are four inches thick

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.140 
inch pads that are four inches thick
under<00:01:53.600> these<00:01:53.750> cinder<00:01:54.110> blocks<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:55.030> like<00:01:56.030> an

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
under these cinder blocks and like an

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.680 
under these cinder blocks and like an
elephant's<00:01:56.570> foot<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:58.310> will<00:01:58.610> stay<00:01:58.970> on<00:01:59.000> top<00:01:59.510> of

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
elephant's foot it will stay on top of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.660 
elephant's foot it will stay on top of
the<00:01:59.780> ground<00:02:00.050> now<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.470> will<00:02:00.650> settle<00:02:00.980> some<00:02:01.370> there

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
the ground now it will settle some there

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.280 
the ground now it will settle some there
will<00:02:01.820> always<00:02:02.120> have<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.390> be<00:02:02.480> leveling<00:02:02.870> has<00:02:03.110> to

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
will always have to be leveling has to

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.290 
will always have to be leveling has to
be<00:02:03.380> done<00:02:03.560> periodically<00:02:04.010> after<00:02:04.550> rains<00:02:04.820> but<00:02:05.180> if

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
be done periodically after rains but if

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.540 
be done periodically after rains but if
we<00:02:05.420> can<00:02:05.570> keep<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:06.020> skirt<00:02:06.500> on<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:06.920> house<00:02:07.190> and

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
we can keep a skirt on this house and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.509 
we can keep a skirt on this house and
keep<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.719> water<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.200> moisture<00:02:09.319> out<00:02:09.799> then<00:02:10.369> it

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
keep the water and moisture out then it

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.069 
keep the water and moisture out then it
will<00:02:10.759> stay<00:02:11.030> pretty<00:02:11.239> close<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.840> its<00:02:11.989> original

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
will stay pretty close to its original

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.040 
will stay pretty close to its original
position

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
position

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.800 
position
and<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.720> use<00:02:15.800> 20-ton<00:02:16.970> hydraulic<00:02:17.970> jacks<00:02:18.390> I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and so I use 20-ton hydraulic jacks I

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.620 
and so I use 20-ton hydraulic jacks I
don't<00:02:19.560> use<00:02:19.710> three-ton<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.610> don't<00:02:20.880> use<00:02:21.030> 10-ton

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
don't use three-ton I don't use 10-ton

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.650 
don't use three-ton I don't use 10-ton
12<00:02:22.050> time<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.830> time<00:02:23.100> we're<00:02:24.000> lifting<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.420> huge

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
12 time to time we're lifting a huge

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.840 
12 time to time we're lifting a huge
house<00:02:24.930> here<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.770> not<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.980> dollhouse<00:02:26.280> this

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
house here this is not a dollhouse this

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.920 
house here this is not a dollhouse this
is<00:02:27.000> serious<00:02:27.420> business

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
is serious business

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.030 
is serious business
and<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.800> we<00:02:28.920> need<00:02:29.240> serious<00:02:30.410> lifting<00:02:31.410> power<00:02:31.650> I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and so we need serious lifting power I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.260 
and so we need serious lifting power I

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
this on top of it and then then lift so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.310 
this on top of it and then then lift so
we<00:03:04.340> need<00:03:05.340> something<00:03:05.670> between<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.990> concrete

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
we need something between the concrete

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.720 
we need something between the concrete
and<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:09.390> beams<00:03:09.959> because<00:03:10.590> they<00:03:11.100> can<00:03:11.310> serve<00:03:11.550> as

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
and the beams because they can serve as

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.180 
and the beams because they can serve as
highways<00:03:12.090> for<00:03:12.330> termites<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.050> so<00:03:13.680> what<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.890> use

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
highways for termites and so what I use

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.520 
highways for termites and so what I use
I<00:03:14.490> just<00:03:14.700> get<00:03:14.910> cedar<00:03:15.420> fence<00:03:15.720> posts<00:03:16.230> at<00:03:16.350> Home

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
know termites don't like it so I put it

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.490 
know termites don't like it so I put it
between<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.040> beams<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.989> cinder<00:03:25.260> blocks

between the beams and the cinder blocks

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.800 
between the beams and the cinder blocks
in<00:03:25.709> some<00:03:26.640> places<00:03:26.910> I'll<00:03:27.180> actually<00:03:27.360> put<00:03:27.720> the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
in some places I'll actually put the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.509 
in some places I'll actually put the
metal<00:03:28.140> I'll<00:03:28.320> put<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.709> quarter<00:03:29.040> inch<00:03:29.190> steel

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
metal I'll put the quarter inch steel

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.770 
metal I'll put the quarter inch steel
between<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.820> concrete<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.540> wood

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
between the concrete and the wood

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.449 
between the concrete and the wood
because<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.530> termites<00:03:34.950> aren't<00:03:35.130> going

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
because the termites aren't going

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.080 
because the termites aren't going
through<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:40.100> it's<00:03:41.100> really<00:03:41.400> important<00:03:41.940> that

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
through that it's really important that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.620 
through that it's really important that
the<00:03:42.600> beams<00:03:43.290> be<00:03:43.739> made<00:03:43.950> out<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.280> two<00:03:44.970> by<00:03:45.150> sixes

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
the beams be made out of two by sixes

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.210 
the beams be made out of two by sixes
and<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.019> they're<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:47.390> two<00:03:48.390> boards<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.019> width

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
what I do is I place several Jack's

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
between it and in the beams just for

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.289 
between it and in the beams just for
just<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.410> keep<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.739> level<00:04:17.950> but<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:18.790> wasn't

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
just to keep it level but that wasn't

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.640 
just to keep it level but that wasn't
really<00:04:19.390> necessary<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.140> could<00:04:20.350> have<00:04:20.440> put

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
anything in there but it's always good

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.000 
anything in there but it's always good
to<00:04:22.540> use<00:04:22.570> something<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.080> termites<00:04:23.560> won't<00:04:23.800> eat

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
to use something that termites won't eat

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
I had the jack on top of that I need to

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.420 
I had the jack on top of that I need to
get<00:04:32.050> that<00:04:32.169> out<00:04:32.230> of<00:04:32.560> there<00:04:32.710> because<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.250> will

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
get that out of there because it will

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.360 
get that out of there because it will
attract<00:04:33.760> termites<00:04:34.300> all<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.620> wood<00:04:35.800> all<00:04:36.310> the

little blocks of wood that you leave
under<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.290> house<00:04:38.470> will<00:04:39.010> attract<00:04:39.370> termites<00:04:39.820> so

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
under the house will attract termites so

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.230 
under the house will attract termites so
just<00:04:40.210> don't<00:04:40.390> do<00:04:40.600> that<00:04:40.780> if<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.080> want<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:42.240> this

there<00:06:06.640> and<00:06:07.090> I<00:06:07.210> lift<00:06:07.479> it<00:06:07.600> up<00:06:07.720> a<00:06:07.810> little<00:06:07.960> bit

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
there and I lift it up a little bit

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.750 
there and I lift it up a little bit
just<00:06:09.010> to<00:06:09.130> change<00:06:09.520> out<00:06:09.820> that<00:06:09.850> cedar<00:06:11.550> that<00:06:12.550> piece

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
just to change out that cedar that piece

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.360 
just to change out that cedar that piece
of<00:06:12.940> cedar<00:06:13.180> on<00:06:13.390> top<00:06:13.630> of<00:06:13.810> the<00:06:13.930> block<00:06:14.200> I<00:06:14.560> did<00:06:15.190> have

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
of cedar on top of the block I did have

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.310 
of cedar on top of the block I did have
one<00:06:15.550> of<00:06:15.580> these<00:06:15.760> pieces<00:06:16.419> of<00:06:16.630> steel<00:06:16.870> under<00:06:17.169> there

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
one of these pieces of steel under there

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.600 
one of these pieces of steel under there
and<00:06:17.410> I<00:06:17.470> just<00:06:17.680> switched<00:06:17.860> it<00:06:17.979> out<00:06:18.070> I<00:06:18.130> didn't<00:06:18.460> lift

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
and I just switched it out I didn't lift

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.219 
and I just switched it out I didn't lift
it<00:06:18.729> up<00:06:18.849> much<00:06:19.090> but<00:06:19.390> if<00:06:19.510> I<00:06:19.599> was<00:06:19.750> going<00:06:19.900> to<00:06:19.930> lift<00:06:20.110> it

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
it up much but if I was going to lift it

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:20.610 
it up much but if I was going to lift it
up

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
up

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.070 
up
more<00:06:20.890> than<00:06:21.040> that<00:06:21.190> I<00:06:21.430> would<00:06:22.180> go<00:06:22.330> along<00:06:22.600> that's

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
more than that I would go along that's

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.710 
more than that I would go along that's
what<00:06:23.200> I<00:06:23.350> originally<00:06:23.440> did<00:06:24.010> I<00:06:24.340> went<00:06:25.210> along<00:06:25.510> the

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
what I originally did I went along the

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.550 
what I originally did I went along the
whole<00:06:25.930> beam

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
whole beam

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.510 
whole beam
I<00:06:26.590> put<00:06:26.950> Jax<00:06:27.600> next<00:06:28.600> to<00:06:28.720> at<00:06:29.020> least<00:06:29.170> one<00:06:29.530> J<00:06:29.800> next<00:06:30.310> to

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
I put Jax next to at least one J next to

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.370 
I put Jax next to at least one J next to
each<00:06:30.670> set<00:06:31.210> of<00:06:31.330> blocks<00:06:31.540> that<00:06:31.780> are<00:06:31.900> holding<00:06:32.260> up

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
each set of blocks that are holding up

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.260 
each set of blocks that are holding up
the<00:06:32.530> beam<00:06:32.710> and<00:06:32.920> I<00:06:33.280> lifted<00:06:33.580> it<00:06:33.730> all<00:06:33.850> up<00:06:34.090> together

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
the beam and I lifted it all up together

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.240 
the beam and I lifted it all up together
I<00:06:34.570> lift<00:06:34.840> it<00:06:34.930> up<00:06:35.080> one<00:06:35.290> a<00:06:35.320> little<00:06:35.620> bit<00:06:35.770> went<00:06:36.070> down

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
I lift it up one a little bit went down

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.820 
I lift it up one a little bit went down
the<00:06:36.430> way<00:06:36.550> lift<00:06:36.820> it<00:06:36.940> up<00:06:37.060> more<00:06:37.410> you<00:06:38.410> know<00:06:38.500> lift<00:06:38.710> it

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
the way lift it up more you know lift it

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.050 
the way lift it up more you know lift it
up<00:06:38.950> with<00:06:39.130> the<00:06:39.220> next<00:06:39.460> one<00:06:39.580> a<00:06:39.640> little<00:06:39.790> bit<00:06:40.030> a

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
up with the next one a little bit a

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.370 
up with the next one a little bit a
little<00:06:40.390> bit<00:06:40.510> with<00:06:40.720> the<00:06:40.780> next<00:06:41.020> one<00:06:41.140> with<00:06:41.320> the

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
little bit with the next one with the

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.900 
little bit with the next one with the
next<00:06:41.530> one<00:06:41.710> the<00:06:41.770> next<00:06:41.860> one<00:06:42.160> then<00:06:42.310> go<00:06:42.340> back<00:06:42.670> and

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
next one the next one then go back and

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.000 
next one the next one then go back and
start<00:06:43.210> over<00:06:43.390> you<00:06:44.110> want<00:06:44.320> to<00:06:44.380> lift<00:06:44.470> up<00:06:44.620> too<00:06:44.830> much

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
start over you want to lift up too much

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.100 
start over you want to lift up too much
in<00:06:45.160> one<00:06:45.310> place<00:06:45.550> or<00:06:45.760> you<00:06:45.880> will<00:06:46.150> break<00:06:46.510> the<00:06:46.870> beam

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
in one place or you will break the beam

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.350 
in one place or you will break the beam
and<00:06:47.350> so<00:06:48.310> then<00:06:48.610> you've<00:06:48.850> got<00:06:49.000> a<00:06:49.030> big<00:06:49.210> problem

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
and so then you've got a big problem

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.090 
and so then you've got a big problem
you've<00:06:49.780> got<00:06:49.810> to<00:06:49.990> replace<00:06:50.200> that<00:06:50.530> which<00:06:50.770> is<00:06:50.920> more

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
you've got to replace that which is more

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.970 
you've got to replace that which is more
trouble<00:06:51.580> than<00:06:51.700> it's<00:06:51.820> worth<00:06:51.940> so<00:06:52.510> just<00:06:52.980> don't

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 
trouble than it's worth so just don't

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.780 
trouble than it's worth so just don't
try<00:06:54.220> to<00:06:54.280> do<00:06:54.400> too<00:06:54.430> much<00:06:54.760> at<00:06:54.970> one<00:06:55.150> time<00:06:56.610> or<00:06:57.610> don't

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
try to do too much at one time or don't

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.110 
try to do too much at one time or don't
try<00:06:58.000> to<00:06:58.060> lift<00:06:58.650> the<00:06:59.650> beam<00:06:59.830> too<00:07:00.100> high<00:07:00.430> at<00:07:00.850> one

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
try to lift the beam too high at one

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.150 
try to lift the beam too high at one
time<00:07:01.390> but<00:07:01.660> don't<00:07:01.870> be<00:07:02.050> a<00:07:02.080> hesitant<00:07:02.650> to<00:07:02.710> go<00:07:02.920> along

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
time but don't be a hesitant to go along

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.430 
time but don't be a hesitant to go along
the<00:07:03.400> entire<00:07:03.730> beam<00:07:04.060> to<00:07:04.570> lift<00:07:04.600> it<00:07:04.930> all<00:07:05.050> up<00:07:05.260> a

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
the entire beam to lift it all up a

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.970 
the entire beam to lift it all up a
little<00:07:05.650> bit<00:07:05.860> at<00:07:05.980> a<00:07:06.100> time<00:07:06.130> so<00:07:07.170> these<00:07:08.170> beams<00:07:08.440> they

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:08.980 
little bit at a time so these beams they

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.850 
little bit at a time so these beams they
run<00:07:09.250> throughout<00:07:09.670> the<00:07:10.050> beams<00:07:11.050> like<00:07:11.260> this<00:07:11.500> run

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
run throughout the beams like this run

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.780 
run throughout the beams like this run
you<00:07:12.310> know<00:07:12.400> there's<00:07:12.580> one<00:07:12.910> every<00:07:13.180> so<00:07:13.660> many<00:07:14.230> feet

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:14.790 
you know there's one every so many feet

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.370 
you know there's one every so many feet
throughout<00:07:15.790> the<00:07:16.030> the<00:07:16.510> entire<00:07:16.840> hat<00:07:17.110> you<00:07:17.260> know

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380 
throughout the the entire hat you know

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.720 
throughout the the entire hat you know
all<00:07:17.560> the<00:07:17.710> way<00:07:17.800> across<00:07:18.070> the<00:07:18.280> bottom<00:07:18.430> of<00:07:18.580> the

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730 
all the way across the bottom of the

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.970 
all the way across the bottom of the
entire<00:07:19.030> house<00:07:19.330> so<00:07:19.840> this<00:07:20.080> even<00:07:20.740> though<00:07:20.830> we're

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:20.980 
entire house so this even though we're

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.190 
entire house so this even though we're
outside<00:07:21.430> you're<00:07:21.760> seeing<00:07:22.090> exactly<00:07:22.840> what

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.200 
outside you're seeing exactly what

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.040 
outside you're seeing exactly what
you're<00:07:23.350> going<00:07:23.500> to<00:07:23.620> do<00:07:24.150> under<00:07:25.150> the<00:07:25.180> house<00:07:25.450> with

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.050 
you're going to do under the house with

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.840 
you're going to do under the house with
the<00:07:26.170> next<00:07:26.410> beam<00:07:26.590> 8<00:07:26.770> 8<00:07:27.250> or<00:07:27.400> 10<00:07:27.580> feet<00:07:27.610> over

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850 
the next beam 8 8 or 10 feet over

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:34.730 
the next beam 8 8 or 10 feet over
there's<00:07:28.300> another<00:07:28.480> one<00:07:28.690> just<00:07:28.870> like<00:07:28.960> it<00:07:29.110> and<00:07:29.410> so

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.200 

that's<00:07:35.740> it<00:07:35.980> if<00:07:36.100> you<00:07:36.130> have<00:07:36.220> any<00:07:36.340> questions<00:07:36.940> feel

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 
I'm sure I can I just could get the time

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.840 
I'm sure I can I just could get the time
to<00:07:45.930> check<00:07:46.930> the<00:07:47.170> post
