00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.750
 I would like to express to tell you my sorrows 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.879
 all my joy that you saved me a 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.040
 good day you came to my life you gave me a 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.050
 way to go and tuned for 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.810
 sing the hands that touch the keys 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.300
 of a strong piano with his eyes melody 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.790
 they say mouths that quiet empty streets 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.800
 you will feel my mind 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.899
 which answers me to that next point 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.059
 he asks me to write that he walks straight 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.130
 that live the present of ugly truths 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.829
 nice lies that I can dance though 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.960
 It's raining to change color to my gray to 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.210
 watercolor leave the mud the soles 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.340
 clay that is clay that creates ceramics 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.560
 new and paint your smile my face 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.570
 invite you on the beach one night 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.550
 August take you to the hell of the forest 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.920
 Heaven gives you the appearance of love 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.720
 unknown train with poems that posts 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.460
 they recite the story of a madman from a 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.380
 monster of a learned who wants to forget 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.899
 and simultaneously remember and face what 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.010
 there will be a gift of applause 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.170
 to thank us 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.630
 is to make the riva a trick of magic 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.330
 juggling I become vowels for 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.830
 balance me in every circumstance 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.020
 risk your life more scenarios and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.360
 send a hug to my neighborhood 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.479
 familiar with the near by much 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.180
 that travel be and end each song come to 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.940
 starboard a ship sails with crew 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.610
 it does not have a motor and in a rudder it defends 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.770
 the couple with the heart poem I wear the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.229
 bottle that is a desire I leave the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.090
 stars can return to laredo with what 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.870
 I love most sciences were made 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.660
 parallel arts 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.900
 resist danger I will be remembered by thousands 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.760
 of friends so many reasons the most 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.010
 important is that you come with me and 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.840
 blows I receive and I have never been taken care of and 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.120
 I was lost I found your love 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.420
 dislikes and messes that makes sense 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.820
 to remain uneasy is my greatest relief the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.850
 break the rules proved all amazement as 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.830
 a performance of millions of works that 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.710
 they take sound art forms 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.560
 Regain meaning by creating life 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.880
 live singing I do not speak to you dance 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.490
 improvising is stepping on without looking at where 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.520
 you're walking you imagine a world without 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.500
 art you would not see his body when photographing 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.600
 you the flowers without land the parks without 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.150
 air guitar without rope the dances and 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.650
 I danced without being able to inspire 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.349
 culture makes the one who wants free 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.000
 escape 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.239
 manifesting leaves so artist to rise 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.700
 in each song they see a starboard boat 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.400
 sail with crew does not have an engine 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.220
 has a rudder defends the pairs with the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.230
 heart poem I carry the bottle there 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.510
 a wish I leave the stars can 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.520
 return to yearning with what I most want 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.070
 the sciences became parallel arts 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.530
 come to write on a ship sail with 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.110
 crew does not have a motor has a 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.810
 rudder defends the couple with the heart 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.090
 poem I carry the bottle and there is a wish 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.950
 I let the stars be able to return to 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.200
 Laredo with what I love the most 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.200
 sciences were made parallel arts
