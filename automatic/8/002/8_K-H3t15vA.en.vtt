00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello to all friends today I'll show you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.849
 a trick that floor or the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.980
 problem that every time it restarts 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.770
 the computer the internet connection 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.650
 sharing comes off internet cherie 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.650
 practically jol the modem attached to the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.080
 computer without having a router the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.529
 computer share the connection 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.949
 internet very protected to others 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.730
 devices such as playstation computers 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.460
 iphone 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.399
 just that every time i restart it 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.340
 disconnects what 's once gone 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.920
 very well and even if it has activated in 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.800
 reality does not work 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.020
 I looked at the new system a little 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.270
 leo x snow leopard wants to stop sta 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 what but in the latest updates 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.620
 they have this disability for 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 security problems anyway how do you do a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.829
 rehabilitate it every time one 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.019
 ball no problem with car m 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.350
 this is an auto m application 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.030
 he does it and I show you the beautiful thing 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.670
 that we macintosh years have that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.820
 maybe on the pc it works also but ugly 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.720
 to see instead on the mac or this one 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:24.689
 launch application is practically 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.119
 active all marelli sulpice very fast 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.299
 you do a second, but on the mac it is a lot 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.970
 more beautiful because it shows just the right 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.659
 actions that I am competing with and that are 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:43.560
 moves and disables re-activates to start 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:46.409
 you are not sure you are then closed 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
 now the connection is active e 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.590
 active and we can go to the other 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.590
 room where the other computer is 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.009
 I was just downloading some pictures that 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.009
 I have 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.100
 my camera very professional 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.400
 now with the mega battery under a lot 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.400
 prof 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.260
 what is the juice football boyfriend 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:33.960
 we are here some photos taken this morning 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:35.690
 this is her and 1.4 natural was there for 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.130
 there I saw there is a lizard 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.430
 newborn baby 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:46.220
 he still had the pacifier in his mouth and I have it 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.990
 found and now we see it if it is so 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.140
 nothing fancy however you can 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.000
 see the conformation of the face of 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.000
 more scarce looks like that 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.330
 alien eyes fired big 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.420
 there is a lot of cheekbones if we and 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.270
 we take the ears off is a 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.920
 alien them and gati descend from 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.440
 aliens 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.840
 obviously they lost some of their skills 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.989
 intelligence things like that is a tad 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.850
 they lost it but it was the former cacciola 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:29.730
 but then this was raining 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:32.370
 the other day a bit of rain a little 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.120
 contrast looks if not effect of 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.160
 photoshop 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:42.660
 in reality it is a true photo it seems to effect 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.780
 dry brass that one there but still not 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:51.239
 we came here we see the aler 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.390
 postcard that the object over there one 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.360
 sage leaf that you can also see 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.930
 the sand like the fast antonina es 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.390
 he will have all the hands that smell like sage 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:10.350
 it is never and she is sowing a little is a bit 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:11.680
 sow the chameleon-like facet with 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.790
 eyes that turn 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:23.979
 behind but who has this is very beautiful 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:39.100
 because you see that little paws 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:41.130
 let's see if I have yet to find that one 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.130
 right 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:58.270
 the nose this crisis sim a little a gecko 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:04.539
 but it is not a gecko because the legs do not 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:09.090
 they are from jacko from the gates co with is said 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:12.690
 ah ah ah this is not this is 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.690
 focused yes but 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.050
 let's pretend we chose this 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.680
 the first thing to do is the hume e 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.289
 look if white lobby launched well 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.669
 but maybe even this now the 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.569
 white need to find something 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:39.270
 white that I don't have maybe this is fine 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:42.240
 but it's better to leave a little on 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:46.800
 green so it looks more like nature is beautiful 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:51.990
 green then we shoot the rai brains immediately 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.090
 at the most, however, the go benz practically 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.580
 increases to color situations I do n't know 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:14.490
 then do a little good 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:18.750
 clarity then obviously draws compare 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:24.389
 the photo obviously using the rule 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:27.750
 four thirds of Marco Gex but now there 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:31.770
 then he wants bla bla bla bla bla then yes 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.500
 puts some noise for this photo is 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.770
 was taken at 400 iso now 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:42.110
 expect a little noise here 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:47.409
 disappeared and that's enough then really 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:50.399
 mika concert 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:50.399
 tombolini 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.669
 the life 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.970
