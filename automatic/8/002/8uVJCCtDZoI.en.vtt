00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.660
 let's start with the most common enemy of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.630
 try weak and slow try us 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.830
 grab and give us their tips 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.859
 shooting them to the arms is possible 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.170
 that we leave them stunned or fetri with 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.449
 these onces shoot us bones are 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.760

 explosive these 11 approach us 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.360
 and explode with shooting them from afar will be 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.190
 enough the good thing is that we can 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.649
 use them to defeat other enemies 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.680
 to kill them the best the gun or the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.270

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.370
 thorns that make them much more 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.230
 dangerous that the rest of the time we 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.239
 can stun and have a wide range 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.610
 of attack with the shotgun to short 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.559
 we will slow them down by shooting them 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.260
 in the extremities it is possible that they 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.059
 let us daze lobster the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.579

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.900
 It hurts them, yes, in the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.090
 chapter 12 we find them in the water 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.180
 and they are lethal if they catch us 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.640
 dead come wolves fined that we 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.740
 they attack in the snow phases still being 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.050
 they catch us we're dead 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.710
