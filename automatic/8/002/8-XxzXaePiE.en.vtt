00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.089
 Hello dear audience 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.359
 It's about time for the first trailer 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.650
 second season of switch is out of necessity 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.609
 for those who are still wrestling 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.310
 have to orient 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.260
 trudi cfc is the first season was 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.910
 pretty much the best thing about watching TV 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.500
 what I ever read but that's it 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.670
 for me personally even brad pitt and 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.410
 the second season is exactly her 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.850
 say american horror story so me 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.469
 The following states are always a new one 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.030
 story or punishment we now grab 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.950
 a new area, too, I am right 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.469
 curious which special unit itself 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.270
 Specialize will definitely be 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.370
 a super super kasseler because topping 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.800
 even the scale at 1, we have 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.989
 Buyer I really like 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.180

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.260
 As we say, we set off 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 augenschein 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.540

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:13.660
 1 of june as soon as you get one you get this one 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.980
 Trader at one minute was up 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.480
 So facebook is publishing it 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.090

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.620
 actually only a small montage with 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.420
 cutouts from the season so it has 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.170
 Next that was it was none 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.470
 Schnauzer is what Schnauzer is 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.700
 bands then whole trades was 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.130
 and there maybe one plays 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.200
 older people or something like that 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.200
 Exactly with the whole positions in the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.670
 US American police service and 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.770

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.090
 right peters out that shell now 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.310

 but not as I said one squadron Meet 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.620
 was pretty much one of the best things 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.810
 that I've ever been allowed to see that is 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.770

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.820
 Outfit tv series is all seen 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.959

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.110
 I as an Austrian may become 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.090
