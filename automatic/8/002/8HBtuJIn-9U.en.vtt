00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
want to concede that goal but both sides

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.840 
want to concede that goal but both sides
went<00:01:08.290> for<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.560> yeah<00:01:08.830> thik<00:01:09.070> first<00:01:09.400> 20<00:01:09.820> minutes

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
went for it yeah thik first 20 minutes

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.160 
went for it yeah thik first 20 minutes
were<00:01:10.180> probably<00:01:10.360> sound<00:01:10.630> in<00:01:10.750> each<00:01:10.840> other<00:01:11.049> out

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
were probably sound in each other out

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.250 
were probably sound in each other out
and

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.890 
and
and<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:12.950> I<00:01:12.980> felt<00:01:13.640> if<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.360> didn't<00:01:14.600> wanna<00:01:14.720> watch

and so I felt if you didn't wanna watch

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.540 
and so I felt if you didn't wanna watch
a<00:01:14.960> movie<00:01:14.990> again<00:01:15.440> i<00:01:15.500> think<00:01:15.740> we<00:01:15.800> probably<00:01:15.920> the

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
a movie again i think we probably the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.710 
a movie again i think we probably the
better<00:01:16.700> chances<00:01:17.000> in<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.210> game<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.570> more

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.180 
halftime I know it's an old cliche and
stuff<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.750> is<00:01:50.930> even<00:01:51.350> if<00:01:51.440> we<00:01:51.560> draw<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.890> game

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.200 
he come to pay for it and that's the
situation<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.490> obviously<00:02:06.790> if<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.060> take

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
situation so obviously if the take

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.109 
situation so obviously if the take
positives<00:02:07.690> out<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.649> bit<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.100> bit<00:02:10.060> of

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
positives out of it is a bit of a bit of

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.620 
positives out of it is a bit of a bit of
a<00:02:10.149> hard<00:02:10.330> game<00:02:10.479> because<00:02:12.300> winning<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.480> first

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
a hard game because winning the first

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.210 
a hard game because winning the first
office<00:02:14.050> were<00:02:14.200> playing<00:02:14.440> their<00:02:14.590> favor<00:02:14.890> and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
office were playing their favor and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.970 
office were playing their favor and
we're<00:02:16.090> probably<00:02:16.270> getting<00:02:16.560> tested<00:02:17.560> keeper<00:02:17.890> at

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
we're probably getting tested keeper at

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.750 
we're probably getting tested keeper at
times<00:02:18.220> when<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.490> should<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.700> done

times when you should have done

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.900 
times when you should have done

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
especially with corners and free-kicks

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.949 
especially with corners and free-kicks
but<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.000> can<00:02:22.120> see<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.360> commitment<00:02:22.750> from<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
but you can see the commitment from the

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.260 
but you can see the commitment from the
voice<00:02:23.170> we<00:02:23.530> would<00:02:23.620> try<00:02:23.800> not<00:02:24.150> honest<00:02:25.150> and
