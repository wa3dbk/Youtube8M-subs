00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.420
 construction of a ceiling next to Turkish taken 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.179
 armed structure 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.609
 to build and durlock ceilings you will have to build a structure of profiles 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.830
 of syncada steel sheet on which the fitur loc plates will be fixed 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.630
 The structure of the ceiling is made using profiles of solitude type 35 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.630
 millimeters and 34 mm montÃ¡nchez 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.120
 once the height of the future ceiling has been defined and marked, taking care to maintain the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.800
 same level on the walls will be marked the desired height transporting 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.350
 this measure with level around the perimeter and drawing a line 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.890
 continue with and step on it using a level to do 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.630
 the fixings will be made every 60 centimeters with bolts and screws 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.290
 Number 8 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.170
 the first solitude will be fixed on the wall of the greater side of the environment 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.170
 repeating this operation on the opposite wall 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.540
 once verified the leveling of the soleras will be placed on them of 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.550
 cross-sectional way to how voters will be placed a level upright profile 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.090
 with a thread and with a maximum separation of one meter twenty 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.960
 these profiles will be the master lines of the structure and should 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.960
 be suspended from the ceiling by means of curled candles 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.380
 which are voting profiles placed every meter point at most 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.820
 the upright profiles will be cut according to the dimensions of the ceiling 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.200
 calculating approximately one centimeter less than the separation 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 between the soleras that is placed on the walls 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.420
 Within the borders the voting profiles will be placed every 40 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.140
 centimeters fixing ourselves to these with steel screws type one point 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.140
 needle with head is in that indra nura jobs 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.949
 two 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.989
 becker 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.639
 the silver 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.629
 Once the structure is assembled, the tur lockout plates and 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.889
 lysing t2 steel screws by placing them with a gap of 25 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:42.430
 30 centimeters at the center of the plate and 15 centimeters at the edges 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:46.859
 that coincides with the axis of a profile to a separation of 10 millimeters from 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.619
 the same 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:52.839
 the plates are placed transversely to the frame of uprights 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:57.749
 locking each other in such a way that there are no continuous joints along 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:58.649
 of all the ceiling
