00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.150 
easiest way I found to do it is to that
you<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:54.120> one<00:02:54.420> arm<00:02:54.800> putting<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.920> seat

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
you can have one arm putting the seat

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.530 
you can have one arm putting the seat
actually<00:02:56.610> back<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:59.190> put<00:02:59.430> your<00:02:59.730> seat

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
actually back in is to put your seat

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.230 
actually back in is to put your seat
this<00:03:01.080> seat<00:03:01.380> belt<00:03:01.850> up<00:03:02.850> at<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> top<00:03:03.720> here<00:03:04.200> so

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
this seat belt up at the top here so

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.470

it's<00:03:06.240> like<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.930> then<00:03:07.430> put<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:09.180> seat

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
it's like that and then put this seat

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.020 
it's like that and then put this seat
belt<00:03:09.510> kind<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.959> like<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.290> hold<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.459> one<00:03:11.730> up
