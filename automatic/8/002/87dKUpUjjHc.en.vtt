and other settings on the car I can go

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.750 
and other settings on the car I can go
anywhere<00:00:47.840> just<00:00:48.260> like<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.800> normal<00:00:49.460> command

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
anywhere just like a normal command

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.819 
anywhere just like a normal command
system<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:50.870> doesn't<00:00:51.140> disturb<00:00:51.559> what<00:00:51.739> the

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
system and it doesn't disturb what the

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.950

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
now the passenger has access basically

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.319 
now the passenger has access basically
to<00:00:57.620> just<00:00:57.920> entertainment<00:00:58.339> features<00:00:58.789> they

to just entertainment features they
can't<00:00:59.629> go<00:00:59.780> do<00:00:59.989> their<00:01:00.230> own<00:01:00.410> separate<00:01:00.949> nav

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
can't go do their own separate nav

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.919 
can't go do their own separate nav
screen<00:01:01.519> for<00:01:01.760> example<00:01:02.210> or<00:01:02.329> dive<00:01:02.510> into<00:01:02.719> other

screen for example or dive into other
vehicle<00:01:03.379> menus<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:03.890> it's<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.100> little<00:01:04.400> limited

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700
