 for this we need and we need 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.550
 that's what the saucepan in which all this 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.170
 will boil the egg itself a spoonful of salt and 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.390
 love time measuring device 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:33.540
 in this case, this phone 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:37.920
 take a pot pour water than 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.930
 more water the better and put on fire 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.930
 no ordinary gas stove 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:59.120
 waiting for a boil, but for now we are boiling 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:59.120
 wash the egg necessarily 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.560
 of us through the corkscrew fleet egg until 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.200
 got to your fridge well 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.350
 hot water makes u more steady 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.540
 temperature drop and so the water will turn out 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:22.210
 boil so well add salt 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:26.220
 how much salt is needed 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:32.399
 without fanaticism further 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:38.140
 spoon because and also heat the spoon 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:44.259
 so that the technology was not a problem with 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:50.080
 melt down and take further the most difficult 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:59.950
 next we gently lay the egg on the spoon 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:02:02.550
 and even more carefully put the egg in 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.550
 saucepan 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.580
 it should not break as seen after 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.320
 this very quickly notice with 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.670
 our time meter 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:25.160
 one minute went and that minute 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:27.680
 ends and as soon as she 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.240
 over we immediately turn off our 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.140
 the stove and the lid cover our case and 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.550
 thereafter 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:43.640
 mark another five minutes exactly the time 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:56.870
