00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:17.230
 Hi, I 'm making a poofin cookie chocolate today. 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.230
 Oh, the chocolate name is Apollo. 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:26.070
 These things are included , and when you hear it, you get this shape. 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.070
 [music] 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.220
 When you look back, 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:38.130
 [music] 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.130
 It 's all about how to make it . 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.670
 Ah 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.940
 So let's get the box out of here. 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.050
 U 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.050
 U 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.600
 U 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.140
 [music] 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.510
 U 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.489
 Oh 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.930
 [clap] 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.960
 Apps look a bit tasteless and chocolate tastes. 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.960
 U 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.980
 And the kids are such candy cookies that they put it in the chocorian or outside . 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.560
 [music] 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.560
 And two days I put chocolate in it and dry it. 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.740
 Because the kids are so hard, they have to melt in warm water. 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.510
 U 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.830

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.020
 Looking back at the box 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.500
 [music] 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.770
 It says you have to immerse yourself in 50 degree water. 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.720
 And then you can just put it in a transcendent way. 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.720
 U 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.399

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.620
 U 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.620
 Ah 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:02.760
 You have to wait until it's soaked in water and completely waxy. 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.340
 3 After about 5 times, the chocolate is completely melted. 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.690
 I am completely dry now. 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.700

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.550

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.750

 I 'll put it in now. 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.880
 If you plump it, it will be flat. 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.880
 5 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.110
 I used to put in stuff . 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.800
 Ah 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:03:00.840

 This anchor Usher writes will be dry for about 30 minutes 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.960
 The way to cross is really simple, but you can just let it go. 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.070
 Oh oh oh 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.070
 So I'll take it out. 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:06.850
 If you learn a little less of dryness, you can get rid of the head of transcendence. 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.140
 I have it 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.180

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.800
 It's pretty.

 Please give me 1 lb 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.470
 It's not so beautiful to put too much 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.470
 It's important that you do not get along well. 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.000
 It does shells coming 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.650
