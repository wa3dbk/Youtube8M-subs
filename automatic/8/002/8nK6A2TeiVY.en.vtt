00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
okay now we're ready to insert the

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:47.449 
okay now we're ready to insert the
bearing<00:02:43.079> I<00:02:44.180> put<00:02:45.180> my<00:02:45.329> dust<00:02:45.780> shield<00:02:46.079> or<00:02:46.459> splash

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
bearing I put my dust shield or splash

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.089 
bearing I put my dust shield or splash
shield<00:02:47.819> on<00:02:48.000> there<00:02:48.269> first<00:02:48.709> then<00:02:49.709> make<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.069> a

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
shield on there first then make it a

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:58.509 
shield on there first then make it a
little<00:02:50.489> bit<00:02:50.640> easier

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.069 

remember<00:02:59.519> your<00:02:59.670> orientation<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.569> this<00:03:00.750> -<00:03:01.049> I

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
remember your orientation of this - I

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.309 
remember your orientation of this - I
 up<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.239> put<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.329> on<00:03:03.450> backwards<00:03:03.659> don't

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
 up and put it on backwards don't

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.009 
 up and put it on backwards don't
ask<00:03:04.530> me<00:03:04.709> how<00:03:05.629> it's<00:03:06.629> one<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.900> those<00:03:07.049> days

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
ask me how it's one of those days

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:17.629 
ask me how it's one of those days
getting<00:03:10.019> ahead<00:03:10.409> of<00:03:10.470> myself<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:17.250> then<00:03:17.459> just

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
getting ahead of myself and then just

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.129 
getting ahead of myself and then just
tighten<00:03:17.879> them<00:03:18.090> up<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.239> little<00:03:18.450> torque<00:03:18.810> them<00:03:18.989> up

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
tighten them up a little torque them up

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:37.460 
tighten them up a little torque them up
as<00:03:19.349> soon<00:03:19.470> as<00:03:19.620> they're<00:03:19.769> all<00:03:19.859> tight<00:03:36.109> our<00:03:37.109> next

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
as soon as they're all tight our next

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.960 
as soon as they're all tight our next
step<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.859> torque<00:03:38.220> these<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.700> 80

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
step is to torque these to 80

00:03:38.970 --> 00:04:02.400 
step is to torque these to 80
foot-pounds<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.870> torque

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:12.840 

and<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.430> always<00:04:03.700> like<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.180> check<00:04:04.360> it<00:04:04.570> twice<00:04:11.850> to

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
and I always like to check it twice to

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.020 
and I always like to check it twice to
see<00:04:13.090> after<00:04:13.270> I<00:04:13.420> tighten<00:04:13.810> her<00:04:13.900> up<00:04:14.730> got<00:04:15.730> a<00:04:15.760> little

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
see after I tighten her up got a little

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:25.320 
see after I tighten her up got a little
more<00:04:16.209> out<00:04:16.450> of<00:04:16.480> her<00:04:21.780> one<00:04:22.780> more<00:04:22.960> time<00:04:24.300> yeah<00:04:25.300> I

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
more out of her one more time yeah I

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.600 
more out of her one more time yeah I
think<00:04:25.570> we're<00:04:25.870> good<00:04:26.050> now

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
think we're good now

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.190 
think we're good now
this<00:04:27.610> next<00:04:28.000> step<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.360> can't<00:04:28.660> stress<00:04:29.020> enough

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
this next step I can't stress enough

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.020 
this next step I can't stress enough
this<00:04:29.500> sense<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.950> preload<00:04:30.190> on<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.610> bearing

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
this sense to preload on the bearing

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.360 
this sense to preload on the bearing
when<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:31.990> put<00:04:32.170> this<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:32.980> put<00:04:33.160> your<00:04:33.220> knot

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
when you put this and you put your knot

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.160 
when you put this and you put your knot
on<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.610> lot<00:04:33.790> of<00:04:33.820> people<00:04:34.240> just<00:04:34.930> torque

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
on a lot of people just torque

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.780 
on a lot of people just torque
this<00:04:35.380> down<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:36.010> not<00:04:36.100> even<00:04:36.340> care

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
this down and not even care

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.170 
this down and not even care
having<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.510> proper<00:04:37.720> torque<00:04:38.640> will<00:04:39.640> prolong<00:04:40.120> the

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
having a proper torque will prolong the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.230 
having a proper torque will prolong the
life<00:04:40.480> of<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:40.840> bearing<00:04:41.230> too<00:04:41.440> tight

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
life of this bearing too tight

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.390 
life of this bearing too tight
and<00:04:43.240> it's<00:04:43.780> gonna<00:04:43.900> be<00:04:44.080> hard<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.680> roll<00:04:44.890> it's

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
and it's gonna be hard to roll it's

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.340 
and it's gonna be hard to roll it's
going<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.580> wear<00:04:45.670> out<00:04:45.730> quicker<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.810> loose<00:04:47.050> and

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
going to wear out quicker to loose and

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.680 
going to wear out quicker to loose and
the<00:04:48.040> barrier<00:04:48.310> might<00:04:48.520> actually<00:04:48.910> separate<00:04:49.420> from

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
the barrier might actually separate from

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.460 
the barrier might actually separate from
the<00:04:49.810> hub<00:04:49.990> so<00:04:50.860> it's<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.460> hundred<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.470> eighty

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
the hub so it's a hundred and eighty

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.560 
the hub so it's a hundred and eighty
foot-pounds<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.280> torque<00:04:54.340> so<00:04:54.850> I'm<00:04:55.390> going<00:04:55.510> to

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
foot-pounds of torque so I'm going to

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.300 
foot-pounds of torque so I'm going to
Snug<00:04:55.870> this<00:04:56.140> up<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:56.560> then<00:04:56.950> we're<00:04:57.130> going<00:04:57.250> to

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
Snug this up and then we're going to

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.820 
Snug this up and then we're going to
torque<00:04:57.610> her<00:04:57.700> down<00:05:02.610> sorry<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:03.790> stand<00:05:04.120> mistaken

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
torque her down sorry I stand mistaken

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.150 
torque her down sorry I stand mistaken
175<00:05:05.830> foot-pounds<00:05:06.460> of<00:05:06.550> torque<00:05:07.800> put<00:05:08.800> this<00:05:08.920> bad

00:05:58.239 --> 00:05:58.249 
time it is this is the one time and I'm

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.189 
time it is this is the one time and I'm
going<00:05:58.400> to<00:05:58.520> say<00:05:58.699> it<00:05:58.789> again<00:05:58.849> is<00:05:59.330> make<00:05:59.719> sure<00:05:59.749> your

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
going to say it again is make sure your

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.679 
going to say it again is make sure your
wheel<00:06:00.439> bearings<00:06:00.949> are<00:06:01.069> torqued<00:06:01.370> properly<00:06:02.060> when

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:02.689 
wheel bearings are torqued properly when

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:04.749 
wheel bearings are torqued properly when
you<00:06:02.719> install<00:06:03.289> them<00:06:03.499> otherwise<00:06:03.949> your<00:06:04.370> preload

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
you install them otherwise your preload

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:05.830 
you install them otherwise your preload
is<00:06:04.879> going<00:06:04.999> to<00:06:05.060> be<00:06:05.180> off<00:06:05.330> and<00:06:05.539> it's<00:06:05.659> going<00:06:05.779> to

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
is going to be off and it's going to

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.540
