00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 and I find myself with a great woman 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.140
 What is Mrs. Petra like this lady 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.300
 is very good and will teach us to 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.730
 prepare a typical dish of this 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.509
 region that is called as they say from 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.509
 bean tamales 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.060
 we are flying one of the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.520
 ingredients of these tamales but here 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.650
 what I have do not worry and for 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.810
 that the before the wind flies 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.180
 all the ingredients that we use 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:35.680
 are is this first the mass is cast 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.309
 butter and a little salt 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.620
 butter salt 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.830
 the same beans are thrown back 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.290
 little bit of butter and salt doÃ±a petra 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.980
 you already have this soccer ready here 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.610
 as he prepared it look at what boils 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.620
 with a little tequesquite and then 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.220
 it is milled 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.000
 I hope you see 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.110
 this is the frijolito is boiled not very 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.110
 boiled 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.930
 and you take a bit of tequesquite 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.650
 so that it takes flavor to see that it is the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.880
 tequesquite is a network of saying is 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.300
 one as as pebbles that before 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.730
 I gave 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:25.850
 in the fields in the lands and it was rising 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.280
 very good as same lime as local if and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.440
 well now it does not get used much and 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.350
 this make them sew the beans with the 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.540
 tequesquite but this one definitely 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.730
 It gives a taste if I do not expect this if it is 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.990
 special the tequesquite is special for 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.720
 the beans are crazy 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.450
 and that's another one has to be bean there 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.330
 ocote there are or cuts once it is 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.430
 Cooked 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.590
 what moves moves in the metate or 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.080
 in the mill people who want to 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.900
 the good mill then hands to the work 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.500
 to see how I'm going to prepare it like this 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.500
 Attention 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.320
 then it puts you plan takes away a 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.910
 a little bit and a little bit of salt and 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.440
 look good Mrs. Petra you already 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.440
 have a tremendous experience 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.790
 and 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.489
 I 'm going to put your bean and it's very 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.040
 all right 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.989

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.660
 to put it on just so they can see 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.000
 well extended and as he told us very 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.250
 finite and see what is adding you 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.459
 I'm putting your butter and a 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.599
 little bit of salt so that it also holds 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.599
 taste very good 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.390
 right now and right now I'm going to do 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.640

 rolling look I'm going to go rolling 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.590

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.330
 Well, it's good now we're going to 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.330
 this 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:50.250
 It has me like that without talking about why 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:53.640
 very interesting of course then we're going 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.150
 to throw in the pot and we're going to throw 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.150
 the pot 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.769
 very well let accommodating as 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.840
 know how long it takes these 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.750
 tamales as one hour as one hour 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.489
 good very good then friends us 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.410
 let's keep making more tamales here 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.540
 I'm going to help Mrs. petra the 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.950
 We are going to cook and she told us 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.200
 It will take like an hour 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.450
 approximately one month and with one hour or 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.190
 less good you have to throw them over 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.830
 about an hour if you do not 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.780
 leave because we came back with something that 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.240
 will definitely give you a lot 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.460
 colorful but above all a lot of flavor 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.060
 these tamalitos of fixed we follow here 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.060
 on the salt road 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.980
 and they took a little less not with three 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.110
 rooms say like three quarters of hours 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.700
 as I told you necessary that you 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.950
 see and something important is that after 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.950
 no more sigma leaves either 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.650
 sometimes allow me a little bit to allow 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.650
 our fields 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.270
 and see how it will look 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.050
 look they are not cursed and clear as 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.340
 they are very hot 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.860
 they soften and central van we're going to try 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.010

 rice that's also something very Mexican 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.940

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.180
