00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello friends and friends that come we are going to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.940
 learn to make a delicious picadillo 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.269
 ingredients we need good obvious the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.129
 ground beef please if you want in 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.440
 Some cases like to occupy a lot 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.390
 half beef be limited me 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.259
 I honestly like this one that is the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.529
 say it is very rich and is not here 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:28.199
 we are going to occupy diced onions already 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.890
 previously cut the onion papa 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.090
 same in quadritos squares in squares 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.790
 tomato in squares I'm going to put 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 also peas if you want a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 garlic clove pepper and salt I put you 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.670
 a lot of vegetables and right now I'm giving you 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.940
 the recipe like that because it's a very 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.910
 economic that you make it yield a lot 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.010
 your meat ok if you put it enough 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.680
 vegetable to your hash 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.470
 as you want to stay delicious and stay 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.710
 much more profitable now that we already know 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.589
 that the meat has gone up a lot of cost 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.060
 it's fine then I do so with 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.210
 pretty vegetable 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.180
 much meat but if you want you can 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.420
 make the picadillo or putting some of 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.240
 these vegetables or increasing the good 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.700
 let's go to the procedure 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.890
 ready friends I already put the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.659
 Onion and garlic is the first step since 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.060
 that the onion and the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.939
 garlic I will integrate the meat let me 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.340
 that right now I see you already integrate the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.799
 meat to onion at this time is in 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.979
 the one that we are going to throw what are the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.509
 potatoes not the precocious ones and before because 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.939
 right now we are going to cover this for 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.439
 that the flesh is also sewn and how 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.380
 potatoes are diced 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.240
 small there will be no problem 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.439
 the fact of one of the pumpkins what 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.690
 only I'm not going to put it all at once 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.700
 it's the tomato and he 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.400
 the peas because it's listening to them like 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.560
 come from here comes free 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.020
 you are going to occupy fresh peas 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.700
 then if at once the facts or 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.580
 those even early antisocial 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.030
 that they are quite cough and cough 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.090
 sew we integrate it well so that it does not 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.180
 I hit the bottom so I do not 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.470
 is to throw more oil is to throw 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.290
 about half a cup of water 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:25.210
 purified capÃ³ well I pot and ready 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.100
 it happened to me just tell you this 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.250
 moment that everything is still raw 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.100
 when we season it perfect a brittes 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.500
 when we put the pepper garlic 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.770
 dust if we're going to put the salt and if 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.600
 is everything you are going to put 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.760
 desazonador is at this time to 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.790
 so both vegetables and meat are 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.970
 impregnate from this moment and everything has 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.970
 that delicious flavor 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.430
 and you throw the flavor, that is, the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.070
 pepper the salt and so on until now 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.170
 everything is raw I say everything is cooked 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.330
 what will happen is that for example the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.850
 potatoes will not absorb the same taste 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.490
 of the salsita then they will see how 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.260
 parts that are going to be very intense 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.720
 of flavor and others that will leave you 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.270
 as unwelcome more then I do 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.120
 when it is here raw I have already put its 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.470
 half cup of water then look there 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.990
 you can see the water 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.520
 this is not fat right now trying what you're going 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.890
 to see how the meat and their own 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.980
 vegetables are going to start to take their juice 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.260
 If you have too much broth what you can 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.540
 to do is that instead of following it 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.150
 cooking when everything is released 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.459
 I mean if you feel that you have 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.060
 too much broth instead of leaving it covered 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.620
 uncover it and alone the juices are going to 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.330
 evaporate and it will be your 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.450
 more sexy mince 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.060
 ready friends so this is our delicious 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.010
 picadillo I ask you nothing of favor 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.950
 If you like me, you do not like meat 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.050
 raw, not as soon as you see it, recite the 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.820
 Take off the fire leave it a good 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.180
 a while while the 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.710
 smoke leave about five or ten minutes 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.140
 cooking so that then if the 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.200
 meat well well from the inside 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.140
 perfectly cooked the potato has already been 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.510
 fully cooked and you integrate the others 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.420
