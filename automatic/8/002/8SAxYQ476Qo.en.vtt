00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:11.630
 welcome to the cupra so the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.460
 presentation is sober 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.530
 for sure a car at 22000 euros 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.600
 we're not going to ask too much about it 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.390
 of lack of taste we would have liked a little 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.080
 more something a little more typical 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.490
 race typed sport but hey it fills 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.840
 his role 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.250
 we dreamed of dials to make a 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.349
 point see the temperature of the water the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.849
 oil pressure but these digital 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.489
 finally at least the water temperature 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.430
 pressure dijon not know there will be a 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.190
 red light so dear problem but good 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.700
 after for for the driving position 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.320
 she is correct 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.970
 I wish we could put the 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.970
 ferry is a little lower it was not 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:54.170
 possible and we have the legs a poplar 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.120
 to have your arms it is quite elongated 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.010
 but hey, but it's a showcase in a 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.600
 correct position frankly the steering wheel 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.760
 is adjusted in depth in height we are 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.460
 a position not bad after on the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.930
 pedals the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.840
 these two pedals a goal which is the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.190
 pallets behind the throttle 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.500
 brake you can brake your left foot 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.300
 what I do is this the common brake 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.250
 and money is not we are not too 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.630
 access with the foot with the left clae 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.490
 and so it is possible 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.649
 so the pallets there is this speed the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.200
 box dsg we know the box looks 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.700
 very fine 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.060
 for the reports back on 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.710
 would like to have more freedom to 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.320
 to get reports up to 7000 is 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.880
 malka but good by cons it goes up and 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.079
 the reports are all alone 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.800
 very good 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.740
 it's still really effective 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.549
 engine of the little 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.130
 already looks extraordinary I have 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.229
 read the technical sheets and already on the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.149
 technical sheet I was amazed a 5400 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.280
 cubic centimeter with double 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.549
 supercharger compressor first and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.970
 after the turbo takes over it 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.549
 adds up and neck of the stroke it's a 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.000
 engine that since very low in the 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.619
 towers resumes there is a good couple and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.569
 after the fences beautiful happens it grows 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.010
 a little more 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.750
 frankly for an amazing 1400 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.549
 and 25 kg of torque and 180 days so that 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.280
 really works very well the weight of the 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.260
 car is a little heavy for this type of 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.240
 car but it's 1200 and some 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.670
 a little heavy kilos 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.930
 now that now go she's 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.420
 really in the standard sea 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.150
 we remember that cars of this 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.950
 dimension there before was closer 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.980
 1000 kilos but good anyway it's 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.690
 beefier for spring security 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.709
 after for behavior the car and the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.550
 little that I saw there already come in two 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.990
 in entry on frampro not on the brakes 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.670
 the back is not stingy in scenes 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.030
 can be 3.90 to see 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.790
 considered she would do no oversteer and 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.090
 that's the problem of cars 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.790
 current and the problem is that 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.130
 still on cons face on the range 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.569
 classic I understand but after on 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.520
 sports cars me it bores me 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.520
 because we would like a car a little 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.819
 player with the back who comes and who 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.260
 relieves the front end gear at 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.150
 less than it is asked and power there 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.950
 from the entrance to the exit these 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.720
 two works that makes his say in 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.550
 charge prices before entering because 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.569
 the tail cars do not come from 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.400
 art is in any case the back does not 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.220
 not relieve the front so it not wants 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.810
 gear and came out in addition we are 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.019
 pointed because the back has not come 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.870
 and in addition we have there all the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.880
 power havas is on the ground so 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.670
 it 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.670
 on a circuit that it fuse 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.330
 masks 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.330
 sporty sports pull- ups 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.460
 we leave no more freedom to 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.620
 to those who 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.830
 hatchet to be able to have a little fun 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.330
 little with being able to have from time to time 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.330
 some possibilities to counterattack 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.910
 after 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.250
 we can if it will, but all of 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.829
 then there is the sp that comes back on it 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.750
 disconnect but still remains 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.540
 present then he is this a little bit 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.760
 more freedom but still not much 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.970
 so the followers of the wiring in the 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.050
 pins in the mountains 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.060
 are disappointed because 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.250
 to laugh with that and we can 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.110
 serve as braking distribution 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.360
 ie put to your career 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.580
 when we are already so attracted to 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.780
 the brake on the front brake 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.729
 but a leap backwards to relieve a 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.250
 little forward good after cons good 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.629
 trains frankly there is a good grip 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.629
 trains have effective air 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.400
 it's not bad to do in management 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.530
 amortization it misses for me a 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.440
 little low speed but average 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.530
 speed are the high speed pretty much 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.400
 by a car to laugh but by 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.979
 against it is effective in output 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.150
 frankly the front gear is effective 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.550
 and despite the cut and the power all 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.000
 goes on the ground 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.370
 then there is 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.150
 we would have liked a real self-blocking they 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.470
 call it a self-blocking 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.900
 electronic but it's more of a 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.300
 anti-skating blokhin ie 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.310
 that the brake pliers declare or 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.320
 interior tends to pack in the 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.100
 domestic fresh base slowed down to 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.300
 wheel it avoids waxing the wheel 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.350
 that's not why you go out more 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.890
 of turns 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:39.100
 here we are going to classify this in the good 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.110
 small cars efficient but not 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.050
 cars for those who love 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:48.150
 the really sporty side 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.150
 car we will fetch the pace quickly 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.560
 all
