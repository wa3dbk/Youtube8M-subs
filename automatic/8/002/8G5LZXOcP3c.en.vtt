00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.880
 In this video I want to show you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:11.130
 like your network settings 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 could do so on yours as well 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.410
 Panasonic Smart TV Internet receive 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.910
 you have to have a wlan 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 capable smart tv have it works too 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.220
 line input on their wireless capable 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:35.570
 just do it once 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:40.700
 a wlan amplifier I'll show you 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.700
 it usually costs 40 50 euro 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.960
 simply come back one dose 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.410
 Of course you have to cut the electroless first 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.230
 times in the home network login and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.789
 make the passwords release number 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.920
 that he is also logged down the bottom 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.610
 It's important that he has a network 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:11.330
 income therefore has a tailor-made 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.729
 cable to take normal cable 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.130
 and what network is designed 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:23.159
 and then you can the cable namely 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:27.600
 do it and you have one 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.509
 Wi-Fi enabled TV and the other 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:37.310
 Of course he ends up in the device himself 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.310
 in and I'll do it 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:16.080
 so i have already done so and so 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:21.090
 now just press the fermi menu button 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.010
 call on setup go down ok 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.040
 to confirm 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:31.709
 and then often network setup go like that 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.920
 then there's the connection test then 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.350
 is there the network type because I do not have one 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.640
 wlan installed in the tv but 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.000
 I could only have one cable 1 at the back 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.859
 yes as I said the amplifier on the 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.680
 rest signal fields and as I said about 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.200
 the cable is directly to the tv 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.910
 that means you do not have a tussis cable 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.900
 pull or whatever you need 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:01.230
 Practical wants free outlet where to get 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.940
 The repeater drum clamps cables differently 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.299
 the repeater and then on television because 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.239
 can also be half a meter 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.220
 that's enough but the network does so 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.989
 Cable connections would be as said for 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.440
 the people the no wlan n tv 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:21.560
 have and radio connection if you have one 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:24.690
 wlan dongle has five tvs or halt 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.700
 if it is integrated in panasonic 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:33.000
 But we go on itself 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.650
 cable connection and connection text and 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.799
 as we see it here so connection 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.900
 It expires and shows test successfully 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.430
 Everything is done with help 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.110
 that means the tv is now for 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.400
 Internet configured at the network 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.379
 Wired TV now wants to go to 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.350
 Internet does not need a password 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:58.240
 enter 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.640
 because yes directly logged in on the 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.530
 repeater what else would she be if you were 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.660
 now keep in wifi enabled tv 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.500
 or have this wlan dongle on 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.560
 TV 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.910
 then you have to go to your repeater 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.940
 and 99 99 percent is on the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.540
 back of the repeater always that 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:23.200
 password the security key for 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.760
 write down your home network and that 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.850
 actually enter password 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.740
 at the radio connection and then comes 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.480
 Also the internet is so we come 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.480
 right here with the button internet 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.690
 call 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:45.490
 so and now are damn smart tv 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:48.070
 panasonic homes and total access 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:54.730
 For example, on the internet this time 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:57.400
 youtube on it mostly seen easy and 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:05.800
 fast and here comes the already 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:07.960
 Most suggestions and I do it myself 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.160
 Here's an example so that you can see that 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:18.190
 is important also what works 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:23.380
 funny mercedes benz so now liter 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.950
 television connection to the internet 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.970
 exists yes and there is already the video 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:33.330
 what I just selected and stuff 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.640
 just make yourself fast 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.630
 not a television neither 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.720
 a wireless TV without need 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.550
 without having to pull cables but stop 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.410
 now with this repeater it 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.620
 actually everywhere next to 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:54.190
 Electrician market from 40 euros I would 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.250
 say 40 50 euro is clear 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.180
 then I wish a lot of fun with it me 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.180
 I hope I was able to help you
