beautiful<00:00:40.309> it<00:00:41.309> definitely<00:00:42.149> took<00:00:42.660> some<00:00:42.719> weight

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
beautiful it definitely took some weight

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.139 
beautiful it definitely took some weight
off<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.590> bike<00:00:43.800> because<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.219> stock<00:00:44.489> pipes<00:00:44.850> are

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
off the bike because the stock pipes are

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.290 
off the bike because the stock pipes are
rather<00:00:45.750> heavy<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:46.920> probably<00:00:47.370> picked<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
rather heavy so I probably picked up a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.330 
rather heavy so I probably picked up a
little<00:00:48.750> bit<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.200> performance<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:50.160> by

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
little bit of performance just by

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.650 
little bit of performance just by
shaving<00:00:51.270> off<00:00:51.420> some<00:00:51.690> weight<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.379> bike<00:00:52.760> I<00:00:53.760> am

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
shaving off some weight on the bike I am

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.290 
shaving off some weight on the bike I am
getting<00:00:55.230> some<00:00:55.770> popping<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.379> some<00:00:58.379> backfiring

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
getting some popping and some backfiring

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.599 
getting some popping and some backfiring
especially<00:01:00.300> after<00:01:01.020> third<00:01:01.590> into<00:01:02.039> fourth<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
especially after third into fourth and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.899 
especially after third into fourth and
into<00:01:02.820> fifth<00:01:03.120> gear<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.799> will<00:01:05.250> remedy<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.700> by

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
into fifth gear so I will remedy that by

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
into fifth gear so I will remedy that by
getting<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:07.970> processor<00:01:08.970> by<00:01:09.150> Cobra<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:09.960> another

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
and I pretty much watch the entire

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.690 
and I pretty much watch the entire
process<00:03:19.909> from<00:03:20.860> taking<00:03:21.860> off<00:03:22.010> these<00:03:22.280> stock
