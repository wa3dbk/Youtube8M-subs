00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.649
 new video 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.000
 Today I want to show you how I am 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.670
 the pressure distance from the nozzle to mine 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.590
 adjusting correct pressure bed and on 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.189
 a relatively fast and easy way 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.050
 and wise on the picture shown can 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.570
 you recognize very well why the right one 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.269
 pressure distance is quite important for 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.460
 the 3d print 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.070
 Here you see the successful on the right 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.309
 model with correct pressure distance and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.489
 left that he did not succeed with model 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.170
 too high a pressure gap before we 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.510
 We have to start with the setting 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.050
 first all filament residues of the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.899
 Remove the nozzle around the nozzle from 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.629
 to free superfluous filament 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.390
 we first have to set the extruder to 180 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.160
 heat up 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.739
 while making sure that the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.199
 heat only briefly so happens shortly 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.699
 come to 180 degrees and then immediately the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.640
 switch extruder off again 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.040
 It forms a small drive and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.720
 then this thready body after the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.049
 switch off immediately with a pair of pliers 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.150
 remove the fine adjustment of the pressure 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.810
 is about the three visible pension 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.060
 made two of them on the screw 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.119
 left side and one of them on the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.780
 right side of the optimal distance 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.960
 between this and return 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.880
 0.05 mm for reference we take 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.310
 sheet paper we see on the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 furniture fair screw however that the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.689
 sheet of paper about 0 1 millimeter thick 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.479
 is and so is now after 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.890
 remove the entire filamente is the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.439
 process from we have here 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.299
 beautiful sheet of paper and this 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.360
 we will be beautiful sheet of paper 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.729
 now for the first time after we all ax 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.030
 have patience 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:04.800
 under or carefully under the nozzle 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.720
 between printing bed and pushing this 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.840
 Now we look with the help of hÃ¤ndel 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.150
 screw the sheet of paper firmly 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.980
 this should be something like that 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.770
 sit 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.190
 that should basically work 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.020
 Do not sit should be relaxed and with 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.450
 but you should be mobile 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:32.110
 the nozzle resistance is still noticeable 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:36.120
 feel that way after you do that now 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.420
 we have stopped the procedure 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.370
 x-axis on or 50 exactly over the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.520
 second rendel screw on the left 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.170
 page and we pick up the process here 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.640
 again push the sheet of paper 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.370
 below, look at how easy that is 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.430
 if possible, do not sit the leaf 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.650
 move on the paper 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.840
 high bed press but the sheet 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.550
 Paper always with between thumbs and 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.550
 hold your index finger and back and forth 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.750
 move and next to it the optimal 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.970
 set the distance 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.100
 now we have the positions of 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.380
 Approaching the third round wrenches 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:21.850
 for that we go to x75 and drive the y 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.920
 axis to the maximum value of 150 now 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.090
 Let's put the paper sheet of paper back 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.540
 below and repeat the process 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.130
 have already done me twice 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.040
 the paper is sitting a little bit tight again 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.630
 That's why we have to screw the edges 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.980
 and do not turn 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:45.630
 as a small tip around the sheet of paper 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.700
 to move a little more relaxed medium 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.900
 we have to screw the rent from above 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:56.320
 Turn around left because we do that 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.130
 the whole - firm is investments 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:04.510
 turn right so and close 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.959
 then everything back into the home back 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.959
 hazards
