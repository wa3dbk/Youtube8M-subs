00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello friends today doing this 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.200
 A short review in advance I apologize 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.150
 for something rare last time 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.350
 I post the video just very big 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.170
 strained from time but getting on 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.199
 order is easier with time therefore 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.550
 I will continue much more actively 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.730
 record and fill 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.710
 saw well let's start the blade of 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.989
 stainless steel 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.780
 this is my 5 job 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.829
 of the very stainless steel very quickly they 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.800
 thatâ€™s why 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.039
 again a stainless steel but the handle like you 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.559
 understand this oak and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.270
 on pain store textol so here 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.550
 image on baron bark 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.690
 such a composition is enough 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.570
 interesting in my opinion 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.379
 especially birch bark agree very well 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.379
 looks nice 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.200
 soaked the handle that is wooden 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.080
 component in natural varnish then 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.360
 covered with two layers of lacquer clock 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.070
 woody but she wore it in order 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.049
 to get rid of wood roughness 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.900
 because it is very hard to grind 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:32.759
 oak pore handle in hand 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:36.060
 perfectly in this grip, too, by the way, I already 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.280
 cut it worked this knife and enough 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.310
 Conveniently it seems like it does not remember but 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.920
 process again we will naturally 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.470
 keep you informed about the blade 's behavior 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.020
 whole and handles respectively downhill 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.439
 as you can see concave there is 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.079
 fake blade and over. 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.030
 20 degrees I will not use 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.369
 no measuring devices i think 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.650
 about the dimensions of the knife on the arm and 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.740
 handles in principle too 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.960
 thought to do first and rater on the knife but 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.960
 at the time he changed his mind he would hardly 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.610
 looked at this blade hilt very 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:20.350
 Conveniently really but such here in my 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.000
 the case can already be called the handle 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.610
 universal with this spot finger my 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.020
 notch under the pointer on or under the little finger 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.630
 I'd have to start already 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.880
 experiment and try to do 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:37.970
 more under the finger and notches very comfortable 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.570
 we are not on it, everything is fine well on it 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.860
 perhaps all all thanks for watching not 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.640
 forget to rate this video all good luck 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.640
 bye everyone
