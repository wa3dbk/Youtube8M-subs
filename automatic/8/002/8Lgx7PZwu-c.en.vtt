we clean the crankshaft

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.440 
we clean the crankshaft
inspecting<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.399> particular<00:00:35.730> crankshaft

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
interfere with our job and will easily

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.189 
interfere with our job and will easily
polish<00:00:49.649> out<00:00:49.940> with<00:00:50.940> some<00:00:51.120> Emery<00:00:51.360> cloth<00:00:51.539> by<00:00:51.870> hand

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
polish out with some Emery cloth by hand

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.830 
polish out with some Emery cloth by hand
or<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.309> competent<00:00:53.760> machine<00:00:54.030> shop<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.539> polish

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
or the competent machine shop can polish

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.260 
or the competent machine shop can polish
them<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> belt<00:00:55.710> unit

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
them for you with a belt unit

them for you with a belt unit
consequently<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.020> another<00:00:58.320> crankshaft

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
consequently we have another crankshaft

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.549 
consequently we have another crankshaft
here<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.430> show<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.670> what<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.239> damage<00:01:01.199> journal

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
here to show you what a damage journal

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.479 
here to show you what a damage journal
may<00:01:02.010> look<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:03.500> if<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.559> look<00:01:04.769> closely<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.339> this
