see it's probably not gonna be a lot of

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.550 
see it's probably not gonna be a lot of
fun<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:02.790> eat<00:04:02.939> so<00:04:03.659> we<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.810> put<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.109> back<00:04:04.229> in<00:04:04.439> and

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560
