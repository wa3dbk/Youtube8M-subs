00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.819
 something 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.819
 I guess I'm I say 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.030
 The part surrounded by silver frame 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.120
 There is 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.080
 Say here strip search 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.770
 Pitch, which makes yesterday 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.380
 I 'm going to see you here like this 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.859
 The left is ost 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.290
 The head of the right side The end of the lost song cheek 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:36.020
 When the middle of the small stop zone 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:40.130
 It does it automatically in this way 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:46.540
 When is the cdj Pioneer 2000 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.540
 It will function marked with that Pioneer products such as but 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.910
 Probably 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.329
 I 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.410
 In the wearing this feature pcdj of controller 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.920
 This ns mark of numark will be the world's first 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:05.229
 think 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.980
 Very but I think that can be seen that it Made up that is touching the but it is what in action and seems to head 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.810
 Say 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:14.600
 Now I'd think strong that it is really very a butterfly in Mars something on a computer 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.780
 If you touch one button 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.180
 That my favorite place 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.300
 It is very easy to use because it will head out nearby 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 Yes 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.790
 The rest is here 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:37.510
 When dirt time stop 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:43.670
 You can adjust the speed to stop the speed of the plastic rotation 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:47.380
 It is a knob I often saw on a turntable , and the speed of stopping and stopping is also the knob of this 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 Let's try adjusting once a little 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.740
 Enter 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.640
 It feels like this 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.280
 Or 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.090
 Oh dear 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.090
 The head is also so 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.959
 I like my own way 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:22.170
 It is a function that moves at speed 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:26.220
 So if you have your favorite adjustment with this one 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.200
 Well motor off motor sounds and this is a platter 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.830
 You can set whether to turn or not turn 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:38.040
 The number six tons break even when it is another tap bpm do not know after 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.000
 Tap and press the stand button like this 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.760
 A tree that automatically detects bp 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.310
 Will be 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.960
 After thisぇhere 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.860
 There is a pre-reverse but 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.100
 This is reverse play reverse while playing 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.990
 It becomes efficacy part that can do the 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.990
 So I will play it once 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:17.930
 Even if blip is playing reversely, it has a head to the place where it usually plays 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.930
 It points out, but when I go back to the river 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:36.980
 Comes at a standard called to play from once was back with would back the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.500
 So it's such that this kind of controller has this kind of function 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.800
 Rare is to to 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:47.050
 When the mix is 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.220
 I think a very unique mix is ​​possible if it is used abundantly in the high region 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.580
 later 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.780
 It's a recording Well , let's say here with the Bitch fader to change the speed of the speed song 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.610
 What 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.740
 It will be yesterday 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:05.240
 If you get this key lock 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:07.030
 The speed of the song can be reduced with the melody of the original song 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.450
 If this is get removed 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:17.329
 If the speed goes down, the pitch goes down a bit or if the speed goes up the station 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:19.609
 If the melody gets a bit high, I use it if you are well 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:25.580
 This is because it is a function 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:30.039
 I think that it is very convenient that this can be made a big key lock by a crossing person 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.039
 Range, but with pitch fader 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.700
 Rate of change 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:38.849
 You can change it like this when you press the button 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.779
 I did not see it because of this 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:46.849
 Now up to plus or minus 8% 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:49.440
 I can speed up or slow down the song 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.100
 Get by pressing the button and 16-Pas 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.849
 Fifty waves 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:05:00.539
 Also can you to change the speed up to a maximum of 50 Pas plus or minus 50% in the wind that 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.539
 Yes
