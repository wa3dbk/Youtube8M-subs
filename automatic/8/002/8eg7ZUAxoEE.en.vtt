00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.690
 Any notes we made 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:15.110

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.110

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.410
 important to our main source of income 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.080
 just apparently entry that points 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.030

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.610
 entry 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.149
 We spent the day too 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.149
 to hunt 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:48.420
 though not very successful only 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.000
 by luck are over maybe 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:59.960
 Stumbled like the father 's 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.739
 Corpse of an article saber tooth tiger 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.640
 stumbled and could this more or 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.640
 take less good 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.820
 the meat probably then sells to the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:33.600
 checkout and then only have the city 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:33.600
 explored the whole day after 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:47.259

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.849
 his was already for this day else 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:56.200
 Something we have seen someone 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:59.259
 the 100 has but that is not so 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.729
 really relevant and who else 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.009
 indications that the battle 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.349
 battle points and cranes real 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.209
 bad family break have to run here 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:10.479
 that even the children are each other 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.130
 but triezen that's not really 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.569
 of relevance 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.799
 then we close the diary now 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.799
