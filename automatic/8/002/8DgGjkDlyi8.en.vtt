thick your gonna be laying on the sand
you<00:01:07.830> want<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> start<00:01:08.310> with<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> pretty<00:01:08.880> thick

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you want to start with a pretty thick

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.130 
you want to start with a pretty thick
brush<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:12.170> then<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.560> fade<00:01:15.110> back<00:01:16.110> into

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
brush and then kind of fade back into

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.550 
brush and then kind of fade back into
the<00:01:16.979> grass

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.810 

you

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.790 

kind<00:01:25.600> of<00:01:25.690> like<00:01:25.900> so<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:28.600> course<00:01:29.200> it<00:01:29.440> is<00:01:29.530> just<00:01:29.710> a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
kind of like so of course it is just a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.510 
kind of like so of course it is just a
small<00:01:30.040> example<00:01:30.159> but<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.860> can<00:01:33.190> spend<00:01:33.490> more

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
small example but you can spend more

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.960 
small example but you can spend more
time<00:01:33.910> on<00:01:33.970> this<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:35.310> hopefully<00:01:36.310> understand<00:01:36.880> a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
time on this and hopefully understand a

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.680 
time on this and hopefully understand a
little<00:01:37.090> bit<00:01:37.240> better<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:39.369> that's<00:01:39.820> adding<00:01:40.240> sand

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
little bit better but that's adding sand

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.670 
little bit better but that's adding sand
to<00:01:40.990> grass<00:01:41.200> basically<00:01:42.360> any<00:01:43.360> questions<00:01:43.960> comment

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
to grass basically any questions comment

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.260 
to grass basically any questions comment
that'll<00:01:44.920> make<00:01:45.040> a<00:01:45.100> tutorial<00:01:45.460> about<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:46.000> I'll
