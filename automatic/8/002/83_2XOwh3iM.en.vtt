00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 ok here we are in a new tutorial 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.060
 of minecraft in which I will teach you to 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.700
 make a statue of the link to size 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.130
 giant well in like the state 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.660
 in order that I already did it and I uploaded it 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.630
 they had also asked for it and here it is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.330
 finished that is very cool then good 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.470
 Here I will teach you how to do it first 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.359
 the boots have to be first the 'law 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.789
 the first whole line behind and by 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.699
 the entire sides of brown wool the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.130
 next also in whole but with 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.530
 wool then I make wool with oak 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.710
 and leaving in front and behind these 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.570
 two with fir wood I think it's 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.059
 forest wood hands the bathroom that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.200
 be the wood of the wood that has this 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.820
 tone 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.370
 and then the next whole line 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.130
 also of whole oak wood and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.320
 these two parachutes from behind also and 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.810
 ahead only 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.760
 and because good ahead of the line 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.739
 brown and then in the next these two 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.590
 yellows in the two centrals and in the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.360
 next another whole wood mount 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.729
 if you have good is that I'm not 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.240
 explaining well but good for how it 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.759
 See that differentiates and then forgives 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.759
 I'm going to destroy that block that's good 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.920
 good and then there would be three lines of 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.170
 white to make it kind of 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.800
 socks whatever you wear ahead and 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.930
 behind all the whole 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.420
 and then they would be from the white 3 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.360
 see three of green by from both 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.240
 front as from behind I think yes 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.149
 I think there are three 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.680
 and now the buckle is made in front 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.390
 is with two wool question 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.460
 I'm going to take a position of vision 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.150
 night that no night station and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.150
 then you do not see anything 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.270
 Now it enters it would be made 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.000
 each side two others brown wool and 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.500
 over two of fir wood and after 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.420
 this form which is the buckle of 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.310
 belt and here another oak 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.900
 and then now we should do as 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.190
 this is what crosses what sport you 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.560
 It has the shield that will explain how it 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.290
 does that it would be like that doing on stairs 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.090
 as well as you see and then doing the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.280
 golden center areas and we continue with 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.520
 the ladder if I do not explain why 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.700
 simply seeing it is done 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.580
 and from behind to make the shield of with 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.200
 the shield they always carry would be 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.670
 if first the area lined with white 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.670
 in this way more or less like this 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.280
 so skirting the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.410
 it looks pretty yes and I did not experience it 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.530
 you put and it is but I think it looks 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.450
 all right 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.090
 then you hear them around here and you do it 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.100
 well and then they put inside the shield 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.770
 two yellow 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.740
 then two red four reds 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.810
 and two red and then two red one 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.140
 red navarra joaquin parallel to this 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.970
 point and everything more blue and leaving two of 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.130
 separation 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.440
 so we put this form would be 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.569
 yellow and then on each tip one of 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.489
 light gray wool 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.650
 and then we already do in the shield area 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.579
 and this and here we do as if it were 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.579
 the part that catches it 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.410
 well we have the body into the 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.350
 it's true that the 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.330
 cell and I quite liked doing it 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.030
 but hey it's done the follow 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.150
 explaining and then good to do the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.160
 always 4x4 manga and this time if they have 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.240
 four height the green on each side 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.240
 what's wrong with this 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.130
 so 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.580
 after 4 you must green wool we put 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.150
 two white then one wooden one 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.070
 wool one of wood one of wool and in the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.510
 left lateral today in the other in the 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.460
 Right where it sticks out 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.040
 we make one more wool on the side 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.440
 to make it like the fist zone and 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.360
 then the rest with birch wood for 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.030
 do as if it were in the fists in the 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.220
 another side the same and now to finish the 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.040
 head that would be both but 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.680
 in front of the first two lines 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.510
 whole birch wood and then going to 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.490
 make the eyes would be 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.160
 towards first to do the hair we do 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.440
 three golden days of wool for each 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.330
 side 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.250
 and then to make the two eyes of 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.960
 white on each side is blue for each 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.290
 side and on top of the solid producer 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.650
 of white 22 of black and in parallel to 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.080
 the two sideburns one line minus the 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.780
 the sides minus this and that all of 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.330
 yellow as it looks and the rest the two 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.290
 remaining floors would be done well with 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.140
 green wool and then laterally it would be 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.910
 from green zone 4 and then it would be 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.040
 on stairs 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.750
 under the ladder is that we have 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.790
 done we make the color of the yellow 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.850
 to do as if it were the part 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.040
 from the lateral and then like this to do what 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.870
 that gives her hair and here as if it were 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.880
 the earrings as it leads we came in 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.620
 the skin goods and so I left it 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.710
 well and on the other side exactly the same 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.250
 that on the contrary 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.870
 and from behind we simply put two of 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.670
 yellow on each side and then all the 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.460
 rest green and above all green 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.960
 just as well here I've been all and 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.060
 you will see that this statue is treated a lot 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.780
 to do it so 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.790
 it's worth it worth doing though 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.800
 it takes a long time so if you have any 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.180
 doubt put any comments 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.190
 recommendation for some statue the 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.190
 lived and thus be liked and subscribe
