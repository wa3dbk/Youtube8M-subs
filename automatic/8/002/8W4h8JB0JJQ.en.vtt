for you pretty much displaying a couple
of<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.319> suggestions<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.519> guys<00:00:08.760> offered

me<00:00:09.540> on<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.469> other<00:00:10.620> day<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.190> magic

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
me on the other day with the magic

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.480 
me on the other day with the magic
waterfall<00:00:12.240> glitch<00:00:12.590> so<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.620> figured<00:00:14.070> I'd<00:00:14.250> go

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
waterfall glitch so I figured I'd go

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.250 
waterfall glitch so I figured I'd go
back<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.940> try<00:00:15.330> out<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> couple<00:00:15.839> other<00:00:16.170> things

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
back and try out a couple other things

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.250 
back and try out a couple other things
first<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.580> tried<00:00:17.850> off<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.210> necro<00:00:18.570> chasm<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
first up I tried off the necro chasm to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.590 
first up I tried off the necro chasm to
see<00:00:19.470> if<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.920> had<00:00:20.100> any<00:00:20.340> effect<00:00:20.430> with<00:00:21.390> this

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
see if it had any effect with this

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.660 
see if it had any effect with this
glitch<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.380> does<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> guess

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
glitch and it does not because I guess

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.370 
glitch and it does not because I guess
since<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.090> kind<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.390> counts<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:24.990> an<00:00:25.170> auto

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
since it kind of counts is like an auto

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.109 
since it kind of counts is like an auto
rifle<00:00:25.949> even<00:00:26.310> though<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.550> kind<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.880> looks<00:00:27.060> like

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
rifle even though it kind of looks like

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.179 
rifle even though it kind of looks like
a<00:00:27.240> fusion<00:00:27.599> rifle<00:00:27.990> yeah<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.590> don't<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:28.980> know

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
a fusion rifle yeah I don't really know

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.009 
a fusion rifle yeah I don't really know
um<00:00:29.429> didn't<00:00:30.090> count<00:00:30.300> didn't<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.810> anything

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
um didn't count didn't do anything

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.500 
um didn't count didn't do anything
special<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:32.070> think<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> only<00:00:32.850> thing<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.149> noticed

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
special I think the only thing I noticed

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.810 
special I think the only thing I noticed
was<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.960> bullet<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.920> bullets<00:00:35.309> kind<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
was the bullet the bullets kind of

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.569 
was the bullet the bullets kind of
lagged<00:00:36.210> um<00:00:36.710> that's<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> only<00:00:38.040> thing<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.250> happen

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
lagged um that's the only thing I happen

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.139 
lagged um that's the only thing I happen
to<00:00:38.610> notice<00:00:38.899> moving<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.800> VEX<00:00:41.700> myth<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to notice moving on to the VEX myth of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.380 
to notice moving on to the VEX myth of
class<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.829> obviously<00:00:44.460> had<00:00:44.789> effect<00:00:45.149> on

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
class that that obviously had effect on

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.139 
class that that obviously had effect on
did<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> same<00:00:46.530> thing<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.890> any<00:00:47.070> normal<00:00:47.520> fusion

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
did the same thing as any normal fusion

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
did the same thing as any normal fusion
rifle<00:00:48.570> would<00:00:48.750> moving<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.530> once<00:00:49.800> again<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
rifle would moving on once again to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.970 
rifle would moving on once again to
rocket<00:00:51.270> launchers<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.989> tried<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.559> gala

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
rocket launchers I tried out the gala

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.090 
rocket launchers I tried out the gala
horn<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.300> gala<00:00:54.480> horn<00:00:54.809> looks<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
horn and the gala horn looks like a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.479 
horn and the gala horn looks like a
normal<00:00:56.370> rocket<00:00:57.090> um<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.989> also<00:00:58.230> tried<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.100> truth

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
normal rocket um I also tried the truth

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.389 
normal rocket um I also tried the truth
because<00:01:00.379> somebody<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.710> other<00:01:01.739> day<00:01:01.890> had

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
because somebody the other day had

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.299 
because somebody the other day had
suggested<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.390> kind<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:04.129> reminded<00:01:05.129> them

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
suggested that it kind of reminded them

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.550 
suggested that it kind of reminded them
of<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.549> javelin<00:01:06.030> from<00:01:06.420> call<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.720> duty<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.350> I

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
of a javelin from call of duty which I

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.010 
of a javelin from call of duty which I
definitely<00:01:08.040> see<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.340> resemblance<00:01:08.460> um<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
definitely see the resemblance um the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.050 
definitely see the resemblance um the
Rockets<00:01:10.470> look<00:01:10.740> exactly<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.369> same<00:01:11.520> they're

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
Rockets look exactly the same they're

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.380 
Rockets look exactly the same they're
just<00:01:12.240> different<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.720> color<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.110> gala<00:01:13.710> horn<00:01:14.040> uh

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
just different in color so gala horn uh

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.520 
just different in color so gala horn uh
the<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.080> end<00:01:16.770> flare<00:01:17.460> part<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:19.229> red

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the the end flare part is just like red

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.340 
the the end flare part is just like red
orange<00:01:20.070> II<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.520> truth<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.299> purple<00:01:21.810> now

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
orange II and the truth is purple now

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.980 
orange II and the truth is purple now
moving<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> supers<00:01:23.990> surprisingly

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
moving on to the supers surprisingly

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.770 
moving on to the supers surprisingly
enough<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.590> thought<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.729> golden<00:01:27.420> gun<00:01:27.570> was

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
enough I thought that the golden gun was

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.359 
enough I thought that the golden gun was
going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.380> sort<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.710> effect<00:01:29.130> on

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
going to have some sort of effect on

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.469 
going to have some sort of effect on
this<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.720> me<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.170> personal<00:01:31.590> um

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
this but for me in my personal um

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.060 
this but for me in my personal um
occasion<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.659> tried<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.229> didn't<00:01:34.770> seem<00:01:34.950> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
occasion that I tried it didn't seem to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.270 
occasion that I tried it didn't seem to
work<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.520> couldn't<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> work<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.990> just

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
work I couldn't get it to work it just

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.859 
work I couldn't get it to work it just
just<00:01:38.280> shot<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.520> into<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> water<00:01:39.180> next<00:01:39.750> up

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
just shot right into the water next up

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.719 
just shot right into the water next up
was<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.079> Titan<00:01:40.530> smash<00:01:40.860> once<00:01:41.220> again<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.610> was

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
was the Titan smash once again I was

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.249 
was the Titan smash once again I was
kind<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.939> surprised<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.659> as<00:01:42.869> well<00:01:42.899> I

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
kind of surprised with this as well I

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.630 
kind of surprised with this as well I
don't<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.560> why<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:44.189> thought<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
don't know why I just thought that the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.889 
don't know why I just thought that the
supers<00:01:45.000> we're<00:01:45.149> gonna<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> better<00:01:45.720> effect

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
supers we're gonna have a better effect

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.859 
supers we're gonna have a better effect
but<00:01:46.860> both<00:01:47.460> times<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.880> tried<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.240> tighten<00:01:48.420> smash

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
but both times I tried to tighten smash

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.800 
but both times I tried to tighten smash
with<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.649> aftermath<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.360> kind<00:01:51.689> of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
with the aftermath and with the kind of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.620 
with the aftermath and with the kind of
uh<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.500> guess<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.549> forget<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.479> it's

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
uh I guess it's I forget what it's

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179 
uh I guess it's I forget what it's
called<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> ripple<00:01:55.530> effect<00:01:55.590> along

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
called it's like the ripple effect along

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.550 
called it's like the ripple effect along
the<00:01:56.399> ground<00:01:56.750> both<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.899> them<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.079> kind<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the ground both of them just kind of

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.050 
the ground both of them just kind of
acted<00:01:58.950> normally<00:01:59.399> nothing<00:01:59.610> out<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
acted normally nothing out of the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.690 
acted normally nothing out of the
ordinary<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.659> those<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.740> finally<00:02:02.250> moving

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
ordinary with those but finally moving

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.730 
ordinary with those but finally moving
on<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.119> Warlock<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.960> actually<00:02:04.110> kind<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.560> had

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
on to the Warlock I actually kind of had

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.639 
on to the Warlock I actually kind of had
a<00:02:04.979> good<00:02:05.009> reaction<00:02:05.430> with<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.090> one<00:02:06.329> um<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:07.229> tried

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
a good reaction with this one um I tried

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.979 
a good reaction with this one um I tried
the<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.340> splits<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.149> apart<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.599> three

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the one that splits it apart in three

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.290 
the one that splits it apart in three
first

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
first

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.420 
first
that<00:02:11.690> was<00:02:11.840> kind<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.170> like<00:02:12.350> boring<00:02:12.830> i<00:02:13.040> mean<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
that was kind of like boring i mean the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.700 
that was kind of like boring i mean the
the<00:02:13.600> Nova<00:02:14.600> bomb<00:02:14.780> itself<00:02:15.140> was<00:02:15.410> slightly

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
the Nova bomb itself was slightly

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.120 
the Nova bomb itself was slightly
smaller<00:02:16.250> since<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.820> splits<00:02:17.270> um<00:02:17.800> but<00:02:18.800> then<00:02:18.980> when

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
smaller since it splits um but then when

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.100 
smaller since it splits um but then when
I<00:02:19.160> actually<00:02:19.400> switched<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.180> over<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.720> the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
I actually switched it over to the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.370 
I actually switched it over to the
aftermath<00:02:21.800> ah<00:02:22.420> Nova<00:02:23.420> bomb<00:02:23.600> which<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.080> bigger

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
aftermath ah Nova bomb which is bigger

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.430 
aftermath ah Nova bomb which is bigger
it<00:02:24.710> actually<00:02:25.130> looked<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.670> lot<00:02:25.850> cooler<00:02:26.210> so<00:02:26.750> those

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
it actually looked a lot cooler so those

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.750 
it actually looked a lot cooler so those
were<00:02:27.620> kind<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.070> I<00:02:28.250> don't<00:02:28.310> know<00:02:28.430> I'm<00:02:28.580> just
