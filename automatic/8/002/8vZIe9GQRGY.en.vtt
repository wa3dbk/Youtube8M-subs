into octane render it knows where to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.760 
into octane render it knows where to
find<00:01:14.039> all<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.549> maps<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.149> its<00:01:15.869> relative<00:01:16.440> to

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.419 

next<00:01:38.020> we'll<00:01:38.200> just<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:39.520> exit<00:01:39.939> out<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.149> DES<00:01:40.509> and

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
next we'll just will exit out of DES and

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.389 
next we'll just will exit out of DES and
boot<00:01:42.429> up<00:01:42.630> octane<00:01:43.630> render<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.649> bring<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.219> into

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
boot up octane render and bring it into

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:52.139 
boot up octane render and bring it into
that<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.939> version<00:01:50.460> 1.5<00:01:51.460> of<00:01:51.729> octane

that this is version 1.5 of octane
render<00:01:52.359> now<00:01:53.319> there's<00:01:53.560> two<00:01:53.950> ways<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.280> can

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
render now there's two ways you can

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.660 
render now there's two ways you can
import<00:01:57.280> your<00:01:57.429> object<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.920> right-click<00:02:00.490> on

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
import your object just right-click on

import your object just right-click on
this<00:02:00.969> screen<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:03.090> you'll<00:02:04.090> go<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:04.360> geometry

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
this screen and you'll go to geometry

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.979 
this screen and you'll go to geometry
mesh<00:02:06.819> and<00:02:07.299> this<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.259> where<00:02:08.500> it'll<00:02:08.950> asked<00:02:09.369> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
mesh and this is where it'll asked you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.580 
mesh and this is where it'll asked you
to<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.319> you<00:02:12.010> just<00:02:12.250> basically<00:02:13.030> click<00:02:13.750> on<00:02:13.810> where

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
to and you just basically click on where

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.339 
to and you just basically click on where
you<00:02:14.769> save<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.250> for<00:02:15.310> our<00:02:15.579> but<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.239> found<00:02:17.079> the

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
you save that for our but I found the

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.850 
you save that for our but I found the
easiest<00:02:17.709> way<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:18.519> through<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.860> Windows

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
easiest way is just through you Windows

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.920 
easiest way is just through you Windows
Explorer<00:02:21.519> have<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.690> opened<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.690> drag<00:02:25.690> and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
Explorer have it opened and drag and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.199 
Explorer have it opened and drag and
drop<00:02:25.959> straight<00:02:26.500> into<00:02:26.920> here<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:30.280> that's

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
drop straight into here and that's

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.770 
drop straight into here and that's
easily<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.930> best<00:02:32.079> method<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.620> do

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.580 

you<00:02:37.440> notice<00:02:37.800> it's<00:02:37.950> loading<00:02:38.400> all<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:41.130> maps

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
you notice it's loading all the the maps

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.850 
you notice it's loading all the the maps
towards<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:44.750> where<00:02:45.750> we<00:02:45.959> say<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.680> all

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
towards it where we say that it's all

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:56.720 
towards it where we say that it's all
relative<00:02:50.120> rodeo

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.320 

as<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.480> can<00:02:57.629> see<00:02:57.950> it's<00:02:58.970> brought<00:02:59.970> everything

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
as you can see it's brought everything

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.930 
as you can see it's brought everything
in<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:02.340> great<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.209> there<00:03:03.810> are<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:04.110> few<00:03:04.940> little

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
in in great but there are a few little

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.530 
in in great but there are a few little
things<00:03:06.269> you're<00:03:06.629> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.560> tweak<00:03:08.540> to

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
things you're going to have to tweak to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.280 
things you're going to have to tweak to
try<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.019> get<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:11.849> textures<00:03:12.420> right

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.399 

now<00:03:16.890> one<00:03:17.129> of<00:03:17.159> them<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.569> vines<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.170> can

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
now one of them is the the vines you can

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.350 
now one of them is the the vines you can
see<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.769> vines<00:03:20.069> here<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:21.299> just<00:03:21.690> not<00:03:21.930> armed

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
see the vines here of just not armed

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.289 
see the vines here of just not armed
everything<00:03:24.360> comes<00:03:24.659> in<00:03:24.989> with<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.319> scaling<00:03:26.069> of

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
everything comes in with a scaling of

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.110 
everything comes in with a scaling of
one-to-one<00:03:27.379> textures<00:03:28.379> so<00:03:29.340> but<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.730> have

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
one-to-one textures so but I have

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.229 
one-to-one textures so but I have
tileable<00:03:30.659> textures<00:03:31.319> on<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.590> vine<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:32.879> they

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
tileable textures on the vine so they

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.460 
tileable textures on the vine so they
didn't<00:03:33.569> come<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:34.849> with<00:03:35.849> with<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:38.030> open<00:03:39.030> up

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
didn't come in with with that so open up

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.199 
didn't come in with with that so open up
in<00:03:40.470> your<00:03:41.040> scene<00:03:41.280> window<00:03:41.670> over<00:03:42.000> here

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
in your scene window over here

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.210 
in your scene window over here
open<00:03:42.690> up<00:03:42.840> your<00:03:43.400> swampy<00:03:44.400> object<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.980> we<00:03:46.980> want

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
open up your swampy object and we want

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.869 
open up your swampy object and we want
to<00:03:47.340> look<00:03:47.489> at<00:03:47.819> our<00:03:48.180> roots<00:03:52.040> yes<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.400> think<00:03:53.610> that's

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
to look at our roots yes I think that's

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:02.710 
to look at our roots yes I think that's
it

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.640 

so<00:04:03.290> what<00:04:03.500> we<00:04:03.680> want<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:03.980> do<00:04:04.220> is<00:04:05.350> tile<00:04:06.350> the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
so what we want to do is tile the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.310 
so what we want to do is tile the
textures<00:04:07.220> say<00:04:07.580> 20<00:04:08.150> by<00:04:08.570> 20

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
textures say 20 by 20

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.480 
textures say 20 by 20
now<00:04:10.280> octane<00:04:10.730> render<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:12.170> doesn't<00:04:12.710> do<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.070> in<00:04:13.220> by

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
now octane render it doesn't do it in by

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.030 
now octane render it doesn't do it in by
num<00:04:13.850> it<00:04:14.120> doesn't<00:04:14.960> do<00:04:15.080> it<00:04:15.200> in<00:04:15.290> positives<00:04:15.860> it

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
num it doesn't do it in positives it

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.180 
num it doesn't do it in positives it
does<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.459> in<00:04:16.610> percentages<00:04:17.420> so<00:04:18.410> what<00:04:18.980> we're

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
does it in percentages so what we're

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.170 
does it in percentages so what we're
going<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.489> have<00:04:19.610> to<00:04:19.760> do<00:04:19.989> in<00:04:21.310> under<00:04:22.310> transform

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
going to have to do in under transform

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
going to have to do in under transform
values<00:04:24.050> UV<00:04:24.770> transforms<00:04:25.780> we<00:04:26.780> are<00:04:26.930> going<00:04:27.110> to

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
values UV transforms we are going to

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.070 
values UV transforms we are going to
have<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.530> type<00:04:27.800> in<00:04:28.660> point<00:04:29.660> zero<00:04:30.290> two<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:32.080> that

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
have to type in point zero two and that

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:41.230 
have to type in point zero two and that
should<00:04:34.030> give<00:04:35.030> us<00:04:38.530> as<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:40.430> can<00:04:40.580> see<00:04:40.820> here<00:04:41.060> that

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
should give us as you can see here that

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.370 
should give us as you can see here that
will<00:04:41.420> give<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:42.170> proper<00:04:42.440> scaling<00:04:43.190> and

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
will give you the proper scaling and

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:53.240 
will give you the proper scaling and
sizing<00:04:45.380> for<00:04:45.890> that

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.760 

so<00:04:53.850> basically<00:04:54.300> that's<00:04:54.570> really<00:04:54.990> all<00:04:55.170> year<00:04:55.440> you

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
so basically that's really all year you

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.150 
so basically that's really all year you
need<00:04:55.980> to<00:04:56.160> do<00:04:56.340> for<00:04:56.640> just<00:04:56.670> a<00:04:57.150> simple<00:04:58.160> obtain

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
need to do for just a simple obtain

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.870 
need to do for just a simple obtain
import<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.960> next<00:05:01.380> important<00:05:01.950> thing<00:05:02.010> you

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
import the next important thing you

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.510 
import the next important thing you
should<00:05:02.910> do<00:05:03.330> is<00:05:03.660> save<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.500> texture<00:05:05.040> and<00:05:05.250> you'll

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
should do is save the texture and you'll

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.900 
should do is save the texture and you'll
see<00:05:06.260> save<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.290> project<00:05:08.040> but<00:05:08.370> if<00:05:08.580> all<00:05:08.700> you'll

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
see save the project but if all you'll

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.080 
see save the project but if all you'll
see<00:05:09.120> why<00:05:09.330> later<00:05:09.360> on<00:05:09.890> we<00:05:10.890> be<00:05:11.280> using<00:05:11.490> this<00:05:11.730> as<00:05:11.880> a

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
see why later on we be using this as a

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.790 
see why later on we be using this as a
texture<00:05:13.080> template

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
texture template

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.020 
texture template
for<00:05:14.730> an<00:05:14.880> animation<00:05:15.300> import<00:05:16.610> so<00:05:17.610> those<00:05:17.820> are

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
for an animation import so those are

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:25.330 
for an animation import so those are
just<00:05:18.060> goes<00:05:18.450> save<00:05:19.080> as<00:05:19.940> I'll<00:05:20.940> save<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.560> stratum

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.279 

where<00:05:26.340> are<00:05:26.580> we

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.089 

I'll<00:05:31.770> save<00:05:32.099> it<00:05:32.129> straight<00:05:32.639> where<00:05:32.879> the<00:05:33.830> we<00:05:34.830> save

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
I'll save it straight where the we save

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.029 
I'll save it straight where the we save
the<00:05:35.340> obj<00:05:35.939> file<00:05:36.300> which<00:05:36.810> is<00:05:37.020> in<00:05:37.050> my<00:05:37.409> octane

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
the obj file which is in my octane

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.769 
the obj file which is in my octane
render<00:05:38.960> and<00:05:39.960> just<00:05:40.319> won't<00:05:40.590> be<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:42.150> cooling

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:42.779 
render and just won't be and cooling

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.580 
render and just won't be and cooling
swampy<00:05:43.229> again

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.290 

now<00:05:48.130> this<00:05:48.310> will<00:05:48.550> save<00:05:48.850> all<00:05:49.120> it'll<00:05:49.810> save<00:05:50.139> the

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
now this will save all it'll save the

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.930 
now this will save all it'll save the
the<00:05:52.300> correction<00:05:52.930> on<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.190> on<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:55.740> UV<00:05:56.740> size<00:05:57.550> on

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
the correction on the on the UV size on

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.429 
the correction on the on the UV size on
the<00:05:58.120> roots<00:05:58.419> again

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:03.439 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:07.089 

so<00:06:04.069> that<00:06:05.029> ends<00:06:05.330> just<00:06:05.629> the<00:06:05.869> the<00:06:06.110> simple<00:06:06.559> basic

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
so that ends just the the simple basic

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.509 
so that ends just the the simple basic
import<00:06:07.580> for<00:06:07.909> it<00:06:08.349> and<00:06:09.349> I'll<00:06:09.709> show<00:06:10.039> you<00:06:10.099> a<00:06:10.279> bit

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:10.519 
import for it and I'll show you a bit

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:15.009 
import for it and I'll show you a bit
