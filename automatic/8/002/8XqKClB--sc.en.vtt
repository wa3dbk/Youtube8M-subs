00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.200
 i 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.630
 I'm going to teach you how to make a green juice 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.800
 one of my favorite energizers 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.590
 stimulating and very appetizing in 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.450
 ingredients orange juice apple 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.989
 banana that we will use to give it a little 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.689
 of sweetness spinach almond seeds 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.640
 flax and ginger good obviously if not 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.460
 you have some of the ingredients 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.050
 nothing happens then we will start by throwing a 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.230
 little orange juice that we have 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.940
 done previously and then we will cut a 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.640
 apple to pieces to make it easier 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.260
 to beat and I recommend that you do not 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.449
 Alavese fights just fine 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.579
 Now let's take a seed 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.660
 linen can be previously thrown in a 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.360
 glass of water 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.670
 but I recommend having it an hour or two 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.790
 hours before it will be created as a bit of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.320
 Gelatin is worth it if you can not do it 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.900
 you want to do it immediately 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.560
 directly we throw the seeds in 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.380
 our forums 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.180
 then I will also add almonds 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.870
 you can use other nuts that 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.630
 you like me the almond is one of the 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.750
 nuts that I like the most and also 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.820
 It has many vitamins 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.380
 we also put it in our glass 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.659
 mixer 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.210
 and we are going to add a displaced piece 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.289
 As you can see, it is very mature 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.700
 precisely so that it is called that is 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.280
 one of the problems so to the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.259
 people do not like green juice is 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.229
 because it's not sweet I'm also going to add 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.030
 a few spinach is good for 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.700
 give it that green characteristic of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.210
 juices because it is very high in iron 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.600
 and that you know that spinach you do not know 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.189
 to nothing in this juice finally I'm going to 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.990
 add a piece of ginger this is 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.270
 optional because there are people who do not 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.299
 like it I am going to add some 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.270
 ginger and I'm going to beat at least one 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.220
 couple of minutes at maximum speed and 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.170
 we have our juices prepared 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.019
 I recommend serving it very cold if you want 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.750
 You can also snack on some ice 

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:14.110
 inside the juice is very good idea to 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.880
 make it more refreshing and now we only 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.069
 is to take it 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.499
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.389
