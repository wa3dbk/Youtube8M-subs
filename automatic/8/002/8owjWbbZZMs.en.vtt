00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.000
 Hello, how are you? 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.740
 better and welcome to a new video of 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.460
 minecraft in which I bring you a new 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.080
 We have called more night tour 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.360
 and well I think that you are in the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.060
 unit of what is 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.279
 this mode adds six new modes in the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.260
 which come marine mobs and motorcycles 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.600
 terrestrial which is quite 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.070
 interesting and I think that the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.900
 Creator of the model adds enough 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.480
 things more but the modes that are 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.580
 now they are well done and everything 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.550
 perfect then let's do the 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.980
 review here we have starting with a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.930
 whale you obviously did not see the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910
 I start many whales together because they 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.559
 they stuck but now we are going to get them out 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.239
 in the water they obviously will not fit 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.060
 because they are too big for this 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.820
 mini laguito but not the whale makes its 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.240
 effort has sounds with the listen 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.540
 as well as the whales 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.540
 in the whale 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.640
 and can hear the sounds of 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.530
 whale obviously I can not do anything 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.200
 because she is stuck she tries to move 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.170
 but it does not achieve its objective and if 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.390
 we kill knows if you die poor but 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.190
 because no way kill her sometimes we 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.080
 he released the fish and experience then 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.510
 power there we have 12 fish like 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.600
 can see especially the big ration what 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.420
 which is quite acceptable 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.600
 and well, here we have what would come 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.479
 being now what is of these type 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.430
 I have nightlight fish with 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.930
 They have already seen them because it is a 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.840
 marine animal obviously as they can 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.430
 see and it's a hostile way institute him 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.640
 you hit to bite and it's going to hurt you 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.110
 then here in messing with these but 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.090
 for however they are there in your world 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.009
 spinning in the sea what bet 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.039
 pretty epic since we already know the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.659
 minecraft there's no so let's say a lot 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.060
 marine variety nothing else we have the 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.960
 pulpits these that are to retard and 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.489
 like they do not do it much then 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.620
 they will have more marine animals 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.140
 obviously affects and if we combine it with 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.300
 other modes like kris urs 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.450
 like enough motorcycles there are of animals 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.569
 Well, it can be something very epic, I 'm not looking for 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.189
 We'll kill the poor guy 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.920
 as you can see they kill him and every 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.469
 experience that was strong can 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.260
 be a specific and now we continue with 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:35.049
 fiji this is another marine animal eating is 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.549
 a little fish just calmed down let's go 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.450
 put other many physis faces 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.030
 appear 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.639
 there are many bis and they are like those fish 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.739
 that are in groups of a jet of 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.109
 fish then then here they can 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.900
 see with their eyes are I think they are 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.819
 well done, it does not bother me the texture 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.430
 because there are some ways in which you 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.099
 teach the animals that they are very 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.419
 but very rare however here I believe 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.889
 that all are very well also the 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.560
 animations as you can see how they are going 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:09.010
 moving the tail of the fish and 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.590
 others then then there we have the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.959
 little hand but we continue with the animals 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.140
 now of earth the butterfly that I believe 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.790
 that you should 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.470
 to draw another idea out there the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.750
 creators since there are many butterflies in 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.060
 many modes of chubut that is called 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.910
 butterfly that are pure butterflies of 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.400
 different colors and different types 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.890
 and many many butterflies but good without 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.160
 However, it does not affect anything, we have 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.190
 of these animals can give us are 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.900
 Orange trees are the classic butterflies 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.790
 you can see us and they also have 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.890
 good animation although I think a lot 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.770
 you already know by other ways 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.630
 this kind of animals not then now 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.870
 we continue with cricket that this one exists 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.650
 epic to have a pet your cricket 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.350
 the link grill can be skipped as 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.080
 crazy as you can see in those grasshoppers 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.670
 that jumps throughout his world that does not 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.460
 You can not even see why you have houses watching 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.260
 and it escapes you and loving it jumps by 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.550
 populated as you can see up to this 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.920
 sing quietly so that people can 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.000
 see how good is fool we are going to have 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.630
 to lock him up so that you do not 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.150
 can admire in him they are admiring the 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.010
 poor little one tries to leave but can not 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.590
 we are going to assassinate we are going to 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.810
 torture him and as you can see they are not so 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.910
 specific this is what I mean 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.170
 that the degree of the mod can add and 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.090
 another that then would not be bad that 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.190
 we will add you have to drop some item and 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.020
 that with that item you would do something 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.270
 or some kind of food that you could 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.000
 cooking good are ideas that I believe that 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.370
 they would not look bad, now we continue 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.350
 with the centipede that however this is 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.460
 the centipede with less 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.530
 with less than 10 feet as you can see 246 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.380
 good if you have 12 in fact but not 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.910
 It is always definitely a malice 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.490
 obviously they are not going to stand up is 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.930
 literal because then you can not do it here 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.620
 in minecraft unless it 's a super 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.460
 design but you have seconds if they are 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.010
 2 466 on each side are 12 o'clock 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.030
 antenitas and then what would be like the 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.620
 body type of the animal and not then you 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.320
 well this one also has good 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.850
 animations stays still and walks from 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.430
 once in a while when he feels like it 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.330
 can see 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.789
 there is nothing more to the remnants 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.189
 and we kill him and he only dies 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.439
 then it is very logical that if we kill him 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.800
 it does not move good rather nothing else 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:33.259
 die better said 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.069
 and then this is the little mochito that I brought 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.500
 today I hope you have them 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:39.259
 liked 14 move that can add there 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.360
 in your folder does not affect the truth is 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.220
 super simple to install nothing more 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.319
 install in the forum and you already know with a 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.930
 installer that is obviously much more 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.430
 easy and what they do is download the mod 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.530
 that I leave in the description and what 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.110
 put in the mods folder like that 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.750
 the rar file do not have to do anything 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.490
 it tastes super simple and you can 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.080
 have their animals so that they can 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.440
 have here in the world as a man 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.120
 we found a cricket and then nothing more 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.740
 what to say we go to the one that appears here 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.849
 the little whale to see if it does not get stuck 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.849
 to see if they can navigate 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.840
 well there we have a guy 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.009
 a rare kind thing and good if you 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.900
 they ask why because the world is 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:23.819
 destroyed the folder has changed 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.340
 since I did the last review and a river 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:28.020
 past we exploit it to the world and 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.909
 nothing more to say remember that in the 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.740
 description is all the information and 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:34.289
 If you liked the world, make sure you leave a 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.289
 like and here it goes quite and it does not cost 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.889
 nothing then well we see the 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.889
 next and
