well<00:00:04.110> Nick<00:00:04.290> he's<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:05.810> soil<00:00:06.810> garden<00:00:07.140> Rises

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.759 

just<00:00:10.820> about<00:00:11.030> ready<00:00:11.269> for<00:00:11.360> Valentine's<00:00:12.230> Day

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
just about ready for Valentine's Day

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.570 
just about ready for Valentine's Day
hopefully<00:00:13.490> we<00:00:13.610> should<00:00:13.930> have<00:00:14.930> all<00:00:15.080> of<00:00:15.200> these

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
hopefully we should have all of these

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.920 
hopefully we should have all of these
picked<00:00:16.580> off<00:00:16.730> in<00:00:16.939> the<00:00:17.029> next<00:00:17.150> couple<00:00:17.689> of<00:00:17.720> days

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
picked off in the next couple of days

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.440 
picked off in the next couple of days
we've<00:00:18.680> done<00:00:19.930> some<00:00:20.930> numbers<00:00:21.320> estimating<00:00:22.330> and<00:00:23.330> I

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
we've done some numbers estimating and I

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.679 
we've done some numbers estimating and I
come<00:00:23.750> up<00:00:23.900> with<00:00:24.610> around<00:00:27.460> 1,500<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:29.180> longest

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
come up with around 1,500 of the longest

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.890 
come up with around 1,500 of the longest
M<00:00:30.939> varieties<00:00:31.989> coming<00:00:32.989> out<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:34.900> three

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
M varieties coming out of that three

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.420 
M varieties coming out of that three
rows<00:00:36.430> over<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:37.580> the<00:00:37.699> side<00:00:38.000> there<00:00:39.430> they've

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
rows over to the side there they've

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.130 
rows over to the side there they've
probably<00:00:40.790> surprised<00:00:41.510> me<00:00:41.839> greatly<00:00:42.370> as<00:00:43.370> far<00:00:43.760> as

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
probably surprised me greatly as far as

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.889 
probably surprised me greatly as far as
stem<00:00:45.140> length<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:47.800> quality<00:00:48.800> goes<00:00:49.660> all<00:00:50.660> around

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
stem length and quality goes all around

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.600 
stem length and quality goes all around
and<00:00:51.520> we<00:00:52.520> certainly<00:00:52.789> appear<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.510> have<00:00:53.660> got

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
and we certainly appear to have got

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.470 
and we certainly appear to have got
reasonably<00:00:55.610> strong<00:00:55.940> numbers<00:00:56.480> all<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.110> way

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
reasonably strong numbers all the way

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.849 
reasonably strong numbers all the way
down<00:00:59.480> through<00:01:00.280> relatively<00:01:01.280> consistent<00:01:02.859> given

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
down through relatively consistent given

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.719 
down through relatively consistent given
how<00:01:04.759> young<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.149> plants<00:01:05.509> were<00:01:05.690> and<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:07.490> think

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
how young the plants were and I think

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.789 
how young the plants were and I think
I've<00:01:07.850> got<00:01:08.000> some<00:01:08.210> photos<00:01:08.720> from<00:01:09.729> around

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.170 

Christmastime<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.180> did<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> prune<00:01:17.180> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
Christmastime and we did the prune and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.370 
Christmastime and we did the prune and
I've<00:01:18.930> certainly<00:01:19.680> come<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:20.070> very<00:01:20.340> well<00:01:21.380> since

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
I've certainly come up very well since

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.060 
I've certainly come up very well since
that<00:01:22.560> point<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.979> time<00:01:23.540> had<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.649> couple<00:01:25.649> of<00:01:25.799> minor

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that point in time had a couple of minor

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.410 
that point in time had a couple of minor
problems<00:01:27.770> with<00:01:28.770> regular<00:01:29.690> trips<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.420> but

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
problems with regular trips in here but

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.580 
problems with regular trips in here but
with<00:01:33.539> them<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.490> kept<00:01:35.490> numbers

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
with them to have kept numbers

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.510 
with them to have kept numbers
relatively<00:01:37.590> low<00:01:38.000> but<00:01:39.000> been<00:01:39.299> unable<00:01:39.899> to

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
relatively low but been unable to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.149 
relatively low but been unable to
eliminate<00:01:43.549> entirely<00:01:45.080> these<00:01:46.159> older

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
eliminate entirely these older

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.380 
eliminate entirely these older
Gabriella's<00:01:48.319> here<00:01:49.909> certainly<00:01:50.909> haven't

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
Gabriella's here certainly haven't

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.669 
Gabriella's here certainly haven't
performed<00:01:52.159> anywhere<00:01:53.159> near<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:54.300> as<00:01:55.200> well<00:01:55.470> as

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
performed anywhere near as as well as

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.730 
performed anywhere near as as well as
you<00:01:55.800> can<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.550> lot<00:01:57.270> sparser<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.170> more

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
you can see a lot sparser and more

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.149 
you can see a lot sparser and more
irregular<00:01:59.520> type<00:01:59.729> growth<00:02:00.619> but<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.830> probably

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
irregular type growth but that probably

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.419 
irregular type growth but that probably
also<00:02:02.520> does<00:02:05.810> part<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.929> the<00:02:07.289> our<00:02:07.679> reflection<00:02:08.280> of

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
also does part of the our reflection of

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.520 
also does part of the our reflection of
how<00:02:09.060> poor<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.750> actual<00:02:10.080> routing<00:02:10.410> systems<00:02:11.360> were

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
how poor the actual routing systems were

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.309 
how poor the actual routing systems were
we<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:13.709> got<00:02:13.950> some<00:02:14.420> Rouge<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> ball<00:02:16.049> sort

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
performed a little disappointed that we

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.380 
performed a little disappointed that we
didn't<00:02:31.400> get<00:02:31.490> some<00:02:31.550> longer<00:02:32.060> stems<00:02:33.160> but<00:02:34.390> the

didn't get some longer stems but the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.100 
didn't get some longer stems but the
vitals<00:02:36.280> have<00:02:37.280> probably<00:02:38.110> exceeded

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
we resorted to using some overhead

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.020 
we resorted to using some overhead
watering<00:02:53.680> because<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.770> found<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.310> we<00:02:55.910> were
