00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.330
 tutorial rolled I'll show you yet 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.299
 once like marriage clients and the game 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.740
 I know I have a few in front 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.320
 have a video about it 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.180
 but made that pretty old and me 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.760
 at that time had an extremely poor stupid 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.289
 then I update that still 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.060
 need it today with a 1.4.2010 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.069
 We however first a file the 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.699
 download as on the internet I will 

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:38.620
 quite often left you asked 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.690
 I just have to ask google 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.889
 I already picked one out if not 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:51.510
 then just enter here 

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:53.769
 minecraft 1 point for point 1.4.2010 only 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.609

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.889

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.270
 already started with direct links 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:06.670
 I do not know how long to insert 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.650
 I still do that but 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:20.030
 is also a bit google like that 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:22.310
 that download is neither for that 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.140
 the whole of his zip archive indirectly 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.490
 manager you have to have a look that 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.890
 Here we have to pack again 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.980
 and here is another text file with 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.310
 mouthguard in so now we have 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.510
 our cafÃ© now we press on this 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.640
 symbol and either go on run 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.850
 or we just give percent here 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.790
 appworld percent to confirm with 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.360
 enter now we go to the point 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.470
 minecraft folder then in the folder and 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.180
 now it's already a minecraft 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.960
 We must either delete those points 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.000
 or rename 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.000
 I'm where they now order in eg 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.979
 something what can you remember you and 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.030
 then we drag and drop this 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.850
 Just drop in 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.500
 so now we give to our desktop 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.500
 back and start a kreft 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.110
 Bark us 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.700
 Now we have introduced the hack client 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.660
 so now the latest version of the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.500
 1.9.2 unfortunately, but the principle is think 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.260
 I understood 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.860

 until next time hey people now 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.210
 there is still a small problem treatment 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.530
 it may be that if in the shredder 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.680
 inserted and minecraft starts and 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.930

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.030

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.249
 kress report is just the mistake 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.260

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:08.849
 we just see this window in 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.499
 our app data folder gene in the 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.060

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.310
 folder and then open minecraft 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:28.930

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.440
 so now we have the normal minecraft 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.120

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.590
