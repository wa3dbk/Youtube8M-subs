00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.470 
kind of being ready to snatch it and
another<00:01:02.310> interesting<00:01:02.550> thing<00:01:02.820> about<00:01:02.970> it<00:01:03.360> is

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
another interesting thing about it is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.299 
another interesting thing about it is
that<00:01:03.510> when<00:01:03.840> he's<00:01:03.990> a<00:01:04.019> nearby<00:01:04.290> mate<00:01:04.799> boosted

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that when he's a nearby mate boosted

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.069 
that when he's a nearby mate boosted
dinosaurs<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:05.999> actually<00:01:06.270> more<00:01:06.450> likely<00:01:06.719> to

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
dinosaurs are actually more likely to

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.599 
dinosaurs are actually more likely to
lay<00:01:07.200> eggs<00:01:07.409> i'm<00:01:07.679> not<00:01:07.829> even<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> when

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:08.609 
lay eggs i'm not even you when

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:10.130 
lay eggs i'm not even you when
i<00:01:08.640> say<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.329> thing<00:01:09.359> makes<00:01:09.929> other

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
i say this this thing makes other

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.810 
i say this this thing makes other
dinosaurs<00:01:10.999> you<00:01:11.999> know<00:01:12.149> that<00:01:12.630> they<00:01:13.439> wanted<00:01:13.829> yeah

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
dinosaurs you know that they wanted yeah

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.219 
dinosaurs you know that they wanted yeah
that's<00:01:15.179> what<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.049> that's

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
that's what they want to do and that's

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.389 
that's what they want to do and that's
how<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.590> their<00:01:16.770> food<00:01:16.979> they're<00:01:17.249> not

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
how to get their food they're not

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.789 
how to get their food they're not
fighters<00:01:17.700> not<00:01:18.179> scavengers<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.229> guess<00:01:19.499> the<00:01:19.619> kind

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
fighters not scavengers I guess the kind

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.889 
fighters not scavengers I guess the kind
of<00:01:19.890> scavengers<00:01:20.310> by<00:01:20.460> scavenging<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> eggs<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
of scavengers by scavenging the eggs and

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.270 
of scavengers by scavenging the eggs and
then<00:01:22.109> eating<00:01:22.530> them<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.770> that's<00:01:22.890> kind<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.159> how

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
then eating them so that's kind of how

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.980 
then eating them so that's kind of how
they<00:01:23.460> work<00:01:23.789> and<00:01:23.999> that's<00:01:24.179> kind<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.479> same<00:01:24.659> reason

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
they work and that's kind of same reason

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.179 
they work and that's kind of same reason
that<00:01:25.079> their<00:01:25.259> team<00:01:25.499> they're<00:01:25.710> not<00:01:25.829> really<00:01:25.920> tame

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that their team they're not really tame

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.889 
that their team they're not really tame
for<00:01:26.399> fighting<00:01:26.789> you<00:01:26.880> can't<00:01:27.090> ride<00:01:27.299> them<00:01:27.569> there<00:01:27.869> I

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
for fighting you can't ride them there I

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.840 
for fighting you can't ride them there I
think<00:01:28.140> well<00:01:28.590> too<00:01:28.920> small<00:01:29.219> for<00:01:29.429> that<00:01:29.549> but

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
think well too small for that but

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.879 
think well too small for that but
they're<00:01:30.030> tamed<00:01:30.359> because<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.439> you're<00:01:31.740> walking

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:31.889 
they're tamed because as you're walking

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:33.319 
they're tamed because as you're walking
around<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.700> they're<00:01:32.880> following<00:01:33.179> you

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
around you know they're following you

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.120 
around you know they're following you
they<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.409> passively<00:01:34.859> not

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
they will I think just passively not

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
they will I think just passively not
passively<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:35.850> they'll<00:01:35.999> try<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> pick<00:01:36.840> up

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
passively like they'll try to pick up

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.599 
passively like they'll try to pick up
eggs<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.499> you<00:01:37.560> guys<00:01:37.710> might<00:01:37.920> run<00:01:38.159> by<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> then

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
eggs that you guys might run by and then

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.700 
eggs that you guys might run by and then
if<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.179> pick<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.539> an<00:01:39.689> egg<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.139> should<00:01:40.439> not<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
if they pick up an egg it should not a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.139 
if they pick up an egg it should not a
grow<00:01:41.039> any<00:01:41.249> dinosaurs<00:01:41.759> because<00:01:41.969> they're

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
grow any dinosaurs because they're

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.090 
grow any dinosaurs because they're
relatively<00:01:42.630> stealthy<00:01:43.380> quote-unquote<00:01:43.979> when

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
relatively stealthy quote-unquote when

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.349 
relatively stealthy quote-unquote when
it<00:01:44.189> comes<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> picking<00:01:44.700> them<00:01:44.880> up<00:01:44.999> and<00:01:45.179> also

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
it comes to picking them up and also

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.910 
it comes to picking them up and also
having<00:01:45.749> one<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> these<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.229> Dino<00:01:46.499> pen<00:01:46.799> or

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
having one of these in your Dino pen or

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.410 
having one of these in your Dino pen or
something<00:01:47.069> should<00:01:47.670> make<00:01:47.819> sure<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.240> your

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
something should make sure that your

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.969 
something should make sure that your
dinosaurs<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.859> be

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
dinosaurs are actually going to be

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
dinosaurs are actually going to be
laying<00:01:50.429> eggs<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:51.179> often<00:01:51.569> because<00:01:51.719> if<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
laying eggs more often because if you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.569 
laying eggs more often because if you
have<00:01:52.259> made<00:01:52.409> boosted<00:01:52.740> dinosaurs<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.399> pen

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
have made boosted dinosaurs in your pen

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.279 
have made boosted dinosaurs in your pen
they<00:01:53.880> should<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.270> able<00:01:54.359> to<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.719> that<00:01:54.899> however

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
they should be able to do that however

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.919 
they should be able to do that however
because<00:01:55.619> its<00:01:55.979> main<00:01:56.219> food<00:01:56.609> source<00:01:56.639> is<00:01:57.179> eggs<00:01:57.689> I'm

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
because its main food source is eggs I'm

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.379 
because its main food source is eggs I'm
feeling<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.829> leave<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.819> pen<00:02:00.090> in

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:00.389 
feeling if you do leave it in the pen in

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:02.179 
feeling if you do leave it in the pen in
a<00:02:00.569> time<00:02:00.929> with<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.170> dinos<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.619> does<00:02:01.770> pick<00:02:02.039> up

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
a time with your dinos and does pick up

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.459 
a time with your dinos and does pick up
the<00:02:02.340> eggs<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.759> your<00:02:02.909> dinos<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.479> might<00:02:03.990> end<00:02:04.139> up

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the eggs of your dinos it might end up

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.769 
the eggs of your dinos it might end up
eating<00:02:04.740> them<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.399> well<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.479> kind<00:02:06.749> of

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:06.779 
eating them as well so that's kind of

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:07.940 
eating them as well so that's kind of
like<00:02:06.899> i'm<00:02:07.170> not<00:02:07.350> sure<00:02:07.560> that's<00:02:07.679> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.889> work

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
like i'm not sure that's going to work

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.490 
like i'm not sure that's going to work
but<00:02:08.459> who<00:02:08.909> knows<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.689> the<00:02:09.750> most<00:02:09.899> part<00:02:10.049> this

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
but who knows but for the most part this

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.839 
but who knows but for the most part this
is<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> pretty<00:02:10.860> interesting<00:02:11.129> Dino<00:02:11.519> because

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
is a pretty interesting Dino because

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.520 
is a pretty interesting Dino because
this<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.120> not<00:02:12.299> a<00:02:12.330> fighting<00:02:12.780> donalds<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.409> not

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
this is not a fighting donalds it's not

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.210 
this is not a fighting donalds it's not
like<00:02:13.650> an

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
like an

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.830 
like an
active<00:02:14.670> died<00:02:14.940> know<00:02:15.000> if<00:02:15.210> anything's<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.630> kind

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
active died know if anything's is kind

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.230 
active died know if anything's is kind
of<00:02:15.930> passive<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.920> sense<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.310> its<00:02:17.820> purpose

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
of passive in the sense that its purpose

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.780 
of passive in the sense that its purpose
is<00:02:18.660> not<00:02:19.500> really<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.800> purpose<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.400> what<00:02:20.550> other

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
is not really the purpose of what other

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.720 
is not really the purpose of what other
dinos<00:02:21.420> do<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.320> like<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.920> new<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.280> have

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
dinos do this is like really new to have

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.160 
dinos do this is like really new to have
something<00:02:24.210> where<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:24.480> like<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.870> could<00:02:25.080> have

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
something where it's like you could have

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.510 
something where it's like you could have
them<00:02:25.260> chill<00:02:25.560> at<00:02:25.680> your<00:02:25.710> base<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.340> he's<00:02:26.430> just

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
them chill at your base and he's just

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.250 
them chill at your base and he's just
being<00:02:26.820> useful<00:02:27.030> by<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.570> chillin<00:02:27.990> your<00:02:28.140> other

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
being useful by just chillin your other

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.690 
being useful by just chillin your other
dinosaurs<00:02:28.830> which<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.100> really<00:02:29.310> cool<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.670> see

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
dinosaurs which is really cool to see

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.180 
dinosaurs which is really cool to see
kind<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.240> new<00:02:30.480> type<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.930> dinosaur<00:02:31.350> per<00:02:31.860> se<00:02:32.130> to

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
kind of a new type of dinosaur per se to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.980 
kind of a new type of dinosaur per se to
be<00:02:32.460> introduced<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.180> I'm<00:02:33.300> really<00:02:33.480> liking<00:02:33.690> that

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
be introduced so I'm really liking that

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.990 
be introduced so I'm really liking that
and<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.710> can't<00:02:34.980> wait<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.220> see<00:02:35.520> what<00:02:35.610> happens<00:02:35.700> I'm

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
and I can't wait to see what happens I'm

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.160 
and I can't wait to see what happens I'm
definitely<00:02:36.210> have<00:02:36.480> one<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.660> these<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.810> my<00:02:36.960> pen

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
definitely have one of these in my pen

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.660 
definitely have one of these in my pen
but<00:02:37.410> potentially<00:02:38.010> I'll<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.280> kind<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.520> like

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
but potentially I'll just kind of like

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.160 
but potentially I'll just kind of like
block<00:02:39.000> them<00:02:39.210> off<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.600> don't<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:39.900> we're<00:02:40.080> gonna

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
block them off I don't know we're gonna

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.720 
block them off I don't know we're gonna
have<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.380> see<00:02:40.560> how<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.830> works<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.370> can't

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
have to see how that works but I can't

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.030 
have to see how that works but I can't
wait<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.060> tame<00:02:42.270> one<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.510> these<00:02:42.630> supercool<00:02:43.470> came

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
wait to tame one of these supercool came

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.470 
wait to tame one of these supercool came
in<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.220> see<00:02:44.280> what<00:02:44.340> happens<00:02:44.700> if<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.030> guys<00:02:45.240> have
