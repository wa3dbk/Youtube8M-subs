00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
feel that I can maybe place top 10 but

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.650 
feel that I can maybe place top 10 but
if<00:04:04.360> I<00:04:04.510> don't<00:04:04.750> win<00:04:05.170> then<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:06.790> play<00:04:06.970> top<00:04:07.210> 10<00:04:07.450> so

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
if I don't win then I can play top 10 so

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.130 
if I don't win then I can play top 10 so
why<00:04:07.810> go<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.260> waste<00:04:08.410> my<00:04:08.590> time<00:04:08.770> so<00:04:09.960> you<00:04:10.960> know<00:04:11.110> I
