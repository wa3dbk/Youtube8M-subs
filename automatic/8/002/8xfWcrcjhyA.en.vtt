00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.940 

lot<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.730> storage<00:03:58.209> in<00:03:58.480> there

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
lot of storage in there

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.220 
lot of storage in there
now<00:03:59.950> these<00:04:00.280> do<00:04:00.640> come<00:04:00.670> off<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.720> middle<00:04:04.989> one<00:04:05.140> is

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
now these do come off the middle one is

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.089 
now these do come off the middle one is
not<00:04:05.470> so<00:04:05.709> bad<00:04:06.330> this<00:04:07.330> one<00:04:07.660> here<00:04:08.019> when<00:04:08.769> you<00:04:08.860> pull

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
not so bad this one here when you pull

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.550 
not so bad this one here when you pull

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
it off

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.220 
it off
well<00:04:11.560> sometimes<00:04:12.069> grab<00:04:12.370> onto<00:04:12.610> this<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.360> pull

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
well sometimes grab onto this and pull

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.479 
well sometimes grab onto this and pull
these<00:04:14.379> off<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.769> door<00:04:15.010> so<00:04:15.220> yeah<00:04:15.310> be<00:04:15.459> very

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
these off the door so yeah be very

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.129 
these off the door so yeah be very
careful<00:04:16.329> I<00:04:18.150> would<00:04:19.150> have<00:04:19.239> just<00:04:19.419> did<00:04:19.959> this<00:04:20.079> a

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
careful I would have just did this a

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:29.820 
careful I would have just did this a
little<00:04:20.350> differently<00:04:21.990> but<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.139> works<00:04:28.800> then<00:04:29.800> you

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
little differently but it works then you

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.770 
little differently but it works then you
get<00:04:30.100> the<00:04:30.400> doors<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:30.910> sides<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.389> get<00:04:31.570> a

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
get the doors on the sides you get a

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.560 
get the doors on the sides you get a
total<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.560> three<00:04:33.810> entry<00:04:34.810> points<00:04:35.229> for<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
total of three entry points for the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.909 
total of three entry points for the
truck<00:04:40.570> there's<00:04:41.229> some<00:04:41.470> doors<00:04:41.650> on<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.860> other

truck there's some doors on the other
side<00:04:46.289> this<00:04:47.289> is<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.650> hitch<00:04:47.889> it<00:04:48.190> just<00:04:48.400> simply

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
side this is the hitch it just simply

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:56.129 
side this is the hitch it just simply
sits<00:04:50.010> down<00:04:51.010> in<00:04:51.220> here<00:04:54.180> it's<00:04:55.180> real<00:04:55.389> easy<00:04:55.419> to<00:04:55.690> snap

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
sits down in here it's real easy to snap

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:04.110 
sits down in here it's real easy to snap
in<00:04:58.530> let's<00:04:59.530> take<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.740> look<00:05:00.039> the<00:05:01.289> truck<00:05:02.639> has<00:05:03.639> doors

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
in let's take a look the truck has doors

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.860 
in let's take a look the truck has doors

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
it open has these mirrors those puzzle

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.820 
it open has these mirrors those puzzle
like<00:05:08.020> mirrors<00:05:08.410> there's<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.280> inside<00:05:10.830> and

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
like mirrors there's the inside and

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.510 
like mirrors there's the inside and
we'll<00:05:12.310> open<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.760> up<00:05:13.889> which<00:05:14.889> is<00:05:14.919> really<00:05:15.340> is<00:05:15.400> it

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
we'll open it up which is really is it

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.320 
we'll open it up which is really is it
open<00:05:15.849> this<00:05:16.450> is<00:05:16.630> actually<00:05:16.990> hinged<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:18.220> you<00:05:19.150> can

don't have notice you get a little TV in
there<00:05:26.500> too<00:05:26.650> so<00:05:26.680> it's<00:05:26.919> kind<00:05:27.130> of<00:05:27.190> like<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.400> little

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
there too so it's kind of like a little

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.450 
there too so it's kind of like a little
mini<00:05:28.530> trailer<00:05:29.530> in<00:05:29.650> here<00:05:29.860> like<00:05:29.979> a<00:05:30.070> little<00:05:30.310> RV

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
driver just doing a long haul I guess

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.920
