00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.250 

and<00:03:16.020> your<00:03:16.380> color<00:03:16.620> should<00:03:17.010> connect<00:03:18.260> underneath

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
and your color should connect underneath

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.530 
and your color should connect underneath
like<00:03:19.470> that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.730 

so<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.660> looks<00:03:25.900> like<00:03:26.020> that<00:03:26.230> you'll<00:03:26.530> need<00:03:26.650> to

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
so it looks like that you'll need to

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.430 
so it looks like that you'll need to
take<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.950> two<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.340> four<00:03:27.580> blending<00:03:28.060> brush<00:03:28.440> and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
take a two to four blending brush and

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.400 
take a two to four blending brush and
just<00:03:29.590> make<00:03:29.800> some<00:03:29.830> swirly<00:03:30.220> circles<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:32.200> soften

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
just make some swirly circles to soften

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.720 
just make some swirly circles to soften
the<00:03:32.620> edges<00:03:33.810> but<00:03:34.810> keeping<00:03:35.050> it<00:03:35.230> dark<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:36.310> here

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:04:04.780 

blend<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:39.880> into<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.180> silver

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.130 

now<00:04:05.790> at<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.000> moment<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.420> looks<00:04:06.569> a<00:04:06.690> little<00:04:06.900> bit

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
now at the moment it looks a little bit

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.259 
now at the moment it looks a little bit
more<00:04:07.349> green<00:04:07.620> than<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.220> does<00:04:08.370> black<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:09.120> it's

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
more green than it does black so it's

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.750 
more green than it does black so it's
black<00:04:09.480> an<00:04:09.629> art<00:04:09.840> I'm<00:04:10.110> going<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.530> take<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:11.040> matte

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
just to make it a little bit more
