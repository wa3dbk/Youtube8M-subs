into<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:34.680> dichroic<00:00:35.010> surface<00:00:37.580> we<00:00:38.580> have<00:00:38.760> finished

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
into a dichroic surface we have finished

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.320 
into a dichroic surface we have finished
pendant<00:00:40.080> here<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:41.010> we're<00:00:41.220> going<00:00:41.970> to<00:00:42.089> make

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
dichroic glass on the top and we've

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.340 
dichroic glass on the top and we've
placed<00:00:50.430> our<00:00:52.400> pre-cut<00:00:53.400> hat<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.839> top<00:00:54.869> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
allowed that to melt inside the dichroic

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.579 
allowed that to melt inside the dichroic
glass<00:00:58.350> which<00:00:59.339> gives<00:00:59.580> a<00:00:59.699> really<00:01:00.119> lovely

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
glass which gives a really lovely

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.310 
glass which gives a really lovely
3-dimensional<00:01:01.589> effect<00:01:02.390> okay<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.839> let's<00:01:04.140> get

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
3-dimensional effect okay so let's get

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.190 
3-dimensional effect okay so let's get
started<00:01:05.090> I'll<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.299> show<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.570> quickly<00:01:07.049> what

this<00:01:37.859> is<00:01:38.039> fuse<00:01:38.850> works<00:01:39.649> with<00:01:40.649> orange<00:01:41.780> orange

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
this is fuse works with orange orange

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.370 
this is fuse works with orange orange
honeycomb<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.009> called<00:01:44.249> and<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:46.049> our

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
honeycomb it's called and we have our

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.069 
honeycomb it's called and we have our
little<00:01:46.590> pre-cut<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.450> little<00:01:48.810> pre<00:01:49.049> cap<00:01:49.380> hat

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
little pre-cut here a little pre cap hat

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.830 
little pre-cut here a little pre cap hat
so<00:01:52.189> what<00:01:53.189> we're<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:53.789> is<00:01:54.090> start<00:01:54.719> off

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
so what we're going to do is start off

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.959 
so what we're going to do is start off
with<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.109> black<00:01:55.319> base<00:01:55.590> we're<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> put<00:01:56.700> our

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
with a black base we're going to put our

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.139 
with a black base we're going to put our
dichroic<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:57.990> top<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.409> it

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
dichroic on top of it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.859 
dichroic on top of it
and<00:01:59.299> then<00:01:59.600> put<00:01:59.840> our<00:01:59.990> clear<00:02:00.829> heart<00:02:01.219> on<00:02:01.670> top<00:02:01.869> so

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
and then put our clear heart on top so

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.200 
and then put our clear heart on top so
we<00:02:02.899> need<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.289> just<00:02:03.469> catch<00:02:03.740> our<00:02:04.070> black<00:02:04.880> piece

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
we need to just catch our black piece

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.669 
we need to just catch our black piece
obviously<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:07.100> start<00:02:07.490> with<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:09.410> we'll<00:02:09.560> just

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
obviously to start with so we'll just

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.460 
obviously to start with so we'll just
cut<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.099> to<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.429> right<00:02:10.580> shape<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:12.230> see

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
cut that to the right shape but you see

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.309 
cut that to the right shape but you see
we<00:02:12.620> can<00:02:12.800> use<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.420> piece<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.599> dichroic<00:02:15.140> via

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
we can use the piece of dichroic via

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.830 
we can use the piece of dichroic via
just<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.739> measure<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.190> right<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:17.269> right<00:02:17.480> size

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
just to measure the right the right size

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.400 
just to measure the right the right size
for<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.290> black<00:02:22.420> one<00:02:23.420> nice<00:02:23.720> little<00:02:23.989> score

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
for this black one nice little score

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:37.030 
for this black one nice little score
line<00:02:24.650> there<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:27.519> break<00:02:28.519> it<00:02:28.700> off<00:02:35.739> black<00:02:36.739> piece

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
line there and break it off black piece

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.330 
line there and break it off black piece
on<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:38.680> dichroic<00:02:39.680> piece<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.840> then<00:02:41.840> our<00:02:42.200> heart

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.100
