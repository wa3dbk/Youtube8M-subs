00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.500
 personal speech beauty orlando martins 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.450
 another video for you and good people 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.670
 this time making another video of 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.820
 lightning tips that in the last video 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.619
 I told you it 's Castilian panela series wants 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.350
 a series of tips and mud but it is 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.720
 plus a video of casting tips but then 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.190
 Just remembering that, let's go guys. 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.699
 first occurs bg 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.650
 The first tip for you today is that I 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.730
 forgot'm with my friend to phuket 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.610
 present 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.559
 Hi guys and he's going to help me here 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.110
 do the business 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.700
 but then as first tip guys do not 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 I know everything as the first one I have 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.469
 For you, let's say the enemy is 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 there I am in it 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.300
 Yeah, I'm here in the background, there's no 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.070
 I appeal to people not only the canon 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.160
 but then he was in the bathroom he 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.690
 starts to hide but I will continue 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.630
 training let's say I'm 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.500
 but it will carry and hide 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.479
 still taking little 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.759
 because someday it will show up 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.140
 He'll end up killing him so let's go. 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.759
 to simulate luck already 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.130
 the channel went from side to side and 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.330
 hid from came back so it's good to continue 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.069
 especially if the guy has 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.979
 a rivet because he will come back one day 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.330
 nÃ© and he almost always go back to the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.179
 same place he will not do another route 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.270
 so it stays there that it will get better 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.280
 I do not know, you can count on Setuf. 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.630
 continue taking it out if we 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.580
 will show up because he always goes 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.420
 go back to the same place but we will not 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.670
 here for the next tip good guys 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.399
 The next I have for you is 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.009
 You are is something I saw in the new 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.000
 to deduce that it does is to say it some 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.610
 shots right? 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.340
 it loads and before the finished ammunition 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.349
 loading and reloading weapon change and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 This will get in your way very expensive because 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:07.979
 sometimes you will lose it say the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.709
 time give me tell it becomes delay and 23 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.120
 seconds to load this time more 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.730
 can not calculate right 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.030
 then it is pretense under the ammunition that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.010
 was 26/1 84 now let's say that this 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.930
 weapon that comes to 30 when you get 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.450
 30 of the area code do whatever you want 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.909
 but I arrived at 30 in the arruda one of 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.450
 gun this is a hint another one of those well 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.790
 coarse 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.720
 but many people do not pay attention and 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.989
 do it 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.400
 and let's say it 's 22 ammunition later 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.260
 arrives someone does not have a mission to 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.019
 kill the guy gives this iron gets angry 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.760
 since then is to pay attention to the tip 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.010
 ammunition before changing weapons 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.250
 This was reloading the gun, we're 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.470
 here for the next tip good guys 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.530
 third and last tip of today is that 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.330
 any damage is profit on the enemy then 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.170
 Let's say the enemy is running. 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.180
 there and not only to demonstrate and take a 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.950
 shot at it even though everything is very 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.920
 away from him I think it will not hit him 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.319
 and you will love me, this will leave you a prototype 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.599
 have the team mark it is not going to leave 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.860
 the team stealing fred is yours and giving shot 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.870
 he's the same because there for 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.239
 example, many people were named 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.329
 walk and two matches and search with 12 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.849
 of life or more until 30 and is no longer 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.769
 because a shot will kill the guy then give 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.420
 a shot even though you 're not going to china 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.280
 kill this guy because sometimes he can 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.610
 killing happens is not always obvious 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.530
 huh 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.290
 but it could happen then you did not have your 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.150
 enemy is to see if you can get 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.739
 the car and will get them to hit more 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.910
 a shot better then yet 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.069
 but then good people this is the tip is me 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.079
 I hope these tips have helped and 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.940
 if the club helps you and I want you to leave 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.680
 a fan and also if you can help me 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.230
 even if you did not have to help the 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.389
 I liked the video but I already knew 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.769
 these tips is I think we left here 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.989
 my obvious way I'm not fighting 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.540
 You do that, but if you can do it, I'll 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.920
 stay very happy and is also commented 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.900
 I thought if you have a tip in 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.630
 Any tips for giving me to do 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.260
 next videos name where I'm going 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.359
 do 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.970
 and that's what she was once a car of 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.340
 future and also induce and also the 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.500
 number one thing now that I'm 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.880
 thinking about creating two new series 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.849
 the first one is going to be what I'm going to recommend 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.739
 more for you and the second I go 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.590
 recommend spots for those who do not know 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.720
 sport is kind of looking to destroy the places 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.110
 where you put your bomb that 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.810
 You'll be able to keep an eye on her or 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.110
 other sports I mean type leakage 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.460
 huh 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.710
 let's debut to capture the flag 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.430
 tsb project can flee then grab the 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.440
 flag 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.940
 this is something that helps a lot and 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.190
 I think it would be time to move on to 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.910
 You are some more tips then 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:49.430
 one is it guys and want to say goodbye love 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:54.270
 Good people, this was the bag for me. 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.010
 It's a lie then I leave it here. 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.550
 video because just because the father appeared 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.310
 Italian is quick to happen again 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.260
 My, then, let's just miss the one on the bank. 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.910
 in a container I finalize the video 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.030
 guys from far away today to see 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.030
 far 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:21.630
 fuck today that seeing this here is where 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:24.600
 I'm seeing a lot of backlinks missing 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.760
 by far, it was this partnership 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.130
 very good but it is not what it once was 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.130
 the next spoke wii
