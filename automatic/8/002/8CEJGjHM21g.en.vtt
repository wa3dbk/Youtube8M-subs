00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.909
 we are still here the love of this much of this world 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.339
 video game questions pass more than me 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.619
 5 years 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.920
 Courses directors contact so proudly please today 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.920
 usufruct year leaders are important 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.540
 we asked ourselves who we kept asking for it 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.030
 I learned to do icon 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.050
 before a prism and afterwards anyway 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.090
 a survey that produces a pro tour 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.500
 because, soon a thought is a precious heritage 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.670
 a beautiful melancholy for those who can 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.530
 writes lesbian photographer 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.430
 but equally for those who run 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.610
 bittorrent except for rare exceptions as it can do more 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.319
 It is humanly understandable 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.940
 the term of comparison sleeps too heavy 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.510
 tobaccos, however, to report an impotent 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.439
 each of us has images and words fragments of a direct relationship 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.990
 to preserve over time 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.370
 according to the procedure below 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.510
 also for this private 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.920
 after 6 May photo finder on tv 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.520
 was forced to com 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.790
 endless bomb 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.150
 and would have been poorly supported 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.480
 even if the tragedy had not intervened 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.270
 is a void is true is a manga legacy 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.040
 because otherwise he had 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.580
 all for director 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.480
 inside a sports legend 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.110
 that's why my name is me 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.250
 he was an extraordinary pilot as little telegenic televised 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.390
 he was a dis 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.350
 upset and for this movie 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.080
 according to normal mode 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.780
 he seemed very strong even in defeat 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.040
 therefore fascinating 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.590
 and it was 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.120
 very uncomfortable 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.120
 dark absurd project 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.370
 not solvable heavy shoes 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.500
 quite 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.830
 double-glazing over time 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.419
 nostalgia always ready 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.090
 but also to treat sky with indulgence 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.969
 after scene continued to run 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.219
 to win to fight with the knowledge of having say 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.569
 the missing man in love with another champion 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.259
 therefore always present 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.089
 available for a regret 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:25.879
 to renew endlessly 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.709
 evening something 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.579
 still something special 182 oulux the water - deep 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.869
 star Wars 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.469
 niece well kenobi games 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.769
 what was going blogged lesson 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.719
 if he is something of you true the crystalline that had to do with it 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.719
 mind with the refraction of the stars 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.249
 &amp; lt not look for a similarity between different people wrong 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:11.169
 each of us is an individual you are different from every other journalist the 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.329
 whole world and populated by people with a precise identity 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.779
 ayrton was a great pilot a fantastic man 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.629
 unfortunately it no longer exists and we remember it intensely but every other 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.989
 pilot you have your own personality talent 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.049
 I think it's not fair to look for asus comparisons 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:42.349
 because helping a bow was a pilot 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.099
 always in the middle of the discussion and it was going very fast with which 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.039
 capilli bilili 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.039
 and in that sense of schumacher for sale 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.139
 what came next if the word 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.139
 as a jolt is one now 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.289
 clearly 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.680
 fantastic 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.109
 of correctness exaggerated 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.059
 I had confidence in him and when I gave ditches to trying 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.080
 they are false 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.080
 waiting for you i knew he doesn't move you see a midi i do 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.699
 hola I think people don't want to talk about it at least I talk a lot 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:36.719
 willingly 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:40.589
 file open knife a great interest because people keep reminding you 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:42.490
 of youtube don't forget it 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.990
 this means that it has represented a very important part 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.000
 for the formula 1 for years amps interest around this sport as well 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.110
 obviously we all miss you newcomers 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.740
 we can win 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.710
 there is only one place 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.710
 Little Red Riding Hood. 1-1 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:24.089
 Schumacher Sophocles 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:28.469
 he insisted on helping behind imola his name on the roll of honor &amp; lt 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.699
 cost of handover a miraculous succession in front of the 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:33.979
 pure talent 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.069
 it was not so 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:36.370
 if we evaluate others 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.020
 customize character 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.279
 relationship with life is a reality 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.830
 schumacher need victory 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.559
 taken the google maps 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:47.699
 we have rarely seen pilots able to hunt success with such fury 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.699
 in the end unable to really stay close to people's hearts 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.219
 it has never quite trivial inconsistent 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.330
 not interested you can live 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.779
 the only one with a personality above the lines 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:03.389
 he was the protagonist of a choice that I removed from the proscenium free mail 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.809
 only a challenge promised a suspension 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:07.249
 you can archimede 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.830
 nice interesting 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.979
 certainly not very nice very interesting very interesting 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.969
 nothing to do 4 world champions with no legacy 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.939
 this is why we are here to remind you of the scene without struggling to see if but 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:21.020
 without boredom 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.580
 it is inevitable but a bad habit can also be a vice 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.889
 even the multiple lack of respect 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.360
 we are taken a license more than memory 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.869
 but then stop 

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:34.939
 because no one can pay this cont 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:37.119
 and maybe that's right 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.769
 it is better that way
