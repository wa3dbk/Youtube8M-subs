00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 So included a little look at scan 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.750
 Plus this is a new release 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.820
 for iphone and ipad comes from software 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.500
 you probably know the bude 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.200
 by pdf pen this is a relative 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.610
 popular pdf tool on mac us 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.170
 Now look at the iOS application 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.880
 from the on and that is first and foremost 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.250
 one of these scanners you make 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.170
 Photo of a document from a sheet 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.789
 paper can then do the whole thing as 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.710
 more page pdf secure something here 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.939
 comes with it is a text recognition 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.380
 among other things also in German 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.400
 language is available and we have it for you 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.700
 Just try it for a while 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.260
 does i start the app for her ? 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.850
 is now for the first time a teaching documents 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.129
 View of the complete documents after and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.000
 after adding new photos when I am here 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.550
 make or 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.800
 I can import pdfs namely and whether 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.960
 the plus express me directly from the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.270
 dropbox or from evernote files 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.340
 add or on which 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.930
 I previously wrote about itunes on iphone 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.699
 but can also have a new one copied 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.829
 take a picture or 1 from the picture gallery 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.059
 We'll get that soon 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.379
 above still briefly with this 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.570
 wrench in the setting 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.890
 there are a few settings icons 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.199
 Personally, I do not like it that much 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 give me a short tutorial video tutorial 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.960
 and most importantly we can here 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.729
 Do not just stop it if it's the iCloud 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.799
 want to use but also in which 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.189
 language we want to recognize the text 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.080
 or the text we are taking pictures of 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.070
 you should know in advance what 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.900
 Portuguese takes pictures and likes 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.790
 want to have the text to continue to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.380
 use in the e-mail contrary to that one 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.850
 before you install the package 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.140
 you can just do it that way 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.729
 free of charge so resp 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.890
 the app costs money for euro 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.060
 bit the packages can be free 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.270
 we have to be installed here 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.939
 the German installed activates yes 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.110
 and I think that is enough for us so far in 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.490
 the attitudes and we say 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.640
 Just make a new photo we have 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.390
 it lies in the document camera goes 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.390
 exactly 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.940
 this time you can focus now 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.409
 choose if he will take it that way 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.810
 Wish or not I say yes that can 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.610
 you keep and should accept that in the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.990
 best case made me there more 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.400
 Recognition I have just now 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.080
 I do not like it that way 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.640
 good for the one you see here I have 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080
 extremely dark underground taken a 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.810
 bright sheet of paper the recognition 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.000
 somehow recognizes the edge of one 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.770
 but not from the picture so 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.410
 here and on the other 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.180
 one can say here in which one 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.660
 area you like to be sampled 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.760
 would like to 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.930
 because the area there is a text 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.640
 be recognized because one of mine 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.790
 edited and there are applications here 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.530
 a little better the whole thing 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.080
 handle me the area my 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.340
 can rightly draw something with the finger 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.930
 then it is a bit annoying me 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.519
 the fact that i have no magnifying glass 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.010
 displayed wars and accordingly 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.110
 can not see from where to where i find myself 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.330
 there was the text chosen a bit 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.010
 chubby man is just holding his finger 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.010
 on it and does not really look 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.709
 limit that here and he sees too 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.569
 I have a little problem with this one 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.070
 sales should get but so like it 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.660
 that's a good thing you can do about 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.130
 say those are the two sets 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.630
 because of me, I continue to process 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.640
 I just want to say my okay 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.750
 attitude then gets displayed 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.820
 that they look good to you so far though 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.040
 maybe I would turn again 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.360
 suggest having it down there right now 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.079
 still the possibility here to influence 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.370
 take on the color or 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.540
 the brightness of the we could until now 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.920
 luca must be a little brighter 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.329
 I make a bit more contrasty 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.560
 Do not just know everything like it 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.700
 works if you do that in the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.350
 standard settings left inside 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.140
 we just jump on to the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.480
 next to the next selection window 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.579
 exactly and he offers me this now 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.280
 either monochrome in black and white here 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.109
 in gray scale or in color 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.570
 I say I speak it in gray tones 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:36.340
 From that you can do so well so very well 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.209
 I think recognize and say safe now 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.220
 Now I have the document here 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.230
 saved he could quasi one more 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.489
 others add another 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.269
 and so on, but we do 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.530
 want a bit like that 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.840
 Speech recognition works or 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.250
 text recognition open the document here 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.830
 and have a button which calls itself 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.330
 ocr 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.810
 I can now tap on that and I can 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.160
 best case exactly he starts here 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.720
 the text recognition then goes line by line 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.480
 line through you can already see he needed 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.099
 a little bit of time, but that has changed 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.980
 then once finished and now has quasi 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.000
 the complete text is recognized by the document 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.470
 could now be sent by e-mail 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.750
 because of me up here 's the button 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.670
 hard if I say everything can do the pdf 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.420
 what I have created now shipped 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.070
 by email 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.489
 the recipient of the pdf then gets 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.660
 can copy the text out is yes 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.190
 always very exciting if you then mine 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.630
 photographed the recipe or something 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.950
 what you send on my e mail that 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.870
 you do not send a picture but instead 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.490
 then just the text with it 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.930
 can do that reformat again 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.150
 Let's see what he's doing here 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.070
 has recognized and for that I open times 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.930
 my note applications here in the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.370
 second screen should be so before 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.720
 you may copy the texts out 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.520
 that can also do about the 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.139
 settings here we say hobby page 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.910
 text now has the text in a gate 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.650
 has recognized copied from the photo 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.080
 if now a note application 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.030
 Go and say I want the whole thing 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.430
 then we see here that became 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.570
 just recognized the dynamic increase 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.860
 The countries are covered by the 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.570
 pension adjustment it is aimed 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.120
 basically according to wage development 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.770
 blablabla if you look at it that way 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.880
 first look you know when you do that 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.789
 has tried with others 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.039
 Document scanners you know that 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.720
 one relatively often trainer so typical 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.639
 Does not have any letters 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.500
 Sinn make umlauts next to commas without 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.720
 exclamation point this actually looks 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.120
 after a pretty readable 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.380
 German text from the numbers vote 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.100
 the comma mood name phone number 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.590
 formatted in it , he has everything right 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:31.289
 on it twice or in the old and at 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.490
 will like to abatement 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.169
 or or look at times yes I have here in 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.570
 my photo actually no or in it 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.729
 I do not know where that comes from and me 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.620
 say so he check it again 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.120
 if i can take the picture i made 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.950
 have and the text of the garde and the 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.960
 fight was under this entry here 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.940
 place and then you can also 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.710
 times word for word compare 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.229
 By and large, it's the scan 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.820
 plus application one has then stop here 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.680
 his documents in it and if you like that 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.300
 a document goes in like this then 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.770
 you could add extra pages 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.539
 Add then has one for my sake 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.220
 Six-page pdf what to send 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.390
 can 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.770
 and I think that was it in the big and 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.870
 whole here with the little app 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.520
 imagination may be useful 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.530
 for you the text recognition makes you one 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.640
 Good job the edge selection could be 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.030
 be much better 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.210
 On the whole you should keep an eye on 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.210
 to keep
