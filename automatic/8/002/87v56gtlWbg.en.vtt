the<00:01:31.020> regular<00:01:31.440> one<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:34.080> weakest<00:01:34.440> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the regular one this is the weakest of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.930 
the regular one this is the weakest of
the<00:01:34.619> rocket<00:01:34.950> launches<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> holds<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
the rocket launches but it holds the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.700 
the rocket launches but it holds the
most<00:01:36.060> ammo<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.990> probably<00:01:37.229> better<00:01:37.590> for

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
most ammo it's probably better for

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.890 
most ammo it's probably better for
taking<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.190> groups<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.640> enemies<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:39.210> mini

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
taking out groups of enemies or mini

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.930 
taking out groups of enemies or mini
bosses<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.890> okay<00:01:41.190> gets<00:01:41.430> regular<00:01:41.759> pasta

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
bosses but it's okay gets regular pasta

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.480 
bosses but it's okay gets regular pasta

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.810 

as<00:01:55.510> if<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:56.080> see<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.320> regular<00:01:56.860> Atlanta<00:01:57.670> would

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.040 
Lisa so it's not like I really have any
choice<00:02:02.380> she<00:02:03.280> just<00:02:03.490> keeps<00:02:03.670> on<00:02:03.790> moving<00:02:04.120> but<00:02:04.960> it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
choice she just keeps on moving but it

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:30.250 
choice she just keeps on moving but it
doesn't<00:02:05.350> do<00:02:05.410> so<00:02:05.590> much<00:02:05.800> damage

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.800 

that's<00:02:31.129> all<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.519> ammo<00:02:31.819> that<00:02:31.849> I<00:02:32.060> have<00:02:32.269> for<00:02:32.510> as

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
that's all the ammo that I have for as

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.830 
that's all the ammo that I have for as
you<00:02:33.379> can<00:02:33.530> see<00:02:33.709> it's<00:02:34.010> good<00:02:34.730> again<00:02:35.090> taking<00:02:35.720> out

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
you can see it's good again taking out

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.199 
you can see it's good again taking out
small<00:02:36.349> hordes<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.769> people<00:02:36.829> it<00:02:37.730> doesn't<00:02:38.000> have

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
small hordes of people it doesn't have

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.030 
small hordes of people it doesn't have
that<00:02:38.360> much<00:02:38.480> ammo<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.140> that's<00:02:39.439> about<00:02:39.560> all<00:02:39.709> it's

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
that much ammo so that's about all it's

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.490 
that much ammo so that's about all it's
good<00:02:40.189> for<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:41.150> not<00:02:41.480> great<00:02:41.750> against<00:02:41.959> bosses

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
good for it's not great against bosses

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.940

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
but whatever it's cool it's good for

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.920 
but whatever it's cool it's good for
take<00:02:46.069> out<00:02:46.220> small<00:02:46.519> enemies<00:02:46.879> not<00:02:47.540> like<00:02:47.659> you<00:02:47.690> need

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
it for much so that is the regular

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.630 
it for much so that is the regular
Canadian<00:02:51.530> lesson<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:51.950> don't<00:02:52.159> like<00:02:52.190> this<00:02:52.430> one

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
Canadian lesson I don't like this one

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.580 
Canadian lesson I don't like this one
out<00:02:52.849> of<00:02:52.970> all<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.150> them<00:02:53.239> but<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.959> can't<00:02:54.230> hold<00:02:54.379> its

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
out of all of them but it can't hold its

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.369 
out of all of them but it can't hold its
own<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.370> let's<00:02:56.150> go<00:02:56.359> on<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.019> next<00:02:57.379> one<00:02:59.200> ok<00:03:00.200> on

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
own so let's go on to the next one ok on

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.410 
own so let's go on to the next one ok on
to<00:03:00.409> left<00:03:00.799> on<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.579> anti-tank<00:03:02.180> gun

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
to left on this is the anti-tank gun

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.899 
to left on this is the anti-tank gun
this<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.230> arguably<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:04.040> best<00:03:04.340> weapon<00:03:04.790> the

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
this is arguably the best weapon the

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.110 
this is arguably the best weapon the
game<00:03:05.060> because<00:03:05.390> there's<00:03:05.569> a<00:03:05.690> rank<00:03:05.840> FF<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:07.220> poor

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
game because there's a rank FF a poor

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.259 
game because there's a rank FF a poor
silly<00:03:08.569> it<00:03:08.959> has<00:03:09.349> low<00:03:09.650> ammo<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.519> it's<00:03:11.030> not

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
silly it has low ammo so it's not

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.379 
silly it has low ammo so it's not
decorating<00:03:11.989> clutch<00:03:12.260> situations<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.250> am<00:03:14.209> going

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
decorating clutch situations I am going

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.030 
decorating clutch situations I am going
to<00:03:14.480> fight<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.750> Scorpion<00:03:15.200> Boston<00:03:15.560> this<00:03:15.650> level

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
to fight the Scorpion Boston this level

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.059 
to fight the Scorpion Boston this level
and<00:03:16.329> gives<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.810> look<00:03:18.109> at<00:03:18.319> how<00:03:18.530> powerful<00:03:19.010> it

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
and gives you a look at how powerful it

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.479 
and gives you a look at how powerful it
is<00:03:19.099> in<00:03:19.810> how<00:03:20.810> useful<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.159> really<00:03:22.370> a

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
is in how useful it is this is really a

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.369 
is in how useful it is this is really a
weapon<00:03:22.819> that<00:03:22.849> comes<00:03:23.150> out<00:03:23.359> to<00:03:23.389> do<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.109> really

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
weapon that comes out to do you really

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:25.660 
weapon that comes out to do you really
want<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.620> lug<00:03:24.769> this<00:03:24.950> thing<00:03:25.010> around<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.549> whole

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
want to lug this thing around the whole

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.629 
want to lug this thing around the whole
entire<00:03:25.970> level<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.930> then<00:03:27.230> use<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.620> or<00:03:27.889> do

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
entire level and then use it or do

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.770 
entire level and then use it or do
that's<00:03:28.879> why<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.060> throw<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.359> away<00:03:29.450> they

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
that's why I throw it away they

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.690 
that's why I throw it away they
something<00:03:30.170> better<00:03:30.349> that<00:03:30.590> has<00:03:31.010> more<00:03:31.190> ammo<00:03:31.549> and

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
something better that has more ammo and

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.699 
something better that has more ammo and
could<00:03:31.879> come<00:03:32.090> in<00:03:32.209> more<00:03:32.389> handy<00:03:32.750> sorry<00:03:33.530> let's

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
could come in more handy sorry let's

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:57.490 
could come in more handy sorry let's
let's<00:03:33.859> take<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.010> look<00:03:34.250> at<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.760> end<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.030> think

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.190 

as<00:03:57.710> you<00:03:58.310> can<00:03:58.430> see<00:03:58.640> two<00:03:59.330> shots<00:03:59.600> took<00:03:59.870> off<00:04:00.050> about

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
as you can see two shots took off about

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.890 
as you can see two shots took off about
two-thirds<00:04:00.800> of<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.160> life<00:04:01.850> that's<00:04:02.540> about<00:04:02.870> all

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
two-thirds of the life that's about all

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.770 
two-thirds of the life that's about all
I<00:04:03.140> can<00:04:03.260> do<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:04.010> it's<00:04:04.520> okay<00:04:04.850> fighting<00:04:05.360> bosses

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
I can do and it's okay fighting bosses

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.430 
I can do and it's okay fighting bosses
but<00:04:06.080> i<00:04:06.440> really<00:04:07.250> suggest<00:04:07.900> just<00:04:08.900> picking<00:04:09.260> up<00:04:09.290> a

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
but i really suggest just picking up a

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.890 
but i really suggest just picking up a
different<00:04:09.740> weapon<00:04:09.860> like<00:04:10.070> a<00:04:10.100> shotgun<00:04:10.610> or<00:04:10.900> even

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
different weapon like a shotgun or even

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.830 
different weapon like a shotgun or even
a<00:04:11.990> magnum<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:13.300> that<00:04:14.300> would<00:04:14.450> do<00:04:14.630> better

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
a magnum and that would do better

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.940 
a magnum and that would do better
against<00:04:15.230> bosses

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.580 

way<00:04:20.490> to<00:04:20.550> kill<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.300> GUP<00:04:21.480> die<00:04:22.110> die<00:04:22.140> die<00:04:22.530> die

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
way to kill it the GUP die die die die

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.500 
way to kill it the GUP die die die die
die

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.710 

and<00:04:28.870> that's<00:04:29.380> it<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:30.160> yeah<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.610> anti<00:04:31.330> take<00:04:31.540> I

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
and that's it so yeah the anti take I

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.540 
and that's it so yeah the anti take I
know<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.200> did<00:04:32.380> take<00:04:32.650> off<00:04:32.860> two<00:04:33.070> thirds<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.460> the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
know it did take off two thirds of the

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.400 
know it did take off two thirds of the
life<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:34.330> kind<00:04:34.540> of<00:04:34.570> leaves<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:34.870> hang<00:04:35.050> if<00:04:35.290> you

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
life it kind of leaves you hang if you

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.180 
life it kind of leaves you hang if you
don't<00:04:35.590> have<00:04:35.740> an<00:04:35.890> ammo<00:04:36.130> from<00:04:36.220> any<00:04:36.430> other<00:04:36.550> guy<00:04:36.810> so

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
don't have an ammo from any other guy so

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.500 
don't have an ammo from any other guy so
we'll<00:04:39.190> see<00:04:39.340> how<00:04:39.370> fares<00:04:39.820> and<00:04:40.030> my<00:04:40.120> phone<00:04:40.330> don't

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
we'll see how fares and my phone don't

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.070 
we'll see how fares and my phone don't
you<00:04:42.810> okay<00:04:43.810> on<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:45.150> rocket<00:04:46.150> launches<00:04:46.600> which

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
you okay on to a rocket launches which

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.390 
you okay on to a rocket launches which
rocket<00:04:47.470> like<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.710> do<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.860> like<00:04:47.950> and<00:04:48.280> what's

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
rocket like to do I like and what's

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.280 
rocket like to do I like and what's
rocket<00:04:48.730> launches<00:04:49.000> do<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.210> not<00:04:49.360> like<00:04:49.540> well<00:04:50.260> I

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
rocket launches do I not like well I

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.140 
rocket launches do I not like well I
definitely<00:04:50.680> like<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:50.980> rocket<00:04:51.370> launcher<00:04:51.400> mrl

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
definitely like the rocket launcher mrl

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.600 
definitely like the rocket launcher mrl
it<00:04:52.450> is<00:04:53.110> such<00:04:53.470> a<00:04:53.500> great<00:04:53.710> rocket<00:04:54.130> launcher<00:04:54.400> like

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
it is such a great rocket launcher like

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.730 
it is such a great rocket launcher like
I<00:04:54.730> said<00:04:54.790> earlier<00:04:55.150> with<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.600> revolvers<00:04:56.260> with

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
I said earlier with the revolvers with

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.380 
I said earlier with the revolvers with
power<00:04:57.010> weapons<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.490> really<00:04:57.730> want<00:04:57.940> that<00:04:58.000> you

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
power weapons you really want that you

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.880 
power weapons you really want that you
want<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.720> chat<00:04:58.900> a<00:04:58.930> lot<00:04:59.140> of<00:04:59.260> power<00:04:59.440> but<00:04:59.620> you<00:04:59.710> want

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
want to chat a lot of power but you want

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.670 
want to chat a lot of power but you want
to<00:04:59.950> have<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.280> ability<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:01.290> reload<00:05:02.290> and<00:05:02.560> have<00:05:02.650> a

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
to have the ability to reload and have a

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.200 
to have the ability to reload and have a
phantom<00:05:03.190> oh<00:05:03.310> so<00:05:04.090> this<00:05:04.330> is<00:05:04.690> arguably<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.770> best

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
phantom oh so this is arguably the best

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.660 
phantom oh so this is arguably the best
rocket<00:05:07.210> launcher<00:05:07.480> the<00:05:07.720> rocket<00:05:08.410> launcher<00:05:09.100> the

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
rocket launcher the rocket launcher the

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.330 
rocket launcher the rocket launcher the
regular<00:05:10.000> rocket<00:05:10.360> launcher<00:05:10.660> it's<00:05:11.230> ok<00:05:11.590> it's

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
regular rocket launcher it's ok it's
