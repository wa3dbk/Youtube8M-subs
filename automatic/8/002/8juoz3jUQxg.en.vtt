00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.850
 meat of them as they are 6 to 2 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.380
 Celtic and this welcome good to a 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.059
 fast video nothing else is for 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.640
 correct them well we can invent 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.130
 give them the solution that worked for me 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.680
 as for the problem this one that is not 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.539
 they create the worlds at 0.9 point zero 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.699
 not in the wilds obviously coming 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.919
 Guided super there are already enough books there 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.489
 several people who already said that the 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.890
 that this I do not know that the mods 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.839
 disappear with texture well white 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.180
 new and in blue not as if it were the 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.090
 This sky that has no texture either 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.770
 water that after during this time I 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.050
 happened to me after a while 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.850
 gambling closes in minecraft and that 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.280
 in fact it did not happen to me as soon as I 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.930
 happened that I was closed and any 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.790
 the world that would have creative survival 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.950
 even lowering the graphics is 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.840
 closed after a while then in 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.300
 you are strange but good main 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.950
 problem that I had was this 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.160
 precisely the title of the video that is 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.680
 I created the world then good 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.839
 there are some who say that there are two good 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.510
 possible not the one I'm going to tell you about 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.910
 any try both then 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.780
 look what I have is one and historical 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.100
 nor with an android 4.1 and the living 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.490
 ok and the obviously the version that 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.840
 should have me is the 4.0 and up 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.340
 anyway anyway if you 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.690
 you do not know where those versions are or not 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.670
 you knew that this version had already come out 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.830
 and here below are the only ones for 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.990
 you see and download already the 4 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.580
 points forward or the 2.3 that you receive 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.340
 from 2.0 to 4 ok then good them 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.690
 I say what I did to start I do not know 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.640
 if you can do this in four 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.560
 points ahead assumes that this is the one 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.860
 I should have but since I am a piraton 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.170
 way I have not tried it for more 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.360
 I got tired of trying it in 4.3 have 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.840
 4.1 law then I said good I'm going to 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.640
 install the 4 the 2.3 and it works for me 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.350
 I find myself that I know that you will not be able to 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.270
 for incompatibility or something but if 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.490
 it works and well what is it that I did what 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.610
 what I did was leave this part 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.930
 and from here in view different for some 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.820
 exaggeration was in this part 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.590
 we none of these two the only 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.250
 what I did was move it from here to 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.010
 here to the end and remove it or something like that 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.230
 not factual and have no image of which 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.590
 is down here experimental that is 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.239
 to erase the control and that 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.130
 the boxes of inventing and 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.010
 all that so that it is the pure image what 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.810
 I had disable more and I had not activated 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.040
 so they would not see each other in everything 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.720
 only thing they have to do is disable 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.519
 button I think you under 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.760
 them what I guess they had to 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.950
 do 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.980
 deactivate all this and good to activate and 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.540
 this one leave it up to the top ok and after 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.790
 of having done that what they have to 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.390
 there is obviously there is another 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.000
 thing is here in this part says that it is 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.670
 the one that the bar of vision this one is 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.890
 disappears as if it were this nothing else 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.880
 I do not have facebook, you're strange but it's what 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.400
 what do they have to do ok 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.830
 I do not know if it works for you remember your 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.540
 Luis in 2.3 and as you can see then 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.180
 had created my world here I did it in 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.370
 creative and therefore the only thing that they have 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.549
 that what they have to be mind 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.409
 and say to this part new ok are you going to 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.500
 give in advanced to give you the 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.390
 infinity you can say here they put you 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.080
 in infinity and you will depend on Inca 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.840
 tivo in survival 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.450
 ok then good simple nothing else 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.190
 obviously in the infinities good there 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.750
 rumors that if you could with a core 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.420
 nothing more but good what the 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.010
 creators is that two cores and 500 megabytes 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.080
 up to travel the infinity 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.610
 they give in create world and good so that 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.320
 see that you are a lie if you 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.700
 that appears to you because you 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.080
 they probably stayed like 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.750
 here in half the bar no longer 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.380
 nothing progressed then good is that 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.690
 both upload the whole vision of creating if 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.760
 It did not work for them, lower the shot and give 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.200
 create ok and then good already being there already 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.360
 you very hard in you already being in the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.580
 map there's no problem with the bar that 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.350
 I do not know I do not really know if I filled the 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.120
 expulsion this try four too 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.680
 why not try it with the 4 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.900
 I tell you, I tell you how Indian I did it 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.430
 with 2.3 if it did not work for them 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.160
 neither of which neither of these 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.770
 methods I am offering you do not see 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.510
 maybe they just do not have the 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.220
 adequate requirements do not have the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.560
 requirements this one enough for 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.019
 be able to run this version and it 's so 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.670
 buggy has given that I do not know 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.920
 he just does not want to change his 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.630
 phone but remember these penalties a 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.960
 boite I tell you both 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:31.600
 and there is a village then the good 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.220
 it really looks very very good 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.320
 obviously it has quite the errors of 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.510
 which certainly does not decide to ask 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.040
 if you want to see those blondes or you 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.260
 he wants to stay alive of every thing I do not know 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.850
 of the portal to lens that of the villas that 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.710
 the new languages ​​that blah blah blah that 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.440
 without that I have to review them for 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.940
 put those videos do not know me if I wanted 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.260
 but I do not know if you wanted to see them 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.090
 I do not believe them in the channel either 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.790
 necessary because you are going to 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.310
 investigate the version I do not know now yes that 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.200
 possibly project them that the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.690
 guys to climb the stadiums is that I 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.940
 I could put it like this on this map 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.850
 do not be traces this or the coordinates 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.680
 no no no wahlberg modes no good 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.080
 so you tell me if you want 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.760
