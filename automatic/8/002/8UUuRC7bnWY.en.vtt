00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.220

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:13.950
 I 'll show you the suzuki 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:21.810
 gsx f750 this fantastic bike and came 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:23.189
 here to give you a deal on it the staff 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.230
 So in the afternoon I want to show it to you. 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.199
 you this tip today mainly 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.849
 Mechanical is a detail of the current 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.189
 chain and any big bike 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.920
 mainly motorcycle that has current 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.469
 with retainer or the ring with lots of people 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.899
 calls out there must always be 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.110
 cleans and lubricates properly 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.820
 exists in the market to produce 3 orion 90 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 with a manufacturer recommends in your 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.149
 user manual so what matters is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.860
 cleaning and greasing white grease is 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.660
 My opinion do not agree to use 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.680
 because it hardens and she arrives 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.300
 correct form 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.260
 So I have to have this here. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.799
 chain roller drive 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.659
 is running on li ning because to 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.030
 Oil when you talked about getting or 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.549
 spray and penetrate here in here 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.290
 grease or white grease 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.110
 any other type of grease and will 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.920
 published are at this point here is that O 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.150
 point between crown or opinion and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.460
 goalkeeper of the chain 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.979
 only in there will penetrate a lot of people 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.540
 is entering the land will crash and you will 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.829
 have premature wear of the chain and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.110
 pinion and crown 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.750
 so here in china a piece that people 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.159
 makes the chain clean is practically 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.210
 not 100 but subject to none 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.070
 chain that has already been cleaned 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.470
 with diesel oil a little bit 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.329
 degreasing a lot of water as far as 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.759
 diluted in a way that does not 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.850
 believes in a motorcycle score of the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.439
 The network side also isolated the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.680
 brakes also did not hit any kind of 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.170
 grease when the jet hit not for here 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.969
 the rear brake is bad I try to have 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.780
 detail then everything has to be done well 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.869
 done 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.380
 another detail I want to show you is the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.920
 champion boot this place also that much 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.180
 people washes current washing taxes 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.189
 anyway, even at home, and you do not take that tam 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.719
 even because it's such a bike you do not 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.459
 will have at home a cap has 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.989
 proper training 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.510
 but a detail that we opened did 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.159
 all the cleaning of the place to be able 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.200
 also check if there are any defects 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.090
 has a sensor inside the bike has the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.950
 possibility of clutching and has an 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.840
 also has to be well treated 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.299
 not only this place here but also the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.280
 cover is the tip of the 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.840
 lubrication is the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.920
 your chain and I even joke with 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.139
 store customers 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.879
 I do not want to stay running, just take care of the 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.500
 then take the bike to 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.409
 wear the chain pardon to see if she 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.359
 get out of the corner and that's it people come 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.620
 as auto parts place and you make the 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.620
 maintenance of your motorcycle
