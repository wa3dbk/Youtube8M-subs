00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 good to all kids new video no 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.259
 I usually do these videos, you know me 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.599
 but something very strange has happened like 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.460
 you know there are price ranges and all 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.929
 this school of extinct players and such 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.650
 but today suddenly I looked like 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.029
 I always have a template for 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 conceptual to look for players then 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.320
 who only want to look to see if they fall in 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.250
 prices and they lower the ranges to see if 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.410
 there are in the market because there are many 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.910
 different colors and such and today entered and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.470
 I have realized that there has been 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.820
 a boom or something because I tried 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.770
 do some players and follow 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.360
 having rank but there are people who are 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.550
 has booed or something has happened and has 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.140
 no longer appear the price range a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.510
 certain player for example to balls and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.350
 79 what is the shift look one the opposite 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.420
 to one million 999 thousand in comparison and it's 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.850
 a player because he was much less 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.800
 the price range that that price for 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.149
 example later in month and end 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.079
 right that is never one I have put it 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.960
 to 15 million that Messi is 2,800,000 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.059
 the maximum range this is xbox in play I know 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.979
 that is more or less to this but but in 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.080
 xbox that is where I am, is the range 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.170
 much less then it has happened 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.360
 for example Lent match monkey 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.100
 719,000 minimum and not good-looking compares already 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.510
 that is something that can not be done now 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.110
 with the price ranges do not put a 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.630
 purchase price and look what madness 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.190
 719,000 then for example we have to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.620
 diego alves that this week there was no 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.180
 come out and two have come out suddenly that 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.480
 look 638,000 bid 200 things 2 million 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 133 thousand or is a burrada people have 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.070
 there was a bus and the grams of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.450
 price and I do not know what to think about why I do 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.740
 this video for you to tell me 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.990
 your opinions on what you could 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.670
 happen and it's been a bug if they're going to plan 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.229
 remove the price ranges 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.030
 I want to see everything that you think and that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.970
 say it for the comments came the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 It's really very strange, as you see 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.610
 today have come new tournaments 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.800
 They have not started yet but there will be 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.990
 new tournaments here you have it for 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.910
 example online tournaments there will be one 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.160
 which is with players for example from the 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.619
 whitecaps and the anders and if you go 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.470
 to the market and you look for example 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.700
 players of this look at the mms 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.090
 let's find m ls 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.620
 of the whitecaps for example look at that 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.800
 there is a players for example how are you 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.420
 teibert to 17,500 compares since that does not 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.860
 is out of range or that player 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.720
 it's less to look at players who do not have 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.019
 compare how this player is this side 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.310
 left he killed 45,000 which is a 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.099
 player that has the much more range 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.190
 low or have you wondered that neither 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.110
 they have put kofi's rank or they are very 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.269
 Rare has had to have someone 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.690
 certain people who have discovered a 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.430
 bug or something to not put the rank ranges 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.599
 of price and I want you to tell me that all 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.400
 what you have in the comments the 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.959
 I'm really freaking out 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.329
 because this is a failure of a failure of 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.519
 security or something important to 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.140
 she already see to see what happens kids 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.209
 You already know that I do not usually do these 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.780
 videos but good this time I wanted 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.959
 do it because there is a lack of information 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.329
 and I want you to have commented everything 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.980
 what do you think and so I do not expect anything 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.510
 they have flown but you do not know 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.299
 that not only do these videos but this 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.130
 Once I think I've been there 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.319
 well do it to inform you also to 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.569
 all of these things that is weird we 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.840
 have passed a play but is that in xbox 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.150
 the crazy thing that is crazy 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.010
 now with the market and all these things 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.079
 and that nothing has molado them you know 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.280
 that you can leave a like to see if you 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.749
 these videos mini videos are cool 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.639
 informative sometimes when they pass the 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:34.689
 weird things and nothing more kids 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.689
