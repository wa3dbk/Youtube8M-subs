most important thing is speed control we
want<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.510> ability<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.020> accelerate

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
want to have the ability to accelerate

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.630 
want to have the ability to accelerate
and<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.490> brake<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.630> nice<00:00:21.930> calm<00:00:22.859> smooth

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
right and that's because the right side

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.770 
right and that's because the right side
of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.340> vehicle<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> little<00:01:45.180> further<00:01:45.390> away

from you than the left so invariably
what<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.180> usually<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.020> stare<00:01:49.590> down

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
what they usually do is they stare down

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.580 
what they usually do is they stare down
to<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> right<00:01:51.000> side<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:52.020> happens<00:01:52.409> when
