come<00:02:42.459> back<00:02:42.670> down<00:02:42.940> okay<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.900> those<00:02:43.959> are<00:02:44.110> your

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
come back down okay so those are your

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.630 
come back down okay so those are your
three<00:02:44.230> different<00:02:44.830> energy<00:02:45.130> phases<00:02:45.520> of

three different energy phases of
recovery<00:02:46.090> okay<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.390> got<00:02:46.600> your<00:02:46.780> your<00:02:47.200> power

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
recovery okay you got your your power

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.590 
recovery okay you got your your power
training<00:02:48.340> phase<00:02:48.610> right<00:02:48.880> which<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.450> going<00:02:49.540> to

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
training phase right which is going to

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.540 
training phase right which is going to
be<00:02:49.690> 1<00:02:49.930> 25<00:02:50.230> reps<00:02:50.590> with<00:02:51.310> about<00:02:52.920> 1<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.010> 5<00:02:54.130> reps<00:02:54.370> with

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
about four minutes of rest there you go

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.020 
about four minutes of rest there you go
there<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:56.830> guys<00:02:56.950> learning<00:02:57.250> right<00:02:57.489> oh<00:02:57.580> okay

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
there you guys learning right oh okay

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.490 
there you guys learning right oh okay
and<00:02:58.209> then<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:58.360> got<00:02:58.510> your<00:02:58.540> strength<00:02:58.989> it's<00:02:59.260> just

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
and then you got your strength it's just

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.470 
and then you got your strength it's just
going<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.650> be<00:02:59.739> 12<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.340> 15<00:03:00.670> repetitions<00:03:00.850> with

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
going to be 12 to 15 repetitions with

about 90 seconds or 60 to 90 seconds of
rest<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.870> then<00:03:05.140> have<00:03:05.380> your<00:03:05.470> endurance<00:03:05.920> phase

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
rest and then have your endurance phase

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.090 
rest and then have your endurance phase
which<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.300> going<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.570> be<00:03:07.660> your<00:03:08.200> 25<00:03:08.920> or<00:03:09.070> more

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100
