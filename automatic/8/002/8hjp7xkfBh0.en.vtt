00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
we do is we have one block like this we

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.140 
we do is we have one block like this we
put<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:26.780> two<00:03:27.780> bits<00:03:28.080> of<00:03:28.320> powered<00:03:28.770> rail<00:03:29.010> here<00:03:29.280> get

mine cart and chest that I found now all
we<00:04:21.510> have<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.720> hear<00:04:22.049> might<00:04:22.650> look<00:04:22.830> like<00:04:22.890> a<00:04:23.100> new

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
we have to hear might look like a new

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.820 
we have to hear might look like a new
block<00:04:23.669> might<00:04:24.510> be<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.960> little<00:04:25.110> bit<00:04:25.289> of<00:04:25.410> pattern

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
block might be a little bit of pattern

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.560 
block might be a little bit of pattern
but<00:04:26.580> all<00:04:26.729> is

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
but all is

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.510 
but all is
is<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:28.230> minecart<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.760> chest<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:31.490> inside<00:04:32.490> a

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
is a minecart in a chest and inside a

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.910 
is a minecart in a chest and inside a
block<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.960> basically<00:04:34.080> makes<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.770> look

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
block and it basically makes it look

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.180 
block and it basically makes it look
like<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.190> have<00:04:35.310> tails<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:36.300> you<00:04:36.390> can<00:04:36.690> have

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
like you have tails so you can have

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.130 
like you have tails so you can have
because<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:38.400> one<00:04:38.610> here<00:04:39.000> is<00:04:39.030> colored<00:04:39.600> this<00:04:39.960> is

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
because this one here is colored this is

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.760 
because this one here is colored this is
when<00:04:40.320> i<00:04:40.350> use<00:04:40.650> two<00:04:41.040> slabs<00:04:41.490> like<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.770> these

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
when i use two slabs like this and these

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.350 
when i use two slabs like this and these
blocks<00:04:44.100> here<00:04:44.400> see<00:04:44.760> as<00:04:44.880> you<00:04:44.970> can<00:04:45.120> see<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
blocks here see as you can see the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.440 
blocks here see as you can see the
difference<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:46.320> is<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:47.150> cut<00:04:48.150> remember<00:04:48.180> the

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
difference this is I cut remember the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.320 
difference this is I cut remember the
name<00:04:48.690> it's<00:04:49.290> just<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.680> sandstone<00:04:50.220> block<00:04:50.850> but

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
name it's just a sandstone block but

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.470 
name it's just a sandstone block but
this<00:04:51.450> one<00:04:51.600> here<00:04:51.840> are<00:04:51.960> two<00:04:52.140> slabs<00:04:52.440> put<00:04:52.740> together

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
this one here are two slabs put together

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.950 
this one here are two slabs put together
so<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:54.900> normal<00:04:55.620> block<00:04:56.040> will<00:04:56.280> make<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.580> dark<00:04:56.960> make

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
so a normal block will make it dark make

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.190 
so a normal block will make it dark make
it<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.290> lighting<00:04:58.710> faulty<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.540> two<00:05:00.540> sandstone

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
it the lighting faulty and two sandstone

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.160 
it the lighting faulty and two sandstone
slabs<00:05:01.440> together<00:05:02.040> will<00:05:02.490> make<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.790> light<00:05:03.170> now

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
slabs together will make it light now

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.690 
slabs together will make it light now
you<00:05:04.230> can<00:05:04.380> do<00:05:04.500> this<00:05:04.590> with<00:05:04.650> any<00:05:04.830> block<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.490> want

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
you can do this with any block you want

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.560 
you can do this with any block you want
make<00:05:06.180> any<00:05:06.840> tile<00:05:07.260> pattern<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.250> want<00:05:08.570> like

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
make any tile pattern you want like

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.600 
make any tile pattern you want like
right<00:05:09.960> here<00:05:10.260> i<00:05:10.290> just<00:05:10.440> use<00:05:10.800> some<00:05:11.040> other<00:05:11.130> blocks

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
right here i just use some other blocks

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.940 
right here i just use some other blocks
and<00:05:12.710> i<00:05:13.710> made<00:05:14.010> a<00:05:14.040> little<00:05:14.220> kind<00:05:14.520> of<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:14.820> square<00:05:15.390> pan

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
and i made a little kind of a square pan

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.400 
and i made a little kind of a square pan
now<00:05:16.950> also<00:05:17.280> we<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.390> have<00:05:18.510> a<00:05:18.540> single<00:05:18.870> one<00:05:19.170> here

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
now also we just have a single one here

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.270 
now also we just have a single one here
and<00:05:19.910> two<00:05:20.910> right<00:05:21.150> here<00:05:21.500> now<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:23.010> annoying

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
and two right here now the annoying

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.330 
and two right here now the annoying
thing<00:05:23.670> is<00:05:23.910> it's<00:05:24.240> you<00:05:25.080> can't<00:05:25.410> click<00:05:25.950> on<00:05:26.130> these

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
thing is it's you can't click on these

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.180 
thing is it's you can't click on these
to<00:05:28.580> open<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.670> chests<00:05:30.170> because<00:05:31.170> they<00:05:31.770> count<00:05:32.070> as

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
to open the chests because they count as

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.860 
to open the chests because they count as
a<00:05:32.280> block<00:05:32.580> basically<00:05:33.480> and<00:05:35.240> all<00:05:36.240> they<00:05:36.450> are<00:05:36.480> is

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
a block basically and all they are is

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.440 
a block basically and all they are is
for<00:05:37.140> decoration<00:05:37.710> so<00:05:38.070> it's<00:05:39.000> expensive

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
for decoration so it's expensive

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.070 
for decoration so it's expensive
decoration<00:05:40.260> but<00:05:40.620> if<00:05:40.860> you<00:05:41.160> have<00:05:41.370> all<00:05:41.670> the<00:05:42.080> stuff

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
decoration but if you have all the stuff

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.080 
decoration but if you have all the stuff
you<00:05:43.290> need<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.560> make<00:05:43.890> a<00:05:43.920> mine<00:05:44.190> cart<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.520> a<00:05:44.760> chest

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
you need to make a mine cart and a chest

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.770 
you need to make a mine cart and a chest
and<00:05:45.530> rails<00:05:46.530> to<00:05:46.860> put<00:05:47.010> them<00:05:47.130> inside<00:05:47.510> then<00:05:48.510> you

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
and rails to put them inside then you

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.400 
and rails to put them inside then you
can<00:05:48.900> do<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.140> and<00:05:49.350> make<00:05:49.770> your<00:05:50.010> house<00:05:50.430> look

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.360 
again how to do it all you need is a
block<00:06:12.330> here<00:06:12.530> put<00:06:13.530> your<00:06:13.560> choice<00:06:13.920> of<00:06:14.100> block

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
there get to powered rails a button or

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.410 
there get to powered rails a button or
you<00:06:20.340> could<00:06:20.490> use<00:06:20.520> a<00:06:20.640> torch<00:06:20.970> or<00:06:21.150> a<00:06:21.240> lever

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
you could use a torch or a lever

you could use a torch or a lever
anything<00:06:22.260> you<00:06:22.380> want<00:06:22.590> and<00:06:23.360> all<00:06:24.360> you<00:06:24.480> have<00:06:24.600> to<00:06:24.690> do

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
is place the minecart of a chest there

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.680 
is place the minecart of a chest there
put<00:06:29.070> up<00:06:29.160> another<00:06:29.220> block<00:06:29.580> head<00:06:29.970> just<00:06:30.330> so<00:06:30.540> the

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
put up another block head just so the

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.330 
put up another block head just so the
main<00:06:30.840> cup<00:06:31.050> of<00:06:31.140> chest<00:06:31.440> doesn't<00:06:31.620> go<00:06:31.830> for<00:06:32.040> it<00:06:32.190> too

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
main cup of chest doesn't go for it too

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.720 
main cup of chest doesn't go for it too
far<00:06:32.690> cut<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:33.840> one<00:06:34.160> you<00:06:35.160> can<00:06:35.220> destroy<00:06:35.520> that

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
far cut the one you can destroy that

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.730 
far cut the one you can destroy that
block<00:06:35.970> and<00:06:36.300> there<00:06:37.230> you<00:06:37.320> have<00:06:37.380> it<00:06:37.790> you<00:06:38.790> have<00:06:39.000> a

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
block and there you have it you have a

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.010 
block and there you have it you have a
chest

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
chest

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.610 
chest
and<00:06:41.139> a<00:06:41.229> block<00:06:41.470> which<00:06:42.280> can<00:06:42.610> be<00:06:42.729> useful<00:06:42.940> or<00:06:43.620> if

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
and a block which can be useful or if

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.730 
and a block which can be useful or if
you<00:06:44.800> don't<00:06:44.919> really<00:06:45.099> care<00:06:45.430> about<00:06:45.520> that<00:06:46.379> you<00:06:47.379> can

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
you don't really care about that you can

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.180 
you don't really care about that you can
cover<00:06:48.699> the<00:06:48.970> sides<00:06:49.270> so<00:06:49.659> we<00:06:50.440> render<00:06:50.800> the<00:06:50.919> chest

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
cover the sides so we render the chest

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.700 
cover the sides so we render the chest
useless<00:06:51.729> and<00:06:51.970> you<00:06:52.840> have<00:06:52.960> a<00:06:52.990> nice<00:06:53.169> little<00:06:53.319> tail

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
useless and you have a nice little tail

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.540 
useless and you have a nice little tail
so<00:06:54.699> you<00:06:54.759> can<00:06:54.879> use<00:06:55.030> on<00:06:55.180> any<00:06:55.330> block<00:06:55.629> you<00:06:55.810> want<00:06:56.550> for

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
so you can use on any block you want for

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.320 
so you can use on any block you want for
example<00:06:59.069> we<00:07:00.069> can<00:07:00.250> make<00:07:00.340> a<00:07:00.370> diamond<00:07:00.759> block

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
example we can make a diamond block

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.909 
example we can make a diamond block
right<00:07:01.599> here<00:07:02.280> put<00:07:03.280> their<00:07:03.490> there<00:07:04.710> put<00:07:05.710> that

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
right here put their there put that
