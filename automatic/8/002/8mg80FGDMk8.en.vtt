hey guys its stars are here on this is
absolute<00:00:11.880> three<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.480> chewing<00:00:12.960> through<00:00:14.089> this

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
absolute three of chewing through this

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.340 
absolute three of chewing through this
alone<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.750> off<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:17.180> machine<00:00:18.180> image<00:00:18.510> using<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
alone is off a machine image using the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.800 
alone is off a machine image using the
draft<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.770> keep<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.760> real<00:00:21.029> duplicator

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
draft you keep the real duplicator

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.920 
draft you keep the real duplicator
that's<00:00:22.140> not<00:00:22.439> bad<00:00:22.939> to<00:00:23.939> get<00:00:24.210> all<00:00:24.359> their<00:00:24.539> blocks

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that's not bad to get all their blocks

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.650 
that's not bad to get all their blocks
to<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.550> so<00:00:26.550> uh<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:27.359> was<00:00:28.050> messing<00:00:28.800> around<00:00:29.070> with

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
to this so uh I was messing around with

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.170 
to this so uh I was messing around with
the<00:00:31.880> real<00:00:32.880> computer<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:35.000> thought<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the real computer and then I thought of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.110 
the real computer and then I thought of
a<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.870> make<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.530> make<00:00:38.370> kissing<00:00:38.730> noises

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
a way to make it make kissing noises

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.500 
a way to make it make kissing noises
that's<00:00:39.960> why<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.230> Strand<00:00:40.680> lava<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.829> there's

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
that's why the Strand lava so there's

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.590 
that's why the Strand lava so there's
pros<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.539> cons<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.320> best<00:00:46.530> cruises<00:00:47.129> that

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
pros and cons the best cruises that

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.299 
pros and cons the best cruises that
makes<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.930> lot<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.350> noise<00:00:49.789> just<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
makes a lot of noise just like this I

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.819 
makes a lot of noise just like this I
with<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> piston<00:00:55.039> piston<00:00:56.039> armed<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:57.180> them

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
with the piston piston armed with them

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.830 
with the piston piston armed with them
throughout<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.219> real<00:00:59.690> fall<00:01:00.690> into<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> lava

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
throughout the real fall into the lava

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.130 
throughout the real fall into the lava
and<00:01:03.840> then<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:05.729> other<00:01:05.760> pro<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.960> that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and then the other pro is that

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.250 
and then the other pro is that
eventually<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.640> reels<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.360> make<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.020> person

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
eventually the reels we make the person

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.690 
eventually the reels we make the person
on<00:01:10.770> all<00:01:10.979> people<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> area<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:14.520> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you can make a team or worse like not

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.830 
you can make a team or worse like not

down you're giving them free real so far
i<00:01:29.430> found<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.140> super<00:01:31.140> make<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.590> our<00:01:31.770> own

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
i found that super make up our own

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.260 
i found that super make up our own
enigma<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.640> only<00:01:33.450> being<00:01:33.810> able<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.290> use<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> normal

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
enigma I only being able to use a normal

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.139 
enigma I only being able to use a normal
know<00:01:36.270> our<00:01:36.810> drill<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.770> normal<00:01:38.640> rules<00:01:38.700> will

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
know our drill the normal rules will

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.820 
know our drill the normal rules will
work<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.659> you're<00:01:39.780> gonna<00:01:40.340> redstone<00:01:41.340> gold<00:01:41.759> gold

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
work so you're gonna redstone gold gold
