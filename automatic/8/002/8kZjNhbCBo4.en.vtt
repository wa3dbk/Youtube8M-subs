 with you bridges and in this video I will talk about 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.189
 how to bind your blade server or 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.020
 speaking easier how to make it so that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.990
 your server could only be logged in with 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.000
 your and yesterday we will rely on 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.490

 Glue and on the server all the settings in 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.899
 principle, the situation has not changed 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.020
 however many users would not 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.629

 everything is pretty easy in principle 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.900
 the point is that we need to replace 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:40.470
 the forest is an important part of the site then you remain 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:46.800

 we are all with them pictures pretty 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.780
 it was simple and the trend was almost 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:25.650
