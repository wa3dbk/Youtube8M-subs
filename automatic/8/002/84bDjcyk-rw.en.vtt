located and we've really made some

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.450 
located and we've really made some
improvements<00:00:34.230> sort<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.500> under<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.920> hood<00:00:35.070> on

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
improvements sort of under the hood on

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
improvements sort of under the hood on
these<00:00:35.640> irons<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.719> really<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.550> used<00:00:39.530> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
these irons and we really have used the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.000 
these irons and we really have used the
AP<00:00:40.920> platform<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.910> showcase<00:00:42.870> our<00:00:43.290> technology

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
AP platform to showcase our technology

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
AP platform to showcase our technology
you<00:00:44.610> look<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> back<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.629> may<00:00:45.750> think

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
you look at the back and you may think

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.619 
you look at the back and you may think
oh<00:00:46.140> they<00:00:46.289> haven't<00:00:46.559> changed<00:00:46.710> much<00:00:47.010> at<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.280> but

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
oh they haven't changed much at all but

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.970 
oh they haven't changed much at all but
underneath<00:00:48.629> there<00:00:48.840> we've<00:00:48.989> changed<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.500> lot<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
underneath there we've changed a lot and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.950 
underneath there we've changed a lot and
we'll<00:00:50.610> begin<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.910> show<00:00:51.210> some<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.840> we

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
we'll begin to show some of that as we

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.410 
we'll begin to show some of that as we
get<00:00:52.110> closer<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> launch<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:54.180> stability

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
get closer to launch but the stability

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540 
get closer to launch but the stability
has<00:00:54.870> improved<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.920> does

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
has improved and really what that does

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.970 
has improved and really what that does
for<00:00:56.730> iron<00:00:56.910> play<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.449> players<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.559> looking<00:00:58.829> for

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
for iron play is players are looking for

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.700 
for iron play is players are looking for
distance<00:00:59.370> control<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.199> know<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
distance control so you know that the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.049 
distance control so you know that the
higher<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.100> moment<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> inertia<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> more

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
higher the moment of inertia the more

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.520 
higher the moment of inertia the more
the<00:01:03.180> forgiveness<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> more<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> stability

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the forgiveness the more the stability

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
the forgiveness the more the stability
the<00:01:04.559> better<00:01:04.860> distance<00:01:05.339> control<00:01:05.640> you're<00:01:05.880> going

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the better distance control you're going

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.130 
the better distance control you're going
to<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.450> hit<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.780> little<00:01:06.900> bit

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
to get if you hit it a little bit

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.050 
to get if you hit it a little bit
off-center<00:01:07.680> you're<00:01:08.189> typically<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> get

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
off-center you're typically going to get

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270 
off-center you're typically going to get
more<00:01:09.270> consistent<00:01:09.750> ball<00:01:10.140> speed<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> better

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
more consistent ball speed and better

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.660 
more consistent ball speed and better
distance<00:01:11.670> control<00:01:14.479> in<00:01:15.479> terms<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> two<00:01:16.200> new

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
distance control in terms of the two new

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.580 
distance control in terms of the two new
traditional<00:01:17.670> blade<00:01:17.850> iron<00:01:18.030> CB<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.630> MB<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
traditional blade iron CB and MB you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.660 
traditional blade iron CB and MB you
know<00:01:19.680> those<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:19.979> great<00:01:20.130> products<00:01:20.520> they're

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
know those are great products they're

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
know those are great products they're
actually<00:01:21.119> sort<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> number<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
actually sort of the number one and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.350 
actually sort of the number one and
number<00:01:22.770> two<00:01:22.860> models<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.549> play<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> PGA

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
number two models in play on the PGA

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.270 
number two models in play on the PGA
Tour<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.890> don't<00:01:25.979> want<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
Tour so you know what you don't want to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.190 
Tour so you know what you don't want to
radically<00:01:26.700> change<00:01:26.939> those<00:01:27.570> those<00:01:27.840> are<00:01:27.869> sort<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
radically change those those are sort of

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.870 
radically change those those are sort of
the<00:01:28.290> bread-and-butter<00:01:28.530> models<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.729> you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the bread-and-butter models out here you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.490 
the bread-and-butter models out here you
know<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> top<00:01:30.689> players<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> world<00:01:31.170> really

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
know the top players in the world really

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.499 
know the top players in the world really
like<00:01:31.740> those<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.670> try<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.210> evolve

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
like those so we try to kind of evolve

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.060 
like those so we try to kind of evolve
them<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.079> that's<00:01:34.200> what<00:01:34.320> we've<00:01:34.439> done<00:01:34.650> here

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
them and that's what we've done here

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.910 
them and that's what we've done here
we've<00:01:35.549> made<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:35.880> refinements<00:01:36.619> we<00:01:37.619> listen

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
we've made some refinements we listen

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.410 
we've made some refinements we listen
for<00:01:37.950> player<00:01:38.250> feedback<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.119> don't<00:01:39.270> we

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
for player feedback but we don't we

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
for player feedback but we don't we
don't<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.750> radically<00:01:40.110> change<00:01:40.140> owners

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
don't want to radically change owners

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.319

trailing edge on the sole and we've

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.979 
trailing edge on the sole and we've
narrowed<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.879> up<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.090> little<00:02:09.300> bit<00:02:09.420> relieved<00:02:09.780> it

narrowed it up a little bit relieved it

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.869 
narrowed it up a little bit relieved it
a<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.229> bit<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> back<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.670> just

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
a little bit in the back and that just

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.610 
a little bit in the back and that just

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
bit easier it's it's easier to use from

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.229 
bit easier it's it's easier to use from
a<00:02:22.049> variety<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.879> different<00:02:23.879> conditions

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
you have to balance those aspects and we

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.000 
you have to balance those aspects and we
try<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.540> do<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.959> we<00:02:40.170> try<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.349> make<00:02:40.470> our<00:02:40.709> iron's

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
try to do that we try to make our iron's

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.830 
try to do that we try to make our iron's
designs<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.730> all<00:02:41.909> Titleist<00:02:42.329> clubs<00:02:42.540> very

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
designs like all Titleist clubs very

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.710 
designs like all Titleist clubs very
well<00:02:43.079> balanced<00:02:43.470> they<00:02:44.280> perform<00:02:44.760> well<00:02:44.970> they

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
well balanced they perform well they

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.270 
well balanced they perform well they
have<00:02:45.870> great<00:02:46.079> technology<00:02:46.410> very<00:02:46.950> sophisticated

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
have great technology very sophisticated

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.339 
have great technology very sophisticated
weighting<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.569> when<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.780> put<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.019> down<00:02:49.170> into

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
weighting but when you put it down into

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.289 
weighting but when you put it down into
playing<00:02:49.590> position<00:02:50.129> it<00:02:50.609> looks<00:02:50.849> like<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> type<00:02:51.269> of

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
playing position it looks like a type of

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.880 
playing position it looks like a type of
golf<00:02:51.629> club<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:51.959> that's<00:02:52.109> certainly<00:02:52.410> important
