00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
around for a bit and immediately you hit

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.729 
around for a bit and immediately you hit
crouch<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.329> look<00:00:39.899> straight<00:00:40.079> down<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
crouch and look straight down to the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.470 
crouch and look straight down to the
ground<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.730> does<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.239> kind<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
ground what this does it kind of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.229 
ground what this does it kind of
animates<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.430> animation<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
animates the animation of what it is

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.970 
animates the animation of what it is
like<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.660> when<00:00:46.050> someone<00:00:46.230> jumps<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
like to when someone jumps out of a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.799 
like to when someone jumps out of a
Titan<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.820> usually<00:00:48.090> get<00:00:48.300> people<00:00:48.660> off

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
Titan so you usually get people off

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.240 
Titan so you usually get people off
guard<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.379> think<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.710> you're<00:00:49.829> jumping

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
guard and they think that you're jumping

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.500 
guard and they think that you're jumping
out<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.460> their<00:00:50.550> italian<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.000> they<00:00:51.030> jump<00:00:51.360> off

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
out of their italian so they jump off

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.910 
out of their italian so they jump off
and<00:00:51.660> try<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> pick<00:00:52.020> off<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.199> pilot<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.829> as
