abutments<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.710> these<00:01:13.979> anterior<00:01:14.610> premolars<00:01:15.479> so

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
abutments in these anterior premolars so

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.260 
abutments in these anterior premolars so
this<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.930> tooth<00:01:16.560> number<00:01:16.799> twenty-one<00:01:17.220> fti<00:01:17.729> 34

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
this is tooth number twenty-one fti 34

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.080 
this is tooth number twenty-one fti 34
to<00:01:19.020> 38<00:01:19.530> FDI<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.490> four<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:22.759> music<00:01:23.759> periapical

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.650 

and<00:01:27.740> this<00:01:28.190> is<00:01:28.340> actually<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:30.500> left<00:01:30.740> mandibular

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660

so<00:01:33.410> tooth<00:01:33.620> number<00:01:34.510> 21<00:01:35.510> let's<00:01:36.410> see<00:01:36.590> here<00:01:36.920> now

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
so tooth number 21 let's see here now

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.760 
so tooth number 21 let's see here now
this<00:01:38.000> is<00:01:38.150> that<00:01:38.270> period<00:01:38.570> for<00:01:38.630> Grady<00:01:38.870> graph<00:01:39.080> and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
this is that period for Grady graph and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.520 
this is that period for Grady graph and
you<00:01:39.890> can<00:01:39.920> see<00:01:40.270> it's<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.510> diagnosis<00:01:42.200> is<00:01:42.350> tooth

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
you can see it's the diagnosis is tooth

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.700 
you can see it's the diagnosis is tooth

asymptomatic<00:01:46.160> Aquarion<00:01:47.000> Titus<00:01:48.010> now<00:01:49.010> it's<00:01:49.160> not

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
asymptomatic Aquarion Titus now it's not

a canine

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.650 
a canine
it's<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.870> premolar<00:01:51.230> and<00:01:53.440> sure<00:01:54.440> enough<00:01:55.660> we're

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's a premolar and sure enough we're

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.630 
it's a premolar and sure enough we're
sort<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.080> like<00:01:57.320> well<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.890> canal<00:01:58.160> kind<00:01:58.520> of

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
sort of like well the canal kind of

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.300 
sort of like well the canal kind of
looks<00:01:58.790> like<00:01:58.940> it's<00:01:59.090> off<00:01:59.210> center<00:02:00.040> there<00:02:01.040> maybe

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
looks like it's off center there maybe

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.750 
looks like it's off center there maybe
and<00:02:02.300> maybe<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:03.320> second<00:02:04.070> canal<00:02:04.310> that's<00:02:04.490> causing

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
and maybe a second canal that's causing

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.669 
and maybe a second canal that's causing
this<00:02:05.680> radiolucent<00:02:06.680> lesion<00:02:08.500> just<00:02:09.500> take

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
this radiolucent lesion just take

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.940 
this radiolucent lesion just take
another<00:02:10.480> shift<00:02:11.480> shot<00:02:11.750> radiograph<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.680> sure

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
another shift shot radiograph and sure

a shift and that will tell you mounts of
information<00:02:43.010> more<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.760> than<00:02:44.030> just<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
straight on like okay yeah we're just

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.340 
straight on like okay yeah we're just
going<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.200> retreat<00:02:49.010> one<00:02:49.160> canal<00:02:49.459> good<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.820> go

however<00:02:51.350> as<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:51.680> can<00:02:51.830> see<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.050> was<00:02:54.200> for

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
however as you can see that that was for

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.560 
however as you can see that that was for
the<00:02:54.530> thought<00:02:54.890> process<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.790> previously

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
the thought process and the previously

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.570 
the thought process and the previously
previous<00:02:57.200> radiographs<00:02:57.650> are<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.040> same<00:02:58.280> and

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
previous radiographs are the same and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.640 
previous radiographs are the same and
until<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.420> was<00:02:59.510> in<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.690> resident<00:03:00.049> residency

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
until it was in the resident residency

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.580 
until it was in the resident residency
I'd<00:03:00.860> be<00:03:00.980> doing<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.430> exact<00:03:01.820> same<00:03:01.850> thing<00:03:02.590> taking

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
I'd be doing the exact same thing taking

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.850 
I'd be doing the exact same thing taking
this<00:03:03.680> straight<00:03:04.010> on<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:05.530> don't<00:03:06.530> worry<00:03:06.709> about

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
this straight on and don't worry about

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.340 
this straight on and don't worry about
the<00:03:06.980> shift<00:03:07.280> or<00:03:07.640> there'd<00:03:08.540> be<00:03:08.660> complaints<00:03:09.200> about

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
the shift or there'd be complaints about

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.250 
the shift or there'd be complaints about
taking<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.190> shift

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
taking the shift

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.729 
taking the shift
long<00:03:13.260> list<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.760> reasons<00:03:15.170> but<00:03:16.170> not<00:03:16.349> strong

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
long list of reasons but not strong

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.399 
long list of reasons but not strong
enough<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.220> not<00:03:17.430> take<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.700> ship<00:03:18.000> shot<00:03:18.299> so<00:03:19.230> just

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
enough to not take a ship shot so just

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.780 
enough to not take a ship shot so just
take<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.590> extra<00:03:19.980> second<00:03:20.459> because<00:03:20.580> now<00:03:20.930> when

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
take that extra second because now when

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.759 
take that extra second because now when
after<00:03:23.790> retreating<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.659> tooth<00:03:24.930> we're<00:03:25.620> able

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
after retreating this tooth we're able

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.069 
after retreating this tooth we're able
to<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.879> I'm<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.150> saying<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:27.420> I'm<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.659> hero<00:03:27.870> by

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
to and I'm not saying that I'm a hero by

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.479 
to and I'm not saying that I'm a hero by
any<00:03:28.230> stretch<00:03:28.379> of<00:03:28.500> imagination<00:03:28.590> be<00:03:29.190> able<00:03:29.370> to

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
any stretch of imagination be able to

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.300 
any stretch of imagination be able to
open<00:03:29.819> up<00:03:29.909> that<00:03:30.450> lingual<00:03:31.349> canal<00:03:31.500> which<00:03:32.159> this

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
open up that lingual canal which this

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.580 
open up that lingual canal which this
turned<00:03:32.579> out<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.790> be<00:03:32.879> a<00:03:32.909> lingo<00:03:33.120> canal<00:03:33.530> okay<00:03:34.530> so

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
turned out to be a lingo canal okay so

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.000 
turned out to be a lingo canal okay so
that's<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:35.159> fairly<00:03:35.849> basic<00:03:36.739> reminder<00:03:37.739> take<00:03:37.980> a

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
that's a fairly basic reminder take a

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.449 
that's a fairly basic reminder take a
shift

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459

the tooth is it restorable well that
definitely<00:05:09.930> decreases<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.889> predictability

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
definitely decreases the predictability

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.930 
definitely decreases the predictability

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
take a paper clip and place it in to see

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.529 
take a paper clip and place it in to see
the<00:05:29.009> canal<00:05:29.849> so<00:05:30.000> I'm<00:05:30.060> just<00:05:30.150> going<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.330> use<00:05:30.449> an

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
the canal so I'm just going to use an

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.300 
the canal so I'm just going to use an
old<00:05:32.509> anatomic<00:05:33.509> file<00:05:33.810> so<00:05:34.800> there's<00:05:34.979> a<00:05:35.070> straight

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
old anatomic file so there's a straight

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.950 
old anatomic file so there's a straight
on<00:05:35.460> you<00:05:35.699> can<00:05:35.849> see<00:05:35.969> it<00:05:36.090> looks<00:05:36.180> dead<00:05:36.539> on<00:05:36.659> center

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
on you can see it looks dead on center

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.370 
on you can see it looks dead on center
and<00:05:37.789> as<00:05:38.789> we<00:05:38.969> do<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.090> shift<00:05:39.389> shot<00:05:39.599> come<00:05:40.080> around

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
and as we do a shift shot come around

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.499 
and as we do a shift shot come around
you<00:05:41.099> can<00:05:41.280> see<00:05:41.460> that<00:05:41.639> we're<00:05:41.849> just<00:05:42.000> a<00:05:42.150> little<00:05:42.180> bit

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
you can see that we're just a little bit

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.020 
you can see that we're just a little bit
off<00:05:43.190> and<00:05:44.190> we'll<00:05:44.370> just<00:05:44.490> continue<00:05:44.639> all<00:05:44.909> the<00:05:44.969> way

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
off and we'll just continue all the way

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:51.640 
off and we'll just continue all the way
around<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.570> there<00:05:45.840> is<00:05:46.610> our<00:05:47.719> perforated<00:05:48.800> root

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
around and there is our perforated root

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.290 
around and there is our perforated root
so<00:05:52.650> again<00:05:52.830> just<00:05:53.039> reiterating<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.820> importance

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
so again just reiterating the importance

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.460 
so again just reiterating the importance
of<00:05:54.449> using<00:05:54.600> a<00:05:56.960> shift<00:05:57.960> shot<00:05:58.169> now<00:05:58.320> I'm<00:05:58.380> gonna

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
of using a shift shot now I'm gonna

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.060 
of using a shift shot now I'm gonna
switch<00:05:58.740> into<00:05:59.130> a<00:05:59.160> little<00:05:59.460> light<00:05:59.729> you<00:06:01.070> switch

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
switch into a little light you switch

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.670 
switch into a little light you switch
the<00:06:02.160> settings<00:06:02.580> on<00:06:02.639> my<00:06:02.669> camera<00:06:03.449> unless<00:06:04.320> you<00:06:04.500> can

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
the settings on my camera unless you can

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.960 
the settings on my camera unless you can
get<00:06:04.830> right<00:06:05.190> down<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.550> canal<00:06:07.699> well<00:06:08.699> there<00:06:08.820> you

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
get right down the canal well there you

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:15.930 
get right down the canal well there you
go<00:06:09.620> as<00:06:10.620> you<00:06:10.710> can<00:06:10.860> see<00:06:11.070> there<00:06:11.370> is

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.890 

that's<00:06:16.510> a<00:06:16.600> perforation<00:06:17.140> so<00:06:18.780> remember<00:06:19.780> that's

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
that's a perforation so remember that's

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.650 
that's a perforation so remember that's
coming<00:06:20.200> out<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:20.350> lingual<00:06:20.680> so<00:06:20.890> the<00:06:21.010> tooth<00:06:21.190> is

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
coming out the lingual so the tooth is

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.000 
coming out the lingual so the tooth is
actually<00:06:22.710> looking<00:06:23.710> at<00:06:23.890> it<00:06:24.010> like<00:06:24.130> this<00:06:25.860> that<00:06:26.860> is

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
actually looking at it like this that is

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:33.790 
actually looking at it like this that is
the<00:06:27.160> access

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.890 

and<00:06:34.099> this<00:06:34.400> is<00:06:34.550> where<00:06:34.699> the<00:06:34.789> canal<00:06:35.030> was

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.600 

okay<00:06:40.530> so<00:06:40.620> just<00:06:40.770> food<00:06:41.100> for<00:06:41.340> thought<00:06:41.700> Cheers
