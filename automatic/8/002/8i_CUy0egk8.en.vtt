00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.450
 Hello, my friends, look: today we'll talk from lime. Bath or lime 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.480
 the kitchen. 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.659
 Lime was included everywhere 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.499
 This gives us a lot of head cleaning pain. 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:15.999
 The system we use is the ecosystem 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.570
 Very cheap, 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.890
 It serves itself for a glass basin, which I will do 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.739
 Because I was more comfortable to do it on the screen. 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.949
 It can be used perfectly 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.350
 Tile, partition, shower, 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.180
 Faucets ... 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.240
 For any porosity of the surface 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.229
 It is not too late 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.030
 Sensitive, 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.740
 Normal 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.440
 Bathroom or kitchen. 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.160
 What we will do is this: we will take 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.900
 A little vinegar 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.720
 (Which we love 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.320
 Which gives you a win. Vinegar I'm using 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.960
 Red wine 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.520
 Because he 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.170
 from my point of view 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.620
 Best, 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.830
 But 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.430
 Do not need to be of high quality: one cheap served. This 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.560
 We heated them until they were about to boil 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.720
 Then put it in a bottle 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.670
 Existence 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.570
 spray. bottle 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
 We can use as spray. 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.770
 Very hot, because the trick is to use 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.510
 Well hot, we go to the bathroom. 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.410
 Here you see how I sink. You barely see through the glass: 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.530
 The imescale has no residue 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.810
 Soap .. Finally: I have been I do not know how many days 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.150
 So that the result can be clearly seen cleaned up. 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.860
 Place a little vinegar in the spray 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.540
 Let stand how long? For nothing: a few minutes or so. 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.040
 As you put the vinegar back to 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.219
 Toilet, through the screen 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.980
 Or anywhere else you go to clean enough. 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.589
 A few minutes ago 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.789
 Rest, 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.189
 Once something is fine 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.329
 With a wet cloth, well, well drained well 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.759
 We will rub. 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:27.809
 Rub good, but do not need much because the truth is that 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.419
 Hot vinegar starts 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.489
 Lime, everything starts. 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.469
 We explained a bit to remove most of the rest 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.309
 And then 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.929
 Dry cloth, Paper 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.719
 cooking 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.609
 Dry it. 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.719
 You see the brightness of this is very fast and disappears around the product. 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.049
 I preferred to do it in this aquarium which is glass 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.110
 They look good how to clean. 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.419
 If you realize 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.459
 I'm drying. In this case I have to do it inside and out. 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.209
 Look at the difference: this before, 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.579
 Before 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.339
 Cleaning. I've been a bit for a minute. 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.799
 Here are ready 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.089
 As I said ... Look what's left bright. 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.889
 I wanted to make that decision 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.789
 Because that is not so the reflections of the lights. 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.819
 You can use it in anything. 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.329
 I hope that you will be pleased, with you, and 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.779
 If you want to see these other clips are placed here and 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.929
 Please tell me as always 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.669
 As you do, 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.859
 If you have any tricks or cures and share them with friends. 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.489
 Come: I see you in the next video. Kiss.
