down<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.979> how<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> did<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.520> quickly<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
down on how I did it quickly with just a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
down on how I did it quickly with just a
few<00:01:30.360> buddies<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.829> ten<00:01:32.009> minutes<00:01:32.280> in

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
few buddies now the ten minutes in

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.920 
few buddies now the ten minutes in
helicopters<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.420> bit<00:01:33.540> confusing

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
helicopters is a little bit confusing

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080 
helicopters is a little bit confusing
because<00:01:34.310> transport<00:01:35.310> helicopters<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.939> not

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
because transport helicopters do not

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.710 
because transport helicopters do not
count

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
count

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.190 
count
I<00:01:36.780> repeat<00:01:37.200> transport<00:01:38.119> helicopters<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:40.020> not

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
I repeat transport helicopters do not

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800 
I repeat transport helicopters do not
count<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.369> assignment<00:01:41.880> spend<00:01:42.450> him<00:01:42.630> mitts

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
count for the assignment spend him mitts

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.710 
count for the assignment spend him mitts
and<00:01:43.250> helicopters<00:01:44.250> don't<00:01:45.060> ask<00:01:45.210> me<00:01:45.390> why<00:01:45.540> it's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and helicopters don't ask me why it's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.679 
and helicopters don't ask me why it's
just<00:01:45.899> another<00:01:46.170> bug<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:47.070> too<00:01:47.280> shocked<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.329> for

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
just another bug not too shocked so for

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.120 
just another bug not too shocked so for
some<00:01:48.780> reason<00:01:49.110> those<00:01:49.259> don't<00:01:49.500> count<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:50.040> if

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
some reason those don't count but if

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.440 
some reason those don't count but if
you're<00:01:50.280> inside<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.759> any<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> attack

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
helicopters or whatever else that counts

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.710 
helicopters or whatever else that counts

very hard to use I think it is it's got
a<00:04:30.900> lot<00:04:31.139> of<00:04:31.169> hype<00:04:31.410> all<00:04:31.620> these<00:04:31.770> people<00:04:32.040> are

a lot of hype all these people are

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.330 
a lot of hype all these people are
thinking<00:04:32.280> it's<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.820> AS<00:04:33.060> VAL<00:04:33.090> of<00:04:33.800> bf3<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.220> it's

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
thinking it's the AS VAL of bf3 and it's

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.980 
thinking it's the AS VAL of bf3 and it's
not<00:04:35.520> it's<00:04:35.820> very<00:04:35.880> very<00:04:36.270> hard<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.540> use<00:04:36.570> it<00:04:36.870> has

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
not it's very very hard to use it has

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.409 
not it's very very hard to use it has
almost<00:04:37.520> uncontrollable<00:04:38.520> recoil<00:04:38.730> it's<00:04:39.180> very

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
almost uncontrollable recoil it's very

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.300 
almost uncontrollable recoil it's very
very<00:04:39.660> hard<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:40.020> burst<00:04:40.260> this<00:04:40.500> thing<00:04:40.710> accurately

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
very hard to burst this thing accurately

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.070 
very hard to burst this thing accurately
I<00:04:41.520> do<00:04:42.090> find<00:04:42.389> myself<00:04:42.540> getting<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.930> lot<00:04:43.050> of

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
I do find myself getting a lot of

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.570 
I do find myself getting a lot of
headshots<00:04:43.290> though<00:04:43.650> because<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:44.040> has<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.220> lot<00:04:44.550> of

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
headshots though because it has a lot of

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.060 
headshots though because it has a lot of
vertical<00:04:44.820> recoil<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:46.050> hipfire<00:04:46.440> is<00:04:46.470> man<00:04:46.860> it's

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
vertical recoil the hipfire is man it's

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.760 
vertical recoil the hipfire is man it's
okay<00:04:47.340> but<00:04:48.120> it<00:04:48.210> does<00:04:48.389> come<00:04:48.630> built-in<00:04:49.440> with<00:04:49.650> the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
okay but it does come built-in with the

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.080 
okay but it does come built-in with the
suppressor<00:04:50.040> there<00:04:50.340> are<00:04:50.520> no<00:04:50.669> barrel

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
suppressor there are no barrel

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.550 
suppressor there are no barrel
modifications<00:04:51.840> for<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.169> can't<00:04:52.380> put<00:04:52.530> on

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
modifications for it you can't put on

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.620 
modifications for it you can't put on
anything<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.190> kind<00:04:53.639> of<00:04:53.760> balance<00:04:54.300> out<00:04:54.419> the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
anything to kind of balance out the

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.050 
anything to kind of balance out the
recoil<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.710> accuracy<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.490> stability<00:04:56.669> of<00:04:56.970> the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
recoil and accuracy and stability of the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.970 
recoil and accuracy and stability of the
weapon<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.450> just<00:04:57.600> can't<00:04:57.810> happen<00:04:58.020> on<00:04:58.350> top<00:04:58.860> of

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
weapon it just can't happen on top of

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.500 
weapon it just can't happen on top of
that<00:04:59.040> it<00:04:59.190> has<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.340> great<00:04:59.550> time<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.120> kill<00:05:00.300> it

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
that it has a great time to kill it

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.480 
that it has a great time to kill it
maybe<00:05:01.169> even<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.470> best<00:05:01.590> in<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.889> game<00:05:02.070> it's<00:05:02.370> got

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
maybe even the best in the game it's got

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.990 
maybe even the best in the game it's got
like<00:05:02.700> ridiculous<00:05:03.270> amounts<00:05:03.660> of<00:05:03.720> killing<00:05:04.470> power

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
like ridiculous amounts of killing power

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.330 
like ridiculous amounts of killing power
but<00:05:06.000> again<00:05:06.560> it's<00:05:07.560> very<00:05:07.770> very<00:05:07.979> hard<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:08.190> get

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
but again it's very very hard to get

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.770 
but again it's very very hard to get
multiple<00:05:08.729> kills<00:05:08.910> with<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.180> and<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.479> game<00:05:09.630> like

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
multiple kills with it and a game like

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.210 
multiple kills with it and a game like
this<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.169> knowing<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:10.380> it's<00:05:10.620> now<00:05:10.770> five<00:05:11.010> man

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
this and knowing that it's now five man

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.250 
this and knowing that it's now five man
squads<00:05:11.520> is<00:05:11.940> that<00:05:12.180> much<00:05:12.330> better<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.870> run<00:05:13.020> into

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
squads is that much better to run into

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.659 
squads is that much better to run into
two<00:05:13.380> or<00:05:13.470> three<00:05:13.620> people<00:05:13.770> at<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:13.979> time<00:05:14.190> this

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
two or three people at a time this

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.000 
two or three people at a time this
weapon<00:05:15.060> just<00:05:15.090> really<00:05:15.600> really<00:05:15.810> is<00:05:15.930> not<00:05:16.080> good<00:05:16.800> in

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
weapon just really really is not good in

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.400
