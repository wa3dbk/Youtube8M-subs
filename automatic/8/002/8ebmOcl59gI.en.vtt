 when the totally distinct parts in the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.700
 first part is the best that we

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.239
 what we did in the second part is 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.769
 not satisfied, we have to do more 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.889
 but it is better as such as we did in 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.889
