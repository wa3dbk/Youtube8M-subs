00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.959
 I have the photo here a shoulder 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.610
 see tripod from photon with the name a 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:15.230
 I have no idea why it all 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.140
 but it is good 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.260
 This tripod as you can see is with 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.939
 worn over the shoulder 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.930
 right as well as left is a role and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.189
 that's how it looks from the back 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.510
 since i have my dear the advantage 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.040
 that weight is ever relieved 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.410
 after what you put it on forever 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.580
 makes you can also bigger things 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.080
 do it as an example 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.479
 digital SLR with 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.790
 malfunction and these cameras have there 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:43.170
 usually very much the weight 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.089
 is distributed here once over the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.239
 over your shoulders and then over here 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.440
 I therefore also support this construction 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.930
 height can adjust 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.070
 I have to just then the thread 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.790
 solve it and then I can do it here 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.750
 within this radius this prop 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.280
 unfortunately I'm not one of the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.299
 That's why I have to be very thin people 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.840
 the thing so relatively the other way around 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.340
 so enter to the right height 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.710
 has determined then screwed that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 the whole system is just that solid 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.290
 Here his hand is in front then the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.300
 Ball head with the pad for the camera 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.250
 including the change burst the hab 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.290
 I already prepared so completely 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.790
 just like a quick change system like 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.870
 Knowing the tripods of the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.700
 classic goods were at the camera 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.990
 attached the tripod plate will be here 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.890
 Simply inserted above is one 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.260
 quick release what is unified and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.050
 So I can do that here as well 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.220
 position off while over this lever 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.540
 then I can solve the ballhead then can 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.560
 So I'm looking for my position like me 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.890
 I would like that too 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.330
 possibility to go down here right 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.310
 and I'll just say it like that 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.900
 it now becomes easy 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.520
 turned 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.430
 and there I can however the angle 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.860
 Fix about this screw I am 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.850
 first simply no flights screw 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.070
 because i do not want me here 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.840
 always the tripod that the axis itself 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.030
 if I adjust everything then so 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.200
 I would like to be able to set 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.850
 Just start that was it then 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.290
 advantage is just synonymous if I then 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.120
 I do not always have to hand my films 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.980
 on the camera I have that too 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.780
 because they are easy to handle by hand 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.920
 stabilize the system again 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.380
 Can not do something so necessarily 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.340
 is required but better the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.680
 if you have your hand free anyway 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.150
 has and can the other one has so here 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.830
 just lie at that belly angle 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.510
 and then just really wonderful here 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.250
 Smoothly easy to do my pans 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.540
 and my films turn and synonymous with the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.190
 the other hand logically the camera 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.130
 So everything is not a problem 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.420
 yes it somehow told everything now 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.420
 they can even get started with it in principle
