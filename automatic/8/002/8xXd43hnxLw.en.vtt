it<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.600> good<00:01:33.869> thing<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.259> pressure

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it the good thing about the pressure

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.130 
it the good thing about the pressure
cooker<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.490> fast<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.360> like

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
cooker is that it's really fast and like

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.600 
cooker is that it's really fast and like
fast<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:38.009> want<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> spend<00:01:38.340> my<00:01:38.430> days

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.670 
fast I don't want to spend my days
cooking<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.840> keeps<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> nutrients

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
cooking and it keeps all the nutrients

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.800 
cooking and it keeps all the nutrients
in<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.310> water<00:01:41.340> stays<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.180> cooks<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.600> really

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
in the water stays in it cooks it really

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.630 
in the water stays in it cooks it really
fast<00:01:42.960> nutri<00:01:43.619> stance<00:01:43.860> that's<00:01:44.130> why<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.340> sound

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
fast nutri stance that's why you sound

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.399 
fast nutri stance that's why you sound
so<00:01:45.630> basically<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.649> put<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.009> sweet<00:01:47.970> potatoes

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
so basically you put in sweet potatoes

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.260 
so basically you put in sweet potatoes
you<00:01:49.409> don't<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.799> fill<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.490> more<00:01:51.180> than

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you don't want to fill it I'm more than

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.080 
you don't want to fill it I'm more than
halfway

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
halfway

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
there's a lot it's a different pressure

nabis<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.350> can't<00:03:18.709> justify<00:03:19.100> anyway<00:03:19.640> if<00:03:19.700> you

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
nabis so I can't justify anyway if you

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.400 
nabis so I can't justify anyway if you
use<00:03:20.030> any<00:03:20.180> wonder<00:03:20.480> though<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:20.750> mean<00:03:21.110> do<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.260> two

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
use any wonder though I mean do you two

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.020 
use any wonder though I mean do you two
need<00:03:21.500> us<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:21.920> is<00:03:22.040> probably<00:03:22.250> about<00:03:22.520> that<00:03:22.820> you

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
need us this is probably about that you

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.229 
need us this is probably about that you
can<00:03:23.150> use<00:03:23.350> blenders<00:03:24.350> Bay<00:03:25.220> mixes<00:03:25.700> processors

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
can use blenders Bay mixes processors

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.670 
can use blenders Bay mixes processors
you<00:03:26.360> could<00:03:26.510> probably<00:03:26.720> eat<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:26.959> mash<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.350> by<00:03:27.440> hand

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
you could probably eat a mash it by hand

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.949 
you could probably eat a mash it by hand
so<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.760> don't<00:03:28.910> need<00:03:29.030> if<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.300> takes<00:03:29.660> longer

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
so you don't need if it takes longer

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.530 
so you don't need if it takes longer
Vitamix<00:03:30.650> or<00:03:30.830> that<00:03:30.980> but<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.850> love<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.180> that's

Vitamix or that but you love it that's

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.300 
Vitamix or that but you love it that's
why<00:03:32.660> we're<00:03:32.840> doing<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.110> over<00:03:33.260> here<00:03:33.560> right<00:03:33.800> yeah

why we're doing it over here right yeah
so<00:03:34.970> let's<00:03:35.870> turn<00:03:36.020> on<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.860> started

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.490 

fast<00:03:48.609> that's<00:03:48.909> what<00:03:49.060> hey<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.170> then<00:03:50.319> we're<00:03:50.409> going

to take this and just pour it into some

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.520 
to take this and just pour it into some
different<00:03:52.780> containers<00:03:53.079> we're<00:03:53.260> going<00:03:53.379> to<00:03:53.439> show

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
different containers we're going to show

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.509 
different containers we're going to show
you<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.680> different<00:03:53.890> options<00:03:54.159> for<00:03:54.219> container

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
you the different options for container

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.599 
you the different options for container
fixed<00:03:54.849> great<00:03:55.409> okay<00:03:56.409> so<00:03:56.829> we<00:03:57.250> have<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.400> couple

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
fixed great okay so we have a couple

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.920 
fixed great okay so we have a couple
different<00:03:57.790> kind<00:03:58.120> of<00:03:58.180> containers<00:03:58.569> I<00:03:58.689> mean<00:03:58.840> you

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
different kind of containers I mean you

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.690 
different kind of containers I mean you
can<00:03:59.049> use<00:03:59.200> also<00:03:59.409> as<00:03:59.709> these<00:03:59.950> are<00:04:00.129> just<00:04:00.219> actually

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
can use also as these are just actually

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.819 
can use also as these are just actually
freezer<00:04:01.150> jam<00:04:01.359> containers<00:04:01.840> right<00:04:02.019> so<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:02.560> figure

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
freezer jam containers right so I figure

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.580 
freezer jam containers right so I figure
you<00:04:03.129> can<00:04:03.250> use<00:04:03.489> these<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:04.180> you<00:04:05.170> know<00:04:05.260> take<00:04:05.530> a

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
you can use these and you know take a

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.839 
you can use these and you know take a
bit<00:04:05.799> out<00:04:05.950> put<00:04:06.219> it<00:04:06.250> in<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.579> bowl<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.090> use<00:04:07.239> it<00:04:08.849> no

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
bit out put it in a bowl and use it no
