that<00:00:26.039> everything<00:00:26.490> goes<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.970> obviously<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that everything goes and obviously the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.929 
that everything goes and obviously the
seminar<00:00:27.810> keeping<00:00:28.380> our<00:00:28.439> pain<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.939> just

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
seminar keeping our pain and just

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.550 
seminar keeping our pain and just
stopped<00:00:30.480> me<00:00:30.570> playing<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.050> thought<00:00:31.320> that's

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
stopped me playing I thought that's

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.350 
stopped me playing I thought that's
called<00:00:31.830> an<00:00:31.890> hour<00:00:32.099> how<00:00:32.550> did<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:33.120> around

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
called an hour how did you get around

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.360 
called an hour how did you get around
that<00:00:33.630> how<00:00:34.170> did<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> sort<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:35.040> one<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that how did you sort of get one of the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.979 
that how did you sort of get one of the
flatfoots<00:00:35.820> well<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.390> did<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> very<00:00:36.690> clear

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
flatfoots well they did a very clear

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.780 
flatfoots well they did a very clear
game<00:00:37.170> plan<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.040> stop<00:00:38.489> us<00:00:38.640> burn

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
game plan and that was to stop us burn

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.700 
game plan and that was to stop us burn
out<00:00:38.940> from<00:00:39.059> goal<00:00:39.180> kicks<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.660> playwright<00:00:40.530> high

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
out from goal kicks and playwright high

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.350 
out from goal kicks and playwright high
up<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> pitch<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.610> thought<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.059> struggled

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
up the pitch and I thought we struggled

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.580 
up the pitch and I thought we struggled
with<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.480> initially<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.140> then<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.379> think

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
with that initially but then I think

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.770 
with that initially but then I think
once<00:00:44.100> gap<00:00:44.340> start<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> open<00:00:44.850> up<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.629> game

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
once gap start to open up and the game

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.020 
once gap start to open up and the game
become<00:00:46.079> stretched<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.530> they<00:00:46.649> always<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:47.039> Weber

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
become stretched as they always do Weber

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.220 
become stretched as they always do Weber

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
off I didn't think it was personally I

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.099 
off I didn't think it was personally I
was<00:00:59.550> right<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.789> front<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.300> didn't<00:01:01.050> think

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
was right in front of it I didn't think

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.560 
was right in front of it I didn't think
was<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> tackle<00:01:01.829> Harry<00:01:02.010> needed<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> make<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:03.000> in

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
was a tackle Harry needed to make but in

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.759 
was a tackle Harry needed to make but in
saying<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> don't<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.379> he's<00:01:04.470> gone<00:01:04.619> into

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
saying that I don't think he's gone into

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.060 
saying that I don't think he's gone into
fatigue<00:01:05.360> he's<00:01:06.360> gone<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.900> Harry's<00:01:07.740> usual

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
fatigue he's gone in with Harry's usual

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.469 
fatigue he's gone in with Harry's usual
determination<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.000> don't<00:01:09.180> think<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.420> was

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
determination but I don't think it was

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.969 
determination but I don't think it was
malicious<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:09.990> any<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:10.260> after<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.530> red<00:01:10.770> card

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
malicious in any way after the red card

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
malicious in any way after the red card

my<00:01:16.170> initial<00:01:16.799> opinion<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.460> shall<00:01:17.640> give<00:01:17.820> it

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
my initial opinion that shall give it

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.550 
my initial opinion that shall give it
well<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> would<00:01:18.750> say<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> red

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
well I would say is if that's the red

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.020 
well I would say is if that's the red
card<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:19.950> Richard<00:01:20.250> done<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.610> opinion<00:01:20.820> has

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
card then Richard done in my opinion has

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.280 
card then Richard done in my opinion has
to<00:01:21.180> go<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.450> his<00:01:21.540> tackle<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.900> Ryan<00:01:22.080> Fraser

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
to go for his tackle on Ryan Fraser

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.530 
to go for his tackle on Ryan Fraser
which<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> lot

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
which was a lot

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.340 
which was a lot
that's<00:01:25.540> where<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.750> thought<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:25.990> referee<00:01:26.230> was

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
that's where I thought the referee was

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.500 
that's where I thought the referee was

you think we could have done better i
think<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.400> disappointing<00:02:45.299> thing<00:02:45.420> for<00:02:45.599> us<00:02:45.689> it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
think the disappointing thing for us it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.280 
think the disappointing thing for us it
was<00:02:45.930> right<00:02:46.319> off<00:02:46.439> our<00:02:46.769> time<00:02:48.140> probably<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> little

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
was right off our time probably a little

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.619 
was right off our time probably a little
bit<00:02:49.469> of<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:50.099> lack<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.700> concentration<00:02:51.090> at<00:02:51.510> that

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
bit of a lack of concentration at that

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.440 
bit of a lack of concentration at that
moment<00:02:51.780> discussed<00:02:52.230> us<00:02:52.489> talk<00:02:53.489> about<00:02:53.519> leaders

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
moment discussed us talk about leaders

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.729
