hope to god are included so this looks

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.210 
hope to god are included so this looks
like<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:07.110> charge<00:01:07.530> cable<00:01:08.330> for<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:10.439> actual<00:01:10.799> drone

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
like a charge cable for the actual drone

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.090 
like a charge cable for the actual drone
and<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.689> some<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> RC<00:01:13.500> helicopters

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and I know on some of the RC helicopters

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.940 
and I know on some of the RC helicopters
you<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:14.490> charge<00:01:15.030> off<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
you can actually charge off of the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.940 
you can actually charge off of the
battery<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.299> remote<00:01:18.710> doesn't<00:01:19.710> look<00:01:19.799> like

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
battery in the remote doesn't look like

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.170 
battery in the remote doesn't look like
that's<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> case<00:01:20.430> here<00:01:20.729> you'll<00:01:20.880> need<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.150> use

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that's the case here you'll need to use

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.960 
that's the case here you'll need to use
your<00:01:21.450> own<00:01:21.600> USB<00:01:22.380> charger<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.009> also<00:01:23.280> notice<00:01:23.790> an

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
your own USB charger I also notice an

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.539 
your own USB charger I also notice an
extra<00:01:24.750> propeller<00:01:25.229> many<00:01:25.710> extra<00:01:26.220> propellers

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
extra propeller many extra propellers

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.160 
extra propeller many extra propellers
three<00:01:27.270> four<00:01:27.720> five<00:01:28.110> extra<00:01:29.009> propellers<00:01:29.960> five<00:01:30.960> or

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
three four five extra propellers five or

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.810 
three four five extra propellers five or
four<00:01:31.320> four<00:01:31.829> would<00:01:31.979> make<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.340> sense<00:01:32.400> than

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
four four would make more sense than

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.600 
four four would make more sense than
four<00:01:33.630> extra<00:01:34.079> propellers<00:01:34.409> they're<00:01:34.799> tiny<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
four extra propellers they're tiny you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.510 
four extra propellers they're tiny you
can<00:01:35.790> probably<00:01:36.329> hardly<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.590> them<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.340> that's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
can probably hardly see them but that's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.899 
can probably hardly see them but that's
good<00:01:38.759> because<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.560> smash<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.280> thing<00:01:41.340> at

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
good because if you smash this thing at

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.330 
good because if you smash this thing at
least<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.780> couple<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> backups<00:01:43.950> as

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
least you have a couple of backups as

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.130 
least you have a couple of backups as
you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> fits<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> palm<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.110> my

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you can see it fits in the palm of my

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.440 
you can see it fits in the palm of my
hand<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.369> you're<00:01:47.460> obviously<00:01:47.520> gonna<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.390> able

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
hand so you're obviously gonna be able

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.270 
hand so you're obviously gonna be able
to<00:01:48.570> fly<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.170> indoors<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.740> gonna<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.130> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
to fly this indoors you're gonna have to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280 
to fly this indoors you're gonna have to
fly<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.549> indoors<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.930> doesn't<00:01:52.200> get

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
fly this indoors so that it doesn't get

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.399 
fly this indoors so that it doesn't get
completely<00:01:53.009> taken<00:01:53.700> away<00:01:53.820> by<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.960> wind

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
completely taken away by the wind

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.280 
completely taken away by the wind
it<00:01:55.680> does<00:01:55.860> feel<00:01:56.159> pretty<00:01:56.520> damn<00:01:57.149> solid<00:01:57.509> I'll<00:01:58.049> link

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it does feel pretty damn solid I'll link

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.510 
it does feel pretty damn solid I'll link
it<00:01:58.439> down<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> description<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.369> want

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520

something like that anyhow I'm gonna go
and<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.630> some<00:02:06.689> triple-a<00:02:07.560> batteries<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.610> this

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and get some triple-a batteries for this
