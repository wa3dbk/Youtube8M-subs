00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.830 
Laflamme comm in this clip I'm going to
show<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:07.799> how<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.160> draw<00:00:08.429> buildings<00:00:08.840> you'll

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
show you how to draw buildings you'll

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.180 
show you how to draw buildings you'll
need<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> sketch<00:00:10.500> book

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
need a sketch book

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.430 
need a sketch book
you'll<00:00:11.849> need<00:00:12.059> some<00:00:12.330> black<00:00:12.540> markers<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.259> draw

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
you'll need some black markers to draw

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.160 
you'll need some black markers to draw
with<00:00:13.880> when<00:00:14.880> drawing<00:00:15.120> buildings<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.900> want<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
with when drawing buildings you want to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.320 
with when drawing buildings you want to
think<00:00:16.379> about<00:00:16.500> perspective<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:18.029> I'm<00:00:18.119> just

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
think about perspective so I'm just

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.269 
think about perspective so I'm just
going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.570> put<00:00:18.810> two<00:00:19.050> little<00:00:19.289> dots<00:00:19.619> here<00:00:19.830> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
going to put two little dots here that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.439 
going to put two little dots here that
are<00:00:21.090> gonna<00:00:21.539> represent<00:00:21.810> my<00:00:22.289> vanishing<00:00:22.680> point

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
are gonna represent my vanishing point

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.570 
are gonna represent my vanishing point
then<00:00:24.449> I'm<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.779> start<00:00:25.140> off<00:00:25.289> drawing<00:00:26.220> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
then I'm going to start off drawing so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.480 
then I'm going to start off drawing so
all<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.970> lines<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.510> draw<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:29.429> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
all the lines that I draw are going to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.549 
all the lines that I draw are going to
go<00:00:29.910> directly<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.679> point

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
go directly to that point

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
go directly to that point
and<00:00:34.559> we're<00:00:34.710> gonna<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.130> draw<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.700> some<00:00:36.239> cubes

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
and we're gonna just draw in some cubes

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.590 
and we're gonna just draw in some cubes
and<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.520> these<00:00:38.700> two<00:00:38.969> lines<00:00:39.180> here

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and as you can see these two lines here

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.229 
and as you can see these two lines here
lead<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.230> point<00:00:40.620> these<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.520> lines<00:00:41.820> here

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
lead to this point these two lines here

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.540 
lead to this point these two lines here
are<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> lead<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.140> point<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.430> we're

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
are going to lead to this point so we're

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.330 
are going to lead to this point so we're
just<00:00:44.579> gonna<00:00:44.850> draw<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.719> series<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.379> cubes<00:00:46.950> in

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
just gonna draw in a series of cubes in

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.610 
just gonna draw in a series of cubes in
this<00:00:48.149> fashion<00:00:50.270> we<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.660> pretty<00:00:52.170> quickly

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
this fashion we can go pretty quickly

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.250 
this fashion we can go pretty quickly
and<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.430> remember<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.780> want<00:00:54.989> those

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and just remember that you want those

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.069 
and just remember that you want those
lines<00:00:55.610> to<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.090> vanishing<00:00:57.600> points<00:00:57.930> in

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
lines to go to the vanishing points in

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.770 
lines to go to the vanishing points in
order<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.949> 3d<00:00:59.760> effect<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
order to get a 3d effect on the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.910 
order to get a 3d effect on the
buildings<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:02.609> again<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.739> can

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
buildings and again this one here can

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.570 
buildings and again this one here can
come<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.600> once<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.130> series

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
come to here so once you have a series

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.820 
come to here so once you have a series
of<00:01:08.610> cubes<00:01:09.119> drawn<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.530> start

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
of cubes drawn in then you can start

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
of cubes drawn in then you can start
going<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.640> blocking<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:13.650> windows<00:01:14.330> or

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
going in and blocking in your windows or

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.399 
going in and blocking in your windows or
just<00:01:15.630> draw<00:01:15.930> straight<00:01:16.439> lines<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.280> again<00:01:18.409> try

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
just draw straight lines and again try

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.240 
just draw straight lines and again try
to<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:19.920> those<00:01:20.310> lines<00:01:21.590> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to think about those lines going to the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550 
to think about those lines going to the
vanishing<00:01:23.580> point<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.930> should<00:01:24.960> always<00:01:25.350> just

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
vanishing point you should always just

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.460 
vanishing point you should always just
do<00:01:26.189> some<00:01:26.580> vertical<00:01:27.000> lines<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.170> create

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
do some vertical lines here to create

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.770 
do some vertical lines here to create
some<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.770> quick<00:01:29.280> windows<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:32.060> again<00:01:33.060> just

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
some really quick windows and again just

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.390 
some really quick windows and again just
cubes<00:01:35.119> more<00:01:36.119> cubes<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
cubes more cubes and you just go in and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.740 
cubes more cubes and you just go in and
fill<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.030> all<00:01:39.299> your<00:01:39.329> buildings<00:01:41.030> just<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.210> so

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.210 

we'll<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.960> put<00:01:46.140> some<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> front

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
we'll just put some here in the front

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.910 
we'll just put some here in the front
you<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:48.299> draw<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.570> front<00:01:48.990> entrance<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you can draw the front entrance of the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.249 
you can draw the front entrance of the
building<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.790> well<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
building as well if you want to have the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.399 
building as well if you want to have the
door<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.460> tall<00:01:53.790> one<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.299> would<00:01:55.290> just

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
door and then this tall one I would just

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
door and then this tall one I would just
bring<00:01:55.619> some<00:01:55.890> vertical<00:01:56.219> lines<00:01:56.579> down<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.299> like

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
bring some vertical lines down just like

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.130 
bring some vertical lines down just like
this<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.939> we'll<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.689> couple<00:02:00.869> more

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
this and we'll just put in a couple more

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.500 
this and we'll just put in a couple more
windows

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.270 

and<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.260> have<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.500> little<00:02:05.830> series<00:02:06.250> of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
and you have a little series of

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.760 
and you have a little series of
buildings<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.990> has<00:02:08.170> been<00:02:08.350> Jacqueline

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
buildings this has been Jacqueline

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.330 
buildings this has been Jacqueline
