Brendan<00:02:31.129> Gaughan<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.930> kind<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:32.959> wonder<00:02:33.200> what

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
Brendan Gaughan I kind of wonder what

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.600 
Brendan Gaughan I kind of wonder what
Carl<00:02:33.590> Edwards<00:02:33.739> would<00:02:34.010> make<00:02:34.129> a<00:02:34.160> move<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:34.580> that

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
Carl Edwards would make a move like that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.539 
Carl Edwards would make a move like that
on<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.970> straightaway<00:02:35.830> animator<00:02:36.830> abrupt<00:02:37.370> move

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
on the straightaway animator abrupt move

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.100 
on the straightaway animator abrupt move
up<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.849> outside<00:02:38.239> lane<00:02:38.480> there<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:38.840> if<00:02:39.019> he

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
up to the outside lane there on if he

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.420 
up to the outside lane there on if he
thought<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.379> was<00:02:39.410> clear<00:02:39.739> now<00:02:40.160> sometimes

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
thought it was clear now sometimes

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.250 
thought it was clear now sometimes
you're<00:02:40.760> moving<00:02:41.120> over<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:41.599> to<00:02:41.660> get<00:02:41.810> against

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
you're moving over just to get against

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.190 
you're moving over just to get against
that<00:02:42.319> car<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:43.730> try<00:02:43.879> to<00:02:43.940> slow<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.900> car<00:02:44.959> down

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
that car to try to slow that car down

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.930 
that car to try to slow that car down
that<00:02:45.680> momentum<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.280> where<00:02:46.459> you<00:02:46.610> can<00:02:46.760> get<00:02:46.879> your

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
that momentum to where you can get your

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.199 
that momentum to where you can get your
line<00:02:47.269> moving<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.810> little<00:02:47.959> bit<00:02:48.079> quicker<00:02:48.470> and

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
line moving a little bit quicker and

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.180 
line moving a little bit quicker and
maybe<00:02:50.209> he<00:02:50.510> just<00:02:50.540> misjudged<00:02:50.989> that<00:02:51.410> has

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
maybe he just misjudged that has

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.039 
maybe he just misjudged that has
happened<00:02:52.640> before<00:02:52.790> but<00:02:53.599> that's<00:02:53.810> what<00:02:53.959> these

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
happened before but that's what these

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.380 
happened before but that's what these
guys<00:02:54.230> are<00:02:54.290> trying<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.769> do<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.129> just<00:02:55.310> side<00:02:55.970> draft

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
guys are trying to do is just side draft

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.500 
guys are trying to do is just side draft
and<00:02:56.920> slow<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.160> car<00:02:58.190> beside<00:02:58.910> them<00:02:59.090> down<00:02:59.269> to

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
and slow that car beside them down to

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.869 
and slow that car beside them down to
where<00:02:59.690> their<00:02:59.900> line<00:03:00.140> will<00:03:00.290> move<00:03:00.319> quicker<00:03:00.879> Greg

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
where their line will move quicker Greg

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.940 
where their line will move quicker Greg
Biffle<00:03:02.269> also<00:03:02.690> involved<00:03:03.170> let's<00:03:03.319> go<00:03:03.440> on<00:03:03.590> board

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
Biffle also involved let's go on board

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.849 
Biffle also involved let's go on board
this<00:03:04.579> is<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.879> view<00:03:05.060> from<00:03:05.090> jr.<00:03:05.650> that's<00:03:06.650> where

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
this is the view from jr. that's where

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.500 
this is the view from jr. that's where
he<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.129> got<00:03:07.310> turned<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:08.000> when<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.269> get<00:03:08.359> into

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
he just got turned it when you get into

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.819 
he just got turned it when you get into
the<00:03:08.629> right<00:03:08.810> rear<00:03:09.079> there's<00:03:09.349> nothing<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.680> can

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
the right rear there's nothing you can

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.559 
the right rear there's nothing you can
do<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.310> course<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.609> air<00:03:10.819> automatically

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
do and of course the air automatically

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.509 
do and of course the air automatically
gets<00:03:11.810> underneath<00:03:12.530> that<00:03:12.799> car<00:03:13.010> right<00:03:13.250> then

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
gets underneath that car right then

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.690 
gets underneath that car right then
let's<00:03:14.390> see<00:03:14.599> here

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
let's see here

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.980 
let's see here
see<00:03:17.360> Carl<00:03:17.629> moving<00:03:18.110> over

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
see Carl moving over

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.290 
see Carl moving over
I<00:03:20.050> think<00:03:20.890> he<00:03:20.980> just<00:03:21.010> his<00:03:21.370> intentions<00:03:21.940> were<00:03:22.060> just

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
I think he just his intentions were just

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.730 
I think he just his intentions were just
to<00:03:22.390> get<00:03:22.630> over<00:03:22.780> there<00:03:23.080> if<00:03:23.170> he<00:03:23.260> could<00:03:23.440> see<00:03:23.620> that

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
to get over there if he could see that

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.920 
to get over there if he could see that
outside<00:03:24.160> line<00:03:24.340> moving<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.820> little<00:03:24.970> bit<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.780> to

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
outside line moving a little bit just to

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.660 
outside line moving a little bit just to
slow<00:03:26.110> them<00:03:26.320> down<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.130> don't<00:03:27.280> know<00:03:27.400> if<00:03:27.460> Brad

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
slow them down and I don't know if Brad

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.580 
slow them down and I don't know if Brad
came<00:03:27.910> down<00:03:28.120> just<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.540> little<00:03:28.780> nothing<00:03:29.440> that

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
came down just a little nothing that

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.470 
came down just a little nothing that
Brad<00:03:29.800> was<00:03:29.830> doing<00:03:30.220> wrong<00:03:30.400> but<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.910> only<00:03:31.060> takes

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
Brad was doing wrong but it only takes

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.110 
Brad was doing wrong but it only takes
just<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.380> split<00:03:32.740> second<00:03:33.310> but<00:03:33.670> both<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:34.030> these

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
just a split second but both of these

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.690 
just a split second but both of these
drivers<00:03:34.540> moving<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.110> same<00:03:35.320> direction<00:03:35.700> and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
drivers moving in the same direction and

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:45.290 
drivers moving in the same direction and
that<00:03:36.730> creates<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.300> content

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.670 

so<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.420> work<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:46.810> takes<00:03:46.930> us<00:03:47.110> go<00:03:47.260> on<00:03:47.410> Lauren

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
so the work that takes us go on Lauren

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.210 
so the work that takes us go on Lauren
just<00:03:47.770> listen

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.940
