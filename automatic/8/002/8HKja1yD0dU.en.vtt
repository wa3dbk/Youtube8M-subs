 young what does my friends know 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.510
 comes to a new video on main 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.869
 channel 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.800
 Today there is a little information 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.990
 video or he asks video to you 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.400
 that will not be so long because 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.400
 I just have to know your opinion 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.370
 It may be about how you might want it 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.370
 I have often noticed that too or 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.530
 very often meanwhile minecraft in 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.400
 my livestream and I wanted you there 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.489
 Just ask how that looks because 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.129
 I have the second channel but that's the case 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.469
 a lot of work and I would like to work too 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.450
 my main channel is minecraft videos 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.640
 Bring it easy for me 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.110
 is easier and I wanted you there 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.420
 Just keep asking like that with you 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.369
 that always looks in the comments 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.350
 writes if you had something against that 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.509
 I hold on my main channel on now 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.539
 Clearly bring minecraft videos without 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.670
 question call of duty videos will always be 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.300
 continue to give if you can do all that 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.289
 I represent you at 1000 percent 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.950
 but I also need a bit 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.830
 variety 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.250
 that means the whole time only call 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.920
 of duty sometime yes I do not know how 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.030
 I should say that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.670
 I would like you too one can 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.319
 a little bit he continues to speak also 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.259
 bring a little minecraft because I do that 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.759
 now since I think three 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.039
 or four years playing and me too 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.380
 have a lot of fun and I do not 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.539
 necessarily want to separate a second channel 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.200
 to open for that because really really 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.759
 I work a lot and I want to 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.069
 Just ask you because I want you to 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.630
 want to share that you with 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.849
 decides what comes on my channel 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.810
 and of course I would be very 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.000
 to be happy about 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.940
 I'll tell you if it is now 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.690
 Okay now , okay, we are there 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.429
 please do not be angry but you are welcome 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.869
 minecraft videos sometimes on the channel 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.000
 but I will not bring them 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.290
 I look for minecraft 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.660
 do not interest 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.319
 I understand that completely 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.080
 I have nothing against it only time 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:26.120
 The thing about a canal is easier too 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.650
 fly like two channels and want to 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.350
 I like to think your opinion was known 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.220
 and what you think about it 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.170
 yes that was really a very short and 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.590
 crisp in the video small information 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.810
 Video 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.090
 Tomorrow will still be a new one 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.670
 I'll come and see 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.050
 maybe a new story with one 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.380
 call of duty gameplay in the background 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.270
 in it 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.900
 Let's just take a look , as I said 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.760
 I would be glad if you 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.310
 Write a comment below what you write 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.480
 I think about that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.750
 resonance weisweil 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.100
 if you bother then I have to 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.200
 I stop it on the second channel 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.510
 bring me my head as well 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.340
 said a lot of fun and yes 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.439
 I do not want to go on beating it 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.879
 The hot mush just writes me in 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.950
 the comments and I would say that 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.950
 have the skin first
