00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.500
 just a touch is going to be special in this 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.240
 video we come already with minecraft evolution 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.850
 it's worth 70 points and zero point 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.300
 in which 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.320
 I'm thinking of doing this in two 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.869
 parties because 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.880
 I'm looking at the changes here I see that 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.880
 the 0.7 zero point itself did not change anything 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.150
 but then this was the person of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.110
 Minecraft moment with more patches 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.030
 is worth from 0.7 points 0.1 point 2.3 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.510
 points 4.5 be ready 6 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.000
 where they changed the most was good 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 larger changes were the 0.7 point 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.840
 three is worth 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.410
 but we're going to 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.960
 we have 4 points and 2.0 which is what 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.420
 well I always say as you see we already have 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.020
 a new new oval background that is 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.830
 static as you see me I do not like 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.520
 because it is very ugly 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.860
 white is static, as you see 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.130
 static means that it's quiet I have 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.480
 a review of 0.7 points 0.8 and point 9 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.480
 in the channel but in a situation of 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.870
 same 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.610
 because that minecraft evolution here 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.530
 well we have not entered a world 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.390
 I wanted to enter a world 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.860
 I was wrong, but well, by the way, 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.770
 You see how everything changes here already 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.880
 simply to the new menu 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.460
 as you see 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.579
 - the moments that do not change anything here 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.880
 the chat is different from the version of 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.880
 now 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.640
 that puts wright tables and good their 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.140
 offspring 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.170
 and it's worth 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.170
 it already appeared below what made you not 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.340
 I could see nothing you were on a server 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.259
 then the menu changed 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.760
 now it's like we have it now more or 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:09.119
 less with some small change worth 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.979
 a small change that I liked was 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.160
 unmolded ning that as you see here there 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.910
 option to deactivate it and in which 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.910
 we have now there is no 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.150
 as you see blocks included new and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.019
 here it is 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.019
 the cubes 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.770
 ok this is these are these include doing 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.970
 7.0 points that were both cubes 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.770
 empty as with lava as with everything 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.300
 then spawn eggs of animals 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.300
 they are by the fund yes 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.280
 how 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.630
 there was up to 0.9 that the world does 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.630
 including animals but not 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.770
 Animal eggs as you know was included 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.380
 the fire each of us can teach 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.830
 because there was no lighter was included 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.830
 the cake 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.800
 this is the review I did of doing 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.430
 points 6 not me 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.790
 now he has a bug now it's a bug or the 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.790
 needle 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.960
 my name is bush and i'm incognito 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.000
 nothing is maintained 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.000
 well let's go to that age one thing 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.540
 However, I do have hits books 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.170
 well with other things the chickens now 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.870
 eggs are now every half hour 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.600
 he released an egg 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.100
 with equal 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.450
 If you include the real ones in this version, 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.450
 They were enabled for us 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.100
 we are going to go for good it has been 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.000
 this is 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.000
 as you see 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.250
 if you are invited I had a weird your 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.360
 time because I already gave it away but now 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.360
 they are no longer 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.090
 well they are still not after nothing 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.170
 change nothing else so in this version are 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.170
 simply about your changes 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.560
 and still looked for the torches but nothing was 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.560
 solved 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.270
 to changes of changes to make 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.960
 points 7.1 point 2 because neither 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.130
 they change so much 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:44.580
 The steel dot 7.1 logo screen 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.919
 It has a more modern appearance 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.370
 minecraft logo demolish I do not know what 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.270
 bar is talking 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.270
 and then 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.770
 I will try what I do not know if these if 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.770
 they are worth 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.260
 of pat good from him part this which 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.410
 you're too small controls 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.450
 to play for my bike that right now 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:14.880
 it's pretty good in size they're a bit 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:16.980
 small yes but I do well a little 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.840
 Sometimes the ideal is high but this is 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.030
 the size of the tablets was worth 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.030
 so this does not come 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.870
 the fire has bad animation 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.110
 these are books fixed but changes 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.620
 no logo home screen me 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.780
 fix the boox the second 7.2 have in 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.260
 tax for multiplayer that's over 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.070
 you could read the name of multiplayer 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.710
 list of players on a server 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.090
 and accused of editing on the screen 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.400
 selection of the world lets you put 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.400
 seeds is simply that 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.740
 and then the 0.7 point 3 I'm going to do 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.169
 a video is worth because I think it's 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.999
 pain 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.009
 make a video by simply speaking to 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.860
 0.7 point 3 because it is much bigger 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:13.639
 that makes the world 7.0 at least for 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:17.539
 the players of minecraft I am reading 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.260
 if it's worth no doubt, that is, the version without 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:22.380
 d doubt 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.780
 of minecraft 0.7 point 3 was very much 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.610
 better than point 0 then I hope that 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.020
 you liked this video I will continue with 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.310
 minecraft evolution now how to do 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.450
 point 7.3 is worth not with point 8 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.980
