 but is that whenever the world 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.080
 technologies have changed and this is the one of 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.730
 smartphones the number of apps and 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.910
 application 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.590
 good and santiago rossi was very 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.790
 little to the presentation of a 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.980
 video game you know that this is the 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.540
 moment of the video game of the week to 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.780
 what videogame and this is the program of 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.850
 world cup brasil-2014 fifa world cup that 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.060
 It's the game this week 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.060
 yes 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.030
 found is that it's a little game 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.239
 simpler than the fixed 5 5 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.490
 in fact right away look if I stay 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.400

 the marquis's brand 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.090
 The brand of your brand is easier to make 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:22.720
 goals and is player oriented more 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.530
 casual not so professional business 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.460
 Then there is a goal 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.880
 the video there 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:35.060

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.390
 first time the visit against Brazil 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.520

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.850
 the audience on the court all that is 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.890
 the environment that 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.760
 of the previous generation of play 3 no 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.950
 There is play 4 then

 if you're used to playing between 4 yes 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.970
 you saw it in 4 you will find that it is the 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.870
 logical minor is done to the maximum of the 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.209
 potentiality that gives you play 3 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.220
