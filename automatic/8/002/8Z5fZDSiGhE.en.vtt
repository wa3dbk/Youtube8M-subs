I<00:00:07.990> was<00:00:08.470> wondering<00:00:09.010> it<00:00:09.130> seems<00:00:09.160> Marvel<00:00:10.090> films

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
I was wondering it seems Marvel films

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.090 
I was wondering it seems Marvel films
have<00:00:10.630> started<00:00:11.050> becoming<00:00:11.380> more<00:00:11.710> and<00:00:11.950> more

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
have started becoming more and more

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.310 
have started becoming more and more
serious<00:00:12.460> and<00:00:12.850> less<00:00:13.330> goofy<00:00:13.810> like<00:00:13.960> some<00:00:14.200> of

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
serious and less goofy like some of

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.350 
serious and less goofy like some of
their<00:00:14.470> previous<00:00:14.710> films<00:00:15.310> do<00:00:15.910> you<00:00:15.970> think<00:00:16.240> this

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
their previous films do you think this

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.420 
their previous films do you think this
is<00:00:16.510> because<00:00:16.690> of<00:00:16.930> the<00:00:17.260> more<00:00:17.470> serious<00:00:17.980> tone<00:00:18.220> of

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
is because of the more serious tone of

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.730 
is because of the more serious tone of
DC<00:00:18.850> films<00:00:19.270> um<00:00:20.110> no<00:00:21.070> no<00:00:21.880> I<00:00:21.910> don't<00:00:22.690> I<00:00:22.869> think<00:00:23.050> first

anything<00:02:21.970> at<00:02:22.150> at<00:02:22.599> all<00:02:22.900> because<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.590> what's

anything at at all because of what's

anything at at all because of what's
been<00:02:24.069> going<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.700> think<00:02:24.880> if<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.030> watch

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
been going on and I think if you watch

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.610 
been going on and I think if you watch
the<00:02:25.480> Marvel<00:02:25.750> films<00:02:25.840> they're<00:02:26.080> all<00:02:26.200> very

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the Marvel films they're all very

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.229 
the Marvel films they're all very
consistent<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.250> their<00:02:27.400> tone<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.060> think

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
consistent in their tone and I think

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.339 
consistent in their tone and I think
that's<00:02:28.360> good<00:02:28.569> because<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:28.959> working<00:02:29.140> for

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
that's good because it's working for

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.360 
that's good because it's working for
them<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.590> they<00:02:29.650> should<00:02:29.709> continue<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.280> way

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
them and they should continue that way

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.970 
them and they should continue that way
anyway<00:02:30.700> Amy<00:02:31.270> Rose<00:02:31.390> how<00:02:31.540> do<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.660> see<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.950> yeah<00:02:32.950> I

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
anyway Amy Rose how do you see it yeah I

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.550 
anyway Amy Rose how do you see it yeah I
mean<00:02:33.400> if<00:02:33.610> anything<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.540> opposite<00:02:35.170> like

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
mean if anything it's the opposite like

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.500 
mean if anything it's the opposite like
we're<00:02:35.830> waiting<00:02:35.980> for<00:02:36.130> DC<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.910> step<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.390> up

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
we're waiting for DC to step it up

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.170 
we're waiting for DC to step it up
because<00:02:38.069> Marvel<00:02:39.069> films<00:02:39.370> consistently<00:02:40.000> keep

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
because Marvel films consistently keep

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.030 
because Marvel films consistently keep
going<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.989> Dark<00:02:41.230> Knight<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.620> mean<00:02:41.800> I'll<00:02:41.920> go

then<00:03:10.690> Nolan<00:03:11.049> just<00:03:11.170> took<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.620> step<00:03:11.739> further

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
then Nolan just took it a step further

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.770 
then Nolan just took it a step further
like<00:03:12.489> he<00:03:12.610> does<00:03:12.760> with<00:03:12.790> most<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.269> his<00:03:13.390> films<00:03:13.540> but

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
like he does with most of his films but

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.229 
like he does with most of his films but
yeah<00:03:14.319> I<00:03:14.350> mean<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.830> just<00:03:14.860> think<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.580> in<00:03:15.850> terms

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
yeah I mean I just think that in terms

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.479 
yeah I mean I just think that in terms
of<00:03:16.450> what<00:03:16.630> Feige<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.049> Marvel<00:03:17.650> have<00:03:17.799> done<00:03:17.980> they

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
of what Feige and Marvel have done they

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.000 
of what Feige and Marvel have done they
just<00:03:18.519> have<00:03:18.850> very<00:03:19.090> different<00:03:19.359> tones<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:20.049> mean<00:03:20.230> DC

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
just have very different tones I mean DC

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.860 
just have very different tones I mean DC
has<00:03:21.280> felt<00:03:21.579> more<00:03:21.790> grounded<00:03:22.239> more<00:03:22.510> gritty

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
has felt more grounded more gritty

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.000 
has felt more grounded more gritty
that's<00:03:23.170> just<00:03:23.350> kind<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.620> what<00:03:23.769> they've<00:03:23.980> been

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
that's just kind of what they've been

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.520 
that's just kind of what they've been
doing<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.840> Marvel<00:03:25.840> has<00:03:25.930> been<00:03:26.079> kind<00:03:26.380> of

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
doing and Marvel has been kind of

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.920 
doing and Marvel has been kind of
adopting<00:03:27.250> more<00:03:27.459> humor<00:03:27.910> as<00:03:28.090> well<00:03:28.420> as<00:03:28.600> the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
adopting more humor as well as the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.599 
adopting more humor as well as the
grittiness<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.530> think<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.980> they<00:03:30.100> have<00:03:30.280> in

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
grittiness so I think that they have in

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.099 
grittiness so I think that they have in
all<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.000> their<00:03:31.299> films<00:03:31.570> they<00:03:31.690> have<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.870> very

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
all of their films they have a very

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.039 
all of their films they have a very
consistent<00:03:32.829> tone<00:03:33.280> going<00:03:33.700> on<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.209> some<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.750> the

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
consistent tone going on and some of the

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.050 
consistent tone going on and some of the
properties<00:03:35.650> are<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.890> little<00:03:36.250> darker<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.790> some

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
properties are a little darker and some

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.370 
properties are a little darker and some
of<00:03:37.180> them<00:03:37.299> would<00:03:37.420> be<00:03:37.570> shown<00:03:37.750> that<00:03:37.870> way<00:03:38.019> but<00:03:38.230> I

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
of them would be shown that way but I

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.319 
of them would be shown that way but I
mean<00:03:38.680> even<00:03:38.920> look<00:03:39.040> at<00:03:39.160> four<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:39.670> mean<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.180> could

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
mean even look at four I mean that could

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.000 
mean even look at four I mean that could
be<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.480> very<00:03:40.540> far-fetched<00:03:41.140> idea<00:03:41.530> but<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:41.799> still

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
be a very far-fetched idea but it still

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.640 
be a very far-fetched idea but it still
felt<00:03:42.310> grounded<00:03:43.060> in<00:03:43.209> some<00:03:43.480> aspect<00:03:44.079> of<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:44.470> I

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
felt grounded in some aspect of it so I

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.810 
felt grounded in some aspect of it so I
think<00:03:44.829> they<00:03:45.100> have<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.310> really<00:03:45.579> beautiful

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
think they have a really beautiful

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.300 
think they have a really beautiful
balance<00:03:46.450> going<00:03:46.630> on<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.079> I'm<00:03:47.470> excited<00:03:47.739> for<00:03:48.040> DC

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
balance going on and I'm excited for DC

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.650 
balance going on and I'm excited for DC
to<00:03:48.519> continue<00:03:49.060> because<00:03:49.180> now<00:03:49.359> it<00:03:49.450> looks<00:03:49.600> like

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
to continue because now it looks like

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.539 
to continue because now it looks like
they<00:03:49.870> do<00:03:49.930> have<00:03:50.200> groundwork<00:03:50.620> happening<00:03:50.980> but<00:03:51.130> no

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
they do have groundwork happening but no

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.699 
they do have groundwork happening but no
I<00:03:51.579> don't<00:03:51.970> think<00:03:52.030> Marvel<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:52.930> copying<00:03:53.320> DC<00:03:53.590> in

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
I don't think Marvel is copying DC in

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.380 
I don't think Marvel is copying DC in
any<00:03:53.859> way<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.549> marvels<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.060> really<00:03:55.269> good

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
any way the marvels and a really good

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.380 
any way the marvels and a really good
job<00:03:55.600> of<00:03:55.750> beating<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.440> their<00:03:56.590> own<00:03:56.769> drummer<00:03:57.459> path

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
job of beating to their own drummer path

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:06.000 
job of beating to their own drummer path

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
they've been doing though they've really

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.090 
they've been doing though they've really
been<00:04:14.810> able<00:04:14.960> to<00:04:15.320> stay<00:04:15.470> true<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.710> what<00:04:15.830> they

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
been able to stay true to what they

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.590 
been able to stay true to what they
wanted<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.489> do<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:16.910> they've<00:04:17.060> been<00:04:17.209> extremely

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
wanted to do and they've been extremely

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.390 
wanted to do and they've been extremely
consistent<00:04:18.020> everything<00:04:18.560> they've<00:04:18.739> done<00:04:18.830> is<00:04:19.160> so

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
consistent everything they've done is so

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.949 
consistent everything they've done is so
planned<00:04:19.700> out<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:20.090> far<00:04:20.239> in<00:04:20.360> advance<00:04:20.480> that<00:04:20.930> I

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
planned out so far in advance that I

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.240 
planned out so far in advance that I
don't<00:04:21.170> think<00:04:21.290> they're<00:04:21.380> taking<00:04:21.500> anyone<00:04:22.010> into

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
don't think they're taking anyone into

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.770 
don't think they're taking anyone into
consideration<00:04:22.880> other<00:04:23.270> than<00:04:23.570> their<00:04:23.750> own

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
consideration other than their own

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.210 
consideration other than their own
commitment<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.500> their<00:04:24.650> ideas<00:04:24.980> and<00:04:25.100> what

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
commitment to their ideas and what

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.010 
commitment to their ideas and what
they're<00:04:25.340> going<00:04:25.490> for<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:26.060> I<00:04:26.330> respect<00:04:26.660> that<00:04:26.720> and

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
they're going for and I respect that and

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.120 
they're going for and I respect that and
they've<00:04:27.110> kind<00:04:27.410> of<00:04:27.500> done<00:04:27.650> their<00:04:27.800> own<00:04:27.830> thing

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
they've kind of done their own thing

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.640 
they've kind of done their own thing
when<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.370> comes<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.880> directors<00:04:29.570> casting<00:04:30.230> ideas

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
when it comes to directors casting ideas

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.930 
when it comes to directors casting ideas
the<00:04:31.100> properties<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.580> they're<00:04:31.820> now

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
the properties that they're now

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.460 
the properties that they're now
introducing<00:04:32.690> into<00:04:32.840> Phase<00:04:33.020> three<00:04:33.050> we're

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
introducing into Phase three we're

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.900 
introducing into Phase three we're
getting<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.710> little<00:04:33.860> bit<00:04:34.040> weird<00:04:34.220> here<00:04:34.520> but<00:04:34.880> I

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
getting a little bit weird here but I

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.340 
getting a little bit weird here but I
appreciate<00:04:35.420> that<00:04:35.450> because<00:04:35.840> they<00:04:35.960> are<00:04:36.080> very

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
appreciate that because they are very

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.110 
appreciate that because they are very
committed<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.800> their<00:04:37.400> vision<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:37.970> I<00:04:38.060> don't

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
committed to their vision and I don't

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.550 
committed to their vision and I don't
think<00:04:38.300> it's<00:04:38.540> influenced<00:04:38.960> by<00:04:39.050> DC<00:04:39.380> or<00:04:39.470> what

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
think it's influenced by DC or what

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.290 
think it's influenced by DC or what
anyone<00:04:39.770> else<00:04:39.920> is<00:04:40.100> doing<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.820> I<00:04:40.910> think<00:04:40.970> people

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
anyone else is doing and I think people

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.800 
anyone else is doing and I think people
miss<00:04:41.570> this<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:43.100> DC<00:04:43.520> comic<00:04:44.360> book<00:04:44.480> films

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
miss this that the DC comic book films

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
playing right now and I'm not surprised

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.000 
playing right now and I'm not surprised
but<00:05:29.090> Avengers<00:05:29.840> was<00:05:30.050> more<00:05:30.230> entertaining<00:05:30.800> I

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
but Avengers was more entertaining I

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.620 
but Avengers was more entertaining I
think<00:05:31.220> you<00:05:31.310> nailed<00:05:31.490> it<00:05:31.700> and<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.270> Dark<00:05:32.480> Knight

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
think you nailed it and the Dark Knight

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.810 
think you nailed it and the Dark Knight
was<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:33.050> better<00:05:33.200> film<00:05:33.500> so<00:05:33.890> I<00:05:33.920> just<00:05:34.460> think<00:05:34.670> that

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
was the better film so I just think that

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.700 
was the better film so I just think that
I<00:05:34.970> think<00:05:35.510> Avengers<00:05:35.900> was<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.080> better<00:05:36.290> game<00:05:38.710> but

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
I think Avengers was a better game but

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.500 
I think Avengers was a better game but
you<00:05:40.070> know<00:05:40.100> Avengers<00:05:41.000> was<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.180> bit<00:05:41.330> more

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510
