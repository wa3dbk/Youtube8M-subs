00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.629
 but come criterion we go high rousseff to the kitchen of this magnificent 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.800
 restaurant 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.870
 after this is the madness that is to say every Sunday 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.719

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.809
 gutierrez quartet 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.869
 I think that in about half an hour we've been up until now 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.829
 Collado work to the can 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:19.659
 my idea is done 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.900
 for coming to visit them, neither is it an honor for me 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.480
 let's talk with you giÃºdici feel the movement and criteria well 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.659
 people started to throw and place and the letter of the moment drew attention 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.430
 both the sets and their prices 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.880
 but already in the kitchen we prepared for presence on the set that 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.490

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.330
 do you think that there are people there 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
 come to eat criterion has become an aspiration 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.930
 that's why I think there are newark criteria 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.280
 the market types followed up to the market 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.460
 civilian assets 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.540
 two that come 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.900
 paco mediar 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.660
 after your problems and your topics here 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.729

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.060
 her office or come to eat is with her friends or her friends 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.760
 the department agent 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.760
 Cardenas 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.740
 who is missing 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.920
 I see it as an interesting question from our state 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.020
 I did not speak 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.070
 something for the cotta reds something good the outside 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.850
 for the seconds 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.960
 I believe that all business that according to 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.690
 clearly there is time 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.690
 in the markets 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.800
 thank you change 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.270
 one can not stagnate 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.230
 and those parts 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.140
 we try to do 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.710
 the pilots is to try to be 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.300
 in the vanguard to disgust 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.300
 this time they come out 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.380
 and at the moment we are in mourning I think it is time 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.900
 to throw in the towel 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.489
 trying to 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.919
 conscious art 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.009
 is to give them 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.219

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.219

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.319
 Mark left them to continue leading the kitchen 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.049

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:10.829

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.260
 it will be an act of courtesy marc davis the amounts of intelligent humor 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.349
