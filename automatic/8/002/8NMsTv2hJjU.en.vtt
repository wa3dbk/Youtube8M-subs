00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
green saw fading up into the flue here

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.110 
green saw fading up into the flue here
towards<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> top<00:00:31.769> with<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> sort<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.730> strip<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
towards the top with a sort of strip to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.430 
towards the top with a sort of strip to
the<00:00:33.239> different<00:00:33.510> color<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the different color I really like that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.280 
the different color I really like that
you've<00:00:35.040> also<00:00:35.190> got<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.360> front<00:00:36.780> decals

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you've also got that on the front decals

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.979 
you've also got that on the front decals
and<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> back<00:00:38.520> decals<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.629> another

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and the back decals there and another

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.479 
and the back decals there and another
little<00:00:40.260> feature<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
little feature that I really like is the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369 
little feature that I really like is the
toe<00:00:41.760> guard<00:00:42.059> you've<00:00:42.719> got<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> Schlessinger

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
toe guard you've got the Schlessinger

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.350 
toe guard you've got the Schlessinger
branded<00:00:43.829> blue<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> green<00:00:44.520> toe<00:00:44.789> guard<00:00:45.120> there

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
branded blue and green toe guard there

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.819 
branded blue and green toe guard there
so<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> think<00:00:46.020> that's<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.530> nice

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so I think that's just a really nice

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.260 
so I think that's just a really nice
little<00:00:47.070> extra<00:00:47.460> touch<00:00:47.670> especially<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
little extra touch especially for a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.180 
little extra touch especially for a
junior<00:00:48.480> cricketer<00:00:49.050> often<00:00:49.800> you're<00:00:49.920> having<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
junior cricketer often you're having to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.790 
junior cricketer often you're having to
play<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> wetter<00:00:50.789> pitch<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.260> think<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.649> toe

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
play on a wetter pitch so I think a toe

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.200 
play on a wetter pitch so I think a toe
guard<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> certainly<00:00:53.460> more<00:00:53.640> important<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
guard is certainly more important for a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.529 
guard is certainly more important for a
junior<00:00:54.449> cricketer<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:56.520> about<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> bat<00:00:57.000> itself

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
junior cricketer so about the bat itself

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.959 
junior cricketer so about the bat itself
this<00:00:57.960> bat<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.260> endorsed<00:00:58.710> by<00:00:58.770> Owen<00:00:59.160> Morgan<00:00:59.579> so

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
this bat is endorsed by Owen Morgan so

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.689 
this bat is endorsed by Owen Morgan so
gives<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.239> some<00:01:00.690> idea<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.520> style<00:01:02.520> of

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
gives you some idea of the style of

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.179 
gives you some idea of the style of
batsman<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> suited<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.040> got

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
batsman that is suited for and it's got

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.190 
batsman that is suited for and it's got
a<00:01:05.220> quite<00:01:05.729> high<00:01:05.970> middle<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> would<00:01:07.049> be

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
a quite high middle so it would be

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.440 
a quite high middle so it would be
perfect<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.860> batsman<00:01:08.220> who<00:01:08.520> plays<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.330> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
perfect for a batsman who plays like to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.179 
perfect for a batsman who plays like to
play<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> back<00:01:09.960> foot<00:01:10.200> quite<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> lot<00:01:10.619> it's

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
play on the back foot quite a lot it's

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the reverse sweep the street and this

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.569 
the reverse sweep the street and this
would<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.350> very<00:01:31.920> much<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> Oh<00:01:32.310> Morgan

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
would be very much in the Oh Morgan

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
would be very much in the Oh Morgan
mould<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.420> would<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.659> ideal<00:01:33.750> bath<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
mould this would be ideal bath for you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230 
mould this would be ideal bath for you
so<00:01:34.920> I'll<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.189> show<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.490> quick<00:01:35.610> tour<00:01:35.880> shape

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
so I'll just show you a quick tour shape

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.359 
so I'll just show you a quick tour shape
of<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.290> y'all<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.740> quite<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> hard

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
of that so y'all get it quite a hard

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.200 
of that so y'all get it quite a hard
middle<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.850> that's<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.759> friendly<00:01:42.000> hard

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
middle so that's a it's a friendly hard

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.840 
middle so that's a it's a friendly hard
middle<00:01:42.420> again<00:01:42.979> con<00:01:43.979> caving<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> real

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
middle again con caving is a real

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.670 
middle again con caving is a real
feature<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> really

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
feature of this but you do have a really

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.109 
feature of this but you do have a really
high<00:01:46.829> spot<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.520> your<00:01:47.670> shot<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
high spot to get your shot in that a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
high spot to get your shot in that a
minute<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.840> see<00:01:49.079> they're<00:01:49.290> massively

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
minute you can see they're massively

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.889 
minute you can see they're massively
high<00:01:50.340> spy<00:01:50.579> especially<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.030> harrowed<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.630> a

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
high spy especially for harrowed but a

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.499 
high spy especially for harrowed but a
lot<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.860> concave<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.399> there<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
lot of concave in there so go on to the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.999 
lot of concave in there so go on to the
sweet<00:01:55.020> hop<00:01:55.200> maybe<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.590> bit<00:01:55.740> thinner

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
sweet hop maybe a little bit thinner

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
sweet hop maybe a little bit thinner
than<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.310> other<00:01:56.460> bats<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.240> are<00:01:57.329> getting<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
than on other bats but you are getting a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.060 
than on other bats but you are getting a
hell<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.990> lot<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.200> woods<00:01:58.590> coming<00:01:58.950> from

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
hell of a lot of woods coming from

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.969 
hell of a lot of woods coming from
behind<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.579> ball<00:01:59.759> there<00:02:00.439> last<00:02:01.439> quick<00:02:01.680> shape

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
behind the ball there last quick shape

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.889 
behind the ball there last quick shape
shot<00:02:02.219> I'll<00:02:02.280> show<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> bird<00:02:02.969> you're

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
shot I'll show you is the bird you're

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.270 
shot I'll show you is the bird you're
not<00:02:04.020> getting<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.469> great<00:02:04.770> amount<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.100> bow

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
not getting a great amount of bow

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.920 
not getting a great amount of bow
there's<00:02:05.549> any<00:02:05.670> sort<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.969> gentle<00:02:06.450> bow<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:06.810> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
there's any sort of gentle bow there to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.839 
there's any sort of gentle bow there to
aid<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.259> pick<00:02:07.469> up<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> think<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.819> are

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
aid the pick up so I think if you are

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.190 
aid the pick up so I think if you are
the<00:02:09.119> kind<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.360> junior<00:02:09.539> bats<00:02:09.840> when<00:02:09.989> he<00:02:10.050> gets

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the kind of junior bats when he gets

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.530 
the kind of junior bats when he gets
straight<00:02:10.590> long<00:02:11.009> over<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> top<00:02:11.790> then<00:02:12.360> maybe

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
straight long over the top then maybe

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.730 
straight long over the top then maybe
this<00:02:12.780> wouldn't<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
this wouldn't be the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.150 
this wouldn't be the
but<00:02:13.950> for<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.340> again<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:14.940> said<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.300> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
but for you again as I said this is the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.800 
but for you again as I said this is the
improvising<00:02:17.160> baton<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:18.210> just<00:02:18.390> do<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.570> quick

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
improvising baton but just do a quick

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.460 
improvising baton but just do a quick
shot<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.350> edges<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.230> prove

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
shot of the edges on this just to prove

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.460 
shot of the edges on this just to prove
that<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:23.040> massive<00:02:24.000> Harrow<00:02:24.540> bat<00:02:24.870> you're

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
that this is a massive Harrow bat you're

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.310 
that this is a massive Harrow bat you're
looking<00:02:25.830> at<00:02:26.130> around<00:02:26.640> seven<00:02:27.540> thirty<00:02:27.810> thirty

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
looking at around seven thirty thirty

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.110 
looking at around seven thirty thirty
one<00:02:28.440> millimeter<00:02:29.100> edge<00:02:29.250> which<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.520> know<00:02:29.580> but

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
one millimeter edge which I know but

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.400 
one millimeter edge which I know but
I'll<00:02:30.240> show<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.390> how<00:02:30.450> light<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.020> as<00:02:31.140> well<00:02:31.260> in

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
I'll show you how light it is as well in

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.220 
I'll show you how light it is as well in
a<00:02:31.470> minute<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.310> quite<00:02:32.580> big<00:02:33.050> I'll<00:02:34.050> do<00:02:34.200> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
a minute that is quite big I'll do a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.540 
a minute that is quite big I'll do a
quick<00:02:34.320> spine<00:02:34.770> shot<00:02:35.070> as<00:02:35.130> well<00:02:35.250> because<00:02:35.460> you

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
quick spine shot as well because you

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.880 
quick spine shot as well because you
probably<00:02:35.730> saw<00:02:36.030> how<00:02:36.210> big<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.600> spine<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.200> from

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
probably saw how big the spine is from

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.100 
probably saw how big the spine is from
there<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.430> quickly<00:02:39.300> you're<00:02:39.930> probably

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
there just quickly you're probably

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.580 
there just quickly you're probably
looking<00:02:40.410> at<00:02:40.500> around<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.890> 56<00:02:41.730> 57<00:02:42.240> 58<00:02:42.590> millage

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
looking at around a 56 57 58 millage

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.650 
looking at around a 56 57 58 millage
which<00:02:43.860> even<00:02:44.520> on<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.640> short<00:02:44.670> handlebar<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.450> quite

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
which even on a short handlebar is quite

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.720 
which even on a short handlebar is quite
big<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:45.960> let<00:02:46.710> alone<00:02:46.890> for<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> Hara<00:02:47.430> that's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
big so let alone for a Hara that's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.300 
big so let alone for a Hara that's
massive<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.080> said<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.620> weight<00:02:49.860> I'll<00:02:50.130> just

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
massive so I said the weight I'll just

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.180 
massive so I said the weight I'll just
show<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:50.520> there<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> typical<00:02:52.230> Harrow<00:02:52.830> bat

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
show you there so a typical Harrow bat

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.000 
show you there so a typical Harrow bat
tends<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.880> way<00:02:54.030> around<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.870> pen<00:02:55.140> 5-2

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
tends to the way around to pen 5-2

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.090 
tends to the way around to pen 5-2
pounds<00:02:56.040> six<00:02:56.730> whereas<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.840> one<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.920> look

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
pounds six whereas this one you look

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.830 
pounds six whereas this one you look
there<00:02:59.310> waste<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.760> found<00:03:00.000> four<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> half<00:03:00.570> so

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
there waste to found four and a half so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.230 
there waste to found four and a half so
I<00:03:00.890> call<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.070> two<00:03:02.280> pound<00:03:02.490> four<00:03:02.790> there<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.150> it's

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
I call it a two pound four there so it's

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.640 
I call it a two pound four there so it's

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
ideal for the bats losing perhaps our

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.830

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
the face of this bat I mean essentially

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.890 
the face of this bat I mean essentially
has<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.670> little<00:03:14.910> perhaps<00:03:15.150> unfair<00:03:15.600> reputation

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
has a little perhaps unfair reputation

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.570 
has a little perhaps unfair reputation

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
of especially junior rats

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.310 
of especially junior rats

six seven eight nine 10 11 almost 12
grains<00:03:28.230> there<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.460> is<00:03:29.490> a<00:03:29.610> really<00:03:29.880> nice

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
outside edge for the right hander which

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.630 
outside edge for the right hander which
is<00:03:37.080> ideal<00:03:37.470> in<00:03:37.710> a<00:03:37.800> junior<00:03:38.190> but<00:03:38.370> especially

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
is ideal in a junior but especially

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.540 
is ideal in a junior but especially
