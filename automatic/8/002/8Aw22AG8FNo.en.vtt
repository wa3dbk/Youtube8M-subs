 so so hard so now up 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.510
 start fucking so you have a server and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.809
 in general, you could just create a series for you 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.580
 I will have to go to the steam to have tim 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.900
 make cub yu n 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.580
 think host game so here 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.770
 set up a server there for yourself 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.080
 server name is how many players on it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.970
 will play if you put in here 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.110
 only on the master or can well service 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.390
 becomes private and it can 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.710
 connect only your friends principle 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:50.149
 I would put the host to the title so 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.920

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.530

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.130
 Well let's try to invite my 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.530

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:07.979
 extinguish the game ok go wait we see 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.450
 Connect your friend for 2 and 4 of that same 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.739
 now just press start game 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.569
 and one more to your friend he connected 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.450
 again it must be exactly in 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.280
 the game if it will network just then him 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.220
 there will almost start downloading some 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.080
 garbage there spacewar is well, spacewar is 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.069
 how would fake name for forest 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.820
 some pirate 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:34.890
 He was not called what starting 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:39.680
 the server and the beginning will be long but then everything 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.680
 it will be okay 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.300
 so here you are all logged in 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.050
 I'm sorry for the lags of the computer batch of risks 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.150
 Carry let me still lag sometimes so 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.470
 same things go up all the cubes and 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:06.820
 close so close raise go 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.800
 for such that we pick up a hatchet and wait 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.800
 until the volt in society well here's a friend 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:18.940
 you have already appeared tra pattern to see it is not 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:21.790
 and so people cinema 5 where he disappeared here 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:27.400
 I apologize then probably no reason now 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.290
 past y and here's your friend here in 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.230
 In principle, everything is fine to see nothing 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:37.120
 does not lag 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.800
 what do we run a little on the gameplay here 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.770
 Of course, I am also a little important. 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:50.620
 Yes, so do not care so that the phone pin phone 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.390
 but need another gta radio on if you 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.340
 You can speak in the game without skype 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.360
 well if you play with someone by skype 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.410
 can communicate on this walkie talkie 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.120
 evolved exactly such flashes this 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.000
 what is it that he is looking for some shit shorter 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.340
 it freezes well this is a very weak sound 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.540
 mood for now but i don't know the settings 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.240
 we can maybe 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.660
 rebuild in general how you see the game 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.600
 Everything is okay, you can play bugs 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.790
 but there are very few of them , you know 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.290
 you're not even beta testing the game coming 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.360
 012 doors and generally the most over of 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.830
 Well, well, Iâ€™m thinking further and 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.590
 there is so will the game develop in 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.940
 In principle, the game will be nice for everyone . 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.830
 this company 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.940

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.940
