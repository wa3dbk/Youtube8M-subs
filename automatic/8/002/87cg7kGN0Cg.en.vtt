okay<00:00:07.460> I'd<00:00:08.460> like<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.760> talk<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.030> little<00:00:09.269> bit<00:00:09.510> about

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
okay I'd like to talk a little bit about

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.779 
okay I'd like to talk a little bit about
articulation<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.630> flute-playing<00:00:16.580> you<00:00:17.580> could

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
articulation and flute-playing you could

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.720 
articulation and flute-playing you could
write<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> book<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:20.670> I'm<00:00:20.939> sure<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.390> say

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
write a book and I'm sure what I say

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.460 
write a book and I'm sure what I say
probably<00:00:23.730> will<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:24.019> scratch<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.260> surface

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
probably will just scratch the surface

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
probably will just scratch the surface
of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.279> challenge<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:27.019> articulating<00:00:28.490> subtly

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
of the challenge of articulating subtly

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.760 
of the challenge of articulating subtly
and<00:00:29.730> subtly<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.890> flute<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:33.590> think<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.739> of

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and subtly on the flute I think one of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.840 
and subtly on the flute I think one of
the<00:00:34.950> most<00:00:35.130> important<00:00:35.760> things<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.480> say<00:00:37.380> about

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
the most important things to say about

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.290 
the most important things to say about
articulation<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.160> try<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.350> analyze<00:00:44.300> what

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
articulation is to try and analyze what

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.690 
articulation is to try and analyze what
happens<00:00:45.750> when<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.079> speak<00:00:46.469> rather<00:00:47.280> than<00:00:47.520> when

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
happens when we speak rather than when

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.850 
happens when we speak rather than when
we<00:00:47.850> play<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> flute<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.350> think<00:00:49.530> you'll

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
we play the flute because I think you'll

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.360 
we play the flute because I think you'll
find<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.410> things<00:00:52.739> much<00:00:53.100> more

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
find that you do things much more

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
find that you do things much more
smoothly<00:00:53.760> when<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.239> speak<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:55.410> when<00:00:55.590> you

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
smoothly when you speak then when you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.310 
smoothly when you speak then when you
play<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> flute<00:00:58.640> one<00:00:59.640> thing<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.300> focus<00:01:00.870> on

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
play the flute one thing that I focus on

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.570 
play the flute one thing that I focus on
a<00:01:01.559> lot<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:03.030> way<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.359> about

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
a lot in the way I think about

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.760 
a lot in the way I think about
articulation<00:01:07.460> I've<00:01:09.080> noticed<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.470> takes

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
articulation I've noticed that it takes

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.990 
articulation I've noticed that it takes
a<00:01:11.310> lot<00:01:11.790> more<00:01:11.820> subtlety<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.049> control<00:01:14.000> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
a lot more subtlety and control to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.870 
a lot more subtlety and control to
connect<00:01:15.390> notes<00:01:15.720> together<00:01:16.250> than<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.280> separate

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
connect notes together than to separate

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.280 
connect notes together than to separate
them<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.799> in<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:19.920> mind<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:21.060> always<00:01:21.810> try

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
them so in your mind I think always try

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.399 
them so in your mind I think always try
to<00:01:22.320> think<00:01:22.549> of<00:01:23.549> how<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.119> connect<00:01:25.080> notes

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to think of how you connect notes

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.490 
to think of how you connect notes
together<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.270> way<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.450> articulate<00:01:28.229> them

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
together in the way you articulate them

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
together in the way you articulate them
not<00:01:29.490> how<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.180> separate<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> notes<00:01:32.479> because

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
not how you separate the notes because

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.999 
not how you separate the notes because
when<00:01:33.689> there's<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> big<00:01:34.140> separation<00:01:34.829> between

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
when there's a big separation between

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.120 
when there's a big separation between
notes<00:01:35.460> there's<00:01:36.329> also<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:37.200> tension<00:01:37.950> between

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
notes there's also a tension between

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.300 
notes there's also a tension between
them<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.450> lack<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.689> fluidity<00:01:40.470> between<00:01:41.070> them

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
them and a lack of fluidity between them

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.090 
them and a lack of fluidity between them
and<00:01:42.049> I<00:01:43.049> think<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:44.570> creates<00:01:45.570> problems<00:01:46.100> with

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and I think this creates problems with

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.249 
and I think this creates problems with
the<00:01:47.220> mechanism<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.600> articulating<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.390> really

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the mechanism of articulating so really

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.420 
the mechanism of articulating so really
focus<00:01:53.119> on<00:01:54.119> how<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:55.729> connect<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.060> merge<00:01:58.430> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
focus on how to connect and merge the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.760 
focus on how to connect and merge the
various<00:02:01.219> movements<00:02:02.219> rather<00:02:03.210> than<00:02:03.770> over

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
various movements rather than over

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.130 
various movements rather than over
emphasizing<00:02:05.430> them

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
emphasizing them

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.230 
emphasizing them
that's<00:02:07.410> one<00:02:07.710> thing<00:02:07.980> which<00:02:08.580> creates<00:02:09.000> an

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
that's one thing which creates an

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.920 
that's one thing which creates an
awareness<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.860> way<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.009> thinking<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.900> I

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
awareness and a way of thinking that I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.370 
awareness and a way of thinking that I
think<00:02:13.350> will<00:02:13.500> lead<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.940> more<00:02:15.540> relaxed<00:02:16.200> and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
think will lead to a more relaxed and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.380 
think will lead to a more relaxed and
flowing<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.630> natural<00:02:18.650> articulation<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:21.210> other

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
flowing a natural articulation the other

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.240 
flowing a natural articulation the other
very<00:02:21.840> very<00:02:22.470> important<00:02:23.280> aspect<00:02:24.950> again<00:02:25.950> is

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
very very important aspect again is

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.580 
very very important aspect again is
about<00:02:26.370> concept<00:02:29.360> what<00:02:30.360> we're<00:02:30.540> trying<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.080> do<00:02:31.260> is

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
about concept what we're trying to do is

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.640 
about concept what we're trying to do is
to<00:02:32.040> become<00:02:32.190> more<00:02:32.580> aware<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:34.170> listen<00:02:34.500> more

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
to become more aware and to listen more

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.449 
to become more aware and to listen more
acutely<00:02:36.290> that's<00:02:37.290> more<00:02:37.620> important<00:02:38.250> than

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
acutely that's more important than

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.870 
acutely that's more important than
choosing<00:02:39.080> which<00:02:40.080> muscles<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.830> use<00:02:41.010> which<00:02:41.430> area

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
choosing which muscles to use which area

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.900 
choosing which muscles to use which area
of<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.180> tongue<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.570> use<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.170> think<00:02:43.610> it's<00:02:44.610> better

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
of the tongue to use I think it's better

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.930 
of the tongue to use I think it's better
to<00:02:45.060> leave<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:46.080> little<00:02:46.650> bit<00:02:46.830> ambiguous<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
to leave this a little bit ambiguous a

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.010 
to leave this a little bit ambiguous a
little<00:02:48.810> bit<00:02:48.930> free<00:02:49.230> from<00:02:49.560> preconceived<00:02:50.310> ideas

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
little bit free from preconceived ideas

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.360 
little bit free from preconceived ideas
taking<00:02:52.020> into<00:02:52.260> account<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.860> we<00:02:52.920> all<00:02:53.160> have

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
taking into account that we all have

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.610 
taking into account that we all have
different<00:02:53.400> mouths<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.330> different<00:02:54.930> aims<00:02:55.140> with

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
different mouths and different aims with

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.960 
different mouths and different aims with
our<00:02:55.800> sound<00:02:57.350> it's<00:02:58.350> very<00:02:58.500> difficult<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.580> define

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
our sound it's very difficult to define

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.440 
our sound it's very difficult to define
the<00:03:00.660> muscles<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.470> use<00:03:01.940> much<00:03:02.940> better<00:03:03.239> to

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
the muscles that we use much better to

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.790 
the muscles that we use much better to
define<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.989> aim<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:06.450> create<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.110> almost

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
define the aim and to create that almost

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.150 
define the aim and to create that almost
without<00:03:08.040> thinking<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:09.410> then<00:03:10.410> understand

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
without thinking and then understand

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.470 
without thinking and then understand
what<00:03:11.310> we're<00:03:11.549> doing<00:03:13.070> ok<00:03:14.070> I'll<00:03:15.000> give<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.360> an

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
what we're doing ok I'll give you an

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.750 
what we're doing ok I'll give you an
example<00:03:17.030> supposing<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.180> say<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:19.489> love<00:03:20.489> you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
example supposing you say I love you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.690 
example supposing you say I love you
alright<00:03:22.010> then<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.190> say<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.690> really<00:03:24.690> slowly

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
alright then you say it really slowly

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.370 
alright then you say it really slowly
really<00:03:26.700> slowly<00:03:27.110> ok<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:30.450> aim<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.720> of

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
really slowly ok and the aim of of

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.770 
really slowly ok and the aim of of
saying<00:03:31.799> this<00:03:32.130> is<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.700> try<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.180> create<00:03:33.450> a

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
saying this is to try and create a

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.789 
saying this is to try and create a
smooth<00:03:34.410> transition<00:03:35.180> between<00:03:36.410> vowel<00:03:37.410> and

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
smooth transition between vowel and

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.030 
smooth transition between vowel and
consonant<00:03:38.630> which<00:03:39.630> are<00:03:39.870> almost<00:03:40.140> like<00:03:40.380> fire<00:03:40.769> and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
consonant which are almost like fire and

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.330 
consonant which are almost like fire and
water<00:03:41.250> they're<00:03:41.910> opposites<00:03:42.769> see<00:03:43.769> if<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.160> can

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
water they're opposites see if you can

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.610 
water they're opposites see if you can
merge<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.910> differences<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.810> make<00:03:46.140> them<00:03:46.350> flow

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
merge the differences and make them flow

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.460 
merge the differences and make them flow
into<00:03:46.950> each<00:03:47.070> other<00:03:47.370> do<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.730> in<00:03:47.880> slow<00:03:48.150> motion

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
into each other do it in slow motion

00:03:48.470 --> 00:04:02.069 
into each other do it in slow motion
even<00:03:49.470> example<00:03:50.100> or<00:03:50.220> come<00:03:50.430> close

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.420 

you<00:04:05.829> all<00:04:06.829> right

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
you all right

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:24.900 
you all right
I'll<00:04:08.000> do<00:04:08.269> it<00:04:08.299> again

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.589 

okay<00:04:25.910> so<00:04:26.690> we<00:04:26.810> have<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:26.990> flow<00:04:27.440> between<00:04:28.599> consonant

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
okay so we have a flow between consonant

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.820 
okay so we have a flow between consonant
and<00:04:30.349> vowel<00:04:31.360> now<00:04:32.360> we're<00:04:32.539> trying<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:33.080> cut<00:04:33.560> out

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
and vowel now we're trying to cut out

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.649 
and vowel now we're trying to cut out
any<00:04:34.460> rough<00:04:35.210> or<00:04:35.539> sudden<00:04:36.110> edges<00:04:37.090> to<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.240> strands

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
any rough or sudden edges to the strands

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.619 
any rough or sudden edges to the strands
these<00:04:39.139> transitions<00:04:40.120> now<00:04:41.120> when<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.360> analyze

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629 
these transitions now when you analyze

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.710 
these transitions now when you analyze
what's<00:04:42.169> happening<00:04:42.590> in<00:04:42.680> your<00:04:42.830> mouth<00:04:43.720> it's

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
what's happening in your mouth it's

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.920 
what's happening in your mouth it's
beyond<00:04:45.530> understanding<00:04:46.210> how<00:04:47.210> many<00:04:47.419> movements

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
beyond understanding how many movements

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.909 
beyond understanding how many movements
are<00:04:48.050> happening<00:04:49.180> between<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:51.110> cheeks<00:04:51.470> the

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
are happening between the cheeks the

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.050 
are happening between the cheeks the
tongue<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.789> lips<00:04:52.870> throat<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:54.500> airflow<00:04:55.159> the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
tongue the lips throat the airflow the

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.870 
tongue the lips throat the airflow the
vocal<00:04:56.509> chords<00:04:57.080> oh<00:04:57.409> god<00:04:58.400> I've<00:04:59.030> missed<00:04:59.139> several

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
vocal chords oh god I've missed several

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.779 
vocal chords oh god I've missed several
galaxies<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:02.210> movements<00:05:02.750> okay<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.610> issue

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
galaxies of movements okay so the issue

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.659 
galaxies of movements okay so the issue
is<00:05:05.210> not<00:05:05.389> just<00:05:05.449> the<00:05:05.810> tongue<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:10.490> other

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
is not just the tongue so the other

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.089 
is not just the tongue so the other
interesting<00:05:11.180> thing<00:05:11.360> is<00:05:11.569> that<00:05:11.870> although<00:05:12.289> you<00:05:12.620> I

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
interesting thing is that although you I

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.520 
interesting thing is that although you I
just<00:05:13.250> created<00:05:13.759> a<00:05:13.909> very<00:05:14.090> smooth<00:05:14.539> transition

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
just created a very smooth transition

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.730 
just created a very smooth transition
between<00:05:16.130> all<00:05:16.610> these<00:05:16.789> sounds<00:05:17.509> I<00:05:17.740> wasn't

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
between all these sounds I wasn't

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.119 
between all these sounds I wasn't
conscious<00:05:19.009> of<00:05:19.430> all<00:05:19.639> those<00:05:19.909> movements<00:05:20.530> so<00:05:21.530> as

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
conscious of all those movements so as

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.270 
conscious of all those movements so as
far<00:05:22.430> as<00:05:22.550> I'm<00:05:22.729> concerned<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.569> devil<00:05:24.080> is<00:05:24.379> to

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
far as I'm concerned the devil is to

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.490 
far as I'm concerned the devil is to
know<00:05:25.460> exactly<00:05:26.330> what<00:05:26.539> every<00:05:26.840> muscle<00:05:27.050> should<00:05:27.349> be

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
know exactly what every muscle should be

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.850 
know exactly what every muscle should be
doing<00:05:27.860> these<00:05:28.310> preconceived<00:05:29.270> ideas<00:05:29.930> wreak

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
doing these preconceived ideas wreak

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.390 
doing these preconceived ideas wreak
havoc<00:05:31.370> on<00:05:31.659> your<00:05:32.659> sense<00:05:33.110> of<00:05:33.289> spontaneity<00:05:33.560> and

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
havoc on your sense of spontaneity and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.240 
havoc on your sense of spontaneity and
naturalness<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.990> playing<00:05:36.259> don't<00:05:37.069> go

naturalness and the playing don't go

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.129 
naturalness and the playing don't go
there<00:05:37.639> don't<00:05:38.509> go<00:05:38.690> there

there don't go there

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:46.510

but define what you want okay so when

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.860 
but define what you want okay so when
you<00:05:47.029> realize<00:05:47.650> what<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:49.029> fantastic<00:05:50.029> thing<00:05:50.539> the
