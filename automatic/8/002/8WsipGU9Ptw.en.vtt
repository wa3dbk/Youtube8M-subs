00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hi all today i have one again 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.770
 formatted video for you and this is 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.450
 then really my last video from 2013 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.160
 and so it is a formatted video and me 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.559
 know it is not that bad in the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.880
 taste falls but still I do it 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.560
 because there are people who do 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.930
 like it and there are also quite a few 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 people who like it less but still 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.769
 I always want to record it 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.750
 I really have a lot this month 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.849
 products and if I like you that way 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.410
 to look at it is really very nice 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.080
 products all 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.850
 so i'm going to quickly show i have two 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.840
 scrub- like products from the body shop 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.420
 also made 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 this chocolate scrub and it really smells 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 very nice I think I have two here 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.809
 year participated is very long and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.040
 this strawberry body polish 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.050
 and I also have quite a long time with this 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.789
 done and at some point it started 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.250
 less and less good to smell so I have 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.739
 quickly made it up and these two 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.530
 I actually thought both of these are scrub 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.730
 very nice but I thought this was okay 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.850
 then I made yesterday or the day before yesterday 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.940
 this dry shampoo from schwarzkopf 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.700
 this costs around 3 euros at the etos or 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.740
 I think 4 euros is something 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.290
 cheaper than the batiste dry shampoo 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.049
 I also think these are just fine 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.640
 yes I do not use this very often 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.740
 but just occasionally how is it possible 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.750
 else as I made every month 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.250
 Primark cleaning wipes and this 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.860
 wash my last package so i have to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.530
 back to Primark quickly because me 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.290
 I no longer have them and forget my body 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.689
 lotion from christina aguilera 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.189
 I got this in the glossy box and this one 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.049
 I really have in a month or so 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.020
 I put it up at the start of van 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.460
 this one was already finished in December and it smells so 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.140
 yummy 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 I think the scent is wonderful and coincidental 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.310
 I have here the odors that I have 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.320
 got it for christmas because i got this 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.329
 I wanted the body lotion too 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.979
 and it is so delicious and powder of essent 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.659
 the matte all about matt white powder this 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.310
 is that transparent powder of essence 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.780
 and at some point it becomes so thin that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.790
 he is going to break 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.680
 he breaks very quickly so that's why he is 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.670
 also completely empty because it is there 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.310
 all just out 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.720
 the price is in itself for the whole price 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.099
 nice another product from the body shop 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.140
 this look also at the start of this 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.590
 month and this is the body butter 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.120
 from the moringa line and the monica odor 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.270
 very floral 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.910
 so whether I feel so great or not 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.650
 yes it is nice and clean but fresh 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.170
 I don't like flowers that much 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.700
 but I have only just made yet 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.830
 a body lotion I'm doing a lot 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.150
 Been lubricate recent months about the 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.290
 last month 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.840
 where i also wanted a lot 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.380
 make up because I just do so much 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.819
 body that I have 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.709
 just format 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.709
 so I also made these from rituals 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.200
 this scent is very nice i've had 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.720
 here also a scrub pot 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.239
 but this is a little honey-like 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.180
 sweet yeah he is also called honey touch with 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.760
 indian rose and himalayan money and glitch 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.780
 nourishing body cream this was really whole 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.330
 yummy 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.860
 this pink line of rituals have one 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.790
 other product of its all very much 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.860
 yummy 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.840
 all this product that is not used up but what 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.780
 I don't really like them anymore 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.459
 the simple day cream of the herb barrel 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.950
 for normal to combination skin and 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.989
 this only costs 150 but if I put it on 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.150
 smear on my skin then leave you white 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.970
 down behind or something it missed I try and 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.859
 then very good spread but you had 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.000
 kind of a white robe and therefore 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.220
 I feel that he is not fast 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.790
 withdraws and does not give really beautiful 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.400
 effect 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.260
 and I also hardly used it I had 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.450
 I bought this one because I thought recently 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.010
 cheap but a bit disappointing 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.380
 so I just put it away and I still have it 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.030
 enough day creams also made this him 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.320
 called out from the spice barrel and this is 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.120
 just such a small tube with a 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.940
 intensive hair mask what you take a minute 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.450
 can withdraw it and start this one 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.579
 just used once so yes I think 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.130
 never so much for a difference 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.810
 actually notice the essence gel eyeliner 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.640
 and i would not put up but 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.310
 he has dried out 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.780
 I have used a lot and I have the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.519
 never actually gel lately 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.900
 use eyeliner and then I would want this 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.359
 trying but then I saw that 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.459
 was dried out so now I'll do it 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.010
 but this is just the black color 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.230
 wit mike there is but i think i do 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.150
 soon again 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.950
 gelliner wants to try is then I buy it 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.300
 maybe again if it is still for sale 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.550
 I don't really know 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.580
 and I made to foundation actually 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.810
 incredible i yes i never make one 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.630
 foundation will almost never 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.550
 and now there happen to be two merged 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.870
 a moon or at least one is running out 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.150
 so I think I'll leave that next month 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.500
 and this, however, is on the tories 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.730
 l'orÃ©al match and you can do it 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.060
 maybe see the text almost there 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.620
 is finished but this is so fine and it has 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.130
 a very light color he has one 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.050
 pump 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.820
 but what i regret is that you get this there 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.680
 cannot turn off because there really is still 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.640
 something in but it just does not come 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.380
 more from the pump 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.150
 and so I can't unscrew the cap 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.920
 I then I can not find the leftovers 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.020
 So play it is a pity but 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.660
 this chill match foundation from l'oreal 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.650
 used so often of course because he is 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.330
 on it 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.460
 but this has a nice light color 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.670
 it is a very liquid thin 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.590
 substance that smells nice and also 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.180
 still quite covering so I found him 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.950
 really super nice and like my other 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.560
 foundations are gone then I think I am 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.180
 These are on your sale now they are 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.070
 about an hour away because mine 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.420
 camera failed because it was empty 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.920
 used to be 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.720
 but of course I need this video 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.140
 just finish so we just go again 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.450
 further 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.340
 I finally make it clear 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:26.200
 product open this is a loop product 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:29.150
 and this product is a cleanser and 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.770
 cleaning paste like something you are with 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.600
 water can mix and I do 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.870
 show it in a favorite video 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.760
 And yes there is a bit in between 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.680
 Scrub particles in it are very spicy and 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.300
 it is good for their skin 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.020
 yes the dot good against pimples and a 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.210
 oily skin it costs around 11 euros at 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.729
 loop and this was all I have 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.229
 Made up in December I hope so 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.970
 you liked it and i am one 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.009
 went through a bit quickly because anyway 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.139
 a lot of people this is not very nice 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.850
 to see where i hope anyway 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.720
 you guys do this video yet a 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.220
 kind of liked 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.720
 Of course I want you very much 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.430
