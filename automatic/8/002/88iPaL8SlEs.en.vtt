00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 the eighth homemade video treatment 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.319
 homemade recipe as you want to call it 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.480
 here in today present in pink channel not 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.920
 make this kind of video here and today 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.690
 I came to talk to you for a treatment. 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.590
 super natural set in flames 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.029
 treatment they charge a fortune only 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.529
 applying ice to your hair is a 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.140
 super cheap and affordable raw material 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.369
 so I think it's very valid to bring 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.420
 This video for you here today in 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.099
 truth is nothing more than a 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.900
 reconstruction because it 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.849
 all the benefits she offers 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.920
 going to replace it will help restore that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.870
 machine that the hair loses is 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.870
 by climatic actions by chapinha 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.700
 dryer or because I got married that was me 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.890
 I indicate the treatment for both hair 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.440
 to more fragile hair 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.270
 more damage is good I already used gila 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.280
 in skin leave here if you have not seen 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.200
 a look because it's worth it and the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 recent one I brought today is super simple 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.930
 for everyone to be able to make spending 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.300
 a little bit without needing many 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 ingredients but there are several uses 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.370
 possible for clays may be 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.289
 eyes with a coconut water with serum 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.059
 with a chamomile tea one 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.760
 several ingredients same to us 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.650
 I get that simplify and has only 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.640
 Nobody with water can find 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.070
 queues in stores that sell products 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.409
 labore natural'll leave straight 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.880
 where do you find mine that has a two 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.400
 links that I may have mobilized to 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.860
 I used it today, it's old. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.270
 video and my hair is going to be this 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.400
 What are you watching, I have not finished with 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.869
 nothing so why he did not go to 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.460
 define themes for which they are more 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.829
 other parts which are less than 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.689
 What a lot of people are very loose. 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.939
 Little wise man looks only at the movement that 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.500
 it is super light even treatment and 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.810
 as much as it is a reconstructor goes 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.430
 replace the keratin of the film and the jeci 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.020
 hair so that's why I like it so much 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.490
 I hope you like it too. 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.409
 can enjoy at home 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.299
 after all it is very cheap a result 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.490
 wonderful that did not stop me 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.170
 tell you in the comments and post a 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.689
 photo there on instagram using the hashtag 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.240
 tip of the doubt tac now because this hashtag 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.009
 to show you the treatments 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.450
 even before postings even ask pro 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.250
 then you can accompany me 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.229
 also be able to follow what you 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.640
 They're making the floods talk and we're going there. 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.250
 see how I did this reconstruction 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.049
 homemade and super cheap 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.270
 So let's go to the application and I'll start the 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.890
 shower even wash 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.390
 the hair hair has is clean to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.190
 people during the application that will do 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.450
 with wet or dry hair 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.840
 at his discretion but he has to be in 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.840
 pine 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.200
 I apply shampoo without salt that Raizen 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.760
 chooses by length runs with the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.860
 water does not apply shampoo in length 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.630
 So wash my hair with shampoo I'm 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.100
 using that at the moment the team think that already 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.290
 I made a video talking about it to 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.550
 you who help growth maybe 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.410
 leave the video at home in the box 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.490
 information is clean and 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.720
 wrapped in a towel to get the 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:42.170
 excess water and let's do this 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:44.540
 mixture will need white clay 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.460
 a non- metallic bowl a spoon 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.990
 Also non - metallic and mineral water 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.660
 mix well come eye start putting 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.190
 a full spoon of those record labels that 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.110
 I'm using a little place 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.820
 water and then add ingredients 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.960
 mixing until smooth. 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.960
 that I want 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.140
 to this consistency neither liquid nor 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.909
 creamy I prefer to work with her 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.650
 more malleable because it is easier to 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.840
 apply on hair than she much 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.670
 I'll put my hair straight as you can. 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.010
 to see it was almost dry because it took 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.810
 because the mix goes everything but 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.609
 I usually stay with him well and who 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.379
 there is no hunting dog with a direct thin brush 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.030
 I'm staying my love, hump with the 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.159
 makeup registration if you have to 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.599
 waive the best hairdresser or can 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.250
 keep a glove that will go 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.200
 applying wick to wick taking care to 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.939
 stay well in the root and promote clay 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.099
 oxygenation of the scalp then this 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.209
 will help the university grow 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.680
 in several other factors 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.599
 I make the application more or less one 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.069
 once a month I do not change more than 20 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.329
 minutes can not but cause 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.829
 hair dryness 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.780
 the only tongue with the hair is 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.609
 because sergipe hiv from the most 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.819
 people are going to talk about this other wines 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.819
 it is 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.270
 the fight just made this justification 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.180
 Beautiful, wonderful and a little bit 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.710
 delayed my case I learn each one 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.390
 of these credits makes a lot of dirt leave 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.040
 he let it go we're learning not 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.780
 also needs the exchange when it 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.400
 it was still wet and allowed to dry 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.680
 so there is no risk of damage 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.660
 the cause of 27 years after he 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.420
 call a shampoo I always prefer one 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.250
 moisturizing shampoo and conditioner or 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.720
 mask to finish is also at your 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.520
 criterion I only used conditioner to 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.230
 not interfere in the result barzinho and 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.940
 has the result look how hair stands 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.680
 super soltinho that's why I like it 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.210
 to apply on any length because 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.610
 I think it gives a brightness and a 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.380
 I light my hair like very few 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.660
 things mainly very few 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.340
 reconstruction offers me how you 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.290
 can see nothing gets the length 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.450
 of threads but toshack received hotel is only 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.550
 mix with a mask with ph more 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.620
 neutral so it also gives supercerto 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.540
 this seems to reflect from today expect 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.280
 many have liked it if you want to see more 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.200
 treatments with clays and others and 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.300
 you had to stay home so you 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.530
 I click I like to write it down 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.480
 of the channel so as not to lose any more 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.130
 video is good but the friends that are 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.600
 needing a good power treatment 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.980
 who do not want to spend too much about it not 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.870
 Forget to use the hashtag there in the 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.090
 instagram was to show the result of your 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.310
 hair was also made then a kiss 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.760
 of large size and up to the next 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.760
 find people
