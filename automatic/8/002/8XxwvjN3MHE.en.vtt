00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.250
 boys and a good 20 minutes mo.vi today vi 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.240
 we want to show you how to do this 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.389
 headphone port states the pandas see you 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.120
 a lot around these headphone holders a lot 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.270
 useful I must say but they are all round 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.590
 and monotonous in my opinion so I wanted 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.680
 make a headphone holder in the shape of a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.869
 panda which is among other things also rhinestones among 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.060
 simple to make even if it is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.039
 really really nice then 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 works like everyone else 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 in headphone and mali case then it wraps us up 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.160
 the headphones around only that it doesn't have 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 no hole because i don't like i 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.780
 pierce your way in which you put the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.450
 so what so you simply have to 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.879
 go and serve the taste of going 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.030
 insert this here in this way is 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.539
 all stuck and cute that I 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.670
 I actually thought this for a 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.270
 back to school then for school 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.420

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:54.939
 in this way before interest areas 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.379
 let's do this too 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.479
 circle here that we will need to create 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.509
 thickness and distance 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.050
 so how can you see then what 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.990
 I have to do 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.839
 I have to make three rows then the first row 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.639
 will be the classic central dot io 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:12.770
 I prefer to make seeks out because 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.889
 more solid and more stable 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.740
 then first or second end actually 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:23.479
 the classic would be all around more 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:26.589
 marine this way and then last last 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.589
 row last lap 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:31.699
 ok guys now we can go and spy 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.039

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.770
 pack course then on the square one the 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:39.339
 panda and the circle on that point 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.339
 circular 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.960
 now my four pieces then two 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.910
 panda faces and 2 circles 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.490
 transparent because they know that and 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.260

 I look for where to place them slightly 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:02.250
 seen of the nose I think it's the right place 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:07.439
 I put some glue directly on the 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:10.650
 Buddhist circles or pressure 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:16.860
