00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
the molecular structure of water and

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.120 
the molecular structure of water and

thought<00:01:11.090> perhaps<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.960> would<00:01:12.110> respond<00:01:12.590> to

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119

thought perhaps it would respond to
non-physical<00:01:14.119> events<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.170> he<00:01:15.320> set<00:01:15.560> up<00:01:15.710> a

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
non-physical events so he set up a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.730 
non-physical events so he set up a

individually

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.370 

we<00:01:58.460> first<00:01:58.850> take<00:01:59.060> photographs<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.840> water<00:02:00.080> that

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
we first take photographs of water that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.830 
we first take photographs of water that
we<00:02:00.470> did<00:02:00.650> not<00:02:00.740> put<00:02:01.010> any<00:02:01.159> information<00:02:01.880> on<00:02:01.970> then

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
we did not put any information on then

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.020 
we did not put any information on then
we<00:02:03.380> take<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.800> water<00:02:03.979> with<00:02:04.280> information<00:02:04.940> you

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
we take the water with information you

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.830 
we take the water with information you
do<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.300> same<00:02:05.540> procedure<00:02:05.690> just<00:02:06.229> describe<00:02:07.840> we

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
do the same procedure just describe we

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.749 
do the same procedure just describe we
take<00:02:09.050> those<00:02:09.229> before<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:09.950> after<00:02:10.550> photographs

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
take those before and after photographs

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:19.040 
take those before and after photographs
and<00:02:11.420> compare<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.080> differences

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.150 

I<00:02:20.660> when<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:21.780> projected<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.410> feeling<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.920> love

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
I when we projected the feeling of love

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.890 
I when we projected the feeling of love
and<00:02:23.220> thanks<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.820> water<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.330> made<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.720> most

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
and thanks to water it made the most

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.640 
and thanks to water it made the most
beautiful<00:02:25.020> crystal<00:02:26.840> those<00:02:27.840> times<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.440> this

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
beautiful crystal those times like this

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.949 
beautiful crystal those times like this
I<00:02:28.950> think<00:02:29.250> butter<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.850> at<00:02:30.000> peace

the thought or intense being the driving
force<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:35.019> all<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.440> this<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:36.280> science<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.819> how

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
force in all of this the science of how

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.150 
force in all of this the science of how
that<00:03:37.030> actually<00:03:37.209> affects<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:38.200> molecules<00:03:38.739> is

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
that actually affects the molecules is

course<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:43.739> it's<00:03:44.739> really<00:03:44.980> fascinating<00:03:45.220> when

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
course and it's really fascinating when

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.449 
course and it's really fascinating when
you<00:03:45.849> keep<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:46.299> mind<00:03:46.329> that<00:03:47.079> 90%<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:48.129> our<00:03:48.310> bodies

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
you keep in mind that 90% of our bodies

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:59.990 
you keep in mind that 90% of our bodies
are<00:03:49.060> water

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.520 

next<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.720> wonder<00:04:01.050> doesn't

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
next you wonder doesn't

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.600 
next you wonder doesn't
if<00:04:03.100> thoughts<00:04:03.370> can<00:04:03.490> do<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.880> to<00:04:04.090> water<00:04:04.120> imagine

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
if thoughts can do that to water imagine

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.840 
if thoughts can do that to water imagine
what<00:04:06.610> our<00:04:06.640> thoughts<00:04:06.730> can<00:04:07.540> do<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.690> us
