00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
it turns out this car is from the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.279 
it turns out this car is from the
Chicago<00:00:23.279> area<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.789> has<00:00:24.240> nearly<00:00:24.539> all<00:00:24.930> the

Chicago area and has nearly all the
emissions<00:00:26.220> stuff<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.269> for<00:00:27.900> 1970<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.429> I'm

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
emissions stuff on it for 1970 so I'm

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.490 
emissions stuff on it for 1970 so I'm
going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.699> come<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.150> side<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.810> my

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
all at the air pump the air pump has a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.610 
all at the air pump the air pump has a
belt<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.399> driven<00:00:38.670> off<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.120> water<00:00:39.360> pump<00:00:39.690> it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
belt it's driven off the water pump it's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.639 
belt it's driven off the water pump it's
always<00:00:41.040> spinning<00:00:41.399> always<00:00:42.329> turning<00:00:42.649> always

always spinning always turning always
sucking<00:00:43.920> air<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.340> through<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.360> through<00:00:46.289> this

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
sucking air in through this through this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.369 
sucking air in through this through this
there's<00:00:47.850> supposed<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> horn<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.230> end

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
there's supposed to be a horn on the end

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.439 
there's supposed to be a horn on the end
of<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.860> which<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.700> supposed<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> stick

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
of here which is supposed to stick

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.110 
of here which is supposed to stick
straight<00:00:51.750> back<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.920> filtered<00:00:53.460> air<00:00:53.820> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
straight back so it's filtered air that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
straight back so it's filtered air that
comes<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.780> here<00:00:54.960> comes<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.890> into<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.789> pump

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
comes into here comes up into the pump

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.959 
comes into here comes up into the pump
and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.410> goes<00:00:58.620> either<00:00:58.920> towards<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
and then out and goes either towards the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.070 
and then out and goes either towards the
gulp<00:01:00.239> valve<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:01.370> towards<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> air<00:01:03.080> manifold

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
gulp valve or towards the air manifold

in the air injectors if neither of these

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.340 
in the air injectors if neither of these
can<00:01:07.530> pass<00:01:08.340> air<00:01:08.729> through<00:01:09.119> them<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:10.049> there's<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
can pass air through them then there's a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.740 
can pass air through them then there's a
relief<00:01:10.799> valve<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> back<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> air<00:01:12.360> pump

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
relief valve on the back of the air pump

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.560 
relief valve on the back of the air pump
that<00:01:13.560> allows<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.369> air<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.580> come<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.240> because

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that allows the air to come out because

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.469 
that allows the air to come out because
it's<00:01:15.930> always<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.799> vane<00:01:17.220> system<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.060> it's

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
it's always it's a vane system and it's

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.710 
it's always it's a vane system and it's
always<00:01:18.720> creating<00:01:19.229> some<00:01:19.439> air<00:01:19.590> pressure<00:01:20.720> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
always creating some air pressure this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.100 
always creating some air pressure this
is<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> one-way<00:01:22.590> valve<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.540> air<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.720> able<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
is a one-way valve and air is able to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.289 
is a one-way valve and air is able to
pass<00:01:25.320> through<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.369> into<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> exhaust

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
pass through it and go into the exhaust

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.870 
pass through it and go into the exhaust
but<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> exhaust<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:28.950> able<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> come<00:01:29.670> back

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
but the exhaust is not able to come back

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.810 
but the exhaust is not able to come back
through<00:01:30.270> once<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> blue<00:01:31.350> moon<00:01:31.460> these<00:01:32.460> things

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
through once in a blue moon these things

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.480 
through once in a blue moon these things
break<00:01:33.150> apart<00:01:33.630> exhaust<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.860> coming<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.430> out

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
break apart exhaust is coming right out

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
break apart exhaust is coming right out
of<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> sounds<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.020> engines

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
of here and it sounds like the engines

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.730 
of here and it sounds like the engines
broken<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.159> makes<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.150> makes<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.450> tremendous

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
broken it makes it makes a tremendous

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.910 
broken it makes it makes a tremendous
racket<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:42.090> anyway<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:43.170> one-way

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
racket but anyway this this one-way

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.520 
racket but anyway this this one-way
valve<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.149> you've<00:01:45.930> got<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.259> air

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
valve is here and you've got the air

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.460 
valve is here and you've got the air
injector<00:01:47.130> ports<00:01:47.460> down<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:48.060> most<00:01:48.840> often<00:01:49.350> you

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
injector ports down here most often you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.420 
injector ports down here most often you
see<00:01:49.710> these<00:01:49.860> guys<00:01:50.630> closed<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.220> case

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
see these guys closed up in in that case

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.899 
see these guys closed up in in that case
you'd<00:01:53.670> use<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.060> 7/16<00:01:55.020> 20<00:01:55.439> cent<00:01:56.280> screw<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you'd use the 7/16 20 cent screw and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.840 
you'd use the 7/16 20 cent screw and
just<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.110> block<00:01:58.469> those<00:01:58.740> air<00:01:59.070> injectors<00:01:59.640> up

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
just just block those air injectors up

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.870 
just just block those air injectors up
the<00:02:00.600> idea<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.320> put<00:02:01.530> air<00:02:01.770> fresh<00:02:02.159> air<00:02:02.430> into

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the idea is to put air fresh air into

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.999 
the idea is to put air fresh air into
the<00:02:02.909> exhaust<00:02:03.329> system<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.290> goes<00:02:04.500> right<00:02:04.740> into

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the exhaust system this goes right into

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.249 
the exhaust system this goes right into
the<00:02:05.250> exhaust<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.969> above<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.540> exhaust<00:02:06.930> valve

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the exhaust it's above the exhaust valve

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.919 
the exhaust it's above the exhaust valve
so<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.099> exhaust<00:02:08.550> coming<00:02:08.819> out<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.569> engine

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
so the exhaust coming out of the engine

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.570 
so the exhaust coming out of the engine
catches<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:11.039> air

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
catches this air

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.950 
catches this air
it<00:02:11.879> helps<00:02:12.330> combust

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
it helps combust

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.260 
it helps combust
the<00:02:13.050> unburned<00:02:13.560> hydrocarbons<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:15.030> might

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
the unburned hydrocarbons that might

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.140 
the unburned hydrocarbons that might
have<00:02:15.480> passed<00:02:15.750> through<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.440> system<00:02:17.150> without

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
have passed through the system without

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.960 
have passed through the system without
getting<00:02:18.480> all<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.840> way<00:02:18.960> combusted<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
getting all the way combusted in the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.540 
getting all the way combusted in the
front<00:02:21.270> we've<00:02:21.840> got<00:02:21.870> another<00:02:22.200> system<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:23.220> here

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
front we've got another system up here

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.780 
front we've got another system up here
in<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.390> passes<00:02:24.930> into<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.470> gulp<00:02:26.430> valve

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
in this this passes into the gulp valve

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.060 
in this this passes into the gulp valve
and<00:02:27.180> there's<00:02:27.780> supposed<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.380> restrictor

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
and there's supposed to be a restrictor

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.890 
and there's supposed to be a restrictor
I'm<00:02:29.220> feeling<00:02:29.670> for<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:29.970> restrictor<00:02:30.540> there<00:02:30.720> is

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
I'm feeling for the restrictor there is

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.840 
I'm feeling for the restrictor there is
no<00:02:31.080> restrictor<00:02:31.740> here<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.490> looks<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
no restrictor here it looks like a

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.630 
no restrictor here it looks like a
bullet<00:02:33.240> with<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.600> hole<00:02:33.870> through<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.500> fits<00:02:35.250> right

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640

so you're pushing raw air fuel right

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.230

about it
horsepower<00:04:27.300> loss<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:29.100> again<00:04:29.460> we've<00:04:29.820> got<00:04:29.850> the

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
horsepower loss so again we've got the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.240 
horsepower loss so again we've got the
the<00:04:30.420> air<00:04:30.720> pump<00:04:31.080> that's<00:04:31.350> always<00:04:31.530> blowing<00:04:32.010> air

the air pump that's always blowing air

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.770 
the air pump that's always blowing air
if<00:04:32.460> it<00:04:32.610> can't<00:04:32.820> go<00:04:32.970> through<00:04:33.210> there's<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.630> goes

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
if it can't go through there's it goes

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.590 
if it can't go through there's it goes
through<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.050> relief<00:04:34.560> valve<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.160> back

through the relief valve in the back

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.100 
through the relief valve in the back
here<00:04:36.600> it's<00:04:36.780> always<00:04:36.990> going<00:04:37.550> into<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.670> exhaust

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
here it's always going into the exhaust

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.380 
here it's always going into the exhaust
here<00:04:40.110> it's<00:04:40.380> it's<00:04:40.800> coming<00:04:41.310> around<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.820> getting

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
here it's it's coming around and getting

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.170 
here it's it's coming around and getting
shot<00:04:42.750> into<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.230> intake<00:04:43.650> manifold<00:04:44.250> during

which<00:04:48.090> is<00:04:48.980> deceleration<00:04:50.570> what<00:04:51.570> goes<00:04:51.810> wrong<00:04:52.110> oh

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
which is deceleration what goes wrong oh

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.910 
which is deceleration what goes wrong oh
my<00:04:52.800> gosh<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.730> valve<00:04:53.970> falls<00:04:54.330> apart

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
my gosh the valve falls apart

the pump of the pump can freeze
sometimes<00:04:59.270> we've<00:05:00.270> got<00:05:00.480> all<00:05:00.780> these

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
sometimes we've got all these

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.890 
sometimes we've got all these

possibilities of air leaks this guy

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.260 
possibilities of air leaks this guy
comes<00:05:04.260> loose<00:05:04.590> down<00:05:04.890> here<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.460> can<00:05:05.670> suck<00:05:06.000> air

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
comes loose down here and can suck air

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.440 
comes loose down here and can suck air
in<00:05:06.540> this<00:05:07.380> this<00:05:07.830> can<00:05:08.160> suck<00:05:08.640> air<00:05:08.940> into<00:05:09.360> the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
in this this can suck air into the

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.410 
in this this can suck air into the
intake<00:05:09.830> manifold<00:05:10.830> this<00:05:11.370> hose<00:05:11.640> is<00:05:11.670> usually<00:05:12.390> a

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
intake manifold this hose is usually a

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.880 
intake manifold this hose is usually a
wire<00:05:13.380> supported<00:05:14.150> because<00:05:15.150> it'll<00:05:15.450> it'll<00:05:15.890> draw

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
wire supported because it'll it'll draw

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.040 
wire supported because it'll it'll draw
down<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.760> actually<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:18.300> collapse<00:05:18.660> and

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
down and actually it collapse and

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.820 
down and actually it collapse and
eventually<00:05:19.500> fractures<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.490> hose<00:05:21.650> so<00:05:22.650> there's

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
eventually fractures the hose so there's

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.570 
eventually fractures the hose so there's
a<00:05:22.890> lot<00:05:23.670> of<00:05:23.850> stuff<00:05:24.060> here<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.680> can<00:05:25.680> go<00:05:25.830> bad<00:05:26.070> and

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
a lot of stuff here that can go bad and
