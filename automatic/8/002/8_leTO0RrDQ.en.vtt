little or a lot the more you move the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.140 
little or a lot the more you move the
lever<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.139> faster<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.709> moves<00:02:39.150> sometimes

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
lever the faster it moves sometimes

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.229 
lever the faster it moves sometimes
speed<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.930> not<00:02:41.139> the<00:02:41.379> main<00:02:42.189> objective<00:02:42.819> safety

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
speed is not the main objective safety

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.660 
speed is not the main objective safety
is<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.810> accuracy<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:46.150> us<00:02:47.010> speed<00:02:48.010> comes<00:02:48.400> with

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
is in accuracy so us speed comes with

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.470 
is in accuracy so us speed comes with
experience
