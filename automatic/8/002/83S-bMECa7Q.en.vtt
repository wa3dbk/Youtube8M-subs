00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
why would I bother doing that not like I

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.250 
why would I bother doing that not like I
needed<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.640> use<00:00:29.880> groudon<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.660> battle

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.709 

anyway<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:35.399> his<00:00:35.579> salamence<00:00:36.120> comes<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.540> with

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
anyway so his salamence comes out with

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.569 
anyway so his salamence comes out with
intimidate<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:39.140> it<00:00:40.140> doesn't<00:00:40.500> say<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.800> belly

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
intimidate but it doesn't say that belly

drum<00:00:41.910> boosts<00:00:42.680> attack<00:00:43.940> like<00:00:44.940> six<00:00:45.300> stages<00:00:45.600> it

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
drum boosts attack like six stages it

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.389 
drum boosts attack like six stages it
says<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.039> max<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.800> would

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
says to the max so I think that would

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.000 
says to the max so I think that would
only<00:00:50.489> count<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.210> he<00:00:51.390> intimidated<00:00:51.719> me<00:00:52.140> after<00:00:52.980> I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
only count if he intimidated me after I

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.130 
only count if he intimidated me after I
used<00:00:53.309> belly<00:00:53.579> drum<00:00:53.930> but<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.230> sure<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.680> mean

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
thought without the Sun actually with

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.060 
thought without the Sun actually with
rain<00:04:58.530> it's<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.980> counter<00:05:00.200> it's<00:05:01.200> like<00:05:01.440> lowers<00:05:01.890> it

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
rain it's a counter it's like lowers it

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.200 
rain it's a counter it's like lowers it
even<00:05:02.280> more<00:05:02.490> than<00:05:02.760> just<00:05:02.970> not<00:05:03.120> having<00:05:03.360> son<00:05:03.720> I

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210

substantial<00:05:07.620> damage<00:05:07.980> but<00:05:08.610> maybe<00:05:09.419> he's<00:05:09.690> raised

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
substantial damage but maybe he's raised

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.960 
substantial damage but maybe he's raised
for<00:05:10.200> defense<00:05:10.500> but<00:05:10.740> either<00:05:11.190> way<00:05:11.430> what<00:05:11.730> I<00:05:11.760> should

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
for defense but either way what I should

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.180 
for defense but either way what I should
