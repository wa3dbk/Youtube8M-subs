tinkering around with some you know some
doodads<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:34.370> I<00:00:34.520> came<00:00:35.059> up<00:00:35.210> with<00:00:35.239> the

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
doodads and I came up with the

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.099 
doodads and I came up with the
sculptural

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
sculptural

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.279 
sculptural
thing<00:00:36.949> that<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:38.030> see<00:00:38.210> here<00:00:38.359> in<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.629> show<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:39.140> a

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
thing that you see here in the show in a

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.340 
thing that you see here in the show in a
utopia<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.340> this<00:00:41.000> is<00:00:41.179> the<00:00:41.390> culmination<00:00:41.839> of

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
utopia and this is the culmination of

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.069 
utopia and this is the culmination of
many<00:00:42.620> months<00:00:43.010> of<00:00:43.160> planning<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:44.420> building<00:00:44.660> and

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
many months of planning and building and

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.410 
many months of planning and building and
this<00:00:46.010> is<00:00:46.160> what<00:00:46.309> I<00:00:46.370> come<00:00:46.579> up<00:00:46.760> with<00:00:46.789> and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
this is what I come up with and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.079 
this is what I come up with and
conceptually<00:00:48.170> it's<00:00:48.559> about<00:00:48.829> what<00:00:49.699> happens

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
conceptually it's about what happens

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.450 
conceptually it's about what happens
after<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:50.989> fall<00:00:51.769> of<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.489> man<00:00:53.230> with

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
after the fall of the man with

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.360 
after the fall of the man with
historically<00:00:55.330> what<00:00:55.600> happens<00:00:55.930> next<00:00:56.230> what<00:00:57.010> was

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
historically what happens next what was

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.960 
historically what happens next what was
created<00:00:57.910> with<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.600> rubble<00:00:58.960> of<00:00:59.340> man

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
created with the rubble of man

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.440 
created with the rubble of man
he<00:01:01.440> collapses<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.680> his<00:01:03.100> own<00:01:03.280> follies<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:03.760> Wars

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:04.450 
he collapses to his own follies and Wars

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.260 
he collapses to his own follies and Wars
and<00:01:04.780> battles<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.920> so<00:01:06.160> this<00:01:06.340> is<00:01:06.580> a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
and battles and so this is a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.539 
and battles and so this is a
a<00:01:08.420> reenactment<00:01:09.289> of<00:01:09.500> something<00:01:09.890> potential

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
a reenactment of something potential

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.859 
a reenactment of something potential
that<00:01:10.670> could<00:01:10.850> be<00:01:10.939> built<00:01:11.210> with<00:01:12.079> the<00:01:12.320> remnants<00:01:12.979> of

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
that could be built with the remnants of

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.319 
that could be built with the remnants of
mankind<00:01:14.869> what<00:01:15.079> is<00:01:15.170> left<00:01:15.409> over<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.060> it's<00:01:17.060> more

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
mankind what is left over and it's more

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.600 
mankind what is left over and it's more
about<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:18.439> know<00:01:18.530> what<00:01:19.100> could<00:01:19.280> be<00:01:19.429> in<00:01:19.520> the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
about you know what could be in the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.850 
about you know what could be in the
future

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
future

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.069 
future
bleak<00:01:21.860> as<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:22.039> may<00:01:22.310> be<00:01:22.369> or<00:01:22.789> or<00:01:23.359> just<00:01:23.390> depending
