00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.630
 Automatically translated by the machine. I love bow style hair, but sometimes big 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.119
 Those can be a bit too much to eat! Below is a simple small bow. 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:29.119
 Grab the hair from the top of your head and brush one side. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.870
 This technique is all looping with elastic hair, so you need a pretty 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.920
 One that is flexible. Coal mines can go more than 4 times... so I wrap 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.100
 The bow was started two times before. By pulling the hair, but this time 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 It's only a few inches, so it's a loop. Twisted elasticity, hair pulled through 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:07.039
 Another cycle. Taadaa you have a bow loop. 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 Now they flip, so they are facing the right way. And PIN where they are. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 So more time if you missed it. You should end this kind of thing. 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.970
 The band to be hidden uses flowers or some kind of clip. 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.790
 You can also split the sides like tails with tails, so it's curly. 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.790
 Sweet and cured, but not too much over the top. I hope this is a useful video, please check 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.010
 More information and tutorials describe links to blog posts. 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.720
 Thank you very much for watching. Goodbye!
