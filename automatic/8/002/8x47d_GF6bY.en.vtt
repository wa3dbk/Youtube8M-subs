even though you know this rarely happens

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.710 
even though you know this rarely happens
one<00:04:14.729> thing<00:04:14.879> I<00:04:14.939> would<00:04:15.000> say<00:04:15.120> about<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.599> though

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
one thing I would say about that though

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.710 
one thing I would say about that though
is<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:16.079> seems<00:04:16.380> like<00:04:16.820> only<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:18.269> beam<00:04:18.479> could<00:04:18.630> be

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
is it seems like only that beam could be

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.750 
is it seems like only that beam could be
taken<00:04:19.079> out<00:04:19.169> which<00:04:19.349> I<00:04:19.469> don't<00:04:19.529> like<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.340> know<00:04:20.430> if

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
you look at it got all the red paste all

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.110 
you look at it got all the red paste all
around<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.680> it's<00:04:22.950> like<00:04:23.130> it's<00:04:23.340> it's<00:04:23.669> like<00:04:23.849> only

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
around it it's like it's it's like only

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.460 
around it it's like it's it's like only
that

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
that

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.680 
that
could<00:04:24.650> be<00:04:24.710> taken<00:04:24.980> out<00:04:25.100> where<00:04:25.510> even<00:04:26.510> after

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
could be taken out where even after

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.880 
could be taken out where even after
you'll<00:04:26.930> see<00:04:27.140> it<00:04:27.230> when<00:04:27.320> they<00:04:27.380> move<00:04:27.560> on<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.800> be

is that the start a video but the
destruction<00:04:31.280> just<00:04:31.460> looked<00:04:31.640> like<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.820> kind<00:04:32.030> of

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
destruction just looked like a kind of

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.520 
destruction just looked like a kind of
was<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.300> close<00:04:32.450> quarters<00:04:32.870> from<00:04:32.930> battlefield<00:04:33.350> 3

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
it you know I one I caught me to

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.540 
it you know I one I caught me to
destruction<00:04:36.200> it's<00:04:36.440> still<00:04:36.620> cool<00:04:36.890> you<00:04:37.520> know

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
destruction it's still cool you know

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.680 
destruction it's still cool you know
being<00:04:37.850> able<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:38.030> do<00:04:38.120> that<00:04:38.270> thing<00:04:38.330> but<00:04:38.570> it

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
being able to do that thing but it

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.380 
being able to do that thing but it
seemed<00:04:38.960> like<00:04:39.170> that<00:04:40.040> was<00:04:40.100> a<00:04:40.280> set<00:04:40.670> one<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.000> only

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
seemed like that was a set one I only

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.210 
seemed like that was a set one I only
that<00:04:41.660> pillar<00:04:42.050> could<00:04:42.200> be<00:04:42.260> just<00:04:42.350> destroyed<00:04:43.010> you

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
that pillar could be just destroyed you

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.100 
that pillar could be just destroyed you
know<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.370> didn't<00:04:43.700> feel<00:04:43.880> like<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.900> whole

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
know I didn't feel like the whole

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.690 
know I didn't feel like the whole
environment<00:04:45.440> won't<00:04:45.740> destructible<00:04:46.340> like<00:04:46.520> in

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
environment won't destructible like in

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.730 
environment won't destructible like in
bad<00:04:46.880> company<00:04:47.060> 2<00:04:47.360> but<00:04:47.630> hopefully<00:04:48.230> they'll<00:04:48.380> you

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
bad company 2 but hopefully they'll you

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.200 
bad company 2 but hopefully they'll you
know<00:04:48.770> maybe<00:04:49.310> certain<00:04:49.640> maps<00:04:49.790> have<00:04:50.000> more

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
know maybe certain maps have more

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.430 
know maybe certain maps have more
destruction<00:04:50.510> in<00:04:50.720> orders<00:04:50.990> hopefully<00:04:51.290> doing

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
destruction in orders hopefully doing

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.720 
destruction in orders hopefully doing
something<00:04:51.710> like<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:51.950> yeah<00:04:52.190> like<00:04:52.400> we're<00:04:52.610> not

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
something like that yeah like we're not

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.850 
something like that yeah like we're not
doubting<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.720> destruction<00:04:54.290> of<00:04:54.350> battlefield

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
doubting the destruction of battlefield

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.320 
doubting the destruction of battlefield
4<00:04:55.130> as<00:04:55.250> much<00:04:55.430> as<00:04:55.550> we're<00:04:55.670> just<00:04:55.820> wondering<00:04:56.150> why

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
4 as much as we're just wondering why

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.240 
4 as much as we're just wondering why
they're<00:04:56.600> not<00:04:56.630> showing<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:57.170> off<00:04:57.290> it's<00:04:57.980> really

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
cool to me is that the flag is actually

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.250 
cool to me is that the flag is actually
up<00:05:43.430> there<00:05:43.490> on<00:05:44.060> top<00:05:44.240> of<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.479> skyscraper<00:05:44.720> and

up there on top of the skyscraper and

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.140 
up there on top of the skyscraper and
then<00:05:45.919> when<00:05:46.220> the<00:05:46.340> building<00:05:46.640> gets<00:05:46.760> taken<00:05:47.000> down

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
then when the building gets taken down

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.520 
then when the building gets taken down
you'll<00:05:47.630> actually<00:05:47.810> see<00:05:48.020> at<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.200> very<00:05:48.290> end<00:05:48.440> of
