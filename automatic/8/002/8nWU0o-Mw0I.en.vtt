00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.949 
your boater cannot handle a stab
does<00:02:08.830> that<00:02:08.950> headbutt<00:02:09.340> from<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.580> makini<00:02:09.959> but

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
does that headbutt from the makini but

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.040 
does that headbutt from the makini but
he's<00:02:11.170> also<00:02:11.560> using<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.370> beat<00:02:13.150> great<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.750> Sun

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
he's also using a beat great in the Sun

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.250 
he's also using a beat great in the Sun
so<00:02:14.530> that's<00:02:14.650> more<00:02:14.830> power<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.760> him<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.840> it's<00:02:17.110> not

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
so that's more power to him so it's not

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.290 
so that's more power to him so it's not
really<00:02:17.470> good<00:02:17.620> for<00:02:17.770> me<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.340> I'm<00:02:18.489> faster<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.180> I'm

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
really good for me but I'm faster so I'm

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.890 
really good for me but I'm faster so I'm
