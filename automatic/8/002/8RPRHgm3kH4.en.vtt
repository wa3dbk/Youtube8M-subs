00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
when your timings off if you go right

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.230 
when your timings off if you go right
through<00:00:32.290> that's<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:33.040> contact<00:00:33.700> song<00:00:33.970> you'll

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
through that's the contact song you'll

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.660 
through that's the contact song you'll
still<00:00:34.540> get<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:34.750> good<00:00:34.960> hit<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:36.070> two<00:00:36.250> handers

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
still get a good hit the two handers

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.639 
still get a good hit the two handers
sometimes<00:00:37.030> that<00:00:37.180> right<00:00:37.390> hand<00:00:37.600> pulls<00:00:37.899> so<00:00:38.200> you

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
sometimes that right hand pulls so you

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.950 
sometimes that right hand pulls so you
need<00:00:38.829> something<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.460> push<00:00:39.910> through<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:40.390> shot

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
need something to push through that shot

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.500 
need something to push through that shot
and<00:00:41.260> again<00:00:41.500> I'm<00:00:41.680> not<00:00:41.710> an<00:00:41.980> advocate<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.610> going

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
and again I'm not an advocate of going

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.270 
and again I'm not an advocate of going
through<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.870> ball<00:00:44.050> it's<00:00:44.440> more<00:00:44.890> about<00:00:45.070> getting

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
through the ball it's more about getting

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.189 
through the ball it's more about getting
to<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:45.610> ball<00:00:45.789> and<00:00:45.910> pulling<00:00:46.270> across<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:47.020> ball

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
to the ball and pulling across the ball

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.880 
to the ball and pulling across the ball
but<00:00:47.800> one<00:00:48.280> thing<00:00:48.460> that<00:00:48.640> helps<00:00:48.940> for<00:00:49.090> sure<00:00:49.329> is<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
but one thing that helps for sure is the
