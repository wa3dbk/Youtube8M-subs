00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
pokemon but a game mascot 1000 years ago

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.029 
pokemon but a game mascot 1000 years ago
i<00:02:04.090> absorbed<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.869> life<00:02:05.079> energy<00:02:05.289> of<00:02:05.590> every

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
i absorbed the life energy of every

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.520 
i absorbed the life energy of every
living<00:02:06.369> thing<00:02:06.869> withdrawing<00:02:07.869> into<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.289> cocoon
