flowers<00:00:10.219> to<00:00:10.490> paper<00:00:10.990> now<00:00:12.159> quilling<00:00:13.159> flowers

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:13.669 
flowers to paper now quilling flowers

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.470 
flowers to paper now quilling flowers
are<00:00:14.289> flowers<00:00:15.289> that<00:00:15.650> are<00:00:16.100> made<00:00:16.340> of<00:00:16.640> long<00:00:16.940> strips

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
are flowers that are made of long strips

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.400 
are flowers that are made of long strips
of<00:00:17.690> paper<00:00:17.950> that<00:00:18.950> are<00:00:19.630> rolled<00:00:20.630> into<00:00:20.930> spirals

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
of paper that are rolled into spirals

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.790 
of paper that are rolled into spirals
and<00:00:21.860> glued<00:00:22.160> together<00:00:22.370> and<00:00:23.200> it's<00:00:24.200> a<00:00:24.290> very<00:00:24.500> fun

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
and glued together and it's a very fun

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.710 
and glued together and it's a very fun
technique<00:00:25.280> but<00:00:25.640> I'm<00:00:25.850> not<00:00:26.060> going<00:00:26.270> to<00:00:26.330> get<00:00:26.450> into

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
technique but I'm not going to get into

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.050 
technique but I'm not going to get into
making<00:00:27.530> the<00:00:27.770> flowers<00:00:28.190> right<00:00:28.460> now

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
making the flowers right now

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.950 
making the flowers right now
a<00:00:29.830> whole<00:00:30.830> tricky<00:00:31.370> part<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.880> quilling<00:00:32.780> is

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
a whole tricky part of quilling is

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.890 
a whole tricky part of quilling is
trying<00:00:33.560> to<00:00:33.800> attach<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.490> to<00:00:34.520> things<00:00:35.030> because<00:00:35.480> it

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
trying to attach it to things because it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.800 
trying to attach it to things because it
is<00:00:36.860> a<00:00:36.890> very<00:00:37.190> lacy<00:00:37.579> kind<00:00:38.090> of<00:00:38.210> look<00:00:38.480> you<00:00:38.690> don't

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
is a very lacy kind of look you don't

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.340 
is a very lacy kind of look you don't
want<00:00:39.020> lots<00:00:39.200> of<00:00:39.320> gloppy<00:00:39.739> glue<00:00:40.310> underneath<00:00:41.350> so

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
want lots of gloppy glue underneath so

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.590 
want lots of gloppy glue underneath so
what<00:00:43.340> I'm<00:00:43.460> going<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.700> do<00:00:43.940> is<00:00:44.239> I'm<00:00:44.390> going<00:00:44.510> to

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.250 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
squeeze<00:00:45.050> out<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.770> little<00:00:46.760> glue<00:00:47.750> now<00:00:47.989> you<00:00:48.079> want

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
squeeze out a little glue now you want

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.440 
squeeze out a little glue now you want
to<00:00:48.350> use<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.560> glue<00:00:48.860> that<00:00:49.040> dries<00:00:49.220> clear<00:00:49.730> because

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
to use a glue that dries clear because

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.560 
to use a glue that dries clear because
no<00:00:50.630> matter<00:00:50.780> how<00:00:50.899> careful<00:00:51.649> you<00:00:51.920> try<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:52.360> do<00:00:53.360> this

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
no matter how careful you try to do this

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.430 
no matter how careful you try to do this
technique<00:00:54.399> how<00:00:55.399> carefully<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:56.239> do<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.989> you're

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
technique how carefully you do it you're

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.020 
technique how carefully you do it you're
probably<00:00:57.920> still<00:00:58.370> going<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:58.640> have<00:00:58.730> a<00:00:58.760> little

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
probably still going to have a little

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.810 
probably still going to have a little
glue<00:00:59.270> showing<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.020> you<00:01:00.110> want<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.980> use

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
glue showing so you want to use

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.060 
glue showing so you want to use
something<00:01:02.090> that's<00:01:02.270> going<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.690> dry<00:01:02.899> clear<00:01:03.410> now

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
something that's going to dry clear now

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.310 
something that's going to dry clear now
I<00:01:04.100> squeezed<00:01:04.549> a<00:01:04.760> little<00:01:05.030> glue<00:01:05.449> onto<00:01:05.930> this<00:01:06.049> paper

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
I squeezed a little glue onto this paper

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.500 
I squeezed a little glue onto this paper
I'm<00:01:06.590> going<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.830> spread<00:01:07.159> it<00:01:07.220> out<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.700> has<00:01:07.729> this

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
I'm going to spread it out it has this

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.990 
I'm going to spread it out it has this
little<00:01:08.810> applicator<00:01:09.350> built<00:01:09.770> on<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.520> spread<00:01:10.820> out

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
little applicator built on to spread out

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.180 
little applicator built on to spread out
the<00:01:11.150> glue<00:01:11.360> which<00:01:11.510> is<00:01:11.540> very<00:01:11.840> handy<00:01:12.080> if<00:01:12.470> you

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
the glue which is very handy if you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.160 
the glue which is very handy if you
don't<00:01:13.460> have<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.240> can<00:01:14.270> just<00:01:14.450> use<00:01:14.960> a

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
don't have that you can just use a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.490 
don't have that you can just use a
toothpick<00:01:15.799> or<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.400> plastic<00:01:16.729> straw<00:01:17.500> something

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
toothpick or a plastic straw something

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.280 
toothpick or a plastic straw something
that<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:18.680> don't<00:01:18.860> mind<00:01:19.010> throwing<00:01:19.460> out<00:01:20.290> is

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
that you don't mind throwing out is

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.100 
that you don't mind throwing out is

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
going to get covered with glue and you

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.430 
going to get covered with glue and you
just<00:01:24.260> kind<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.530> spread<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:24.890> out<00:01:26.440> somewhat

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
just kind of spread it out somewhat

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.940 
just kind of spread it out somewhat
evenly<00:01:29.770> then<00:01:30.770> you're<00:01:31.549> going<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.090> take<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.950> pair

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
evenly then you're going to take a pair

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.080 
evenly then you're going to take a pair
of<00:01:33.979> tweezers<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:36.250> get<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.280> hold<00:01:37.580> of<00:01:37.820> your

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090

slide<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.479> around<00:01:47.750> too<00:01:48.110> much<00:01:48.259> because<00:01:48.320> you

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
slide it around too much because you

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.649 
slide it around too much because you
don't<00:01:48.650> want<00:01:48.979> glue<00:01:49.570> glopping<00:01:50.570> up<00:01:51.310> into<00:01:52.659> the

don't want glue glopping up into the
delicate<00:01:54.229> parts<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.070> flower<00:01:55.840> you're<00:01:56.840> just

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
delicate parts of the flower you're just

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.260 
delicate parts of the flower you're just
going<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.259> press<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.979> gently<00:01:58.220> then<00:01:59.090> you're

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
going to press it gently then you're

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.569 
going to press it gently then you're
going<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.450> take<00:01:59.750> your<00:01:59.930> tweezers<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.740> gently

lift<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.210> up<00:02:03.970> quilling<00:02:04.970> flowers<00:02:05.420> are<00:02:05.659> very

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
lift it up quilling flowers are very

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.139 
lift it up quilling flowers are very
delicate<00:02:06.500> so<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:06.710> have<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.189> be<00:02:07.340> gentle<00:02:07.610> then

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
delicate so you have to be gentle then

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.330 
delicate so you have to be gentle then
you're<00:02:08.270> going<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.599> place<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:08.959> very<00:02:09.649> carefully

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
you're going to place it very carefully

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.729 
you're going to place it very carefully
on<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:11.030> paper<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:11.660> don't<00:02:12.260> want<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.500> slide<00:02:12.680> it

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
on the paper you don't want to slide it

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:13.550 
on the paper you don't want to slide it
around

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
around

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.990 
around
then<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.099> will<00:02:14.220> defeat<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.640> entire<00:02:14.790> purpose

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
then that will defeat the entire purpose

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.670 
then that will defeat the entire purpose
of<00:02:17.150> doing<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.569> way<00:02:18.840> because<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.500> don't

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
of doing it this way because you don't
