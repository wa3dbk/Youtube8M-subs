00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.450
 and not 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.480
 Hi, the first thing you're going to do is 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.510
 open your compass to 7 centimeters and go 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.420
 to make a wheel on the white cardboard 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.370
 and then open the ones at 5 centimeters and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.430
 it is another circle also in the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.620
 white cardboard and then cut that 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.440
 you have to have something like this now 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.540
 on the other card of another color we go 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.430
 also open our compass at 5 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.040
 centimeters and let's make a circle 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.040
 which is also going to be cut 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.750
 then you have to fold it by the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.440
 half helping you with your rule and 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.440
 cut it out 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.470
 this will be the cap of our doll 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.950
 snow which we will glue with 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.950
 low 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.550
 after paying the smallest one ball 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.770
 if you have left over we are going to 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:35.730
 cut them and now we're going to paste the two 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.670
 parts or the two wheels for that we're going to 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.160
 paste a little on top and what 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.600
 let's join with the ball below now 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.930
 to make the envelope we are going to make a 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.640
 rectangle of 23 x 11 centimeters and what 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.400
 let's cut now that you have 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.430
 let's make marks at 2 and 9 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.380
 centimeters both above and below 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.870
 the narrowest part and we're going to 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.330
 trace with a line and then shape 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.940
 horizontal let's make marks at 3 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.890
 and at 13 centimeters too much 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.030
 up and down and we're also going to 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.030
 join with a straight line 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.800
 Y 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.110
 and now that you have something like that, we're going to 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.150
 cut out these parts here that will be 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.960
 which we will not need to put together 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.960
 our envelope 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.910
 and 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.540
 now just cut in shape these 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.330
 parts of here that are tabs with something 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.100
 round tip we will help and 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.190
 let's mark all the folds for 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.770
 be able to bend more easily we bend and 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.220
 we stick the two tabs to form the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.220
 on 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.030
 why 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.700
 and now that we have it, we are going to paste it in 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.830
 all the center of our bull what if 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.630
 the body of our doll now 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.239
 we are simply going to make the decoration 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.239
 that you want for that I'm going to put a 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.099
 little red edge in the color in the 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.140
 my doll's cap so it does not look 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.069
 as simple but you can 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.069
 decorate to your liking 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.710
 ah 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.379
 meanwhile I will send a greeting to 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.989

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.510

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.319
 for the scarf simply use 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.140
 cloth tape for which I folded it 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.580
 in half since it was like very thick 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.130
 but simply if you want you can 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.850
 do it also with paper or using 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.120
 a piece of common cloth and well that's it 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.850
 like the whole circle and at the end 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.920
 do you like a knot 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.690
 and simply if you want you can tell 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.690
 sticking with hot silicone 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.940
