00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the foundation so I'm going to use a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.270 
the foundation so I'm going to use a
tiny<00:02:34.690> bit<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.050> triangular<00:02:35.620> piece<00:02:35.860> of<00:02:36.040> paper

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
tiny bit of triangular piece of paper

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.820 
tiny bit of triangular piece of paper
and<00:02:37.209> hold<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.630> there<00:02:37.660> with<00:02:37.930> my<00:02:38.050> fingers<00:02:38.560> and

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
and hold it there with my fingers and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.470

just work into the eye and into the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.180 
just work into the eye and into the
crease<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:49.840> me<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.019> think<00:02:50.319> adding<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.709> wing<00:02:50.920> is

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
crease for me I think adding a wing is

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.740 
crease for me I think adding a wing is
great<00:02:51.459> because<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.819> have<00:02:51.940> such<00:02:52.150> around<00:02:52.450> big

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
great because I have such around big

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.080 
great because I have such around big
eyes<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.349> sometimes<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.400> really<00:02:54.580> like<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.940> play

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
eyes and sometimes I really like to play

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.070 
eyes and sometimes I really like to play
up<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.480> cat<00:02:55.690> eye

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
up a cat eye

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.600 
up a cat eye
well<00:02:56.379> some<00:02:56.590> people<00:02:56.950> struggle<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.430> it

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
well some people struggle with it

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.229 
well some people struggle with it
because<00:02:57.700> they<00:02:57.879> can't<00:02:58.150> get<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:59.440> know<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.799> wing

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
because they can't get you know the wing

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.000 
because they can't get you know the wing
as<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:01.450> can<00:03:01.629> see<00:03:01.840> there<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.349> get<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.739> line

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
as you can see there you get that line

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.559 
as you can see there you get that line
and<00:03:03.250> then<00:03:03.370> what<00:03:03.610> we<00:03:03.730> do<00:03:03.879> is<00:03:03.909> blend<00:03:04.269> it

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
and then what we do is blend it

and then what we do is blend it
afterwards<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:07.150> with<00:03:07.329> the<00:03:07.480> brush<00:03:07.750> just

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
afterwards so just with the brush just

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.440 
afterwards so just with the brush just
keep<00:03:08.319> blending<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.980> shadow<00:03:09.280> into<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.819> lid

starlet I'm going to use more of the
lighter<00:04:14.099> side<00:04:14.810> because<00:04:15.810> Lindsey's<00:04:16.259> skin<00:04:16.560> is

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
lighter side because Lindsey's skin is

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.400 
lighter side because Lindsey's skin is
fairer<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:20.209> I'm<00:04:21.209> using<00:04:21.449> this<00:04:21.690> thicker<00:04:22.079> brush

fairer and I'm using this thicker brush

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.320 
fairer and I'm using this thicker brush
because<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:22.860> really<00:04:23.220> gives<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.520> nice<00:04:23.729> buff<00:04:24.120> on

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
because it really gives a nice buff on

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.300 
because it really gives a nice buff on
the<00:04:24.449> skin<00:04:24.780> when<00:04:25.289> you're<00:04:25.410> applying<00:04:25.740> blush

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
the skin when you're applying blush

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.980 
the skin when you're applying blush
where<00:04:26.729> is<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:27.000> correct<00:04:27.300> placement<00:04:27.570> cuz

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
where is the correct placement cuz

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.570 
where is the correct placement cuz
sometimes<00:04:28.169> I<00:04:28.470> feel<00:04:28.680> like<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:28.949> might<00:04:29.130> put<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.400> too

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
sometimes I feel like I might put it too

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.270 
sometimes I feel like I might put it too
