on<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.160> controller<00:00:14.519> itself<00:00:14.870> we<00:00:15.870> have

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
on the controller itself we have

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.609 
on the controller itself we have
installed<00:00:16.980> two<00:00:17.310> new<00:00:17.490> buttons<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.060> back<00:00:18.619> on

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
installed two new buttons in the back on

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.960

the left hand right hand side those are

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.700 
the left hand right hand side those are
to<00:00:21.180> control<00:00:21.630> their<00:00:21.810> rapid<00:00:22.140> fire<00:00:22.320> mode<00:00:22.529> here

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
to control their rapid fire mode here

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.340 
to control their rapid fire mode here
and<00:00:23.070> also<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.430> switch<00:00:23.760> between<00:00:24.019> modes<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and also to switch between modes and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.070

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
all you need to control your controller

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.859 
all you need to control your controller
ones<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.549> play<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.600> little<00:01:18.630> bit

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
ones you play with it a little bit

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
ones you play with it a little bit
you're<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.439> used<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> Isaac<00:01:20.759> is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you're going to get used to it Isaac is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.460 
you're going to get used to it Isaac is
going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> show<00:01:21.240> us<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.049> controller

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
going to show us how this controller

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.560 
going to show us how this controller
works<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.890> code<00:01:23.070> 35<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.820> design<00:01:24.180> mode<00:01:24.390> 3

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
works for code 35 we have design mode 3

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.350 
works for code 35 we have design mode 3
and<00:01:24.780> 4<00:01:24.990> specifically<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:26.430> call<00:01:26.670> duty<00:01:26.909> clattuc

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
and 4 specifically for call duty clattuc

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
and 4 specifically for call duty clattuc
as<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.990> has<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> patch<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.470> control<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.040> speed

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
as it has a patch that control the speed

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.819 
as it has a patch that control the speed
of<00:01:29.460> fire<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.329> still<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:31.140> were<00:01:31.259> able<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.560> beat

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
of fire but still we were able to beat

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.050 
of fire but still we were able to beat
it<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.939> use<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.780> win<00:01:34.049> every<00:01:34.290> time

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
it and you can use it to win every time

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.940 
it and you can use it to win every time
Isaac<00:01:36.060> show<00:01:36.570> us<00:01:36.720> how<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> works<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.680> call<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
Isaac show us how it works on call of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.440 
Isaac show us how it works on call of
duty<00:01:38.159> 5<00:01:38.400> ok<00:01:39.439> so<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.860> see<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.460> rapid<00:01:42.240> fire

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
duty 5 ok so as you see the rapid fire

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.100 
duty 5 ok so as you see the rapid fire
is<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:42.990> off<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:44.420> just<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.780> couple<00:01:45.930> times

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
is now off I just do it a couple times

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.679 
is now off I just do it a couple times
and<00:01:46.979> set<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.119> m1<00:01:48.920> carbine<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.689> turned

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and set this is the m1 carbine I turned
