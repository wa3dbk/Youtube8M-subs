00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
decent damage on those elementals but I

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.180 
decent damage on those elementals but I
recently<00:02:17.600> found<00:02:18.020> out<00:02:18.260> by<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> nice<00:02:18.800> player<00:02:19.160> I

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
recently found out by a nice player I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.850 
recently found out by a nice player I
met<00:02:19.520> on<00:02:19.700> in<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.090> game<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:20.570> there's<00:02:21.500> actually

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
met on in the game that there's actually

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.360 
met on in the game that there's actually
a<00:02:21.980> better<00:02:22.370> combination<00:02:22.930> for<00:02:23.930> damage<00:02:24.370> believe

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
a better combination for damage believe

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.360 
a better combination for damage believe
it<00:02:25.490> or<00:02:25.580> not<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.440> one<00:02:27.680> hand<00:02:27.950> it's<00:02:28.100> old

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
it or not it is the one hand it's old

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.070 
it or not it is the one hand it's old
and<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:29.090> torch<00:02:30.430> why<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.490> see<00:02:31.840> well<00:02:32.840> let's

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
and the torch why you see well let's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.860 
and the torch why you see well let's
demonstrate<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.830> basic<00:02:36.830> attacks<00:02:37.690> not<00:02:38.690> much

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
demonstrate so basic attacks not much

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.210 
demonstrate so basic attacks not much
damage<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:39.709> look<00:02:40.400> at<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.610> fifth<00:02:40.910> skill<00:02:41.330> and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
damage but look at the fifth skill and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.460 
damage but look at the fifth skill and
look<00:02:43.220> at<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> damage

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
look at the damage

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.680 
look at the damage
you<00:02:46.470> get<00:02:46.950> quite<00:02:47.909> a<00:02:47.940> lot<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.420> damage<00:02:50.420> okay<00:02:51.420> let's

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
you get quite a lot of damage okay let's

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.309 
you get quite a lot of damage okay let's
finish<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.019> off<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:53.700> elemental<00:02:54.269> but<00:02:55.049> that's

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
finish it off this elemental but that's

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.420 
finish it off this elemental but that's
not<00:02:55.530> basically<00:02:56.129> why<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.090> damage<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.629> better

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
not basically why the damage is better
