 maisonette hiking enthusiasts 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.500
 but also john and they know them very well 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.380
 their regulars are often tormented 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.969
 from insects like it wants to sing being 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.029
 points from which if not a big problem 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.100
 it's a little annoying if everything comes and you can 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.320
 limit it much better 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.779
 I can put the only one back in one 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.240
 of the two lengths may not be effective 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.699
 I invariably come luca so maybe 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 the need for something stronger it 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.790
 I have to admit I'm a skeptical mercier 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.649
 natural remedies 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.270
 I can't find everything if they work very well 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.040
 I hope to help you with a remedy that I have 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.700
 found it was during my childhood 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.980
 in malaysia but i found out that the plant 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.469
 what I need is between 4 thousand 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.829
 900 species inside Cornwall 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.570
 of the eden klose to the advance call for 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.360
 a piece of copied and malaysia 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.559
 glued in the middle of the cornwall 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.199
 municipal lemongrass each of these 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.969
 beautiful looking plants that each one 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.519
 of them will have a different use 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.350
 you could recognize the plant that you are 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.510
 serves for my remedy but you could 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.640
 having already tasted it in a curry is the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.409
 citronella 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 if you have ever torn a birthmark or 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.820
 also touched on lemongrass thieves 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.950
 lemon dance and fills the air the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.350
 Lemongrass is much more than an ingredient 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.790
 green areas of the Thai curry 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 used all over the world than one 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.750
 multitude of medicinal reasons rita 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.670
 toothbrush and toothpaste 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.130
 imposed as a port to kill and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.380
 remove the mosquitoes what you need 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.420
 massage it on the skin 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.369
 essential oils come out of the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.020
 square and you will have authors of milito al 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.619
 lemon but what could be better 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.270
 eye kisses me my deckchair at 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.299
 Lemongrass contains an essential oil 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.920
 which is a mixture of active ingredients 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.009
 including the central and the site in the oil 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.119
 when applied to the skin 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.710
 removes and kills insects 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.710
 so it protects me from cultures 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.210
 and is perfect for giving us inspiration but 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.680
 it is not necessary to have a huge saddle 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.240
 to grow citronella 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.429
 no need to go into 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.780
 herbal medicine to buy the plant if 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.459
 you don't have a mind set on 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.260
 supermarket and put them in a 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.270
 glass of water like this in a pair 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.640
 of weeks this young man will pull 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.340
 outside the roots and sprouts and will end with the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.190
 become so then you have to plant it and 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.660
 puts the abbreviation boasts of the window 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.790
 in summer you can also keep it out in 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.410
 a vase as a canvas in a flower bed up to 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.810
 when the cold of winter does not come 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.970
 bring it inside you know that you have it 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.739
 grown or bought at the supermarket 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.300
 the citronella is perfect for the 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.190
 insect control 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.190
 you have to take a complaint like this 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.290
 to hit him barry so if he vergeat e 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.450
 in hot water he sees a repellent 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.400
 instant than the bugs you can 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.080
 brush them on but if you want 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.700
 something more modern I am going to 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.530
 turn it into a strike 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.910
 if you can hold and carry 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.910
 always with you we understood 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.000
 start with the cut like stems of 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.010
 lemongrass drive busted just 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.810
 start cutting them you can hear 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.370
 the smell of lemon peel almost is 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.930
 permit 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.750
 these are the scents that people don't like 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.940
 insects in particular silt mosquitoes 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.799
 Swiss I want to shoot down the insects 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.049
 for this I add another ingredient 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.129
 that do not support carnations 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.200
 put in the 4 teaspoons think 300 ml 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.269
 of sunflower oil which is perfect for 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.670
 extract active ingredients and dates 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:41.900
 a nice smoothie other palaces looks like 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.900
 we're done 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.769
 to be honest you will have some sort of 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.810
 pool villa fibrous looking for 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:53.519
 nothing promising where I promise that 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.890
 they will change 26 that we have the mixture 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.359
 in a glass bowl covered so 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.970
 that the best parts of the plants 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.920
 they are released in the oil after having it 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.980
 boiled for an hour on a low heat 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.810
 you can get rid of the sense bottle 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.579
 cold the fun part 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.730
 look here the best is always the 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.730
 life 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.200
 for its appearance it is as it should 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.820
 be her smell fresh and lemon 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.680
 the only ones not appreciated will be the 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.520
 insects the same my strike will last 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 one year 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.060
 just remember to keep it in a 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.920
 cool and dry hikers 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.960
 they tested my spray during one 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.700
 capatina in the country therefore will have 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.860
 kept insects at bay 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.570
 I was expecting a couple of sculptures today 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.560
 I had one so maybe it has 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.450
 worked 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.280
 this his arm but usually the 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.320
 bites are more and are much more than 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.390
 years so I firmly believe that there is 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.280
 been a friend I haven't been stung 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.870
 by no means some people of the 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.150
 group yes then some hikers 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.250
 they thought they should use 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.200
 also the repellent for them follows 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.990
 I don't like using artificial lav 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.200
 contains are facts that I will prove it 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.200
 certainly 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.870
 our hikers gave 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.240
 different opinions than obviously remedies 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.160
 natural do not give guarantees but also 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.410
 can work that work for 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.350
 some of us so why not try 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.060
 but I am an ethnobotanist, not a doctor 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.340
 these remedies may work 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.840
 really for you but it's always important 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.630
 to ask for a medical diagnosis 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.340
 professional before starting one 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.050
 once you know what the problem is 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.389
 try my animals but if so 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.700
 have been winning so too 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.740
 under verified medicinal treatment 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.720
 and always with a doctor or pharmacist who 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.990
 any new treatment goes well 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.990
 for you
