00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
here is take out this ten millimeter

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.520 
here is take out this ten millimeter
bolt<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.550> 10<00:01:02.820> millimeter<00:01:03.300> bolt<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:04.290> is

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
bolt and that 10 millimeter bolt this is

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
bolt and that 10 millimeter bolt this is
this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> brake<00:01:05.430> guv<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.750> brakes<00:01:06.990> they're

where it lines up with this now one

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.860 
where it lines up with this now one
thing<00:02:37.290> when<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.470> jacked<00:02:37.800> up<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.100> noticed<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
thing when I jacked up I noticed the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.860 
thing when I jacked up I noticed the
swing<00:02:40.140> arm<00:02:40.320> here<00:02:40.680> are<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.790> driver's<00:02:42.210> side<00:02:42.390> it

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
tended to go toward the back of the car

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.050 
tended to go toward the back of the car
so<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.390> had<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.750> put<00:02:45.960> my<00:02:46.110> foot<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:47.190> against<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.940> as

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
so I had to put my foot up against it as

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.080 
so I had to put my foot up against it as
I<00:02:48.210> jacked<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.630> up<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:50.310> get<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.670> line<00:02:50.820> up<00:02:51.060> to

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
I jacked it up to get it to line up to

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.290 
I jacked it up to get it to line up to
the<00:02:51.270> holes<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:52.530> passenger<00:02:53.100> side<00:02:53.310> was<00:02:54.090> going

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
the holes the passenger side was going

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.000 
the holes the passenger side was going
to<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.600> front<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.170> had<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> hook<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> little

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
to the front so I had a hook a little

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.340 
to the front so I had a hook a little
rope<00:02:56.190> on<00:02:56.400> here<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:56.930> pull<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.200> Rope

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
as we jacked it up to get it to line up

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.240 
as we jacked it up to get it to line up
but<00:03:00.330> that's<00:03:00.570> basically<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.200> put<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> bolt

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
bottom of that knuckle and just put a

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.759 
bottom of that knuckle and just put a
little<00:03:47.100> little<00:03:47.610> slow<00:03:48.000> push<00:03:48.360> on<00:03:48.600> it<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.930> then

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
little little slow push on it and then

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.250 
little little slow push on it and then
this<00:03:49.980> bolt<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.640> on<00:03:51.360> top<00:03:51.780> will<00:03:52.019> pull<00:03:52.230> right

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
this bolt here on top will pull right

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.330 
this bolt here on top will pull right
out<00:03:52.519> once<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.700> pulls<00:03:53.850> out<00:03:54.769> this<00:03:55.769> just<00:03:56.070> comes

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.840 
out once it pulls out this just comes
down<00:03:57.080> because<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.500> bottom<00:03:58.920> one<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> bit

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850
