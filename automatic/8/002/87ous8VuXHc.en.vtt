00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
about an hour to come up with a concept

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.270 
about an hour to come up with a concept
and<00:01:33.630> then<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.440> only<00:01:34.590> took<00:01:34.770> us<00:01:34.830> about<00:01:35.010> three<00:01:35.070> or

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and then it only took us about three or

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.550 
and then it only took us about three or
four<00:01:35.369> hours<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.760> shoot<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.750> when<00:01:37.500> I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
four hours to shoot it and then when I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.050 
four hours to shoot it and then when I
got<00:01:37.680> back<00:01:37.830> here<00:01:38.160> it<00:01:38.280> took<00:01:38.430> me<00:01:38.640> about<00:01:38.759> five

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
got back here it took me about five

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.760

knowing that we had only one day to do
it<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.650> was<00:01:46.710> crazy<00:01:47.369> what<00:01:47.550> you<00:01:47.610> could<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.850> in

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
it and it was crazy what you could do in

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.410 
it and it was crazy what you could do in
a<00:01:48.330> day<00:01:48.860> you're<00:01:49.860> watching<00:01:50.009> $99<00:01:50.789> music<00:01:51.149> videos

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
done so far I think this is broken so

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.950 
done so far I think this is broken so
far<00:01:56.429> everything<00:01:56.910> has<00:01:56.940> come<00:01:57.179> out<00:01:57.330> better<00:01:57.660> than
