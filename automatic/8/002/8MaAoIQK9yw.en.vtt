00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
guys probably already know this but

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
guys probably already know this but
there<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.040> three<00:00:38.430> separate<00:00:39.030> auction<00:00:39.540> houses

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
there are three separate auction houses

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.560 
there are three separate auction houses
now<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:41.280> you're<00:00:41.640> an<00:00:41.700> auction<00:00:42.149> house<00:00:42.270> one

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.970 
now so if you're an auction house one
you<00:00:42.750> won't<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:43.020> able<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> see<00:00:43.469> any<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you won't be able to see any of the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.639 
you won't be able to see any of the
cards<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.460> auction<00:00:44.940> house<00:00:45.090> two<00:00:45.480> or<00:00:45.719> three<00:00:45.750> vice

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
cards in auction house two or three vice

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.119 
cards in auction house two or three vice
versa<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.670> way<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> line<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:49.129> they

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
versa all the way down the line and they

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.180 
versa all the way down the line and they
probably<00:00:50.309> did<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.660> prevent

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
probably did this to prevent

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.709 
probably did this to prevent
transferring<00:00:53.190> yourself<00:00:53.520> coins<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
transferring yourself coins all that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.270 
transferring yourself coins all that
good<00:00:54.899> stuff<00:00:54.930> because<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:55.530> started<00:00:55.920> limiting

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
good stuff because they started limiting

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.889 
good stuff because they started limiting
the<00:00:56.489> amount<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.730> gifts<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.210> could<00:00:57.329> give<00:00:57.570> to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the amount of gifts you could give to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.310 
the amount of gifts you could give to
one<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.399> previous<00:00:59.820> season<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.110> believe

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
one in the previous season so I believe

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.490 
one in the previous season so I believe
they're<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.949> down<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.190> line<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
they're just going down the line and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.329 
they're just going down the line and

I<00:02:11.819> don't<00:02:12.819> know<00:02:12.910> what<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.740> it's<00:02:14.740> kind<00:02:15.069> of

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
I don't know what it is it's kind of

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.550 
I don't know what it is it's kind of
ridiculous<00:02:15.300> well<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.480> for<00:02:16.870> starters<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:17.410> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
ridiculous well it for starters it's the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.690 
ridiculous well it for starters it's the
beginning<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> game<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.370> there's<00:02:18.520> not

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
beginning of the game so there's not

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.090 
beginning of the game so there's not
that<00:02:18.730> many<00:02:18.910> elites<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.840> begin<00:02:20.200> with<00:02:20.410> but

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
that many elites to begin with but

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.980 
that many elites to begin with but
because<00:02:21.550> there's<00:02:21.730> also<00:02:21.940> three<00:02:22.390> auction

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
because there's also three auction

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.540 
because there's also three auction
houses<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:25.180> spreads<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.900> already<00:02:26.550> little

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
houses it spreads the already little

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.630 
houses it spreads the already little
supply<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:28.000> elites<00:02:28.300> even<00:02:28.720> thinner<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.800> it's

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
supply of elites even thinner so it's

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.059 
supply of elites even thinner so it's
like<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:31.030> bunch<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.420> competition<00:02:32.080> just<00:02:32.560> for<00:02:32.830> one

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
like a bunch of competition just for one

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.740 
like a bunch of competition just for one
card<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:36.100> just<00:02:36.459> it's<00:02:36.790> just<00:02:36.970> ridiculous

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
card and it's just it's just ridiculous

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.630 
card and it's just it's just ridiculous
you're<00:02:38.020> seeing<00:02:38.260> one<00:02:38.440> card<00:02:38.770> every<00:02:39.130> 10<00:02:39.430> minutes

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
you're seeing one card every 10 minutes

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.150 
you're seeing one card every 10 minutes
not<00:02:40.030> even<00:02:40.060> every<00:02:40.450> five<00:02:40.720> minutes<00:02:40.989> it's<00:02:41.709> crazy

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
not even every five minutes it's crazy

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.009 
not even every five minutes it's crazy
so<00:02:42.970> we'll<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.180> have<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.510> wait<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.690> see<00:02:43.870> how

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
so we'll just have to wait and see how

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.160 
so we'll just have to wait and see how

now<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.060> found<00:04:59.360> out<00:04:59.480> some<00:04:59.600> more<00:04:59.720> information

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
now I found out some more information

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.410 
now I found out some more information
about<00:05:00.350> force<00:05:00.770> closing<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.550> believe<00:05:02.120> if<00:05:02.270> you

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
about force closing I believe if you

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.420 
about force closing I believe if you
attempt<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:02.930> your<00:05:03.050> whole<00:05:03.230> Drive<00:05:03.590> just<00:05:03.950> ends

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
attempt it your whole Drive just ends

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.120 
attempt it your whole Drive just ends
end<00:05:04.640> in<00:05:05.420> the<00:05:05.570> after-action<00:05:06.200> report<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:06.950> just

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
end in the after-action report it just

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.190 
end in the after-action report it just
shows<00:05:07.310> it<00:05:07.490> as<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.640> turnover<00:05:08.360> so<00:05:08.900> I<00:05:08.930> believe

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
shows it as a turnover so I believe

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.750 
shows it as a turnover so I believe
that's<00:05:09.620> going<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:09.920> stop<00:05:10.130> force<00:05:10.400> closing

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
that's going to stop force closing

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.840 
that's going to stop force closing
altogether<00:05:11.210> which<00:05:11.450> is<00:05:11.630> great<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:13.490> forgot

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
altogether which is great and I forgot

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.460 
altogether which is great and I forgot
to<00:05:14.000> mention<00:05:14.390> that<00:05:14.420> you<00:05:15.020> don't<00:05:15.200> have<00:05:15.350> to

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470
