we're going to go through here and check

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.220 
we're going to go through here and check
a<00:00:13.920> couple<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.370> options<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.969> notice<00:00:15.780> where

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
a couple of options and notice where

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.320 
a couple of options and notice where
what<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.680> checked<00:00:16.980> here<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.820> zoom<00:00:18.150> with

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
what I have checked here the zoom with

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.240 
what I have checked here the zoom with
scroll<00:00:18.600> wheel<00:00:18.810> zoom<00:00:19.350> clicked<00:00:19.710> point<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
scroll wheel zoom clicked point to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.240 
scroll wheel zoom clicked point to
Center<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.300> those<00:00:21.510> two<00:00:21.720> checked<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
Center I have those two checked and the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.490 
Center I have those two checked and the
image<00:00:23.430> interpolation<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.630> always<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.410> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
image interpolation I always have that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.009 
image interpolation I always have that
set<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.010> bicubic<00:00:26.519> sharper<00:00:26.779> best<00:00:27.779> for

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
set to bicubic sharper best for

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.130 
set to bicubic sharper best for
reduction<00:00:28.529> because<00:00:29.330> what<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.359> option<00:00:30.900> does

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
reduction because what that option does

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.650 
reduction because what that option does
is<00:00:31.470> basically<00:00:31.890> if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.369> crop<00:00:32.850> your<00:00:33.059> image<00:00:33.120> or

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
is basically if you crop your image or

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.870 
is basically if you crop your image or
you<00:00:34.050> resize<00:00:34.829> your<00:00:34.860> image<00:00:35.309> where<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.520> save<00:00:35.730> it

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
you resize your image where you save it

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.900 
you resize your image where you save it
for<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.059> web<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.480> smaller<00:00:36.750> size<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
for the web at a smaller size the the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.389 
for the web at a smaller size the the
interpolation<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.960> basically<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> algorithm

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
interpolation is basically the algorithm

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.000 
interpolation is basically the algorithm
that<00:00:41.489> Photoshop<00:00:41.969> uses<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.809> resize<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.530> photo

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that Photoshop uses to resize your photo

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.529 
that Photoshop uses to resize your photo
and<00:00:44.280> that's<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> reasons<00:00:45.420> why

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and that's one of the reasons why

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.750 
and that's one of the reasons why
Photoshop<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.320> powerful<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.670> you're

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
Photoshop is so powerful so if you're

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.490 
Photoshop is so powerful so if you're
making<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.149> photo<00:00:48.360> smaller<00:00:48.809> which<00:00:49.170> most

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
making your photo smaller which most

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
making your photo smaller which most
cases<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.520> we're<00:00:50.879> taking<00:00:51.180> huge

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
cases we are because we're taking huge

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
cases we are because we're taking huge
megapixel<00:00:52.170> images<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:53.070> posting<00:00:53.460> them

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
megapixel images and then posting them

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.580 
megapixel images and then posting them
on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.180> Internet<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.989> we're<00:00:55.140> usually<00:00:55.260> making

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
on the Internet so we're usually making

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.979 
on the Internet so we're usually making
them<00:00:55.739> smaller<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.120> make<00:00:57.449> logical

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
them smaller so it would make logical

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.250 
them smaller so it would make logical
sense<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.359> defaulted<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:01.079> that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
sense to have this defaulted for that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.340 
sense to have this defaulted for that
particular<00:01:01.620> option<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.059> way<00:01:03.229> most<00:01:04.229> of

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
particular option so this way most of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.780 
particular option so this way most of
the<00:01:04.409> time<00:01:04.530> we're<00:01:04.680> making<00:01:04.920> images<00:01:05.100> smaller<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the time we're making images smaller so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.149 
the time we're making images smaller so
let's<00:01:05.970> set<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:07.229> option<00:01:07.470> bicubic

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
let's set it for that option bicubic

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.490 
let's set it for that option bicubic
sharper<00:01:08.280> best<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:08.939> reduction<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.049> that's<00:01:10.350> why

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
sharper best for reduction so that's why

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
sharper best for reduction so that's why
we<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.920> set<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.580> let<00:01:12.270> me<00:01:12.360> go<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
we have that set like that let me go to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.380 
we have that set like that let me go to
interface<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.700> basically<00:01:14.700> most<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.299> this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
interface here basically most of this

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.710 
interface here basically most of this
stuff<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.020> leave<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.350> default<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.570> can

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
stuff I just leave as default so you can

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.510 
stuff I just leave as default so you can
scroll<00:01:18.990> through<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> custom

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
scroll through here I do have a custom

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.429 
scroll through here I do have a custom
color<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:21.119> my<00:01:21.330> background<00:01:21.900> I'll<00:01:22.110> show<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.350> how

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
color on my background I'll show you how

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.950 
color on my background I'll show you how
to<00:01:22.500> change<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.950> later<00:01:23.299> then<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.600> here

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
to change that later then in here

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.020 
to change that later then in here
there's<00:01:25.680> some<00:01:26.009> other<00:01:26.130> options<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
there's some other options here that I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.660 
there's some other options here that I
always<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.720> check<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.770> ask<00:01:29.159> before

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
always like to check the ask before

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.219 
always like to check the ask before
saving<00:01:29.880> layered<00:01:30.240> tiff<00:01:30.509> files<00:01:30.750> I'm<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
saving layered tiff files I'm going to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
saving layered tiff files I'm going to
actually<00:01:31.350> uncheck<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.820> kind

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
actually uncheck that because I I kind

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.539 
actually uncheck that because I I kind
of<00:01:33.180> find<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.540> annoying<00:01:33.750> maximize<00:01:34.650> PSD<00:01:35.250> files

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
of find that annoying maximize PSD files

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.969 
of find that annoying maximize PSD files
that<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> want<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.360> set<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> always

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
that you want to have set to always

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.840 
that you want to have set to always
especially<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.189> you're<00:01:38.280> using<00:01:38.400> Adobe

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
especially if you're using Adobe

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.460 
especially if you're using Adobe
Lightroom<00:01:38.900> basically<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.079> does<00:01:40.439> is

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
Lightroom basically what that does is

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
Lightroom basically what that does is
when<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.310> back<00:01:41.520> from<00:01:41.790> Photoshop<00:01:42.299> back

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
when you go back from Photoshop back

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.569 
when you go back from Photoshop back
into<00:01:42.869> Lightroom<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> maybe<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.340> over<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
into Lightroom and maybe you go over to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.999 
into Lightroom and maybe you go over to
another<00:01:44.939> adobe<00:01:45.840> products<00:01:46.320> such<00:01:46.439> as<00:01:46.470> fireworks

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
another adobe products such as fireworks

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.920 
another adobe products such as fireworks
or<00:01:47.280> something<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.750> Photoshop<00:01:48.750> will

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
or something like that Photoshop will

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.420 
or something like that Photoshop will
make<00:01:49.049> sure<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.470> it'll<00:01:49.680> work<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.280> those

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
make sure that it'll work with all those

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.429 
make sure that it'll work with all those
programs<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.689> maximizes<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
programs so it just maximizes the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.830 
programs so it just maximizes the
photoshop<00:01:52.920> capability<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.060> other<00:01:54.390> programs

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
photoshop capability so other programs

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.929 
photoshop capability so other programs
can<00:01:55.049> read<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.380> without<00:01:55.500> any<00:01:55.770> issues<00:01:56.189> now<00:01:56.700> will

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
can read it without any issues now will

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.789 
can read it without any issues now will
make<00:01:57.060> your<00:01:57.180> file<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.780> larger<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.350> it's

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
make your file a little larger but it's

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.620 
make your file a little larger but it's
not<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> end<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.310> world<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.360> highly

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
not the end of the world so I highly

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.929 
not the end of the world so I highly
recommend<00:02:00.780> having<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.409> checked

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939

always there and these are just checked
at<00:03:43.820> default<00:03:44.150> I'm<00:03:44.360> just<00:03:44.420> going<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.660> leave<00:03:44.840> them

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
at default I'm just going to leave them

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.100 
at default I'm just going to leave them
and<00:03:45.110> then<00:03:45.890> type<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.579> always<00:03:47.360> have<00:03:47.480> mine<00:03:47.750> set<00:03:47.959> to

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
and then type I always have mine set to

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.170 
and then type I always have mine set to
extra<00:03:48.440> large<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.100> can<00:03:49.310> see<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.790> fonts<00:03:50.090> a

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
extra large so I can see the fonts a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.000 
extra large so I can see the fonts a
little<00:03:50.390> better<00:03:50.540> because<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.140> default<00:03:51.530> it's

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
little better because the default it's

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.100 
little better because the default it's
hard<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.340> see<00:03:52.579> when<00:03:52.790> you're<00:03:52.940> using<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:54.049> know

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
hard to see when you're using you know

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.539 
hard to see when you're using you know
you're<00:03:54.320> when<00:03:54.500> you're<00:03:54.560> viewing<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:54.980> fonts

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
you're when you're viewing the fonts

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:56.830 
you're when you're viewing the fonts
it's<00:03:55.700> hard<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:55.940> see<00:03:56.060> when<00:03:56.209> it's<00:03:56.239> set<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.480> small

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
it's hard to see when it's set to small

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.140 
it's hard to see when it's set to small
so<00:03:57.079> extra<00:03:57.440> large<00:03:57.620> is<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.430> way<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.700> go<00:03:58.880> on<00:03:59.030> my

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
so extra large is the way to go on my

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.800 
so extra large is the way to go on my
opinion<00:03:59.570> and<00:03:59.720> 3d<00:04:00.680> if<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.010> have<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.810> extended

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
opinion and 3d if you have the extended

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.330 
opinion and 3d if you have the extended
version<00:04:02.870> of<00:04:03.200> photoshop<00:04:03.709> there's<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.040> bunch<00:04:04.220> of

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
version of photoshop there's a bunch of

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.009 
version of photoshop there's a bunch of
options<00:04:04.459> in<00:04:04.820> here<00:04:04.850> we're<00:04:05.630> not<00:04:05.750> going<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.930> go

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
options in here we're not going to go

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.840 
options in here we're not going to go
into<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.320> right<00:04:06.500> now<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.459> just<00:04:07.670> want<00:04:07.820> to

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
into that right now but I just want to

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.220 
into that right now but I just want to
make<00:04:07.910> you<00:04:08.030> aware<00:04:08.150> that<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.660> is<00:04:08.690> there<00:04:09.019> if<00:04:09.140> you

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
make you aware that it is there if you

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.500 
make you aware that it is there if you
have<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.440> extended<00:04:09.890> version<00:04:10.329> so<00:04:11.329> that's

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
have the extended version so that's

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.420 
have the extended version so that's
pretty<00:04:11.720> much<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.930> with<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.380> settings<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:13.250> is

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
pretty much it with the settings this is

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.330

the<00:04:13.610> general<00:04:13.910> settings<00:04:14.269> and<00:04:14.720> then<00:04:14.750> we<00:04:14.959> have

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
the general settings and then we have

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.979 
the general settings and then we have
the<00:04:16.340> color<00:04:16.609> settings<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.299> hope<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:17.900> got
