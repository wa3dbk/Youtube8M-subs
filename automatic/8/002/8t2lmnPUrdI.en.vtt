00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello everyone, I collected this 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.980
 lawn mower at the cottage 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.030
 means to say in general that money 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:20.400
 I almost did not spend was old 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:26.369
 engine old washing machine type 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:34.380
 from 180 182 engine lying on the bike 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:43.020
 baby shell made this part of 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:48.469
 old barrel this is some kind of metal basket 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.469
 for collecting grass from the front mesh 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.469
 the switch is the only thing that 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.899
 had to buy 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:01.460
 and slightly redo the engine with two 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:06.540
 circuit breakers either with two contact 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.720
 one for the working winding and one for 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.960
 launcher who slightly redid 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.960
 put a spring and he is released 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:37.340
 further that we have inside and inside us 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:44.240
 floating knives 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:48.659
 life made from 2 disks from a circular 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.390
 width is completely this radius of knives 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.390
 it turns out not a radius diameter of 36 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.960
 centimeters here also zero and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.340
 raking or for grass knives floating 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:08.299
 done so in order to 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.299
 blow until I turned the knife out just 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.980
 blunt a little bit you can sharpen so 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.290
 they work when this thing is spinning 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.570
 they straighten everything ok 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.990
 partially satisfied with the results 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.050
 grass 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.070
 remains on earth most of 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.070
 going to cart 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.300
 during the tests themselves in the country pumped out 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.740
 all the grass 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.980
 if you can find somewhere now 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.370
 nearby plot to stretch can 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:54.630
 It was a long try to show how 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.390
 she was eating talking protection that's because 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.010
 that wheel 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.620
 the knife rather threw grass on the wheel 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:10.790
 long tangled and spun badly 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.790
 that we try to mow 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.510
 Here is the result I want to partially 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.430
 remains 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:17.230
 how much because the long grass 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.230
 something goes into the basket 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:29.350
 very thick grass very large 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.350
 in the whole village works
