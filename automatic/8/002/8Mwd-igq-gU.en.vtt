00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.670 
out yet we haven't tried out his idle
animation<00:02:21.690> we<00:02:21.959> should<00:02:22.140> see<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> vastly

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
animation we should see a vastly

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:32.539 
animation we should see a vastly
different<00:02:22.799> angle<00:02:23.430> all<00:02:24.180> right<00:02:30.470> that's<00:02:31.470> perfect

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
different angle all right that's perfect

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.690 
different angle all right that's perfect
that's<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:33.660> what<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.049> wanted<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.489> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
that's just what I wanted this is the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.580 
that's just what I wanted this is the
bed<00:02:35.970> oh<00:02:37.730> my<00:02:38.730> god<00:02:39.030> yeah<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:40.230> pretty<00:02:40.440> much

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
bed oh my god yeah that that pretty much

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.449 
bed oh my god yeah that that pretty much
suits<00:02:40.950> him

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
suits him

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.449 
suits him
I<00:02:41.489> think<00:02:42.120> screw<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.500> that's<00:02:44.010> pretty<00:02:44.340> much

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
I think screw it and that's pretty much

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.879 
I think screw it and that's pretty much
it<00:02:44.609> that's<00:02:45.060> pretty<00:02:45.810> much<00:02:46.019> for<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.319> hack<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.680> I

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
it that's pretty much for the hack is I

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.099 
it that's pretty much for the hack is I
mean<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.519> there's<00:02:48.180> not<00:02:48.269> much<00:02:48.540> else<00:02:48.900> to

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
mean it's this there's not much else to

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.559 
mean it's this there's not much else to
it<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.680> Sonic<00:02:50.130> 1<00:02:50.340> essentially<00:02:50.790> but<00:02:51.540> I

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
it it's just Sonic 1 essentially but I

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.379 
it it's just Sonic 1 essentially but I
am<00:02:51.810> curious<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.319> see<00:02:52.500> if<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.430> boss<00:02:54.090> has

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
am curious to see if the boss has

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.110 
am curious to see if the boss has
changed<00:02:54.870> any<00:02:55.079> so<00:02:55.799> of<00:02:56.549> course<00:02:56.850> we're<00:02:57.060> gonna

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
changed any so of course we're gonna

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.759 
changed any so of course we're gonna
have<00:02:57.359> to<00:02:57.540> get<00:02:57.720> there<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.139> in<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.350> meantime<00:02:58.530> I

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
but basically I've covered a lot hacks I

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.009 
but basically I've covered a lot hacks I
have<00:03:14.310> downloaded<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.970> lot<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.180> hacks<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.750> even

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
have downloaded a lot of hacks I even

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.020 
have downloaded a lot of hacks I even
have<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.500> started<00:03:17.069> organizing<00:03:17.340> them<00:03:17.880> when<00:03:18.000> I

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
have I started organizing them when I

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.520 
have I started organizing them when I
originally<00:03:18.239> started<00:03:18.810> doing<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.290> then<00:03:19.410> it

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
originally started doing it and then it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.050 
originally started doing it and then it
got<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.709> hand<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.970> I

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
got a hand so I

because I have options I could do it's

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.550 
because I have options I could do it's
just<00:03:40.209> if<00:03:40.330> there's<00:03:40.540> one<00:03:40.810> that's<00:03:41.019> particular

you<00:03:42.010> know<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:42.190> particular<00:03:42.459> hack<00:03:42.819> someone<00:03:43.180> wants

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
you know a particular hack someone wants

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.559 
you know a particular hack someone wants
to<00:03:43.569> show<00:03:43.840> off<00:03:44.040> for<00:03:45.040> some<00:03:45.760> reason

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
to show off for some reason

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.100 
to show off for some reason
then<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.530> would<00:03:48.519> gladly<00:03:48.880> show<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.599> off<00:03:49.720> first

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
then I would gladly show that off first

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.490 
then I would gladly show that off first

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
so if you have a hack to recommend don't

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.520 
so if you have a hack to recommend don't
link<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.130> because<00:03:54.580> Google<00:03:55.299> or<00:03:56.140> YouTube

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
link it because Google or YouTube

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.650 
link it because Google or YouTube
brother<00:03:56.950> does<00:03:57.310> most<00:03:57.730> Google+<00:03:58.330> doesn't<00:03:58.569> have
