texture resembles a woven basket so i'm
going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> work<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.030> chain<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.690> chain<00:00:37.290> stitches

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
going to work a chain of chain stitches

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.770 
going to work a chain of chain stitches
and<00:00:38.190> insert<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> hook<00:00:38.850> into<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.329> second

loop on the crochet hook and continue to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.180 
loop on the crochet hook and continue to
the<00:00:47.340> second<00:00:47.789> chain<00:00:48.829> you're<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.010> keep

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the second chain you're going to keep

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.840 
the second chain you're going to keep
working<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.329> whole<00:00:51.600> row<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> chains<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
working the whole row of chains and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.430 
working the whole row of chains and
you'll<00:00:53.850> end<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> same<00:00:54.480> amount<00:00:55.289> of

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
you'll end up with the same amount of

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.369 
you'll end up with the same amount of
loops<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> chains<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.750> your<00:00:58.199> needle

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
loops and like the chains on your needle

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.670 
loops and like the chains on your needle
and<00:01:01.699> then<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.090> work<00:01:03.690> through<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
and then we have to work through to the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.810 
and then we have to work through to the
end<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> work<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.790> row<00:01:06.110> back<00:01:10.820> reverse

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
end we have to work the row back reverse

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.969 
end we have to work the row back reverse

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
loops are worked and then only one loop

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.649 
loops are worked and then only one loop
remains<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> hook<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.400> continue<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> end

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.670 
of the row till it's just one loop left
on<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:37.020> hook<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.960> begin<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> next<00:01:40.259> row

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
on your hook like so begin the next row

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.340 
on your hook like so begin the next row
with<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> chain<00:01:41.640> stitch<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.479> insert<00:01:43.110> the

with a chain stitch and insert the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.230 
with a chain stitch and insert the
needle<00:01:43.590> under<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> vertical<00:01:44.820> loop<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.119> the

needle under the vertical loop of the
previous<00:01:45.780> row<00:01:46.549> like<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.390> yarn

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
previous row like this and then yarn

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.410 
previous row like this and then yarn
over<00:01:48.890> leave<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.130> loop<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.000> hook<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
over leave the loop on the hook and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.800 
over leave the loop on the hook and
continue<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> whole<00:01:52.320> row<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:54.180> reverse<00:01:54.570> row

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
continue the whole row the reverse row

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.870 
continue the whole row the reverse row
is<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> same<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:55.500> before<00:01:55.890> chain<00:01:56.310> stitch<00:01:56.610> yarn

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
is the same as before chain stitch yarn

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
is the same as before chain stitch yarn
over<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.630> pull<00:01:57.659> through<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> next<00:01:58.560> two

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
over and you pull through the next two

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.340 
over and you pull through the next two
loops<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.729> then<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.810> building<00:02:01.200> all

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
loops and so on then you building all

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.429 
loops and so on then you building all
the<00:02:01.500> loops<00:02:01.740> back<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.790> hook<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> each

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the loops back up on your hook so each

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.399 
the loops back up on your hook so each
row<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.640> Tunisian<00:02:06.149> crochet<00:02:06.390> consists<00:02:07.320> of

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
row of the Tunisian crochet consists of

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.609 
row of the Tunisian crochet consists of
a<00:02:07.530> forward<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> then<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.390> reverse<00:02:09.899> row<00:02:10.319> and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
a forward and then a reverse row and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.500 
a forward and then a reverse row and
this<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.640> what<00:02:11.790> creates<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.360> text

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
this is what creates the text

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.160 
this is what creates the text
look<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.810> resembles<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:15.950> woven<00:02:16.940> basket<00:02:17.570> feel

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
look that resembles a woven basket feel

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.280 
look that resembles a woven basket feel
so<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.560> can<00:02:18.680> start<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.040> see<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:20.660> keep<00:02:20.840> going

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
so you can start to see just keep going

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.850 
so you can start to see just keep going
and<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.620> then<00:02:21.920> go<00:02:22.400> back<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.180> reverse<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.770> then

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
and I then go back and reverse and then

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.020 
and I then go back and reverse and then
start<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.340> lose<00:02:25.550> each<00:02:25.820> of<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.330> loops<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.970> can

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
start to lose each of the loops you can

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.680 
start to lose each of the loops you can
see<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.930> woven<00:02:30.170> effect<00:02:31.450> you're<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:32.570> going

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
see the woven effect you're just going

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.050 
see the woven effect you're just going
to<00:02:32.750> repeat<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.170> again<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.010> again<00:02:34.220> forward

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
