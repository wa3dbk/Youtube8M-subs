00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
regular kind of bridging exercise so

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.590 
regular kind of bridging exercise so
doing<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.250> exercise<00:01:02.820> what<00:01:03.120> you're<00:01:03.270> doing<00:01:03.480> is

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
doing this exercise what you're doing is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
doing this exercise what you're doing is
actually<00:01:03.719> pushing<00:01:04.680> yourself<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.909> your

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
actually pushing yourself up with your

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.679 
actually pushing yourself up with your
bum<00:01:06.240> muscles<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.710> come<00:01:07.979> about<00:01:08.100> by

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
bum muscles so that can come about by

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.030 
bum muscles so that can come about by
really<00:01:09.689> focusing<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.260> squeezing<00:01:10.470> your<00:01:10.890> bum

together it's a bit bit awkward to talk
about<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:14.880> about<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.659> trying

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
about and think about but really trying

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.679 
back up I've actually come back up into
a<00:01:40.110> into<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> posture<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.369> quite<00:01:42.180> similar<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
a into a posture that's quite similar to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.560 
a into a posture that's quite similar to
running<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.430> bridging<00:01:44.430> very<00:01:44.790> simple<00:01:45.119> exercise

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
running so bridging very simple exercise

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.030 
running so bridging very simple exercise
but<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:45.990> actually<00:01:46.350> enables<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
but it's actually enables you to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.440 
but it's actually enables you to
practice<00:01:47.430> turning<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:47.939> glutes<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.329> way

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
practice turning on your glutes in a way

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.840 
practice turning on your glutes in a way
that's<00:01:48.659> similar<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.110> running

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
that's similar to running

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.550 
that's similar to running
so<00:01:50.030> now<00:01:50.210> if<00:01:50.300> I<00:01:50.390> go<00:01:50.570> into<00:01:50.810> say<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.140> standard

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
so now if I go into say a standard

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.410 
so now if I go into say a standard
running<00:01:51.830> drill<00:01:52.070> I<00:01:52.310> can<00:01:52.820> just<00:01:53.000> think<00:01:53.120> about

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
running drill I can just think about

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.570 
running drill I can just think about
turning<00:01:53.630> like<00:01:54.200> glued<00:01:54.470> on<00:01:54.650> in<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.070> same<00:01:55.280> way<00:01:55.460> as

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
turning like glued on in the same way as

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.850 
turning like glued on in the same way as
I<00:01:55.700> did<00:01:55.910> when<00:01:56.210> I<00:01:56.270> was<00:01:56.390> doing<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.780> bridge<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.710> I'm

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
I did when I was doing the bridge so I'm

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.570 
I did when I was doing the bridge so I'm
pushing<00:01:58.100> down<00:01:58.540> squeezing<00:01:59.540> up<00:02:00.310> going<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.370> push

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
pushing down squeezing up going to push

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.880 
pushing down squeezing up going to push
down<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.150> squeeze<00:02:02.600> up<00:02:02.810> nice<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.200> tall<00:02:03.620> so

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
down and squeeze up nice and tall so

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.230 
down and squeeze up nice and tall so
really<00:02:04.100> squeezing<00:02:04.490> with<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.820> glute<00:02:05.030> there

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
really squeezing with that glute there

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.570 
really squeezing with that glute there
so<00:02:05.900> that<00:02:06.410> sort<00:02:06.830> of<00:02:06.860> explains<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.340> little<00:02:07.430> bit

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
so that sort of explains a little bit

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.249 
so that sort of explains a little bit
about<00:02:07.790> what<00:02:07.970> we<00:02:08.060> mean<00:02:08.210> by<00:02:08.270> glutes<00:02:08.750> active

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
about what we mean by glutes active

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.110 
about what we mean by glutes active
during<00:02:09.710> running<00:02:10.009> or<00:02:10.399> when<00:02:10.729> you're<00:02:10.880> trying<00:02:10.970> to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
during running or when you're trying to

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.520 
during running or when you're trying to
do<00:02:11.180> your<00:02:11.330> drills<00:02:11.570> or<00:02:11.870> some<00:02:12.080> other<00:02:12.230> exercises

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
do your drills or some other exercises

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.070 
do your drills or some other exercises
in<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.040> gym
