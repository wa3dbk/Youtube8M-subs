as<00:00:00.719> first<00:00:01.020> flight<00:00:01.350> around<00:00:01.589> our<00:00:01.829> solar<00:00:02.040> system

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
as first flight around our solar system

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.090 
as first flight around our solar system
here's<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> picture<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.179> Mars<00:00:03.650> by<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.680> way<00:00:04.920> this

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
here's a picture of Mars by the way this

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.190 
here's a picture of Mars by the way this
is<00:00:05.279> not<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.490> professional<00:00:06.089> tape<00:00:06.359> as<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.080> can

and Wendell and I are flipping through
the<00:00:12.540> pictures<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.530> not<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.250> produced

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
moon in front of Earth and he's looking

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.160 
moon in front of Earth and he's looking
over<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.890> surface<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.459> another<00:04:04.000> moon<00:04:04.300> at<00:04:04.870> that

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
over the surface of another moon at that

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.840 
over the surface of another moon at that
point<00:04:05.470> they<00:04:05.650> told<00:04:05.709> him<00:04:06.070> there<00:04:06.250> were<00:04:06.370> two<00:04:06.580> moons

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850

in orbit around planet Earth
we<00:04:09.400> think<00:04:09.610> we're<00:04:09.790> about<00:04:09.970> 60<00:04:10.480> million<00:04:10.780> years

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
we think we're about 60 million years

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.660 
we think we're about 60 million years
back<00:04:11.260> here's<00:04:11.620> another<00:04:11.860> picture<00:04:12.220> over<00:04:12.580> the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
back here's another picture over the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.690 
back here's another picture over the

one<00:05:15.839> this<00:05:16.589> one's<00:05:16.830> pretty<00:05:16.979> hard<00:05:17.249> to<00:05:17.399> see<00:05:17.639> here's

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
one this one's pretty hard to see here's

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.249 
one this one's pretty hard to see here's
the<00:05:18.059> head<00:05:18.270> of<00:05:18.479> some<00:05:18.689> sort<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.050> creature

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:21.749 
crashing through some bushes here it's

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:23.600 
crashing through some bushes here it's
hard<00:05:21.930> to<00:05:22.020> tell<00:05:22.589> I<00:05:22.649> know<00:05:22.830> it's<00:05:23.039> probably<00:05:23.460> hard

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
hard to tell I know it's probably hard

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.999 
hard to tell I know it's probably hard
to<00:05:23.639> see<00:05:23.759> these<00:05:24.029> anyway<00:05:24.449> from<00:05:24.629> back<00:05:24.839> there<00:05:25.080> but

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.230 

just<00:05:29.009> the<00:05:29.219> idea<00:05:29.639> that<00:05:29.849> someone<00:05:30.089> could

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
just the idea that someone could

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.969 
just the idea that someone could
actually<00:05:30.479> go<00:05:30.749> back<00:05:30.930> in<00:05:31.139> time<00:05:31.289> this<00:05:31.710> really

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
actually go back in time this really

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.760 
actually go back in time this really
gets<00:05:32.189> my<00:05:32.339> brain<00:05:32.639> going<00:05:32.879> there's<00:05:33.779> a<00:05:33.930> bird
