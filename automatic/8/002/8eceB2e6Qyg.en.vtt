I just nail them down to the frame and
what<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.300> measure<00:02:59.600> I<00:03:02.770> measure<00:03:04.930> my

what it is I measure I measure my

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.490 
what it is I measure I measure my
regular<00:03:06.350> can<00:03:06.680> size<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.460> know<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.170> the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
regular can size you know so that the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.270 
regular can size you know so that the
distance<00:03:10.280> between<00:03:10.670> them<00:03:11.210> is<00:03:12.040> smaller<00:03:13.040> than

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
distance between them is smaller than

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.060 
distance between them is smaller than
they<00:03:13.460> can<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:15.220> just<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.880> also<00:03:17.150> add<00:03:18.910> this

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
they can I just and I also add this

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.850 
they can I just and I also add this
right<00:03:22.070> here<00:03:22.520> so<00:03:23.060> these<00:03:23.270> those<00:03:23.840> dividers<00:03:24.620> are

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
right here so these those dividers are

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.120 
right here so these those dividers are
made<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.280> wood<00:03:26.440> some<00:03:27.440> of<00:03:27.590> them<00:03:27.740> are<00:03:27.860> actually

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
made of wood some of them are actually

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.170 
made of wood some of them are actually
carve<00:03:28.790> or<00:03:32.650> fall<00:03:33.650> down<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:34.250> got<00:03:34.490> get<00:03:35.000> in

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
carve or fall down and I got get in

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:46.610 
carve or fall down and I got get in
place

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.089 

you

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.369 

and<00:03:53.099> then<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.819> hugest<00:03:54.239> stick<00:03:54.690> they<00:03:55.110> wanted

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
and then the hugest stick they wanted

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.339 
and then the hugest stick they wanted
the<00:03:55.470> boys<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:57.060> all<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.390> others<00:03:57.930> fall<00:03:58.230> in

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
the boys and all the others fall in

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:06.080 
the boys and all the others fall in
place<00:04:01.849> so<00:04:02.849> that's<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.209> system<00:04:05.090> myself

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
place so that's the system myself

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.860 
place so that's the system myself
