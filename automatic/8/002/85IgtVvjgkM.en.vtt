00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
have a YouTube merit pie here so I

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.450 
have a YouTube merit pie here so I
figured<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.470> might<00:00:04.589> as<00:00:04.650> well<00:00:04.859> go<00:00:05.190> ahead<00:00:05.279> and

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
figured I might as well go ahead and

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.760 
figured I might as well go ahead and
build<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.850> autumn<00:00:06.089> elevator<00:00:06.450> just<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.410> people

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
build the autumn elevator just so people

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.080 
build the autumn elevator just so people
understand<00:00:08.280> exactly<00:00:08.550> what<00:00:08.849> I'm<00:00:08.940> talking

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
understand exactly what I'm talking

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.600 
understand exactly what I'm talking
about<00:00:09.300> buy<00:00:09.570> an<00:00:09.690> item<00:00:09.900> elevator<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.590> know<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.429> lot

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
about buy an item elevator I know a lot

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.459 
about buy an item elevator I know a lot
of<00:00:11.670> people<00:00:11.759> have<00:00:12.150> already<00:00:12.690> build<00:00:12.960> stuff<00:00:13.290> like

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
of people have already build stuff like

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.560 
of people have already build stuff like
this<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.099> uh<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.670> think<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.360> fairly

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
this but uh I think this is a fairly

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.550 
this but uh I think this is a fairly
compact<00:00:16.049> design<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.430> very<00:00:17.670> simple<00:00:18.119> design

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
compact design and a very simple design

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.019 
compact design and a very simple design
so<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:20.600> anybody<00:00:21.800> anybody<00:00:22.800> who<00:00:23.029> doesn't

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
so that it anybody anybody who doesn't

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.609 
so that it anybody anybody who doesn't
even<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.420> know<00:00:24.600> much<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.900> our<00:00:25.140> redstone

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
even really know much of our redstone

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.830 
even really know much of our redstone
can<00:00:26.340> get<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.880> work<00:00:27.060> rather<00:00:27.750> usually<00:00:29.449> so<00:00:30.449> let

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
can get it to work rather usually so let

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.330 
can get it to work rather usually so let
me<00:00:30.929> show<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.080> working<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.679> always<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.219> then

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
me show you working as always and then

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.950 
me show you working as always and then
I'll<00:00:32.430> show<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.640> how<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.910> works<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.630> isn't

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
I'll show you how it works this isn't

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.090 
I'll show you how it works this isn't
largely<00:00:34.230> based<00:00:34.500> off<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> design<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:36.680> of<00:00:37.680> a

I<00:00:42.059> keep<00:00:42.210> saying<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.629> wrong<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:43.379> Cana<00:00:44.010> 80<00:00:44.399> ka<00:00:45.120> na

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
I keep saying it wrong at Cana 80 ka na

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.190 
I keep saying it wrong at Cana 80 ka na
I'm<00:00:46.200> guessing<00:00:46.620> that's<00:00:46.680> at<00:00:46.920> Cana<00:00:48.200> except

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I'm guessing that's at Cana except

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.060 
I'm guessing that's at Cana except
there's<00:00:49.789> seems<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.320> each<00:00:52.320> layer<00:00:52.710> seemed

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
there's seems a little each layer seemed

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.740 
there's seems a little each layer seemed
a<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.280> overly<00:00:53.670> complicated<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.539> thought

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
a little overly complicated so I thought

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.380 
a little overly complicated so I thought
I<00:00:54.809> might<00:00:54.899> try<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.500> simplify<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.210> let

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
I might try to simplify it a bit so let

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.099 
I might try to simplify it a bit so let
me<00:00:57.420> throw<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.780> some<00:00:57.960> items<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:00.960> my

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
me throw in some items so I have this my

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.959 
me throw in some items so I have this my
little<00:01:01.379> collection<00:01:01.739> stream<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.789> show

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
little collection stream just to show

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.580 
little collection stream just to show
that<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.870> used<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.350> any<00:01:04.729> sort<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.590> any

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that this can be used on any sort of any

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.410 
that this can be used on any sort of any
sort<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> farm<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.400> has<00:01:08.549> collection<00:01:09.030> streams

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
sort of farm that has collection streams

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.130 
sort of farm that has collection streams
things<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.080> cacti<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:12.560> sugar<00:01:13.560> cane<00:01:13.890> or<00:01:15.140> mob

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
things like cacti or sugar cane or mob

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.480 
things like cacti or sugar cane or mob
killing<00:01:16.740> chains<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:18.299> whatever<00:01:19.220> can<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.340> used

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
killing chains or whatever can be used

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.080 
killing chains or whatever can be used
on<00:01:20.610> any<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.909> those<00:01:21.060> two<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:22.740> upward<00:01:23.670> item

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
on any of those two have upward item

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.120 
on any of those two have upward item
movement<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.409> let<00:01:25.799> me<00:01:26.270> take<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> look<00:01:27.979> yeah<00:01:28.979> it's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
movement so let me take a look yeah it's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.149 
movement so let me take a look yeah it's
all<00:01:29.280> there<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.590> I'm<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.799> activate<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
all there and I'm going to activate it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.190 
all there and I'm going to activate it
by<00:01:32.220> tahsin<00:01:32.610> item<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.000> there

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.250 

what<00:01:36.200> happened<00:01:36.500> that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
what happened that

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.100 
what happened that
good<00:01:39.660> ah<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:44.140> we<00:01:44.230> go<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:45.010> was<00:01:45.160> my<00:01:45.310> issue

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
good ah there we go that was my issue

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.500 
good ah there we go that was my issue
let's<00:01:47.110> try<00:01:47.440> it<00:01:47.500> again

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.490 

you<00:01:52.510> heard<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.780> bunch<00:01:52.900> of<00:01:52.990> items<00:01:53.080> follow

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
you heard a bunch of items follow

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.770 
you heard a bunch of items follow
through<00:01:53.830> because<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:55.030> have<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.330> have<00:01:55.540> at

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
through because you have to have at

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.140 
through because you have to have at
least<00:01:55.810> a<00:01:56.530> three<00:01:57.040> tik<00:01:57.340> delay<00:01:58.500> between<00:01:59.500> each

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
least a three tik delay between each

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.520 
least a three tik delay between each
piston<00:02:01.150> in<00:02:01.570> order<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.930> collect<00:02:02.110> some<00:02:02.470> items

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
piston in order to collect some items

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.120 
piston in order to collect some items
and<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.700> must<00:02:04.180> be<00:02:04.360> at<00:02:04.780> least<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.229> 4<00:02:05.530> tick<00:02:05.740> delay

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
and it must be at least a 4 tick delay

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.249 
and it must be at least a 4 tick delay
between<00:02:06.369> each<00:02:06.820> piston<00:02:07.150> layer<00:02:07.570> in<00:02:07.840> order<00:02:08.080> for

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
between each piston layer in order for

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.320 
between each piston layer in order for
it<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.350> collect<00:02:08.679> all<00:02:09.100> items<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:12.000> since<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.120> had<00:02:13.300> a

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
it to collect all items so since I had a

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.850 
it to collect all items so since I had a
one<00:02:13.569> tick<00:02:13.750> delay<00:02:13.989> right<00:02:14.140> there<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.590> didn't

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
one tick delay right there it didn't

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.550 
one tick delay right there it didn't
quite<00:02:15.190> work<00:02:15.810> exactly<00:02:16.810> right<00:02:16.989> but<00:02:17.260> let's<00:02:17.410> try

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
quite work exactly right but let's try

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.580 
quite work exactly right but let's try
it<00:02:17.650> again<00:02:19.530> there<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:20.680> go<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:22.350> then<00:02:23.350> they

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
it again there we go and then they

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.449 
it again there we go and then they
remove<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.430> check<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.360> see<00:02:26.280> there<00:02:27.280> any

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
remove this and check to see there any

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.490 
remove this and check to see there any
items<00:02:27.760> down<00:02:27.910> there<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.180> looks<00:02:28.330> like<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:28.810> got

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
items down there it looks like one got

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.390 
items down there it looks like one got
left<00:02:30.209> let's<00:02:31.209> try<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.480> one<00:02:31.660> more<00:02:31.720> time<00:02:32.250> there<00:02:33.250> we

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
left let's try it one more time there we

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.300 
left let's try it one more time there we
go<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:35.230> then<00:02:35.709> let's<00:02:35.830> pick<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.010> back<00:02:36.130> up<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:37.260> so

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
go and then let's pick it back up and so

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.620 
go and then let's pick it back up and so
pretty<00:02:39.310> simple<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.959> pressure<00:02:41.709> plate<00:02:42.630> that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
pretty simple I have pressure plate that

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.320 
pretty simple I have pressure plate that
power<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:45.190> piston<00:02:45.640> right<00:02:45.790> down<00:02:45.970> here

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
power is this piston right down here

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.030 
power is this piston right down here
which<00:02:46.959> lifts<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.920> block<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.180> items<00:02:49.600> are

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.060 

ending<00:02:54.040> up<00:02:54.130> on<00:02:54.310> up<00:02:54.880> one<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:56.590> lifts<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:56.980> to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
ending up on up one and that lifts it to

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.560 
ending up on up one and that lifts it to
the<00:02:57.190> lair<00:02:57.370> where<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.910> first<00:03:00.180> sideways<00:03:01.180> piston

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
the lair where the first sideways piston

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.050 
the lair where the first sideways piston
will<00:03:01.989> use<00:03:02.260> item<00:03:02.709> physics<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.250> push<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.549> up<00:03:03.700> and

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
will use item physics to push it up and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.259 
will use item physics to push it up and
it<00:03:05.049> just<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.739> just<00:03:05.920> built<00:03:06.280> in<00:03:06.430> series<00:03:06.880> so

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
it just it's just built in series so

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.880 
it just it's just built in series so
it's<00:03:07.959> fairly<00:03:08.230> easy<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:09.030> keep<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.209> delay

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
it's fairly easy to keep the delay

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.069 
it's fairly easy to keep the delay
working<00:03:11.890> correctly<00:03:12.600> like<00:03:13.600> I<00:03:13.690> said<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.989> have

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
working correctly like I said you have

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.420 
working correctly like I said you have
different<00:03:14.350> for<00:03:14.470> tape<00:03:14.709> delay<00:03:14.950> between<00:03:15.130> each

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
different for tape delay between each

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.479 
different for tape delay between each
layer<00:03:15.459> in<00:03:15.970> order<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.630> collect<00:03:16.980> all<00:03:17.980> your<00:03:18.040> items

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
layer in order to collect all your items

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.430 
layer in order to collect all your items
look<00:03:18.940> like<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.150> missed<00:03:19.420> one<00:03:19.510> but<00:03:19.720> usually<00:03:20.320> it

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
look like I missed one but usually it

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.990 
look like I missed one but usually it
collects<00:03:20.739> all<00:03:20.980> your<00:03:21.130> items<00:03:21.250> with<00:03:21.579> a<00:03:21.640> 4<00:03:21.850> tick

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
collects all your items with a 4 tick

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.610 
collects all your items with a 4 tick
delay<00:03:22.299> at<00:03:22.540> least<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.840> does<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:22.989> lot<00:03:23.260> better<00:03:23.380> than

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
delay at least it does a lot better than

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.470 
delay at least it does a lot better than
a<00:03:23.680> three<00:03:23.890> tik<00:03:24.070> delay<00:03:24.310> if<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.150> want<00:03:25.269> to<00:03:25.360> build

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
a three tik delay if you want to build

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.390 
a three tik delay if you want to build
another<00:03:25.690> layer<00:03:25.900> it's<00:03:26.110> really<00:03:26.320> simple<00:03:26.590> all<00:03:27.340> you

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
another layer it's really simple all you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.970 
another layer it's really simple all you
got<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.730> do<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:30.100> just<00:03:30.280> add<00:03:30.459> another<00:03:31.980> round

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
got to do you just add another round

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.429 
got to do you just add another round
about<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:34.030> start<00:03:34.329> out<00:03:34.420> with<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.600> repeater

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.979 

build<00:03:42.439> it<00:03:42.590> up<00:03:42.739> you<00:03:43.640> gotta<00:03:43.849> take<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.750> into

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
build it up you gotta take that into

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.380 
build it up you gotta take that into
account<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:48.610> don't<00:03:49.610> care<00:03:49.730> about<00:03:49.879> that<00:03:50.090> let's

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
account I don't care about that let's

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.559 
account I don't care about that let's
see<00:03:50.599> and<00:03:50.870> then<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:52.549> add<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.790> sticky<00:03:53.390> piston

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
see and then you add a sticky piston

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.809 
see and then you add a sticky piston
right<00:03:53.930> here<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:55.519> place<00:03:55.870> your<00:03:57.579> block<00:03:58.579> right

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
right here you place your block right

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.599 
right here you place your block right
there<00:03:58.849> you<00:03:59.720> can<00:03:59.900> close<00:04:00.349> this<00:04:00.709> area<00:04:01.189> because

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
there you can close this area because

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:02.800 
there you can close this area because
you<00:04:01.760> need<00:04:01.879> to<00:04:01.909> make<00:04:02.090> sure<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.329> atoms<00:04:02.599> don't

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
you need to make sure the atoms don't

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.649 
you need to make sure the atoms don't
have<00:04:02.959> anywhere<00:04:03.349> to<00:04:03.609> escape<00:04:04.609> to<00:04:04.879> other<00:04:05.209> than<00:04:05.480> up

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
have anywhere to escape to other than up

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.229 
have anywhere to escape to other than up
and<00:04:06.099> then<00:04:07.099> you<00:04:07.129> place<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.730> block<00:04:07.939> right<00:04:08.209> here

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
and then you place a block right here

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.410 
and then you place a block right here
and<00:04:08.720> all<00:04:09.349> you<00:04:09.470> have<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.680> do<00:04:09.799> from<00:04:09.950> there<00:04:10.159> is<00:04:10.459> why

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
and all you have to do from there is why

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.979 
and all you have to do from there is why
are<00:04:11.599> your<00:04:11.750> redstone<00:04:12.109> so<00:04:12.769> that<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.129> ends<00:04:13.459> up

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
are your redstone so that it ends up

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.279 
are your redstone so that it ends up
touching<00:04:14.989> this<00:04:15.260> block<00:04:15.530> right<00:04:15.560> here<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:18.079> then

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
touching this block right here and then

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.710 
touching this block right here and then
let's<00:04:19.250> just<00:04:19.280> make<00:04:19.519> sure<00:04:19.699> it<00:04:19.760> still<00:04:20.209> works<00:04:20.239> I'll

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
let's just make sure it still works I'll

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.750 
let's just make sure it still works I'll
throw<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:20.959> couple<00:04:22.900> wait<00:04:23.900> for<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.139> to<00:04:24.199> go<00:04:24.350> through

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
throw a couple wait for it to go through

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.129 
throw a couple wait for it to go through
I'm<00:04:25.760> sure<00:04:25.940> somebody<00:04:26.300> more<00:04:26.449> clever<00:04:26.780> than<00:04:26.870> me

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
I'm sure somebody more clever than me

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.930 
I'm sure somebody more clever than me
can<00:04:27.410> have<00:04:27.680> can<00:04:29.199> develop<00:04:30.199> an<00:04:30.410> item<00:04:31.370> recognition

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
can have can develop an item recognition

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.719 
can have can develop an item recognition
system<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.780> goes<00:04:32.990> with<00:04:33.260> my<00:04:33.500> design<00:04:34.039> or<00:04:34.340> maybe

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
system that goes with my design or maybe

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.360 
system that goes with my design or maybe
they<00:04:34.849> have<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.060> redesign<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.539> little<00:04:35.870> bit<00:04:36.020> but<00:04:37.010> I

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
they have to redesign a little bit but I

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.700 
they have to redesign a little bit but I
just<00:04:38.060> give<00:04:38.210> it<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.330> little<00:04:38.449> time<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:39.500> seems

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
just give it a little time that seems

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.790 
just give it a little time that seems
like<00:04:39.770> enough<00:04:40.009> time<00:04:40.250> go<00:04:40.699> ahead<00:04:40.910> toss<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.300> in<00:04:41.800> and

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
like enough time go ahead toss it in and

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.260 
like enough time go ahead toss it in and
there<00:04:43.550> we<00:04:43.639> go<00:04:44.530> seems<00:04:45.530> like<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:45.740> missed<00:04:45.949> a<00:04:46.010> couple

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.879 

now<00:04:50.270> trying<00:04:50.599> to<00:04:50.660> get<00:04:50.810> back<00:04:51.020> up<00:04:51.260> and<00:04:51.500> you're

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
now trying to get back up and you're

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.830 
now trying to get back up and you're
gonna<00:04:52.010> have<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.280> go<00:04:52.400> from<00:04:52.610> this<00:04:52.729> way
