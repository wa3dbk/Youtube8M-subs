far I've been lucky however I'm worried
about<00:02:13.610> those<00:02:13.819> guys<00:02:14.030> in<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.420> black<00:02:14.660> coming<00:02:15.049> to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
about those guys in the black coming to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.690 
about those guys in the black coming to
visit<00:02:15.230> me<00:02:15.500> once<00:02:15.709> again<00:02:18.070> I've<00:02:19.070> seen<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.430> lot<00:02:19.670> of

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
visit me once again I've seen a lot of
