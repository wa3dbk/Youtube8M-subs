objective<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.649> pretty<00:00:49.890> much<00:00:50.840> each<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.989> them

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
objective so pretty much each of them

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.580

are<00:00:52.940> like<00:00:53.940> Angry<00:00:54.270> Birds<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.020> concept<00:00:55.440> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
are like Angry Birds but the concept is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.540 
are like Angry Birds but the concept is
that<00:00:55.620> you're<00:00:56.100> playing<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:56.870> 1<00:00:57.870> 2<00:00:58.020> toys<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.890> in

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
that you're playing as 1 2 toys so in

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.340 
that you're playing as 1 2 toys so in
this<00:00:59.670> one<00:00:59.910> you're<00:01:00.120> actually<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.230> Buzz<00:01:02.190> so

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
this one you're actually as but Buzz so

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.770 
this one you're actually as but Buzz so
drag<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> finger<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.949> aim<00:01:05.309> release<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
drag the finger to aim release but to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.539 
drag the finger to aim release but to
throw<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> goal<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.890> knock<00:01:08.070> down<00:01:08.250> all<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
throw and a goal to knock down all the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.000 
throw and a goal to knock down all the
aliens<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.510> someone<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.680> angry

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
aliens so someone I like to the angry

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.890 
aliens so someone I like to the angry
birth<00:01:11.159> ones<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.640> pretty<00:01:12.210> much<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
birth ones so pretty much this is just a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
birth ones so pretty much this is just a
basic<00:01:13.200> one<00:01:13.320> normally<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.460> targets

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
basic one normally you just have targets

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.270 
basic one normally you just have targets
so<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.720> aim<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.740> shoot<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so you just aim at it just shoot it and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.340 
so you just aim at it just shoot it and
boom<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.299> pretty<00:01:18.540> much<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> objective<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
boom so pretty much the objective is to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.609 
boom so pretty much the objective is to
do<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.549> generally<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:22.320> get

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
do that and so generally as you do get

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.980 
do that and so generally as you do get
on<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.310> harder<00:01:23.820> tart<00:01:24.090> whoops

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
on to harder tart whoops

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.560 
on to harder tart whoops
generally<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.460> into<00:01:26.759> harder

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
generally as you do get into harder

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.050 
generally as you do get into harder
levels<00:01:27.869> they<00:01:28.799> introduce<00:01:29.340> new<00:01:29.549> things<00:01:29.610> such<00:01:30.000> as

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
levels they introduce new things such as

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.420 
levels they introduce new things such as
like<00:01:30.299> bricks<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.290> ice<00:01:31.409> blocks<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:32.100> harder

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
like bricks and ice blocks down harder

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.880 
like bricks and ice blocks down harder
to<00:01:32.610> break<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.420> yeah<00:01:36.890> just

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
to break like this one and so yeah just

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.350 
to break like this one and so yeah just
a<00:01:37.950> general<00:01:38.310> round<00:01:38.520> thing<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:38.880> he's<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.090> red

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
a general round thing so he's a red

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.429 
a general round thing so he's a red
thing<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.780> our<00:01:39.900> bricks<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.259> don't

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
thing you see our bricks they don't

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.200 
thing you see our bricks they don't
knock<00:01:40.650> down<00:01:40.920> as<00:01:41.159> easily<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
knock down as easily I don't know and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.830 
knock down as easily I don't know and
you<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.680> weapons<00:01:44.280> stage<00:01:44.790> news<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.689> this
