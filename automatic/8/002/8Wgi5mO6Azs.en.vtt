00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.779
 fascist 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.280
 the attention of the gib 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.870
 everything in elche 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.330
 in the revolutionary person of the guerrilla commander of man 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.170
 the man who knew how to live so many battles to take over the column for 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.480
 hundred and made his entrance in the knee and 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.620
 this together with Camilo 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.740
 percent is he who already internationally recognized 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.230
 p never forgot puerto rico 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.950
 I remember it perfectly that one time it was becoming a 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.110
 activity 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.320
 percent of the solidarity city with Puerto Rico Perez was expressing his 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.870
 thinking in relation to puerto rico 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.610
 on that occasion the che 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.340
 very clearly said 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.820
 that the Puerto Rican people Álvaro colom aerobic 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.900
 from all Latin America 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.910
 because he had fought a battle 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.910
 against colonialism to survive as a people 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.270
 against all penetration by facing all the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.260
 cultural penetration to all the penetration and aggressiveness of the 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
 imperialism in all peoples from every point of view 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.290
 an imperialism and a colonialism that was 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.670
 that he had as a projection was in the background but he still has it 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.179
 then destroy the essence of the expected 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.390
 of the seasonality of our national consciousness 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.500
 i choose I thought the mere fact 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.490
 of the Puerto Rican people having survived 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.939
 one is not as powerful and as powerful as the strength of colonialism 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.170
 Yankee 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.480
 with all the resources that they had 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.040
 go and see in her having faced her in defense with our culture 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:16.539
 this event was raised that percent and he expects one of the most 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.419
 aerobic and that the people of Puerto Rico had to have recognitions of all 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:21.799
 Latin America 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.429
 as such 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.059
 one million 141 of united nations 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.059
 demands that the metropolis that to the colonial power 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.759
 to do everything possible because the colony 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:40.039
 is developed in economic terms so you can exercise your independence 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.039
 and free yourself from the colonial yoke 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:48.859
 and to achieve that it is clearly stated that the metropolis has to help 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.119
 promote the independent economy of the colony 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.989
 they have to be liberating step by step to the colony of the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.420
 with the metropolis and that the people have the ability to survive 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.989
 economically 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.949
 percent released 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.019
 and that that a bolivia without out of the metropolis 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.159
 according to what has been established by international law in the 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.909
 resolution 15 41 very clear about it 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:15.979
 i 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.639
 this is something that the United States is on the contrary what it has done is 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.790
 put them more to puerto rico feigned control of the economy of states 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:24.699
 United 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.519
 impose the interests of the economy that of the American industry in 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.849
 Puerto Rico control the entire commerce in Puerto Rico 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.839
 instead of doing the opposite 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:39.809
 as the law said they what they have clearly shown that they do not have 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:44.289
 no respect for the law no respect for this people treat us like 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:48.189
 inferiors intend to continue controlling have not been mining 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.059
 to then use our territory our people 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.429
 as a basis the aggression some cases 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:58.579
 eleven decisively as for winter another case 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.239
 I understand that a woman who have been used for experimentation the 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.579
 anvil cpsc and using for experimentation with the agent orange 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.610
 Everything is worth to die in what was of it 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.879
 still has not defined its territory the military bases to attack others 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.049
 peoples like this the American community as a strategist 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.910
 I believe that they do not intend to apply the law or only they have is 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:25.099
 the practice is clearly seen as demonstrated 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.059
 but that they do everything is in violation of the law and according to their interests nothing 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:30.200
 the favor 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.110
 from town 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.120
