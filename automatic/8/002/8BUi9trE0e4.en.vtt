00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.860 

ok<00:00:01.920> so<00:00:01.979> now<00:00:02.340> we're<00:00:02.520> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.700> show<00:00:02.909> how<00:00:03.300> green

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
ok so now we're going to show how green

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.249 
ok so now we're going to show how green
beads<00:00:04.400> 100<00:00:05.400> up<00:00:05.580> from<00:00:06.330> green<00:00:06.600> address<00:00:06.899> can

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
beads 100 up from green address can

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:29.620 
beads 100 up from green address can
begin<00:00:07.680> with<00:00:07.980> three<00:00:08.220> different<00:00:08.400> hugger<00:00:09.179> walls

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.089 

so<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:30.929> logged<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.349> these<00:00:31.740> are<00:00:31.949> my

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
so we just logged in these are my

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.770 
so we just logged in these are my
transactions<00:00:32.850> these<00:00:33.600> are<00:00:33.840> my<00:00:34.020> sub<00:00:34.470> accounts

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
transactions these are my sub accounts

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:45.110 
transactions these are my sub accounts
we<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:37.050> receive<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:39.510> itself<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.120> let's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
we can receive and itself so now let's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:01:06.420 
we can receive and itself so now let's
try<00:00:45.530> with<00:00:46.530> letter<00:00:46.739> Nano

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.970 

and<00:01:06.850> we're<00:01:07.270> in

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.910 

seems<00:01:13.980> to<00:01:14.190> have<00:01:14.570> slight<00:01:15.570> connection<00:01:16.670> slowness

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
seems to have slight connection slowness

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.580 
seems to have slight connection slowness
okay<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.310> now<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:21.690> most<00:01:21.900> fun<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.380> NFC<00:01:24.590> is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
okay and now the most fun on NFC is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.960 
okay and now the most fun on NFC is
collect<00:01:26.090> OTG<00:01:27.090> cable<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.610> new

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
collect OTG cable so this is the new

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.430 
collect OTG cable so this is the new
prototype<00:01:30.480> from<00:01:30.690> ledger

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
prototype from ledger

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.630 
prototype from ledger
it's<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.280> USB<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.200> NFC<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.650> we're<00:01:35.490> gonna

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it's about USB and NFC and we're gonna

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:53.679 
it's about USB and NFC and we're gonna
show<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.330> NFC<00:01:36.660> partner<00:01:40.160> yeah

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.349 

so<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.469> signing<00:01:54.979> is<00:01:55.100> actually<00:01:55.460> happening<00:01:55.880> on

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
so the signing is actually happening on

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.020 
so the signing is actually happening on
the<00:01:56.479> harder<00:01:57.200> wallet<00:01:57.439> itself<00:01:57.859> and<00:01:58.159> it's<00:01:58.759> doing

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
the harder wallet itself and it's doing

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.380 
the harder wallet itself and it's doing
that<00:01:59.149> through<00:01:59.450> NFC<00:02:00.429> again<00:02:01.429> some<00:02:01.789> speed

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
that through NFC again some speed

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.789 
that through NFC again some speed
slowness<00:02:02.990> but<00:02:03.369> we're<00:02:04.369> in<00:02:05.679> transactions<00:02:06.679> are

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
slowness but we're in transactions are

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.949 
slowness but we're in transactions are
loaded<00:02:07.219> with<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.909> can<00:02:08.360> receive<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:11.750> is

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
loaded with and can receive and this is

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.110 
loaded with and can receive and this is
it
