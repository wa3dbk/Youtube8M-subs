state history to try and gain estimation

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.699 
state history to try and gain estimation
of<00:02:17.760> when<00:02:17.909> are<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.120> coming<00:02:18.150> out<00:02:18.450> then<00:02:18.709> because

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
of when are we coming out then because

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.100 
of when are we coming out then because
realistically<00:02:20.370> we're<00:02:20.819> not<00:02:20.970> talk<00:02:21.510> by<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:21.959> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
realistically we're not talk by then the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.449 
realistically we're not talk by then the
year<00:02:22.260> unless<00:02:22.500> they've<00:02:22.709> been<00:02:22.860> secretly<00:02:23.250> doing

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
year unless they've been secretly doing

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.559 
year unless they've been secretly doing
it<00:02:23.580> all<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.760> time<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.120> that's<00:02:24.239> why<00:02:24.420> they're

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
it all this time and that's why they're

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.149 
it all this time and that's why they're
not<00:02:24.599> responding<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.080> anyone<00:02:25.379> about<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.590> I'm

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
not responding to anyone about it I'm

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.530 
not responding to anyone about it I'm
assuming<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.730> only<00:02:26.909> reason<00:02:27.090> they're<00:02:27.180> not<00:02:27.209> is

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
assuming the only reason they're not is

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.729 
assuming the only reason they're not is
because<00:02:27.690> they<00:02:27.930> don't<00:02:28.080> know<00:02:28.170> hi<00:02:28.319> people

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
because they don't know hi people

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.280 
because they don't know hi people
already<00:02:29.010> because<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.060> know<00:02:30.750> they<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.080> I

of<00:03:45.900> bug<00:03:46.049> testing<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.650> because<00:03:46.950> it's<00:03:47.069> a<00:03:47.250> lot

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
of bug testing to do because it's a lot

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.309 
of bug testing to do because it's a lot
more<00:03:47.430> blitz<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:48.389> just<00:03:48.780> include<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.169> in<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
more blitz just just include that in the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.960 
more blitz just just include that in the
free<00:03:49.500> updates<00:03:49.859> we<00:03:50.069> could<00:03:50.190> say<00:03:50.340> for<00:03:50.370> but<00:03:50.880> we'll

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
free updates we could say for but we'll

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.120 
free updates we could say for but we'll
say<00:03:51.090> free<00:03:51.299> updates<00:03:51.599> make<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.840> simple<00:03:52.169> pretty

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
say free updates make it simple pretty

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.370 
say free updates make it simple pretty
big<00:03:53.280> updates<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.030> realistically<00:03:54.840> speaking<00:03:54.989> if

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
big updates so realistically speaking if

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.990 
big updates so realistically speaking if
you<00:03:55.470> just<00:03:55.650> did<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.069> map<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.489> would<00:03:56.639> be<00:03:56.790> nine

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
you just did the map that would be nine

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.220 
you just did the map that would be nine
months<00:03:58.430> which<00:03:59.430> from<00:03:59.700> October<00:04:00.209> would<00:04:00.419> be<00:04:00.599> go

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
months which from October would be go

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.740 
months which from October would be go
back<00:04:01.379> three<00:04:01.590> months<00:04:01.700> july<00:04:02.700> of<00:04:02.730> next<00:04:02.849> year<00:04:03.419> but

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
back three months july of next year but

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.539 
back three months july of next year but
let's<00:04:04.319> let's<00:04:04.680> be<00:04:04.829> realistic<00:04:05.069> they're

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
let's let's be realistic they're

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.400 
let's let's be realistic they're
probably<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.540> know<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.690> bit<00:04:06.900> faster<00:04:07.290> because

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
probably you know a bit faster because

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.890 
probably you know a bit faster because
i'd<00:04:07.709> imagine<00:04:08.069> part<00:04:08.489> like<00:04:08.849> about<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.480> month<00:04:09.780> or

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
i'd imagine part like about a month or

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.289 
i'd imagine part like about a month or
two<00:04:09.959> is<00:04:10.349> bug<00:04:10.799> fixing<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.459> then<00:04:11.970> there's<00:04:12.150> also

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
two is bug fixing and then there's also

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.720 
two is bug fixing and then there's also
the<00:04:12.690> 10<00:04:12.989> well<00:04:13.560> essentially<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.220> week<00:04:14.400> or<00:04:14.549> two

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
the 10 well essentially the week or two

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.449 
the 10 well essentially the week or two
of<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.120> microsoft<00:04:15.930> certification<00:04:16.500> so<00:04:16.769> we<00:04:16.949> we

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
of the microsoft certification so we we

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.400 
of the microsoft certification so we we
factor<00:04:17.849> that<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.150> i'm<00:04:18.750> going<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.049> make<00:04:19.229> the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
factor that in i'm going to make the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.599 
factor that in i'm going to make the
prediction<00:04:19.889> of<00:04:19.979> somewhere<00:04:20.280> between<00:04:20.430> about

prediction of somewhere between about
februari<00:04:21.359> april<00:04:21.810> area<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:24.380> realistically

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
februari april area so realistically

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.469 
februari april area so realistically
