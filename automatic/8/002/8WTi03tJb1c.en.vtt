00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.910
 is getting closer to the launch 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.469
 in open huarte and is the expected 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.689
 First-person shooter developed 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.670
 by practice it will be distributed in a 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.670
 free under the free to play model 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.030
 If you still did not know, we'll tell you that your 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.559
 History places us in the near future 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.660
 in the nations of the world and they have 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.790
 crumbled something that has led to 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.790
 a powerful military force called the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.680
 cut has filled that power vacuum 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.540
 initiates a struggle between these and the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.640
 elite forces for control of the 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.530
 resources of the planet although we are not 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.540
 before a shooter that is going to stand out with 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 his argument which in fact is 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.530
 merely anecdotal being its 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.370
 playability where your 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.370
 Main attractive 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.480
 and precisely in this sense the game 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.729
 is completely oriented towards 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.740
 online multiplayer side betting 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.570
 by a half mechanic champions of 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.869
 titles as known and the saga 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.869
 battlefield 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.200
 i 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.229
 for this the game will offer us two 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.760
 well differentiated modalities having 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.680
 On the one hand, the classic modes 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.900
 competitive where we will face 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.060
 to the rest of players in different modes 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.800
 of game and regulars of the genre as 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.990
 for example play on the match with 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.280
 teams one against all or the mode 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.170
 plant the pump among others 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.040
 chances more well good the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.040
 game system 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.000
 on the other hand we will also have a mode 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.860
 cooperative multiplayer in which a 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.780
 group of players will have to join their 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.370
 forces to face in this case 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.690
 the enemies controlled by the 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.460
 artificial intelligence of the game 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.740
 having several types of missions 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 possible from having to defend a 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.550
 highest position of a zone up 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.200
 escort a convoy while we advance 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.690
 shooting on board some vehicle 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.690
 meeting even with final bosses 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.530
 we must also highlight in this 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.240
 aspect that cooperative missions are 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.490
 renew and change their daily 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.350
 objectives with various variants so 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.890
 that we will always find new ones 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.890
 challenges 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.159
 and also as is customary in 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.079
 Multiplayer shooters will allow us 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.209
 choose between several classes at the time of 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.340
 play each one with their own 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.170
 weapons and skills having to choose 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.750
 more specifically four types of 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.730
 soldiers these are first of all the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.799
 rifleman being this a soldier of 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.750
 assault thought for the first line of 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.079
 one with the ability to replenish the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.000
 ammunition of the other players in 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.040
 second place we have the fish and in order 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.349
 will have first aid kits to cure the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.389
 injured and even a defibrillator may 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.349
 Quickly revive the companions who 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.349
 have been killed 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.840
 On the other hand, the third class is the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.060
 engineer arranging the mines state 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.620
 antipersonnel iodine sachets when playing 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.180
 well with the ability to repair the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.180
 shields of your teammates 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.110
 finally the fourth class is 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.030
 sniper which as is of 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.260
 imagine is specialized in shooting down 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.260
 the enemies at long distances 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.220
 also an important element to 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.319
 highlight is that all the classes and weapons 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.299
 of fire are highly customizable 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.250
 with a multitude of components so 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.659
 each player can be created at the type of 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.549
 soldier best fits their 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.530
 preferences being even possible 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.019
 modify weapons in real time with 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.519
 the game already started in addition a detail 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.200
 that has caught our attention is the 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.150
 interaction that players can 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.860
 have with members of its same type 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.870
 and from the stage itself being able to 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.060
 example lean on a partner for 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.440
 be able to climb a wall or reach a 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.390
 elevated area to which we would be 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.390
 impossible to climb by ourselves 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.919
 and before concluding we have to say that 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.410
 the realization of the game is used the 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.750
 opponent brian ching 3 the same engine 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.669
 elite is not like ulises 3 being all the 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.340
 luxury of a game of this visual quality 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.229
 in front of it for free though as 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.760
 and many to budget when dealing with 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.800
 a free to play can be accessed 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.510
 new weapons even to new clothes and 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.580
 various bonuses with which 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.620
 level up faster by buying the 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.240
 with real money although it is assured that 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.040
 this will not affect the balance of 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.080
 games and in any case also 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.060
 we will receive free credits for 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.750
 spend in the game as a reward after 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.750
