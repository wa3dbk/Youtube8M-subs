00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
even have a lego store in there so you

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.820 
even have a lego store in there so you
can<00:02:08.720> go<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.110> buy<00:02:09.140> your<00:02:09.350> favorite<00:02:09.470> Lego

sets so we offer kids in Lego cities

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.070 
sets so we offer kids in Lego cities
something<00:02:13.610> like<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.790> starter<00:02:14.300> set<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.840> get

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
something like a starter set so you get

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.809 
space we also are launching this year
spaceport<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.269> kids<00:02:50.540> can<00:02:50.840> build<00:02:51.050> their<00:02:51.260> own

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.910 

again<00:03:00.270> we<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.660> starter<00:03:01.110> set<00:03:01.140> for

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
again we have a starter set for

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.760 
again we have a starter set for
spaceport<00:03:02.819> here<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.300> Lego<00:03:03.480> city<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:04.500> try<00:03:04.709> to

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
spaceport here in Lego city so we try to

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.040 
spaceport here in Lego city so we try to
offer<00:03:05.010> something<00:03:05.430> at<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.730> $10<00:03:06.209> price<00:03:06.300> point<00:03:06.810> and

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
countdown clock that you can build here

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.009 
countdown clock that you can build here
we've<00:03:34.950> got<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.400> minifigures<00:03:36.299> suited<00:03:36.720> up<00:03:36.870> and

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
we've got the minifigures suited up and

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.220 
we've got the minifigures suited up and
ready<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.319> blast<00:03:37.709> off<00:03:37.950> into<00:03:37.980> outer<00:03:38.280> space

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
ready to blast off into outer space

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.740 
ready to blast off into outer space
and<00:03:40.489> then<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.610> course<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:42.000> rocket<00:03:42.330> is<00:03:42.450> waiting

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
and then of course the rocket is waiting

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.990 
and then of course the rocket is waiting
to<00:03:42.870> go<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:49.069> then<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.099> lot<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.610> cities<00:03:50.880> have

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
to go and then a lot of cities have

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.750 
to go and then a lot of cities have
Harbour<00:03:51.810> fronts<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.799> we<00:03:52.950> offer<00:03:53.160> here<00:03:53.610> in

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
Harbour fronts and so we offer here in

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.970 
Harbour fronts and so we offer here in
lego<00:03:53.940> city<00:03:54.239> some<00:03:54.569> new<00:03:54.720> opportunities<00:03:55.349> to

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
lego city some new opportunities to

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.580 
lego city some new opportunities to
build<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.430> roleplay<00:03:56.849> at<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.420> city<00:03:57.690> harbour

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.170 

so<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.650> have<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:01.950> Coast<00:04:02.370> Guard<00:04:02.640> boat<00:04:02.880> for

so you have a Coast Guard boat for

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.530 
so you have a Coast Guard boat for
example<00:04:03.600> over<00:04:03.930> here<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:05.430> this<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.239> all<00:04:06.390> about

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
example over here and this is all about

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.990 
example over here and this is all about
a<00:04:06.930> roleplay<00:04:07.200> situation<00:04:08.040> in<00:04:08.160> which<00:04:08.310> there's

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
a roleplay situation in which there's
