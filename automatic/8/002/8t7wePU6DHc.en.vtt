00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and open him I drop a smoke bomb hoping

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.920 
and open him I drop a smoke bomb hoping
to<00:01:08.100> flare<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> rogue<00:01:08.670> out<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.659> should<00:01:09.840> have

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
to flare the rogue out and I should have

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.300 
to flare the rogue out and I should have
cloaked<00:01:10.080> here<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.830> repped<00:01:11.070> right

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
cloaked here because I get repped right

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.039 
cloaked here because I get repped right
away<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.729> he<00:01:12.180> did<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.360> last<00:01:12.630> game<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
away and he did that last game so I

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.630 
away and he did that last game so I
should<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.350> seen<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.560> coming<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.520> other

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
should have seen that coming the other

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.130 
should have seen that coming the other
Road<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.060> cloaked<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.540> I'm<00:01:15.630> pretty<00:01:15.810> sure<00:01:15.900> he

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
Road just cloaked and I'm pretty sure he

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.469 
Road just cloaked and I'm pretty sure he
avoided<00:01:16.590> pure<00:01:17.009> shields<00:01:17.310> Hodge<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.790> then<00:01:18.240> here

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
avoided pure shields Hodge and then here

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.260 
avoided pure shields Hodge and then here
i<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.810> Hodge<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> need<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.090> drink<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
i get Hodge so I need to drink at that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.730 
i get Hodge so I need to drink at that
and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.720> i<00:01:21.780> disarmed<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.229> rope<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.560> he

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and then i disarmed the rope and he

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.749 
and then i disarmed the rope and he
doesn't<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.100> trinket<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.640> he
