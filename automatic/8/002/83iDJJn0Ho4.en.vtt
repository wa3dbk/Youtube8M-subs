we're going to be installing this and
I'm<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.159> testing<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.610> also<00:01:39.060> against

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
I'm going to be testing it also against

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
I'm going to be testing it also against
two<00:01:39.600> other<00:01:39.630> SSD<00:01:40.229> drives<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:41.159> time<00:01:41.430> around<00:01:41.549> so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
two other SSD drives this time around so

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.149 
two other SSD drives this time around so
we<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.090> how<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> compares<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:43.200> other

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
we can see how it compares to other

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.700 
we can see how it compares to other
drives<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.180> same<00:01:45.450> machine<00:01:45.840> now<00:01:46.320> looking

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
drives in the same machine now looking

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.740 
drives in the same machine now looking
at<00:01:46.799> some<00:01:46.950> benchmarks<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.540> how

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
at some benchmarks just to see here how

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.160 
at some benchmarks just to see here how
it<00:01:48.960> performs<00:01:49.500> using<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> arrow<00:01:50.600> benchmark<00:01:51.600> we

it performs using the arrow benchmark we

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.469 
it performs using the arrow benchmark we
can<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.500> here<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.670> read<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.329> the

can see here that on the read and on the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.240 
can see here that on the read and on the
right<00:01:54.689> okay<00:01:55.200> those<00:01:55.380> two<00:01:55.560> bars<00:01:55.829> there<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
right okay those two bars there the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.760 
right okay those two bars there the
green<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.549> red<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.060> does<00:01:57.659> actually<00:01:58.020> meet

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
green and the red it does actually meet

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.520 
green and the red it does actually meet
the<00:01:58.950> specification<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.240> great<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:01.290> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the specification so it's great up to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.100 
the specification so it's great up to
258<00:02:02.490> Meg's<00:02:02.939> per<00:02:03.180> second<00:02:03.570> there<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> right

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
258 Meg's per second there on the right

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.059 
258 Meg's per second there on the right
and<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> read<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.869> 280<00:02:06.869> mix<00:02:07.469> per<00:02:07.680> second

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
and on the read up to 280 mix per second

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.309 
and on the read up to 280 mix per second
so<00:02:08.190> indeed<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.700> does<00:02:08.910> keep<00:02:09.239> up<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:10.050> those

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
so indeed it does keep up with those

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.160 
so indeed it does keep up with those
specifications

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
specifications

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.610 
specifications
here<00:02:11.830> are<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.340> crystal<00:02:12.790> disk<00:02:13.440> benchmarks<00:02:14.440> as

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
here are the crystal disk benchmarks as

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.680 
here are the crystal disk benchmarks as
well<00:02:14.860> they're<00:02:15.430> doing<00:02:15.700> sequential<00:02:16.150> read<00:02:16.510> and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
well they're doing sequential read and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.839 
well they're doing sequential read and
rights<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.170> also<00:02:17.830> on<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.069> Everest<00:02:18.489> disk

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.559 
rights and also on the Everest disk
benchmark<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.690> can<00:02:19.840> see<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.020> consistent

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
benchmark you can see a consistent

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.040 
benchmark you can see a consistent

delivery there of 246 on average Meg's
per<00:02:26.319> second<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:26.950> not<00:02:27.130> bad<00:02:27.400> using<00:02:28.150> these

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.050 
per second so not bad using these
different<00:02:28.780> tools<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.500> see<00:02:29.770> how<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.730> Drive

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
different tools to see how this Drive

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.210 
different tools to see how this Drive
performs<00:02:31.690> does<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.260> actually<00:02:32.470> meet<00:02:33.069> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
performs does it actually meet the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.640 
performs does it actually meet the
specifications<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.390> example<00:02:34.480> one<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.470> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
specifications so for example one of the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.559 
specifications so for example one of the
specifications<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.550> there<00:02:36.700> was<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.030> access

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
specifications on there was the access

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.070 
specifications on there was the access
time<00:02:37.810> indeed<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:38.860> fast<00:02:39.220> look<00:02:39.459> at<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:40.080> 0.1

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
time indeed it is fast look at it 0.1

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.870 
time indeed it is fast look at it 0.1
milliseconds<00:02:41.980> therefore<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.340> access<00:02:42.700> time

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
milliseconds therefore the access time

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.790 
milliseconds therefore the access time
not<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.780> read<00:02:43.959> in<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.200> rights<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.739> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
not just to read in the rights and the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.460 
not just to read in the rights and the
transfer<00:02:45.250> rates<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:45.880> pretty<00:02:46.720> darn<00:02:47.019> good<00:02:47.110> if

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
transfer rates so pretty darn good if

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.410 
transfer rates so pretty darn good if
you<00:02:47.560> ask<00:02:47.709> me<00:02:48.010> compared<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.790> other<00:02:48.910> drives

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
you ask me compared to other drives

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.090 
you ask me compared to other drives
which<00:02:49.870> I've<00:02:50.049> tested<00:02:50.470> as<00:02:50.560> well<00:02:50.739> in<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.920> past

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
which I've tested as well in the past

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.100 
which I've tested as well in the past
now<00:02:51.640> let's<00:02:51.910> take<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.120> look<00:02:52.360> at<00:02:52.420> other<00:02:52.569> drives<00:02:52.870> in

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
now let's take a look at other drives in

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.949 
now let's take a look at other drives in
everest<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.370> disk<00:02:54.670> benchmark<00:02:54.970> I've<00:02:55.510> compared

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
everest the disk benchmark I've compared

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.979 
everest the disk benchmark I've compared
it<00:02:56.049> against<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.560> Kingston<00:02:57.100> drive<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.880> also<00:02:58.780> I

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
it against the Kingston drive and also I

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.590 
it against the Kingston drive and also I
compared<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.500> read<00:02:59.769> test<00:03:00.040> suite<00:03:00.280> with<00:03:01.150> the

compared the read test suite with the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.170 
compared the read test suite with the
ocz<00:03:02.380> vertex<00:03:02.590> 2<00:03:03.130> which<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.430> another<00:03:03.640> brand<00:03:04.000> new

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
well but look here just underneath it I

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.970 
well but look here just underneath it I
have<00:03:21.400> also<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.329> retest<00:03:22.930> sweet<00:03:23.200> results<00:03:23.709> for

the mock extreme technology 120 gig
drive<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.420> can<00:03:28.630> see<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:28.870> it's

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
the random read it's about the same but

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.210 
the random read it's about the same but
the<00:03:36.459> buffered<00:03:36.880> read<00:03:37.120> look<00:03:37.810> at<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.220> 261

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
the buffered read look at that 261
