2012 and it's starting to rain so I'm

going to try to keep this grief this

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.589 
going to try to keep this grief this
morning<00:00:10.889> while<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.130> was<00:00:11.309> trying<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.240> convert

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
morning while I was trying to convert

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.980 
morning while I was trying to convert
some<00:00:12.870> videos<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.940> discovered<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:14.969> most<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.809> my

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
some videos I discovered that most of my

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.130 
some videos I discovered that most of my
hard<00:00:16.320> drive<00:00:16.590> space<00:00:16.830> was<00:00:17.400> used<00:00:18.140> which

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
hard drive space was used which

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.820 
hard drive space was used which
shouldn't<00:00:19.650> really<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.220> case<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:21.320> only<00:00:22.320> had

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
shouldn't really be the case I only had

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.910 
shouldn't really be the case I only had
well<00:00:23.430> less<00:00:23.970> than<00:00:24.210> 2<00:00:24.510> gigabytes<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.350> free<00:00:25.529> space

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
well less than 2 gigabytes of free space

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.320 
well less than 2 gigabytes of free space
on<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.380> I<00:00:28.380> don't<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.039> keep<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.910> much

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
on it and I don't really keep that much

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.150 
on it and I don't really keep that much
on<00:00:30.660> my<00:00:30.840> hard<00:00:31.080> drive<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:32.600> should<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:34.020> least

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
on my hard drive I should have at least

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.540 
on my hard drive I should have at least
300<00:00:35.160> gigabytes<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.940> free<00:00:36.329> space<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
300 gigabytes of free space out of the

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.860 
300 gigabytes of free space out of the
455<00:00:38.550> available<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:40.730> but<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.270> some<00:00:42.480> reason

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
455 available on it but for some reason

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.479 
455 available on it but for some reason
most<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.680> gone<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.770> I<00:00:46.770> don't<00:00:47.160> know

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
most of that was gone and I don't know

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.700 
most of that was gone and I don't know
maybe<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.090> well<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.840> haven't<00:00:49.200> really<00:00:49.500> been

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
maybe I well I haven't really been

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.680 
maybe I well I haven't really been
keeping<00:00:50.160> track<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.550> how<00:00:50.879> much<00:00:51.030> space<00:00:51.390> i've

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
keeping track of how much space i've

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.069 
keeping track of how much space i've
been<00:00:51.930> using<00:00:52.170> lately<00:00:52.699> which<00:00:53.699> i<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.719> should

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
been using lately which i really should

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.610 
been using lately which i really should
do<00:00:55.260> more<00:00:55.469> often<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.059> i<00:00:57.600> don't<00:00:57.809> know<00:00:57.930> i<00:00:58.140> might

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
do more often and i don't know i might

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.000 
do more often and i don't know i might
have<00:00:58.800> used<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.160> much<00:00:59.489> space<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.420> i<00:01:01.010> just

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
have used that much space but i just

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.650 
have used that much space but i just
find<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.370> hard<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.879> believe<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.390> actually

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
find it hard to believe that I actually

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.560 
find it hard to believe that I actually
have<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.710> guess<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.610> should<00:01:05.909> try<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.210> start

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
have I guess I should try to start

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.230 
have I guess I should try to start
backing<00:01:06.840> things<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.680> DVDs<00:01:08.280> again<00:01:08.700> which<00:01:09.000> I

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
backing things up on DVDs again which I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.170 
backing things up on DVDs again which I
haven't<00:01:09.720> really<00:01:09.900> been<00:01:10.140> doing<00:01:10.200> either<00:01:11.180> I'm

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
haven't really been doing either I'm

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.760 
haven't really been doing either I'm
getting<00:01:12.869> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.200> bad<00:01:13.439> about<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:13.920> doing<00:01:14.159> that

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
getting kind of bad about not doing that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.070 
getting kind of bad about not doing that
so<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> don't<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.310> maybe<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:18.330> used<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
so I don't know maybe I have used that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.820 
so I don't know maybe I have used that
much<00:01:19.470> space<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.720> didn't<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.049> but

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
much space and I just didn't know it but

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.550 
much space and I just didn't know it but
I<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:24.000> don't<00:01:24.150> really<00:01:24.509> know<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.049> could

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I just don't really know what I could

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.990 
I just don't really know what I could
have<00:01:25.680> used<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.619> I'm<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
have used it for so I'm going to have to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600 
have used it for so I'm going to have to
do<00:01:30.210> some<00:01:30.420> more<00:01:30.570> research<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.430> if

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
do some more research on that and see if

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.080 
do some more research on that and see if
I<00:01:32.759> actually<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:34.159> there<00:01:35.159> might<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.400> some<00:01:35.820> kind

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
I actually have there might be some kind

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.840 
I actually have there might be some kind
of<00:01:36.240> malware<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.340> something<00:01:38.340> only<00:01:38.549> that's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
of malware or something only that's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.600 
of malware or something only that's
taking<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.630> much<00:01:39.810> space<00:01:40.310> that<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.400> don't

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
taking up that much space that I don't

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.719 
taking up that much space that I don't
know<00:01:41.759> about<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> haven't<00:01:42.720> found<00:01:43.140> any<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.799> did

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
know about but I haven't found any I did

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.429 
know about but I haven't found any I did
the<00:01:44.850> scan<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.270> morning<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.869> nothing<00:01:46.170> showed

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the scan this morning and nothing showed

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.649 
the scan this morning and nothing showed
up<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> i<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:49.380> know<00:01:49.880> maybe<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.420> need<00:01:51.630> a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
up so i don't know maybe I just need a

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.539 
up so i don't know maybe I just need a
better<00:01:51.990> hard<00:01:52.380> drive<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.970> bigger<00:01:54.210> one

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
better hard drive and the bigger one

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.340 
better hard drive and the bigger one
bigger<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.759> always<00:01:56.880> better

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.780 

anyway<00:02:01.350> i'm<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:02.220> go<00:02:02.370> ahead<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.520> wrap

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
anyway i'm going to go ahead and wrap

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.890 
anyway i'm going to go ahead and wrap
this<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:03.240> before<00:02:03.300> i<00:02:03.660> get<00:02:03.840> soaked<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.040> i<00:02:05.900> guess

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
this up before i get soaked so i guess

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.240 
this up before i get soaked so i guess
i'll<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.680> later<00:02:08.240> bye
