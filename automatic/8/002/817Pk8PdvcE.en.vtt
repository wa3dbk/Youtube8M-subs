me again well I guess we should start at
the<00:00:28.410> basics<00:00:28.769> what<00:00:28.890> are<00:00:29.010> stem<00:00:29.189> cells<00:00:29.689> as<00:00:30.689> stem

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the basics what are stem cells as stem

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.200 
the basics what are stem cells as stem
cells<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:31.410> undifferentiated<00:00:32.160> cells<00:00:32.820> that

cells are undifferentiated cells that

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.240 
cells are undifferentiated cells that
that<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> body<00:00:33.899> uses<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.620> heal<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.130> repair

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that the body uses to heal and repair

that the body uses to heal and repair
itself<00:00:35.760> researchers<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.750> found<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.020> these

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
itself researchers have found that these

stem cells are in a plentiful supply in

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.430 
stem cells are in a plentiful supply in
teeth<00:00:41.600> they're<00:00:42.600> they're<00:00:42.989> found<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.320> all

it's a perfect opportunity to banks
themselves<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.300> dr.<00:00:54.660> Briggs<00:00:54.870> how<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.320> stem

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
themselves so dr. Briggs how are stem

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.069 
themselves so dr. Briggs how are stem
cells<00:00:55.680> currently<00:00:56.640> used<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> treatment<00:00:57.780> of

cells currently used in the treatment of
systemic<00:00:58.739> disease<00:00:59.930> there<00:01:00.930> are<00:01:01.020> many

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
systemic disease there are many

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.070 
systemic disease there are many
illnesses<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.579> stem<00:01:02.879> cells<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.809> be

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
illnesses that that stem cells can be

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.630 
illnesses that that stem cells can be
used<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.470> treat<00:01:04.710> such<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.250> Parkinson's

disease diabetes arthritis and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.140 
disease diabetes arthritis and
researchers<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.110> finding<00:01:10.500> ways<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.250> use

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
researchers are finding ways to use

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.690 
researchers are finding ways to use
those<00:01:12.390> stem<00:01:12.689> cells<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.979> treat<00:01:14.010> each<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.580> those

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
those stem cells to treat each of those

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.670 
those stem cells to treat each of those
diseases<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.810> we're<00:01:15.930> discussing<00:01:16.259> about<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
diseases so we're discussing about the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.890 
diseases so we're discussing about the
idea<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> taking<00:01:17.220> dental<00:01:17.850> stem<00:01:18.150> cells<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
idea of taking dental stem cells can you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.859 
idea of taking dental stem cells can you
talk<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.439> process<00:01:20.390> stem<00:01:21.390> cells<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
talk about that process stem cells and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.260 
talk about that process stem cells and
collecting<00:01:22.619> them<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.490> controversial

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
collecting them is is a controversial

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.480 
collecting them is is a controversial
topic<00:01:24.619> because<00:01:25.619> there<00:01:25.680> are<00:01:25.979> two<00:01:26.100> types<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
topic because there are two types of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.310 
topic because there are two types of
stem<00:01:26.700> cells<00:01:26.970> there's<00:01:27.240> adult<00:01:27.479> stem<00:01:27.810> cells<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
stem cells there's adult stem cells and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.719

okay<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.349> why<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:10.860> somebody<00:02:11.160> need<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> bank

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
okay so why would somebody need to bank

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.710 
okay so why would somebody need to bank
and<00:02:12.629> prison

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
and prison

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.420 
and prison
they're<00:02:13.930> stem<00:02:14.260> cells<00:02:14.560> why<00:02:14.770> not<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.190> take

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
they're stem cells why not just take

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.660 
they're stem cells why not just take
them<00:02:15.670> when<00:02:15.850> they<00:02:16.000> are<00:02:16.150> needed<00:02:16.650> well<00:02:17.650> many<00:02:18.430> many

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
them when they are needed well many many

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.910 
them when they are needed well many many
people<00:02:19.240> have<00:02:19.600> already<00:02:19.930> banked<00:02:20.350> stem<00:02:20.680> cells

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920
