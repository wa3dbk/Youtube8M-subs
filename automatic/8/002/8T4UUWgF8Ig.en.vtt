00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.509 
Rhino so we just select that click on
open<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.260> we'll<00:02:32.260> see<00:02:32.470> down<00:02:32.830> here<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.459> has

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
open and we'll see down here it has

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.089 
open and we'll see down here it has
loaded<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.660> into<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:35.019> plugins<00:02:35.470> window<00:02:35.860> in

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
loaded it into this plugins window in

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.020 
loaded it into this plugins window in
the<00:02:36.310> Rhino<00:02:36.519> options<00:02:37.480> window<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.590> Rhino<00:02:39.190> so

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
the Rhino options window of Rhino so

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.030 
the Rhino options window of Rhino so
it's<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.269> grasshopper<00:02:40.959> type<00:02:41.410> utility

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
it's like grasshopper type utility

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.420 
it's like grasshopper type utility
loaded<00:02:42.849> yes<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.140> should<00:02:44.319> be<00:02:44.349> loaded<00:02:44.769> click

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
loaded yes so it should be loaded click

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.979 
loaded yes so it should be loaded click
on<00:02:45.550> OK<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.410> back<00:02:47.410> up<00:02:47.680> at<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.010> command<00:02:48.640> line<00:02:48.989> we

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
on OK and back up at the command line we

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.710 
on OK and back up at the command line we
can<00:02:50.260> type<00:02:50.500> in<00:02:50.620> grasshopper<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:52.360> can<00:02:52.510> see

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
can type in grasshopper and you can see

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.990 
can type in grasshopper and you can see
it<00:02:52.840> already<00:02:53.080> populates<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:54.010> for<00:02:54.280> us<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:54.700> it

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
it already populates it for us so it

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.940 
it already populates it for us so it
knows<00:02:55.239> it's<00:02:55.450> noses<00:02:56.200> there<00:02:56.350> we'll<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.769> click

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
knows it's noses there we'll just click

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.050 
knows it's noses there we'll just click
on<00:02:57.040> enter<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:58.019> grasshopper<00:02:59.019> will<00:02:59.230> load<00:02:59.620> up

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
on enter and grasshopper will load up

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.080 
on enter and grasshopper will load up
this<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:02.010> straight<00:03:03.010> grasshopper<00:03:03.700> window

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
this is the straight grasshopper window

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.039 
this is the straight grasshopper window
it's<00:03:04.799> within<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:06.250> Rhino<00:03:06.670> window<00:03:07.180> just<00:03:07.840> like

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
it's within the Rhino window just like

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.039 
it's within the Rhino window just like
any<00:03:08.230> other<00:03:08.380> window<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.400> might<00:03:09.670> have<00:03:09.880> open<00:03:10.090> we

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
any other window you might have open we

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.870 
any other window you might have open we
can<00:03:11.200> minimize<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.160> minimizes<00:03:12.340> it

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
can minimize it and it minimizes it

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.089 
can minimize it and it minimizes it
within<00:03:13.110> rhino<00:03:14.110> down<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> left<00:03:14.890> hand

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
within rhino down to the left hand

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.370 
within rhino down to the left hand
corner<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.610> then<00:03:16.180> we<00:03:16.330> can<00:03:16.480> minimize<00:03:16.870> rhino

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
corner and then we can minimize rhino

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.120 
corner and then we can minimize rhino
and<00:03:17.769> it's<00:03:18.459> no<00:03:19.180> longer<00:03:19.480> there<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.890> go<00:03:21.100> back

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
and it's no longer there so to go back

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.979 
and it's no longer there so to go back
to<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.670> we'll<00:03:21.850> have<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.150> open<00:03:22.180> up<00:03:22.540> our<00:03:22.720> Rhino

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
to it we'll have to open up our Rhino

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.580 
to it we'll have to open up our Rhino
model<00:03:23.739> again<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.850> then<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.660> grasshopper

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
model again and then the grasshopper

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.580 
model again and then the grasshopper
window<00:03:26.799> will<00:03:26.920> pop<00:03:27.130> up<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.140> grasshopper

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
window will pop up so the grasshopper

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.670 
window will pop up so the grasshopper
window<00:03:29.829> itself<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.459> really<00:03:30.970> pretty<00:03:31.180> basic<00:03:31.680> we

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
window itself is really pretty basic we

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.420 
window itself is really pretty basic we
can<00:03:32.920> enlarge<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.720> see<00:03:35.380> more<00:03:35.799> of<00:03:35.829> our<00:03:36.100> what

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
can enlarge it to see more of our what

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.020 
can enlarge it to see more of our what
we're<00:03:36.579> doing<00:03:36.850> in<00:03:36.970> grasshopper<00:03:38.310> at<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.489> top<00:03:39.730> it

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
we're doing in grasshopper at the top it

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.960 
we're doing in grasshopper at the top it
has<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.420> basic<00:03:40.630> file<00:03:41.140> edit<00:03:41.650> view<00:03:41.970> drop-down

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
has the basic file edit view drop-down

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.599 
has the basic file edit view drop-down
menus<00:03:43.600> this<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.410> where<00:03:44.560> we'll<00:03:44.709> go<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.069> create<00:03:45.549> a

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
menus this is where we'll go to create a

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.440 
menus this is where we'll go to create a
new<00:03:45.760> definition<00:03:45.970> open<00:03:46.690> definition<00:03:47.230> save<00:03:47.560> them

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
new definition open definition save them

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.030 
new definition open definition save them
different<00:03:49.450> cut<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.750> paste<00:03:49.959> options<00:03:50.470> how<00:03:50.980> to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
different cut and paste options how to

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.650 
different cut and paste options how to
view<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.579> and<00:03:52.019> then<00:03:53.019> some<00:03:53.380> more<00:03:53.590> technical

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
view it and then some more technical

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.289 
view it and then some more technical
technical<00:03:55.660> things<00:03:55.900> as<00:03:56.139> well<00:03:57.090> over<00:03:58.090> on<00:03:58.180> the

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
technical things as well over on the

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.300 
technical things as well over on the
right<00:03:58.480> side<00:03:58.510> we'll<00:03:59.440> see<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.889> there's

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
right side we'll see that there's

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.729 
right side we'll see that there's
another<00:04:00.850> drop-down<00:04:01.239> window<00:04:01.720> that<00:04:04.500> works<00:04:05.500> with

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
another drop-down window that works with

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.640 
another drop-down window that works with
different<00:04:06.190> definitions<00:04:06.940> so<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:07.450> can<00:04:08.079> open<00:04:08.530> up

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
different definitions so I can open up

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.059 
different definitions so I can open up
one<00:04:08.889> file<00:04:09.579> open<00:04:10.239> definition<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:10.989> I<00:04:11.769> just<00:04:11.950> have

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
one file open definition and I just have

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:19.590 
one file open definition and I just have
one<00:04:12.250> on<00:04:12.370> my<00:04:12.519> desktop<00:04:12.880> right<00:04:13.150> here<00:04:18.090> it's<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.150> very

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
one on my desktop right here it's a very

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.300 
one on my desktop right here it's a very
small<00:04:19.900> definition

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
small definition

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.900 
small definition
and<00:04:22.320> it's<00:04:23.320> called<00:04:23.530> edition<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.700> says

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
and it's called edition so it says

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.080 
and it's called edition so it says
Edition<00:04:25.330> right<00:04:25.510> here<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:25.980> can<00:04:26.980> also<00:04:27.070> open<00:04:27.880> up<00:04:27.970> a

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
Edition right here I can also open up a

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.010 
Edition right here I can also open up a
new<00:04:28.300> new<00:04:28.810> definition<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:30.840> save<00:04:31.840> this

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
new new definition and save this

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.770 
new new definition and save this

I'll<00:04:35.380> call<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:36.150> first

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
I'll call this first

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.490 
I'll call this first
this<00:04:38.260> is<00:04:38.380> our<00:04:38.470> first<00:04:38.680> grasshopper<00:04:39.520> definition

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
this is our first grasshopper definition

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.780 
this is our first grasshopper definition
it's<00:04:41.500> blank<00:04:41.830> right<00:04:42.040> now<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:42.250> don't<00:04:42.490> have

other definition that we had open and

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.270 
other definition that we had open and
then<00:04:52.870> we<00:04:53.050> could<00:04:53.169> just<00:04:53.200> click<00:04:53.530> on<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.800> again<00:04:54.070> and

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
then we could just click on it again and

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.620 
then we could just click on it again and
go<00:04:54.370> back<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.640> first<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:55.360> is<00:04:55.510> the

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
go back to first and this is the

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.920 
go back to first and this is the
definition<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:56.169> we<00:04:56.470> just<00:04:56.800> open<00:04:57.130> right<00:04:57.310> now

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
definition that we just open right now

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.930 
definition that we just open right now
so<00:04:58.930> that's<00:04:59.110> how<00:04:59.290> we<00:04:59.800> can<00:05:00.010> use<00:05:00.669> different

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
so that's how we can use different

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.409 
so that's how we can use different
definitions<00:05:01.150> all<00:05:01.840> at<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.080> same<00:05:02.260> time<00:05:03.419> below

this top this top toolbar we have the

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.600 
this top this top toolbar we have the
buttons<00:05:07.750> toolbar<00:05:08.200> and<00:05:08.500> this<00:05:09.070> is<00:05:09.280> pretty<00:05:09.520> much

anything<00:05:09.940> you'll<00:05:10.270> need<00:05:10.510> in<00:05:10.810> grasshopper<00:05:11.710> is

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
anything you'll need in grasshopper is

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.460 
anything you'll need in grasshopper is
right<00:05:12.460> here<00:05:12.669> in<00:05:12.820> its<00:05:12.940> own<00:05:13.090> button<00:05:13.479> there's

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
right here in its own button there's

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.790 
right here in its own button there's
different<00:05:15.310> tabs<00:05:15.600> these<00:05:16.600> are<00:05:16.840> all<00:05:16.960> separated

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
different tabs these are all separated

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.640 
different tabs these are all separated
into<00:05:17.950> different<00:05:18.570> tools<00:05:19.570> that<00:05:19.750> we<00:05:19.870> can<00:05:20.080> use<00:05:20.380> and

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
into different tools that we can use and

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.830 
into different tools that we can use and
they<00:05:21.639> all<00:05:21.820> have<00:05:21.970> different<00:05:22.000> buttons<00:05:22.660> within

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
they all have different buttons within

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.310 
they all have different buttons within
them<00:05:23.850> we'll<00:05:24.850> go<00:05:25.000> into<00:05:25.360> more<00:05:25.870> about<00:05:26.110> all<00:05:26.229> these

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
them we'll go into more about all these

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.159 
them we'll go into more about all these
specific<00:05:26.800> buttons<00:05:27.070> later<00:05:27.540> but<00:05:28.540> this<00:05:28.750> is<00:05:28.810> where

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
specific buttons later but this is where

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.659 
specific buttons later but this is where
everything<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:29.680> need<00:05:29.950> to<00:05:30.220> know<00:05:30.250> in

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
everything you need to know in

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.460 
everything you need to know in
grasshopper<00:05:31.060> should<00:05:31.720> have<00:05:31.960> its<00:05:32.080> own<00:05:32.229> button

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
grasshopper should have its own button

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.750 
grasshopper should have its own button
right<00:05:32.650> here<00:05:33.510> below<00:05:34.510> that<00:05:34.780> is<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:35.050> workspace

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
right here below that is the workspace

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.570 
right here below that is the workspace
we<00:05:36.760> can<00:05:36.789> see<00:05:37.090> how<00:05:37.240> that<00:05:37.330> that<00:05:38.080> works<00:05:38.380> in<00:05:38.650> this

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
we can see how that that works in this

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.310 
we can see how that that works in this
other<00:05:39.820> definition<00:05:40.479> that<00:05:40.539> I<00:05:40.600> had<00:05:40.720> open<00:05:41.020> called

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
other definition that I had open called

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.969 
other definition that I had open called
addition<00:05:41.970> here<00:05:42.970> are<00:05:43.180> some<00:05:43.630> buttons<00:05:43.900> in<00:05:44.289> the

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
addition here are some buttons in the

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.650 
addition here are some buttons in the
workspace<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.550> can<00:05:45.789> right<00:05:46.060> click<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.539> hold

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
workspace I can right click and hold

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.900 
workspace I can right click and hold
down<00:05:46.900> to<00:05:47.200> pan<00:05:47.500> this<00:05:48.100> is<00:05:48.280> great<00:05:48.550> if<00:05:48.669> I<00:05:48.760> have

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
down to pan this is great if I have

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.150 
down to pan this is great if I have
large<00:05:49.090> definitions<00:05:49.810> and<00:05:49.930> need<00:05:50.080> to<00:05:50.169> get<00:05:50.979> all

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
large definitions and need to get all

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.540 
large definitions and need to get all
the<00:05:51.280> way<00:05:51.400> around<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:52.120> workspace<00:05:52.630> I<00:05:53.430> can<00:05:54.430> also

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
the way around the workspace I can also

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.440 
the way around the workspace I can also
zoom<00:05:54.669> in<00:05:55.120> with<00:05:55.390> a<00:05:55.660> scroll<00:05:56.440> wheel<00:05:56.590> on<00:05:56.830> a<00:05:56.890> mouse

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
zoom in with a scroll wheel on a mouse

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.440 
zoom in with a scroll wheel on a mouse
this<00:05:58.450> is<00:05:58.510> just<00:05:59.110> like<00:05:59.260> rhino<00:05:59.710> or<00:05:59.970> many<00:06:00.970> other<00:06:01.150> 3d

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
this is just like rhino or many other 3d

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.950 
this is just like rhino or many other 3d

on the workspace so if I am out here and
kind<00:06:15.610> of<00:06:15.640> lost<00:06:15.850> I<00:06:16.270> can<00:06:16.720> look<00:06:16.900> down<00:06:17.080> to<00:06:17.229> the
