00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.680
 This is the first van that leaves the 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.230
 avocado sprout of cambita san 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.539
 CristÃ³bal financed by the government 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.090
 central through the special fund for 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.039
 the agricultural development feda with 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.320
 destination to the New York market 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:32.680
 in the intention to send two 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.430
 weekly containers but tomorrow the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.399
 Friday comes out this first container and 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.879
 then the possibility that every week 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:46.870
 two containers go to the market 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:50.829
 New York produced by the cluster of 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.500
 avocado from here of this community that 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.059
 has come to improve the conditions of 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.059
 life of both producers and 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.610
 producers and the community in their 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.450
 whole because they have been integrated into 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.930
 work people from the community that 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.869
 allows to change the life of the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.509
 more dispossessed people in that I did not have a 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.780
 source of work is a policy of 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.680
 central government 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.890
 to combat the problem of unemployment and 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.340
 poverty and it's the way that the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.990
 government is doing this job 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.170
 facilitating the use of small and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.180
 medium producers with the objective of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.240
 energize the rural economy so that 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.670
 make a change in Dominican society 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.700
 in investment in cambita are 32 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 million pesos between cost and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.660
 avocado cooperative because also 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.030
 there is a cooperative that was made a 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.820
 financing to improve 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.039
 plantations that is the genetics that is 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.679
 improve it then there is an investment of 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.710
 32 million but if necessary 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.940
 invest more money the central government 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.670
 is in the availability 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.650
 of that does the president live 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.020
 concerned about the rural sectors of the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.960
 field because he says he 's from a country 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.370
 that lives from the agricultural and livestock 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.920
 if there is not a development in the economy 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.200
 agricultural sector there can not be a 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.040
 development in the general sense of the country 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.210
 the cluster has an enrollment of 225 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.950
 producers of which then the great 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.100
 Most are a natural area 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.230
 change but we have 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.880
 at a national level we support each other 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.350
 producers wherever they are 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.850
 the avocado grower but 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.310
 fundamentally that this project is 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.180
 to support producers of 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.310
 cambita we have in addition to those 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.260
 225 families, another 125 families 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.780
 we have a population of 40 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.550
 approximately 40 young people who work 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.400
 with us men and women in the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.580
 process but I must tell you that this 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.490
 year in the month of February this project 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.100
 was closed the producers with their 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.380
 product on farms 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.660
 distributors at the level of united states 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.400
 waiting for the product the producers 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.630
 with debt in the agricultural bank and that 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.550
 product was missing because of lack 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.650
 of resources Mr. President in the 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.010
 surprise visit that made cambita came 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.280
 Here he saw the project and he promised us 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.670
 he immediately met with support for 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.670
 marketing 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.340
 according to the time of grace that there 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.020
 that to give you this motion is the production and 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.360
 we also discuss interest rates 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.150
 benefits very low but but for 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.870
 can help us other groups of 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.870
 people who come 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:05.349
 and work to improve the 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.690
 marketing of avocados this 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.910
 year immediately the harvest began 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.090
 il cem it was last week as 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.900
 us with the help of the feda we 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.250
 immediately we started to take out what 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.660
 we did last week for some 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.250
 rain details but we had 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.160
 last week's commitment to 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.020
 take one or two containers to one 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.760
 company but I must tell you started with 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.919
 Antonio to that company is going to take two 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.510
 containers but we have 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.520
 demand at least for six or seven 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.410
 weeks and we thought to work so 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.200
 minus four because we have the ability to 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.180
 them but really this project is 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.280
 running is open is in 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.040
 ability to take the product out of 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.350
 producers thanks to the help to the 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.620
 presence that the president danilo 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.229
 medina then came here cambita and did not leave 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.000
 this project can not stand me 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.830
 I will support it and the results are 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.660
 these this year we have no problems with 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.180
 resources because they have reached us in the 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.710
 moment they change 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.470
 that's why we understand that 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.060
 initiatives like this as the former 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.419
 president has to continue to donate 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.220
 antonio and there's a lot of area in the country that 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.949
 are needing this kind of 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.440
 support and a large part of the companies 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.870
 group that the president has supported 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.009
 one way or another they are growing and it is 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.009
 a sample of it
