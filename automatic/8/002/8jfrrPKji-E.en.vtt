00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:06.000
 and compass and welcome to another new 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:10.499
 video as you saw it in the title of ls 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.719
 1.27 and 1.29 for large cars 5 online 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:15.879
 soon with the logo name ok and 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.279
 this was a topic on which I wanted to play 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.980
 today since recently the 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.160
 user jean 22 better known as jean 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.859
 22 95 on twitter that if you do not remember 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.960
 of him or they do not know him he was a user 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.570
 that filtered things not like the bomb 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.489
 termites like things from robberies and 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.469
 many more things and in the end always 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.360
 it was coming out or was getting the 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.370
 codes of the game I reviewed it very 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.530
 background and found things that could 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.300
 be it from s p's futures there was no 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.829
 some things that did not come out and others 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.050
 things that if they left but in the end 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.180
 many things that he predicted 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.550
 final they ended up coming out and that gave 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.699
 something more credibility because said 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.730
 user has found a new code and 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.250
 they may be watching it on screen ok and 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.750
 as they see it there says more or less that it was 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.699
 On August 20, I had been 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.320
 happened to bring them and I said the end of 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.750
 week I will bring them with a little 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.970
 more calm and better explained 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.760
 they tell us there that he was looking 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.370
 some things and that I found this 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.470
 logo code ok but before we go to 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.630
 investigate everything that is at your 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.360
 around as you see it here it does not come out 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.460
 first one that is going to go and how 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.520
 come come the burrito he leads and the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.729
 helmet and the bayern and what does that mean 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.310
 because that code of April and of is the 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.830
 code that good the code more than anything 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.530
 one way is the code that was given to 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.360
 said tlc of what was doing this of 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.250
 muggings not as they see out the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.369
 burrito the pound and those who were in 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.190
 those of the robberies right after we see 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.470
 the one that come with the name of fh and here 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.430
 with what we get the innovation and the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.550
 kutxa just below we would see what would be 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.130
 the code of lt and we get what with the 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.649
 western 2 and the massacre 2 and the mouse loader 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.750
 2 and the slam for no but as you see it 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.649
 always rockstargames when you put 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.440
 some codes does not put the name of the 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.840
 tlc original let's not assume that of something 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.819
 have in the ghost in game I do not know 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.610
 in the codes of the game but it takes 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.610
 the lux code ok now we can see 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.650
 how they see it comes out x m2 and how they see us 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.290
 it comes out some codes I suppose it is 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.140
 xm two can be the Christmas two already 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.120
 that x and m would mean like christmas and 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.860
 besides that the 2 would mean the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.019
 second Christmas in which they were taken 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.000
 some cars and below only some 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.760
 codes is something that can be very 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.790
 dispensable and can be given no and fair 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.670
 down we can see it from us 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.220
 lux not take the code as they see the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.400
 Lux code was the dirty money part 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.519
 1 and lux 2 was the dirty money part 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.549
 2 ok and right up down already underlined in 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.069
 the red frame we see a new code that 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:04.200
 It ensures that the user was not and takes 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.200
 the name of fm ms 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.299
 lÃ¶w ok then a lot of things come up here 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.640
 that emerges first that nothing that maybe 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.410
 the dlc that does not know about and maybe we 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.170
 something soon comes in addition to that too 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.510
 we have to remember that recently 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.140
 rockstar games had confirmed us of 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.790
 what was going 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.590
 the new tool I do not suppose this 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.420
 new tool will come with this dlc 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.970
 but they still have it a bit like 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.530
 surprise ok now another thing that a lot 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.740
 people were saying and I also told them 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.230
 had said is that maybe all this was going 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.090
 to be related to the subject one and 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.910
 the low rider theme that if you do not know what it is 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.860
 this is a good culture of cars a 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.540
 little alone we could not say it of 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.670
 some way if they remember that I have gone up 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.860
 videos of the mobile cholo and all those 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.170
 things or cholo's car and all these 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.900
 things that were like elba pete chinese and 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.550
 this kind of low rider type vehicles 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.250
 It is believed that in this update 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.860
 they will come pure low rider vehicles 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.380
 although you also have to take into account 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.239
 that the word low in English is not only 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.459
 means the low rider but also 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.560
 means down not and also another way 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.290
 to interpret what the cars would be 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.660
 the lowest are sports vehicles 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.150
 since if we take into account the centor not 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.070
 it's a very short vehicle that is 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.169
 very low and is very close to the floor 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.180
 then there may also be that you do not 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.550
 include vehicles of this species but 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.710
 the most important thing and what I most believe 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.300
 is that they have only put it in code 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.030
 and the dl is going to take a man 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.370
 totally different and maybe not even 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.020
 contain lowrider vehicles not because 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.289
 recently we have also had 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.479
 many like the Chinese daddy the the other who 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.610
 it was and there have been many low vehicles 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.410
 rider lately not then boys 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.150
 as they see it, it was something I wanted 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.250
 share this code with you today 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.050
 has been found and will only be a thing of 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.460
 wait for it to come out and see what we 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.039
 I really hope I 'm pretty 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.849
 excited I tell you I do not think everything 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.710
 this is due to an update of the 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.840
 low rider can not be anything else 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.630
 have put that code just because 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.610
 what do I know suppose I make a video not 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.320
 I am the video that the man I'm going to 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.180
 put in the end but nothing else for 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.820
 renderize what I process it I put the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.830
 name xl3 not just because I was 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.960
 that name happened and it is already can not 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.849
 put it that way and maybe it does not have 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.310
 some sense not just put it 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.840
 so as not to repeat names or something else like that 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.610
 that kids follow in their opinion the 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.169
 comments do not forget to leave your like

 tell your opinion in the comments 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.960
 tell me what kind of vehicles 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.030
 would like to see in a following dlc to 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.969
 me and then you will know that those who 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.340
 I like motorcycles 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.710
 bat type and 801 and sports cars 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.270
 as project 20 the ader and in that 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.189
 environment that the truth is cars that I 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.840
 love and enjoy very much when 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:54.159
 I do careers with my friends so 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.569
 chavos league in his opinion in the 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.490
 comments what do you think of all this topic 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.990
 about that they think that you are going 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.669
 to come I say that only this is a 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.620
 code and the name is going to be totally 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.780
 different from what we had seen not already 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.300
 yes and ghost in game had the name of 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.270
 luxe is very obvious or very easy to 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.000
 guess that all this is based on 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.830
 something totally different we put to 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.900
 you have a code or you go to the 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.270
 school and they give them a code and that code 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.190
 it is obviously very different from his name 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.139
 real, nothing else is a code for 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.210
 have you there and do not get confused with 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.639
 another student who may have the 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.289
 same name is the easiest thing to say and 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.120
 not only because he says the loan can be 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:34.270
 that brings the tone but can also 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.939
 they decide to include it and they put 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.349
 this to make sense of the code like this 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.060
 what guys I hope you liked 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.740
 this video I do not roll up a bit 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.389
 do not forget to leave your like tell me your 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.090
 opinion the comments remember that if 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:48.580
 they want to see the twitter of 31 code 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.230
 texts of jean 22 I leave you just in 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:54.570
 the description so without more than 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.570
 say goodbye or goodbye
