00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
concept that I address in our last video

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.400 
concept that I address in our last video
here<00:00:31.410> about<00:00:32.270> increasing<00:00:33.270> our<00:00:33.390> strength<00:00:33.780> by

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
here about increasing our strength by

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.680 
here about increasing our strength by
getting<00:00:34.739> rid<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.980> our<00:00:35.130> energy<00:00:35.550> leaks<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> most

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
getting rid of our energy leaks and most

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.900 
getting rid of our energy leaks and most
often<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.200> every<00:00:37.469> single<00:00:37.739> exercise<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
often on every single exercise one of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.400 
often on every single exercise one of
the<00:00:39.000> biggest<00:00:39.239> energy<00:00:39.360> leaks<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.989> through<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the biggest energy leaks is through the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.200 
the biggest energy leaks is through the
core<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.800> that's<00:00:41.370> because<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> lot<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.030> us

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
core and that's because a lot of us

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.750 
core and that's because a lot of us
don't<00:00:42.600> know<00:00:42.780> how<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.680> engage<00:00:43.860> our<00:00:44.399> core

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
don't know how to engage our core

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.520 
don't know how to engage our core
properly<00:00:45.510> I've<00:00:45.989> said<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> time

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
properly I've said all the time

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.529 
properly I've said all the time

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
does he mean by engage well it's more

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.150 
does he mean by engage well it's more
than<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.780> abs<00:00:51.989> guys<00:00:52.350> you'll<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
than just your abs guys you'll see the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.700 
than just your abs guys you'll see the
core<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.670> obviously<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.750> whole<00:00:55.260> group<00:00:55.500> of

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
core is obviously a whole group of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.930 
core is obviously a whole group of
muscles<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.160> go<00:00:56.340> all<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> way<00:00:56.579> around<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
muscles that go all the way around the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.270 
muscles that go all the way around the
back<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.690> through<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> front<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.559> see<00:00:58.800> up

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
back up through the front that we see up

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.700 
back up through the front that we see up
underneath<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> rib<00:01:00.210> cage<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.780> how<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.530> get

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
underneath the rib cage so how do we get

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.000 
underneath the rib cage so how do we get
those<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.309> contract<00:01:02.969> together<00:01:03.589> really<00:01:04.589> simple

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
those to contract together really simple

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.740 
those to contract together really simple
guys<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.489> exercise<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> incorporate

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
guys is that exercise and I incorporate

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.080 
guys is that exercise and I incorporate
in<00:01:06.930> my<00:01:06.990> own<00:01:07.560> training<00:01:07.830> routine<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.729> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
in my own training routine is just a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.660 
in my own training routine is just a
static<00:01:09.590> isometric<00:01:10.590> move<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.010> some<00:01:11.490> people

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
static isometric move and some people

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.070 
static isometric move and some people
are<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.540> some<00:01:12.750> metrics

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
are going to say I like some metrics

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.190 
are going to say I like some metrics
that's<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.830> 1980s<00:01:14.430> no<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.810> really

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that's so 1980s no that's not really

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.050 
that's so 1980s no that's not really
there<00:01:16.680> used<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.040> full<00:01:17.250> workout<00:01:17.640> programs

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
there used to be full workout programs

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.060 
there used to be full workout programs
based<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> symmetric<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.680> there's<00:01:19.890> always

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
based on a symmetric but there's always

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.070 
based on a symmetric but there's always
a<00:01:20.189> place<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.490> them<00:01:20.820> okay<00:01:21.299> especially<00:01:21.540> mixed

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
a place for them okay especially mixed

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.620 
a place for them okay especially mixed
into<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.619> workout<00:01:23.189> program<00:01:23.400> that's<00:01:24.180> utilizing

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
into a workout program that's utilizing

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.840 
into a workout program that's utilizing
typical<00:01:25.619> concentric<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.250> eccentric<00:01:26.310> moves

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
typical concentric and eccentric moves

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.719 
typical concentric and eccentric moves
so<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.360> isometric<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.799> want<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.130> grab

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
so an isometric what you want to do grab

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.569 
so an isometric what you want to do grab
something<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.630> heavy<00:01:31.020> okay<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:32.189> happens

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
something really heavy okay what happens

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.980 
something really heavy okay what happens
is<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.820> soon<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.210> grab<00:01:33.479> something<00:01:33.840> heavy

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
is as soon as I grab something heavy

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
is as soon as I grab something heavy
you'll<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> dumbbell<00:01:35.040> I'll<00:01:35.280> plate<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
you'll get a dumbbell I'll plate a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.969 
you'll get a dumbbell I'll plate a
kettlebell<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.930> case<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.470> soon<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.920> do

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
kettlebell in this case as soon as I do

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.840 
kettlebell in this case as soon as I do
that<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.970> side<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.689> my<00:01:40.170> core<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.520> side<00:01:41.729> of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
that this side of my core this side of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.899 
that this side of my core this side of
my<00:01:41.939> body<00:01:42.150> has<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.320> contract<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:44.100> prevent<00:01:44.700> this

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
my body has to contract to prevent this

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.660 
my body has to contract to prevent this
thing<00:01:44.970> from<00:01:45.180> dropping<00:01:45.930> me<00:01:46.200> down<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.770> okay<00:01:47.159> so

thing from dropping me down here okay so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.030 
thing from dropping me down here okay so
it<00:01:47.909> has<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.329> contract<00:01:48.540> hard<00:01:49.259> right<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.860> through

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it has to contract hard right in through

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.940 
it has to contract hard right in through
here<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.490> order<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.509> prevent<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.079> lean<00:01:52.619> if

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
here in order to prevent that lean if

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.770 
here in order to prevent that lean if
you<00:01:53.340> lean<00:01:53.549> even<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.880> little<00:01:54.149> bit<00:01:54.270> more<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.720> can

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
you lean even a little bit more you can

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230 
you lean even a little bit more you can
see<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.619> more<00:01:56.149> activation<00:01:57.149> over

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
see a little bit more activation over

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.700 
see a little bit more activation over
here<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.840> hard<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.110> me<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> speak<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
here it's hard for me to speak to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.600 
here it's hard for me to speak to
because<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.369> should<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.119> bearing<00:02:00.960> down<00:02:01.140> now<00:02:01.610> we

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
because I should be bearing down now we

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.670 
because I should be bearing down now we
talked<00:02:02.880> about<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.299> other<00:02:03.390> day<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.350> video

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
talked about the other day in that video

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.350 
talked about the other day in that video
if<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.189> haven't<00:02:05.430> seen<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.939> should<00:02:06.149> put<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
if you haven't seen it I should put a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.389 
if you haven't seen it I should put a
link<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.810> right<00:02:07.380> over<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:07.619> somewhere<00:02:08.220> you

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
link of it right over here somewhere you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.730 
link of it right over here somewhere you
have

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
have

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.650 
have
watch<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.130> video<00:02:09.280> on<00:02:09.880> how<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.120> increase<00:02:10.450> your

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
watch this video on how to increase your

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.390 
watch this video on how to increase your
strength<00:02:10.900> because<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.410> really<00:02:11.740> does<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.250> not

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
strength because it really does it's not

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.340 
strength because it really does it's not
magic<00:02:12.820> but<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.390> really<00:02:13.510> does<00:02:13.750> work<00:02:13.990> right<00:02:14.230> away

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
magic but it really does work right away

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.130 
magic but it really does work right away
you<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:15.790> able<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.060> tighten<00:02:16.480> up<00:02:16.780> and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
you have to be able to tighten up and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.290 
you have to be able to tighten up and
tighten<00:02:17.650> down<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.190> if<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:18.850> was<00:02:19.000> doing<00:02:19.090> an

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
tighten down so if I was doing an

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.810 
tighten down so if I was doing an
overhead<00:02:19.570> shoulder<00:02:19.930> press<00:02:20.370> what<00:02:21.370> you'd<00:02:21.520> see

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
overhead shoulder press what you'd see

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.620 
overhead shoulder press what you'd see
underneath<00:02:22.270> here<00:02:22.600> is<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.800> everything<00:02:24.670> tight

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
underneath here is this everything tight

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.930 
underneath here is this everything tight
tight<00:02:26.320> through<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.680> core<00:02:26.980> tight<00:02:27.580> through<00:02:27.850> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
tight through the core tight through the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.060 
tight through the core tight through the
chest<00:02:28.240> up<00:02:28.480> over<00:02:28.900> here<00:02:29.140> as<00:02:29.350> I'm<00:02:29.530> pressing

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
chest up over here as I'm pressing

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.100 
chest up over here as I'm pressing
that's<00:02:30.700> what<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:30.970> should<00:02:31.210> see<00:02:31.450> let's<00:02:31.960> just

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
that's what you should see let's just

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.930 
that's what you should see let's just
you<00:02:32.170> should<00:02:32.350> feel<00:02:32.620> because<00:02:33.370> everything<00:02:33.760> else

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
you should feel because everything else

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.420 
you should feel because everything else
becomes<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.480> lot<00:02:34.720> lighter<00:02:35.080> with<00:02:35.740> those<00:02:35.950> energy

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
becomes a lot lighter with those energy

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.910 
becomes a lot lighter with those energy
leaks<00:02:36.810> plugged<00:02:37.810> up<00:02:37.990> okay<00:02:38.440> you're<00:02:38.590> not<00:02:38.680> getting

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
leaks plugged up okay you're not getting

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.400 
leaks plugged up okay you're not getting
that<00:02:39.220> dissipation<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:40.510> me<00:02:40.750> just<00:02:41.020> standing

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
that dissipation but me just standing

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.830 
that dissipation but me just standing
here<00:02:41.470> in<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.280> contraction<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.570> long

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
here in a contraction for this long

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.230 
here in a contraction for this long
about<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.380> minute<00:02:44.800> minute<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.520> half<00:02:45.700> really

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
about a minute minute and a half really

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.380 
about a minute minute and a half really
works<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.230> core<00:02:47.500> now<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:48.520> give<00:02:48.670> myself<00:02:48.820> a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
works the core now to give myself a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.570 
works the core now to give myself a
second<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.470> break<00:02:50.710> we<00:02:51.040> obviously<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.520> to

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
second of a break we obviously have to

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.520 
second of a break we obviously have to
work<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.880> other<00:02:52.000> side<00:02:52.240> too<00:02:52.510> but<00:02:53.260> how<00:02:53.380> do<00:02:53.440> we

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
work the other side too but how do we

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.380 
work the other side too but how do we
make<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:53.890> even<00:02:53.980> more<00:02:54.130> challenging<00:02:54.850> if<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.180> do

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
make it even more challenging if we do

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
make it even more challenging if we do
think<00:02:55.840> we<00:02:56.350> have<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> strong<00:02:56.710> core<00:02:57.130> right<00:02:57.460> well

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
think we have a strong core right well

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.990 
think we have a strong core right well
you<00:02:59.410> pick<00:02:59.620> up<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.890> dumbbell<00:03:00.220> again<00:03:00.490> I'm<00:03:00.820> going

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
you pick up the dumbbell again I'm going

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.970 
you pick up the dumbbell again I'm going
to<00:03:01.060> work<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.360> side<00:03:01.600> obviously<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.740> side

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
to work this side obviously this side

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.090 
to work this side obviously this side
now<00:03:03.190> does<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.820> work<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.210> I<00:03:04.810> lift<00:03:05.140> up<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.650> leg

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
now does the work and I lift up a leg

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.900 
now does the work and I lift up a leg
okay<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.330> now<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.840> have<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.200> work<00:03:08.320> even<00:03:08.770> harder

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
okay so now I have to work even harder

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.410 
okay so now I have to work even harder
right<00:03:09.910> here

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
right here

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
right here
to<00:03:11.290> hold<00:03:11.470> back<00:03:11.650> what<00:03:12.520> do<00:03:12.640> we<00:03:12.700> do<00:03:12.880> well<00:03:13.450> we<00:03:14.260> got<00:03:14.410> a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
to hold back what do we do well we got a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.340 
to hold back what do we do well we got a
muscle<00:03:14.710> up<00:03:14.950> again<00:03:15.250> through<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.880> glute<00:03:16.350> into

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
muscle up again through the glute into

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.830 
muscle up again through the glute into
the<00:03:17.530> core<00:03:18.220> here<00:03:18.520> through<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.880> chest<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
the core here through the chest the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.750 
the core here through the chest the
shoulders<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.620> arm<00:03:20.920> everything<00:03:21.370> should<00:03:21.730> be

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
shoulders the arm everything should be

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.360 
shoulders the arm everything should be
working<00:03:21.850> together<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:23.500> really<00:03:23.740> fight<00:03:24.160> that

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
working together to really fight that

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.880 
working together to really fight that
and<00:03:24.610> most<00:03:24.970> of<00:03:25.150> all<00:03:25.270> keep<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:25.930> side<00:03:26.170> here

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
and most of all keep this side here

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.460 
and most of all keep this side here
working<00:03:27.600> we<00:03:28.600> want<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.840> get<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.960> little<00:03:29.110> bit<00:03:29.290> more

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
working we want to get a little bit more

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.120 
working we want to get a little bit more
extreme<00:03:29.970> then<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.510> stand<00:03:31.780> on<00:03:31.990> the<00:03:32.590> same<00:03:32.830> side

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
extreme then you stand on the same side

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.480 
extreme then you stand on the same side
leg<00:03:33.400> because<00:03:33.850> now<00:03:34.120> all<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:35.620> weight<00:03:35.920> wants<00:03:36.400> to

leg because now all this weight wants to

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.550 
leg because now all this weight wants to
pull<00:03:36.730> me<00:03:36.760> over<00:03:37.060> here<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:37.540> have<00:03:38.020> my<00:03:38.050> center<00:03:38.530> of

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
pull me over here I have my center of
