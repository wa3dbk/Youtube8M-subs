trying to arrange it for like a lot of
performance<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.110> as<00:02:20.040> opposed<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.640> move

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
performance and as opposed to just move

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.699 
performance and as opposed to just move
this<00:02:21.209> because<00:02:21.660> with<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.959> it's<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.350> I've<00:02:22.500> I

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709
