you can't help but get close and develop
these<00:00:05.069> close<00:00:05.370> bonds<00:00:05.940> because<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.870> spent

these close bonds because you spent

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.049

hours together in classes I'd say the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.270 
hours together in classes I'd say the
environment<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.170> good<00:00:13.469> mix<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.860> nurturing

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
environment is a good mix of nurturing

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.250 
environment is a good mix of nurturing
and<00:00:14.549> competitive<00:00:15.179> with<00:00:15.690> definitely<00:00:16.230> a

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
and competitive with definitely a

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:25.429 
and competitive with definitely a
leaning<00:00:16.680> toward<00:00:16.980> nurturing<00:00:23.779> I've<00:00:24.779> realized

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
leaning toward nurturing I've realized

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.759 
leaning toward nurturing I've realized
that<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.930> discovered<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.170> different<00:00:28.380> side

that I have discovered a different side
to<00:00:29.070> me<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.490> guess

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
to me I guess

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.540 
to me I guess
hockey's<00:00:30.929> an<00:00:31.050> aggressive<00:00:31.380> sport<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
hockey's an aggressive sport but to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.479 
hockey's an aggressive sport but to
dance<00:00:32.790> you're<00:00:33.120> able<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.450> express<00:00:33.870> yourself

emotionally<00:00:35.540> and<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.809> value<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.800> not

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
emotionally and I value that because not

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.940 
emotionally and I value that because not
everybody<00:00:39.210> wants<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.260> express<00:00:40.559> themselves

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
everybody wants to express themselves

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.100
