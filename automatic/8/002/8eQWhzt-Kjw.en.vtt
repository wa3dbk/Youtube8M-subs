 tutorial for those who have 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.180
 scadding 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.180
 it is pirate, so to speak 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.330
 They did not buy it because we were 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.850
 no original store 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.850
 this load that 'no and exc hard 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.599
 do not complain about the subject because you do not have 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.599
 theme of 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.600
 it accommodates me already 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.440
 efe 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.440
 fast rap so 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.359
 let's see what this is 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.780
 we are a very typical error look 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.840
 long time 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.510
 about skyrim's error of entering the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.370
 game see the capital move forward a little 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.370
 of session like the following 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.990
 what how to solve that you have to go to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.990
 options do not have to do any of that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.920
 do not touch anything 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.920
 and all they have to do is look 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.690
 to hardware and sound 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.980
 to minister 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.400
 audio devices speakers or their 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.400
 device 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.510
 let's go to advanced options 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.720
 and they're going to see this a complete list of 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.020
 audio format 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.240
 here you may have from the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.630
 24 bits 48,000 up to 17 the 190 and 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.630
 as well 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:17.290
 16 bits d 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.290
 up to 292 b 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.800
 you do not have to have any of these 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.490
 but the first 24 min 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.590
 and they click 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.379
 in reality 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.379
 there are different ways 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.769
 the wow 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.769
 game studios 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.530
 the capita a little smoke and they will see 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.850
 that will serve you achievement 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.540
 clearly if buying from the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.540
 yields 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.340
 to do it 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.030
 I wish they would have graduated 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.030
 see you
