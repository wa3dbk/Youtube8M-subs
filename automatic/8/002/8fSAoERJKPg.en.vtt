00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.400
 Y 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.680
 ok to begin I'll tell you a little 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.510
 with the darker base of the tub in 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.959
 actually not for much but if I 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.299
 I put it like that here it showed a little and 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.310
 here also looks darker despite 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.890
 that I have so much light on and that's why 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.990
 are seen now I believe this will be 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.460
 that the second makeup easier than 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.320
 I've done I just wanted to do it 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.600
 because it combines with my joy I'm going to start 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.349
 with a shadow aviv is slightly 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.050
 lies pearly practically matte 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.940
 I'm going to apply it on the entire eyelid 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.309
 but I'll start first only in the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.339
 basin is for what am I saying I 'm going to 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.409
 put it on the entire eyelid all 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.949
 but I'm going to put it heavily in the 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.949
 eyelid mobile 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.290
 and then I'm going to upload it in the basin 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.440
 without taking more products and even get 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.620
 to the bone of the breasts now I will apply 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.350
 this color like bronze here in the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.240
 basin but I'll try that the moment 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.880
 that stops on the mobile eyelid then 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.360
 I'm going to do it with the eye open 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.820
 you do not need to puncture it I forget that 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.950
 say with these shadows and they are super 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.830
 pigmented I have it as highlighting a 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.370
 little bit so it's a triangle 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.370
 Y 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.180
 by the way the bronze shadow 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.960
 definitely if it 's bright now 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.960
 I will apply this brilliant white just 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.700
 under the eyebrow but only below the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.700
 bow leaving all the eyebrows 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.810
 now with a small molar brush and a 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.360
 dark coffee shadow but it will be matte 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.640
 because I decide everyone bright I'm going to 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.680
 make a line throughout the part of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.210
 down but it's going to be very very thin is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.460
 simply so that the eyes look more 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.450
 great because I'm not going to apply anything of 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.450
 eyeliner inside 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.810
 I will not try that in the part of 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.550
 outside is thicker and nothing that is 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.789
 just as thin throughout the part of 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.340
 down 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.739
 now comes the delineated part would be 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.750
 great if they had a gel eyeliner 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.140
 there is one blue led that was actually 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.269
 for sale on my page but what's wrong with me 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.609
 of me and one of him at 20 on my page 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.129
 the problem is that for so long 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.079
 I have this line of beni the blue is not 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.629
 want to use it before discarding it 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.819
 only that it was very difficult I could not 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.250
 do the line just with this I started to 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.769
 help me with an angular brush but the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.439
 truth is that I just did not fuck 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.209
 because it's too hard then what 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.700
 I will do and you can follow this trick 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.549
 but I tell you something if the eyeliner in 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.530
 normal pencil no problem again 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.419
 of so much care but this one is in gel 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.549
 any gel eyeliner if you apply it 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.859
 it's heat is going to send literally 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.480
 sets fire then I will pass 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.100
 fire but only a little bit so that 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.140
 it gets softer 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.880
 and now I'm going to take it from there with the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.180
 brush and I will do the outlined with 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.180
 butts 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.580
 and on top of the blue liner on me 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.280
 I'm going to apply this blue shade tv latina 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.280
 which by the way is a bright puff 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.250
 ah 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.260
 lastly hoisting the same weird and 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.170
 apply the eyelash I'm using the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.569
 minera clean mask of him in the part 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.900
 from above and in the bottom 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.900
 do not 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.180
 the next step is optional but I think 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.639
 that adds a lot of elegance to the look 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.819
 also if you have this big part 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:55.069
 as I am here I suppose that this one is going to 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.620
 have more definition in the part of 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.139
 up so it's not black but sud and 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.090
 although it is a dark color it does not give you so 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.709
 definition as the black apart from that 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.260
 uses a tab that does not give almost 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.450
 volume but more than all length to 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.370
 continue I will continue to use lashes and 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.620
 started a life the idea is that here 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.359
 start smaller and as long as they are 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.009
 Arganda come out bigger or you can 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.900
 add singles only in the part 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.630
 outside the good thing about these eyelashes that 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.810
 I'm going to use is that they are like lashes 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.050
 individual but all on the same 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.910
 transparent band so they are too 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.889
 easy to put on and in fact sometimes I 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.330
 I prefer individual tabs and 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.830
 right now you see a lot and by 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.889
 white everywhere and they look very 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.650
 faces but I'll wait like 5 seconds more 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.680
 and then I fix them with the shooter 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.110
 eyelashes I'm going to use them a little bit no 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.060
 I will use it only to take the form 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.689
 of the natural lashes all these 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.929
 they are so big 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:56.159
 come in here that's what she said 

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:58.289
 now in terms of face makeup 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.569
 so I will follow a little more the rules and 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.579
 had contoured but will add a 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:06.919
 little bit more tanning that will be 

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:21.269
 a non-mate will be saving not alive from 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:24.860
 stroessner ex the word that I will use 

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:29.189
 normally it should be not pale pink 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.919
 but caused between the red balances like 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:34.169
 between this and this color but nothing so 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.239
 strong and I'll use this here that's 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.360
 look like a sunscreen but actually 

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:42.499
 if it has a little pink and what 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.499
 I will explain only here 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.180
 and now of course illuminator for the 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.979
 lips use the lipstick not really 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.110
 they come by name but by differences 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.539
 but it is the most expensive plane that has 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.490
 latina is what I'm using now 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.650
 same to be honest I like it first 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.729
 delineate when they are vibrant colors or 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.199
 powerful 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.000
 delineate so that the lips remain very 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.860
 well defined and then the labial but 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.710
 this time use only the lipstick so that 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.470
 see how it is 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.710
 and they do not really take off at all 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.710
 the day
