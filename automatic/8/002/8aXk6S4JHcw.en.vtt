00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.729 
great sound stage so it sounds much
broader<00:02:20.060> than<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.360> looks<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.230> fills<00:02:21.590> up

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
broader than it looks and it fills up

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.500 
broader than it looks and it fills up
the<00:02:21.800> room<00:02:21.920> really<00:02:22.280> well<00:02:22.640> even<00:02:23.180> at<00:02:23.300> high

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
the room really well even at high

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.340 
the room really well even at high
volumes

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
volumes

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.320 
volumes
it<00:02:24.500> didn't<00:02:24.920> really<00:02:25.010> distort<00:02:25.700> which<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.030> really

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
it didn't really distort which I really

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.670 
it didn't really distort which I really
like<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:26.690> it's<00:02:26.840> good<00:02:27.019> enough<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.320> throw<00:02:27.650> a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
like so it's good enough to throw a

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.979 
like so it's good enough to throw a
party<00:02:27.950> but<00:02:28.670> what<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:28.880> really<00:02:29.330> like<00:02:29.510> about<00:02:29.540> its

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
party but what I really like about its

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.050 
party but what I really like about its
design<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> front<00:02:31.430> grille<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:31.940> be

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
design is that the front grille can be

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.940 
design is that the front grille can be
changed<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.510> different<00:02:32.660> colors<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.470> if<00:02:33.920> you

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
changed to different colors and if you

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.150 
changed to different colors and if you
want<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.209> can<00:02:35.390> actually<00:02:35.690> take<00:02:36.530> out<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.920> front

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
want you can actually take out the front

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.880 
want you can actually take out the front
grille<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.060> go<00:02:38.870> with<00:02:39.080> something<00:02:39.530> like<00:02:39.650> this<00:02:39.830> a

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
grille and go with something like this a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.350 
grille and go with something like this a
naked<00:02:40.370> look<00:02:40.550> which<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.790> think<00:02:41.060> looks<00:02:41.239> really

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
naked look which I think looks really

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.870 
naked look which I think looks really
sexy<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.260> also<00:02:42.560> comes<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:43.220> wood<00:02:43.580> finish

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
sexy it also comes in a wood finish

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.840 
sexy it also comes in a wood finish
which<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:44.840> absolutely<00:02:45.620> something<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.250> die<00:02:46.519> for

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
which is absolutely something to die for

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.570 
which is absolutely something to die for
but<00:02:47.330> at<00:02:47.570> fifty<00:02:48.170> five<00:02:48.350> thousand<00:02:48.800> rupees<00:02:49.250> it

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
but at fifty five thousand rupees it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.330 
but at fifty five thousand rupees it
does<00:02:49.940> feel<00:02:50.330> expensive<00:02:50.989> but<00:02:51.800> there<00:02:52.069> are<00:02:52.190> other
