00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.320 

all<00:00:04.000> right<00:00:04.120> so<00:00:04.330> this<00:00:04.480> is<00:00:04.540> a<00:00:04.689> 95<00:00:05.140> Saturn<00:00:05.620> SL<00:00:05.979> and

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
all right so this is a 95 Saturn SL and

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.879 
all right so this is a 95 Saturn SL and
yes<00:00:07.330> the<00:00:07.779> other<00:00:07.930> day<00:00:08.049> as<00:00:08.200> I<00:00:08.320> was<00:00:08.350> driving<00:00:08.740> home

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
yes the other day as I was driving home

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.119 
yes the other day as I was driving home
the<00:00:09.700> car<00:00:10.469> stalled<00:00:11.469> and<00:00:12.480> would<00:00:13.480> not<00:00:13.629> restart<00:00:14.129> so

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
the car stalled and would not restart so

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.189 
the car stalled and would not restart so
I'm<00:00:16.119> thinking<00:00:16.539> it's<00:00:16.720> a<00:00:16.779> fuel<00:00:16.990> pump<00:00:17.260> and<00:00:19.169> so<00:00:20.169> I

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
I'm thinking it's a fuel pump and so I

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.470 
I'm thinking it's a fuel pump and so I
get<00:00:20.380> a<00:00:20.410> tow<00:00:20.619> home<00:00:20.890> and<00:00:21.759> I'm<00:00:22.150> thinking<00:00:22.419> I'm

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
get a tow home and I'm thinking I'm

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.499 
get a tow home and I'm thinking I'm
gonna<00:00:22.599> have<00:00:22.749> to<00:00:22.810> replace<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.259> fuel<00:00:23.439> pump<00:00:24.509> but

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
gonna have to replace the fuel pump but

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.269 
gonna have to replace the fuel pump but
before<00:00:25.839> I<00:00:25.869> did<00:00:26.050> that<00:00:26.079> I<00:00:26.230> decided<00:00:26.679> to<00:00:26.829> check<00:00:27.130> out

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
before I did that I decided to check out

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.429 
before I did that I decided to check out
a<00:00:27.339> few<00:00:27.550> things<00:00:27.609> online<00:00:28.029> and<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.960> you<00:00:32.079> can<00:00:32.230> see

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
a few things online and as you can see

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.670 
a few things online and as you can see
the<00:00:33.250> gear<00:00:33.430> shift<00:00:33.790> so<00:00:34.450> this<00:00:34.660> is<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.900> passenger

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
the gear shift so this is the passenger

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.550 
the gear shift so this is the passenger
side<00:00:35.830> of<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.010> car<00:00:36.190> you<00:00:36.310> pull<00:00:36.520> this<00:00:36.930> fuse<00:00:37.930> panel

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
side of the car you pull this fuse panel

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.620 
side of the car you pull this fuse panel
excess<00:00:39.130> off<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:41.130> right<00:00:42.130> in<00:00:42.280> there

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
excess off and right in there

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.670 
excess off and right in there
right<00:00:43.630> here<00:00:43.870> this<00:00:44.110> this<00:00:44.470> is<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.650> relay<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:48.420> $11

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
right here this this is a relay and $11

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.420 
right here this this is a relay and $11
that's<00:00:50.680> what<00:00:50.890> it<00:00:50.980> was

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
that's what it was

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.040 
that's what it was
so<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:53.520> that's<00:00:54.520> all<00:00:54.670> you<00:00:54.820> do<00:00:54.940> pop<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.720> old<00:00:55.750> one

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
so and that's all you do pop the old one

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.380 
so and that's all you do pop the old one

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
out put the new one in and this one here

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.420 
out put the new one in and this one here
if<00:00:59.350> you<00:00:59.470> look<00:00:59.650> on<00:00:59.740> the<00:00:59.860> back<00:00:59.980> side<00:01:00.250> of<00:01:00.280> the

they're for
that's<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.850> HVAC<00:01:06.850> one<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.469> it<00:01:08.469> worked<00:01:08.740> so<00:01:09.009> if

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
that's the HVAC one and it worked so if

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.020 
that's the HVAC one and it worked so if
you<00:01:09.909> were<00:01:09.999> in<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.210> in<00:01:10.929> a<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:12.460> pickle<00:01:12.670> like<00:01:12.909> I

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
you were in a in a little pickle like I

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.569 
you were in a in a little pickle like I
was<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.479> other<00:01:13.630> day<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:14.499> can<00:01:14.649> pop<00:01:15.159> that<00:01:15.429> one

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
was the other day you can pop that one

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.830 
was the other day you can pop that one
out<00:01:15.759> I<00:01:15.789> don't<00:01:16.119> know<00:01:16.240> what<00:01:16.359> it's<00:01:16.479> going<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.659> do

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
out I don't know what it's going to do

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.599 
out I don't know what it's going to do
to<00:01:16.990> your<00:01:17.079> air-conditioning<00:01:18.069> system<00:01:18.429> because

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 
to your air-conditioning system because

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.029 
to your air-conditioning system because
mine<00:01:18.939> when<00:01:19.149> I<00:01:19.179> when<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.020> took<00:01:20.259> it<00:01:20.350> out<00:01:20.439> to<00:01:20.499> see<00:01:20.859> if

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
mine when I when I took it out to see if

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.559 
mine when I when I took it out to see if
if<00:01:21.429> the<00:01:21.609> relay<00:01:21.909> was<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.270> problem<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
if the relay was the problem the

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.709 
if the relay was the problem the
compressor<00:01:25.569> started<00:01:25.929> screeching<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:28.030> maybe

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
compressor started screeching so maybe

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.050 
compressor started screeching so maybe
it<00:01:28.929> wouldn't<00:01:29.140> be<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.319> good<00:01:29.530> thing<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.859> drive<00:01:30.069> two

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
it wouldn't be a good thing to drive two

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.879 
it wouldn't be a good thing to drive two
hours<00:01:31.359> on<00:01:31.600> but<00:01:31.869> maybe<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.530> get<00:01:32.649> you<00:01:32.770> off<00:01:32.859> the

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:32.889 
hours on but maybe to get you off the

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:36.749 
hours on but maybe to get you off the
busy<00:01:33.700> interstate<00:01:33.969> so<00:01:35.130> if<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.310> have<00:01:36.429> a<00:01:36.460> fuel

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
busy interstate so if you have a fuel

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.499 
busy interstate so if you have a fuel
pump<00:01:36.880> problem<00:01:37.329> on<00:01:37.509> a<00:01:37.539> on<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.899> Saturn<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.479> a

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
pump problem on a on a Saturn this is a

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.730 
pump problem on a on a Saturn this is a
95<00:01:41.049> I<00:01:41.079> have<00:01:41.469> a<00:01:41.499> 96<00:01:43.020> SL<00:01:44.020> as<00:01:44.259> well

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
95 I have a 96 SL as well
