00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello everyone with you gleb and today review 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.190
 on the ninth jet fighter 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.260
 Level f6 operat I personally flew it 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.789
 fighters are not in the top and followed only 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.770
 the weapon received from him was great 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.510
 pleasure i would say that this is one of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.369
 the strongest himself this ninth level 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.140
 the historical pirate was the first serial 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.670
 jet deck fighters but to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.769
 Fortunately, there is no class in the game. 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.779
 bogs and we do not have to fool 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.520
 head and fortunately this war machine 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.559
 could not take part of a new war 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.780
 lord for playing still managed as 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.520
 let's all the same personally I flew 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.290
 almost in stock configuration and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.300
 I will build on it 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.160
 or rather top gun everything else 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.230
 stock in this configuration pirate already 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.360
 able to catch you top dozens especially 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.100
 bothering about speed we have 800 units 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.809
 at the same time and high-altitude fighter with 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.730
 optimal speed of 600 kilometers per 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.860
 an hour and a height of 1900 meters 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.260
 our firepower is just great here 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.090
 us tobago kotlas tools which is just 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.710
 with ease desire cut down any 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.719
 target for a couple of seconds you only need 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.159
 aim a bit because it's worth 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.200
 20 caliber that optimum distance 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.060
 firing is not bad at all 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.070
 start shooting with a thousand meters of gun 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.840
 more than good maneuverability 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.180
 I would not say that the ninth and tenth 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.799
 level is an important indicator here more 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.659
 it all depends on speed than on your 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.340
 twirling you ti but still pirates here 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.470
 can stand up for himself of course he is not 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.119
 war with the advice of the Japanese but the same strands 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.430
 and we twist in great pleasure to 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.780
 sorry for more we lack well and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.820
 at the end of the little-known parameters 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.520
 strength here we have enough hit points on 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 a couple of crazy shot 206 so you can 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.479
 add a little modification 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.189
 aircraft but there are two options if you 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.720
 decided to fan on this plane itself 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.430
 you need to do everything tops 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.710
 at the same time, at first they gave the guns 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.780
 motor to the end of the hull or variant 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.460
 fast pumping putting only guns 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.530
 we do not feel discomfort and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.450
 calmly do your frags on flight 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.869
 the quality itself will be a little worse 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.939
 other 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.860
 I would say almost imperceptibly we go 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.780
 wheelbarrow or sky I'm here to talk a lot 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.549
 pointless well first of all we have 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.229
 advantage height and speed first 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.030
 climbs there kill all the strands and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.040
 fallen fighters after 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.990
 get down saw your tail and 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.879
 You can both come up and 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.770
 you have almost no straight lines 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.629
 Tactics equivalent to your opponents 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.569
 number two first we fly full 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.519
 afterburner to a point with 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.499
 still attack the enemy and the first kill 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.629
 one goal further sharply turn around 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:21.790
 choose our tools confidently folds 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.069
 catch forties so we have time to kill well and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.650
 tactic number 3 for the ferocious brave 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.749
 pilots fly directly to the center pressing into the floor 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.579
 afterburner sit on your tail piston 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.650
 clunks maybe someone is merging 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.689
 sunset stray bullet further rotate us 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.430
 and just fly away none of the piston 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.560
 airplanes are not able to catch you in 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.959
 principle and most reagents too 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.609
 so calmly fly away now a little 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.290
 The links are generally cool 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.269
 a link of three pirates can easily 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.280
 destroy the whole team and not 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.290
 need to come up with evil plans to fly 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.000
 right on the top of the map we fly to the middle 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.829
 we sit on the tail a bunch of enemies and in your 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.230
 pirates in the run kill your tails 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.090
 arms enough speed the same 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.069
 enough to fly take the link ate 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.199
 it seemed to me impractical and 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.120
 love commands and so you enough 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:06.010
 help with this particular team will not be a 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.109
 clean up and flight managers one plane seems to me 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.730
 wrong and productive now 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.799
 service modules but first stands 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.699
 sight we have very accurate guns will 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.980
 stupid not to develop this ability 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.959
 next with polishing the plating the same things 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.609
 we are a speed plane one of the best and 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.650
 don't develop red the indicator is the same 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.750
 stupid not to the end of your choice i 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.609
 flew without any module at all 3 and was pleased 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.620
 service to start armor piercing 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.720
 cartridges for slaughter cannons even more 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.400
 adding further restart though engines 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.470
 criticizes rarely but still happens 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.239
 further gasoline and first aid kit of choice well and 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.310
 fire extinguisher though for me not extinguished 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.290
 I never set a standard set 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.329
 fired up and got no criticism of the page so 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.220
 what choose for yourself what you should wear 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.959
 Well, in the end the crew will not say 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.120
 a lot and just read the standard 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.599
 set review for sniper so motors 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.699
 veteran 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.739
 let's summarize the pirate speed 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.209
 plane with you on and guns use 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.310
 only his strengths you will 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.810
 succeed in a fight with you today 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.250
 as always was gleb thanks for 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.909
 attention subscribe to the channel and 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.709
 group vk 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.709
 put huskies and good luck in the air
