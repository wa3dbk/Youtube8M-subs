a normal old redstone signal or you can

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.210 
a normal old redstone signal or you can
use<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.840> player<00:01:25.020> sensor<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.100> the

use the the player sensor so this is the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.859 
use the the player sensor so this is the
the<00:01:26.520> crafting<00:01:26.790> recipe<00:01:27.060> for<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> couple<00:01:27.600> iron

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
you can put them over the door and they

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.969 
you can put them over the door and they
just<00:01:36.150> act<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> automatic<00:01:37.470> sensors

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
just act as like the automatic sensors

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.609 
just act as like the automatic sensors
so<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.430> doors<00:01:38.610> open<00:01:38.970> when<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.110> walk

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
so that the doors open when you walk

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.060 
so that the doors open when you walk
narrow<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> place<00:01:42.630> them<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.710> either

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
narrow and so I place them on on either

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
narrow and so I place them on on either
side<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.549> these<00:01:44.670> uh<00:01:44.700> these<00:01:45.540> wooden<00:01:45.869> planks

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
side of these uh these wooden planks

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.380 
side of these uh these wooden planks
here<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> door<00:01:47.399> opens<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.850> plenty

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
here and so the door opens with plenty

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.149 
here and so the door opens with plenty
of<00:01:48.479> time<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.869> spare<00:01:49.170> when<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.829> through

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
of time to spare when I go in through

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.480 
of time to spare when I go in through
either<00:01:50.640> side<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.170> cool<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> avoid

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
either side so cool so you get to avoid

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.069 
either side so cool so you get to avoid
having<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.909> step<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.360> pressure<00:01:54.659> plates

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
having to step on pressure plates

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.560 
having to step on pressure plates
anything<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.009> sort<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.270> doors<00:01:57.420> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
anything of that sort and the doors just

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.190 
anything of that sort and the doors just
glide<00:01:58.290> open<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.250> closed<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.540> nice

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
glide open and closed and it's a nice

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.859 
glide open and closed and it's a nice
and<00:02:01.409> nifty<00:02:01.759> ok<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.820> moving<00:02:03.119> right<00:02:03.390> along<00:02:03.540> we've

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
and nifty ok so moving right along we've

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.240 
and nifty ok so moving right along we've
got<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> set<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.409> blocks<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.070> good

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
got a set of blocks that are really good

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.039 
got a set of blocks that are really good
for<00:02:05.520> making<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:06.060> traps<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.719> secret

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
for making like traps and secret

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.719 
for making like traps and secret
entrances<00:02:07.649> which<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.250> guess<00:02:08.369> sounds<00:02:08.640> very

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
entrances which I guess sounds very

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.790 
entrances which I guess sounds very
similar<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.660> torch<00:02:09.869> levers<00:02:10.200> mod<00:02:10.440> which<00:02:10.679> I

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
similar to the torch levers mod which I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.530 
similar to the torch levers mod which I
looked<00:02:10.920> at<00:02:11.099> last<00:02:11.280> time<00:02:11.430> but<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.150> different

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
looked at last time but it's different

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.250 
looked at last time but it's different
in<00:02:12.690> its<00:02:12.930> own

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
in its own

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.649 
in its own
right<00:02:13.379> so<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> quick<00:02:14.760> heads-up

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
right so just as a quick heads-up

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.479 
right so just as a quick heads-up
there's<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.409> thing<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.890> don't<00:02:17.159> know<00:02:17.280> what's

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
there's this thing I don't know what's

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.949 
there's this thing I don't know what's
causing<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:18.030> but<00:02:18.090> occasionally<00:02:18.599> you'll<00:02:18.900> see

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
causing it but occasionally you'll see

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.899 
causing it but occasionally you'll see
one<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.470> blocks<00:02:19.739> like<00:02:20.010> sort<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.430> jump<00:02:20.730> out

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
one of the blocks like sort of jump out

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.399 
one of the blocks like sort of jump out
and<00:02:21.090> buzz<00:02:21.329> like<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.840> right<00:02:22.110> there

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
and buzz like that right there

I<00:02:22.650> don't<00:02:23.310> know<00:02:23.489> what's<00:02:23.849> causing<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.450> I've

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
I don't know what's causing it I've

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.000 
I don't know what's causing it I've

looked up on the forum page trying to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.679 
looked up on the forum page trying to
figure<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.370> out<00:02:26.459> no<00:02:26.819> one<00:02:26.939> else<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.239> commenting

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
figure it out no one else is commenting

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.869 
figure it out no one else is commenting
about<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.409> I'm<00:02:28.799> not<00:02:29.280> sure<00:02:29.489> if<00:02:29.579> I'm<00:02:29.700> setting

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
about it so I'm not sure if I'm setting

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.850 
about it so I'm not sure if I'm setting
it<00:02:30.030> up<00:02:30.180> wrong<00:02:30.450> either<00:02:30.810> way<00:02:31.110> try<00:02:31.409> to<00:02:31.440> ignore<00:02:31.799> it

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
it up wrong either way try to ignore it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.500 
it up wrong either way try to ignore it
because<00:02:32.159> the<00:02:32.280> functionality<00:02:32.700> still<00:02:33.299> works

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
because the functionality still works

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.990 
because the functionality still works
just<00:02:33.870> see<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.409> anyway<00:02:35.129> we've<00:02:35.430> got<00:02:35.459> wooden

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
just see that anyway we've got wooden

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.949 
just see that anyway we've got wooden
vanishing<00:02:36.450> frames

we've<00:02:37.260> got<00:02:37.530> iron<00:02:37.890> vanishing<00:02:38.519> frames<00:02:38.790> and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
we've got iron vanishing frames and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.270 
we've got iron vanishing frames and
we've<00:02:39.569> got<00:02:39.840> gold<00:02:40.109> vanishing<00:02:40.590> frames<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.010> they

we've got gold vanishing frames and they

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.890 
we've got gold vanishing frames and they
all<00:02:41.370> do<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.640> same<00:02:41.670> thing<00:02:42.180> essentially<00:02:42.659> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
all do the same thing essentially the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.690 
all do the same thing essentially the
only<00:02:43.109> difference<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.769> how<00:02:44.189> they<00:02:44.370> propagate

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
only difference is how they propagate

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.369 
only difference is how they propagate
they're<00:02:45.180> on/off<00:02:45.569> States<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.109> other

they're on/off States to other

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.130 
they're on/off States to other

redstone and an ender pearl for all of
them<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.150> then<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.329> replace<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.870> other<00:02:55.019> four

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
them and then you replace the other four

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.869 
them and then you replace the other four
ingredients<00:02:55.470> with<00:02:55.829> either<00:02:55.950> sticks<00:02:56.280> iron

ingots or gold depending upon what type
you<00:02:59.670> want<00:02:59.849> and<00:03:00.150> then<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.840> set<00:03:01.049> them<00:03:01.260> up<00:03:01.470> you

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
you want and then to set them up you

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:02.899 
you want and then to set them up you
just<00:03:02.250> place<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.519> down

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
just place it down

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.050 
just place it down
looks<00:03:03.780> like<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.470> wooden<00:03:04.950> vanishing<00:03:05.670> frame

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060

occasionally<00:03:17.910> which<00:03:18.060> again<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.359> don't<00:03:18.449> know

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
occasionally which again I don't know

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.539 
occasionally which again I don't know
why<00:03:18.780> that's<00:03:18.930> happening<00:03:19.379> but<00:03:19.650> ignore<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.400> for

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
why that's happening but ignore it for

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.909 
why that's happening but ignore it for
now<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.540> then<00:03:21.690> when<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.900> apply<00:03:22.139> a<00:03:22.169> redstone

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
now but then when you apply a redstone

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.150 
now but then when you apply a redstone
signal<00:03:23.069> to<00:03:24.000> one<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.750> these<00:03:24.870> blocks<00:03:25.230> it'll

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
signal to one of these blocks it'll

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.640 
signal to one of these blocks it'll
actually<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:27.449> really<00:03:27.629> cool<00:03:27.930> animation

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
actually do this really cool animation

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.220 
actually do this really cool animation
and<00:03:28.859> toggle<00:03:29.549> off<00:03:29.669> and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.750> can<00:03:30.989> walk<00:03:31.169> on

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
and toggle off and then you can walk on

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.289 
and toggle off and then you can walk on
through<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:31.949> for<00:03:32.129> my<00:03:32.220> secret<00:03:32.579> base<00:03:32.730> be

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
through if this for my secret base be

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.449 
through if this for my secret base be
super<00:03:33.629> cool<00:03:33.810> then<00:03:34.109> flip<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.560> lever<00:03:34.709> again<00:03:35.040> and

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
super cool then flip the lever again and

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.689 
super cool then flip the lever again and
it's<00:03:35.790> solid<00:03:36.090> wall<00:03:36.419> so<00:03:36.870> there's<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.680> now<00:03:38.370> let

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
it's solid wall so there's that now let

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.819 
it's solid wall so there's that now let
me<00:03:38.819> sort<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.329> outline<00:03:39.690> what<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.959> meant<00:03:40.199> by<00:03:40.379> this

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
me sort of outline what I meant by this

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.289 
me sort of outline what I meant by this
difference<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.430> how<00:03:41.519> they<00:03:41.639> propagate<00:03:41.910> their

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.970 
difference in how they propagate their
states<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.780> other<00:03:42.989> blocks<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.949> a

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
states to other blocks so this is a

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.180 
states to other blocks so this is a
wooden<00:03:44.599> vanishing<00:03:45.599> frame<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:47.010> will

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
wooden vanishing frame and it will

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.490 
wooden vanishing frame and it will
propagate<00:03:47.459> its<00:03:47.879> state<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.269> any<00:03:48.540> surrounding

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
propagate its state to any surrounding

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.439 
propagate its state to any surrounding

of<00:03:54.599> anything<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.370> if<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.579> flip<00:03:56.790> the

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.849 
of anything like that so if I flip the
lever<00:03:57.090> all<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.569> these<00:03:58.019> are<00:03:58.379> going<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.680> turn

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
lever all of these are going to turn

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.830 
lever all of these are going to turn

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
despite the fact that this is iron and

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.449 
despite the fact that this is iron and
this<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.199> gold<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.709> they're<00:04:02.220> imitating

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
this is gold and they're imitating

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.399 
this is gold and they're imitating
different<00:04:03.120> block<00:04:03.299> types<00:04:03.540> now<00:04:04.169> on<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.319> other

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409

surrounding frame blocks that have the

surrounding frame blocks that have the
same<00:04:10.889> block<00:04:11.519> type<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.239> these<00:04:12.359> are<00:04:12.569> both<00:04:12.750> wool

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
same block type so these are both wool

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.469 
same block type so these are both wool
so<00:04:13.709> when<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:13.889> flip<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.220> lever<00:04:14.400> here<00:04:14.699> it's<00:04:15.329> going

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
so when I flip the lever here it's going

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.060 
so when I flip the lever here it's going
to<00:04:15.540> toggle<00:04:15.930> those<00:04:16.079> but<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:16.680> not<00:04:16.739> going<00:04:17.010> to

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
to toggle those but it's not going to

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.649 
to toggle those but it's not going to
toggle<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.489> planks<00:04:17.820> because<00:04:18.180> totally

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
toggle the planks because totally

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.229 
toggle the planks because totally
different<00:04:18.959> block<00:04:19.310> now<00:04:20.310> finally<00:04:20.880> we<00:04:21.030> have<00:04:21.120> the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
different block now finally we have the

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.750 
different block now finally we have the
gold<00:04:21.419> ones<00:04:21.630> which<00:04:22.079> super<00:04:22.680> duper<00:04:23.039> specific<00:04:23.550> and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
gold ones which super duper specific and

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.760 
gold ones which super duper specific and
it<00:04:24.090> will<00:04:24.210> only<00:04:24.330> propagate<00:04:24.960> its<00:04:25.110> on/off<00:04:25.440> state

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
it will only propagate its on/off state

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.140 
it will only propagate its on/off state
to<00:04:26.219> other<00:04:26.430> frames

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
to other frames

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.360 
to other frames
have<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.780> right<00:04:27.960> block<00:04:28.169> type<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:29.220> right

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
have the right block type and the right

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.790 
have the right block type and the right
data<00:04:29.639> value<00:04:30.030> so<00:04:30.330> in<00:04:30.449> this<00:04:30.570> case<00:04:30.840> purple<00:04:31.590> wool

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
data value so in this case purple wool

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.240 
data value so in this case purple wool
so<00:04:32.340> boom<00:04:32.759> and<00:04:33.090> it's<00:04:33.870> just<00:04:34.110> going<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.350> flip<00:04:34.560> that

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
so boom and it's just going to flip that

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.749 
so boom and it's just going to flip that
one<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:36.300> you<00:04:36.360> can<00:04:36.750> create<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.080> set<00:04:37.350> of<00:04:37.759> hidden

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
one so you can create a set of hidden

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.310 
one so you can create a set of hidden
doors<00:04:39.090> hidden<00:04:39.479> traps<00:04:39.690> next<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.050> each<00:04:40.169> other

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
doors hidden traps next to each other

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.350 
doors hidden traps next to each other
that<00:04:40.830> flip<00:04:41.250> differently<00:04:41.850> depending<00:04:42.030> upon

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
that flip differently depending upon

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.999 
that flip differently depending upon
what<00:04:43.020> was<00:04:43.199> triggered

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
what was triggered

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.249 
what was triggered
so<00:04:44.430> anyway<00:04:45.150> pretty<00:04:45.509> cool<00:04:45.720> though<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:45.990> really

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
so anyway pretty cool though I really

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.499 
so anyway pretty cool though I really
like<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.530> animation<00:04:46.880> pretty<00:04:47.880> nifty<00:04:48.090> stuff

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
like the animation pretty nifty stuff

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.890 
like the animation pretty nifty stuff
like<00:04:49.440> smokey<00:04:50.039> effect<00:04:50.130> afterwards<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.780> it's

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
like smokey effect afterwards and it's

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.409 
like smokey effect afterwards and it's
kind<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.169> gradual<00:04:52.800> wave<00:04:53.070> type<00:04:53.460> dealio<00:04:53.850> anyway

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
kind of gradual wave type dealio anyway

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.219 
kind of gradual wave type dealio anyway
I<00:04:54.600> think<00:04:54.990> it's<00:04:55.380> a<00:04:55.620> it's<00:04:56.100> pretty<00:04:56.610> cool<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:57.870> from

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
I think it's a it's pretty cool so from

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.020 
I think it's a it's pretty cool so from
there<00:04:58.380> we'll<00:04:58.860> move<00:04:59.009> along<00:04:59.190> to<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.699> final

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
there we'll move along to the final

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.820 
there we'll move along to the final
thing<00:05:00.210> which<00:05:00.300> is<00:05:00.510> actually<00:05:00.990> something<00:05:01.350> I<00:05:01.620> find

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
thing which is actually something I find

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.700 
thing which is actually something I find
like<00:05:02.130> really<00:05:02.880> nifty<00:05:03.090> I<00:05:03.449> haven't<00:05:04.380> seen<00:05:04.590> it

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
like really nifty I haven't seen it

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.469 
like really nifty I haven't seen it
before<00:05:04.800> maybe<00:05:05.220> it's<00:05:05.400> existed<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:05.970> another<00:05:06.210> mod

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
before maybe it's existed in another mod

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.439 
before maybe it's existed in another mod
but<00:05:07.110> it's<00:05:07.380> it's<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.070> ability<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.520> actually

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
but it's it's the ability to actually

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.860 
but it's it's the ability to actually
combine<00:05:10.410> two<00:05:10.889> blocks<00:05:11.220> into<00:05:11.550> one<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.690> make

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
combine two blocks into one to make

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.320 
combine two blocks into one to make
something<00:05:13.169> that<00:05:13.530> aesthetically<00:05:14.190> can<00:05:14.940> be<00:05:15.120> one

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
something that aesthetically can be one

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.779 
something that aesthetically can be one
thing<00:05:15.510> on<00:05:15.690> one<00:05:15.840> side<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.350> another<00:05:17.160> thing<00:05:17.550> on

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
thing on one side and another thing on

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.659 
thing on one side and another thing on
the<00:05:17.850> other<00:05:18.780> so<00:05:19.470> in<00:05:19.560> order<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:19.770> do<00:05:20.039> this<00:05:20.220> you

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
the other so in order to do this you

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.560 
the other so in order to do this you
need<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:21.120> make<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:22.020> block<00:05:22.830> mixer<00:05:23.669> block<00:05:24.120> thing

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
need to make the block mixer block thing

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.200 
need to make the block mixer block thing
which<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.289> crafting<00:05:25.590> recipe<00:05:25.889> for<00:05:26.130> it<00:05:26.250> is<00:05:26.400> iron

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
which the crafting recipe for it is iron

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.240 
which the crafting recipe for it is iron
ingots<00:05:27.539> you<00:05:27.930> got<00:05:28.110> some<00:05:28.289> pistons<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.009> some

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
ingots you got some pistons and some

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.430 
ingots you got some pistons and some
more<00:05:29.370> iron<00:05:29.729> ingots<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.360> then<00:05:30.960> get<00:05:31.139> the<00:05:31.260> block

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
more iron ingots and then get the block

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.770 
more iron ingots and then get the block
mixer<00:05:31.830> in<00:05:32.010> return<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:32.699> then<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.360> simply

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
mixer in return and then you simply

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.740 
mixer in return and then you simply
place<00:05:34.080> whatever<00:05:34.620> blocks<00:05:35.070> you<00:05:35.310> want<00:05:35.580> in<00:05:35.910> the

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
place whatever blocks you want in the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.400 
place whatever blocks you want in the
slots<00:05:37.169> here<00:05:37.680> on<00:05:37.860> either<00:05:38.250> side<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.880> then<00:05:39.539> they

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
slots here on either side and then they

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.310 
slots here on either side and then they
just<00:05:40.710> compress<00:05:41.190> into<00:05:41.550> one<00:05:42.300> sort<00:05:42.659> of<00:05:42.840> hybrid

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
just compress into one sort of hybrid

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.210 
just compress into one sort of hybrid
block<00:05:43.770> in<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.699> middle<00:05:44.900> which<00:05:45.900> this<00:05:46.380> is<00:05:46.560> sponge

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
sponge that sounds weird ah

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.870 
sponge that sounds weird ah
so<00:05:54.750> yeah<00:05:55.349> that's<00:05:55.560> anyway<00:05:56.039> let<00:05:56.220> me<00:05:56.250> place<00:05:56.699> it

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
so yeah that's anyway let me place it

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.300 
so yeah that's anyway let me place it
down<00:05:57.060> um<00:05:57.690> so<00:05:57.900> you<00:05:57.990> can<00:05:58.139> see<00:05:58.349> it<00:05:58.470> it's<00:05:58.979> kind<00:05:59.250> of

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
down um so you can see it it's kind of

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.420 
down um so you can see it it's kind of
cool<00:05:59.550> right<00:05:59.820> it's<00:06:00.210> kind<00:06:00.510> of<00:06:00.539> cool<00:06:00.860> mm-hmm<00:06:01.949> bed

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
cool right it's kind of cool mm-hmm bed

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.600 
cool right it's kind of cool mm-hmm bed
sponge<00:06:02.789> right<00:06:03.510> there<00:06:03.810> take<00:06:04.710> that<00:06:04.740> with<00:06:05.280> you

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
sponge right there take that with you

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.820 
sponge right there take that with you
hold<00:06:06.030> it<00:06:06.180> next<00:06:06.300> to<00:06:06.479> your<00:06:06.539> bed<00:06:06.620> because<00:06:07.620> it's

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
hold it next to your bed because it's

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.159 
hold it next to your bed because it's
bed<00:06:08.070> sponge<00:06:08.430> now<00:06:09.330> you<00:06:09.389> may<00:06:09.570> be<00:06:09.599> wondering<00:06:09.720> does

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
bed sponge now you may be wondering does

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.839 
bed sponge now you may be wondering does
it<00:06:10.320> work<00:06:10.530> with<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:10.860> vanishing<00:06:11.520> frames

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
it work with the vanishing frames

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.120 
it work with the vanishing frames
unfortunately<00:06:12.750> at<00:06:12.870> this<00:06:13.050> moment<00:06:13.470> it<00:06:13.770> doesn't

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
unfortunately at this moment it doesn't

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.219 
unfortunately at this moment it doesn't
seem<00:06:14.550> to<00:06:14.729> it<00:06:14.880> just<00:06:15.000> turns<00:06:15.300> it<00:06:15.479> a<00:06:15.539> strange

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
seem to it just turns it a strange

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.339 
seem to it just turns it a strange
flashing<00:06:16.770> orange<00:06:17.460> color<00:06:17.729> you<00:06:18.419> you<00:06:18.990> think<00:06:19.229> that

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
flashing orange color you you think that

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.350 
flashing orange color you you think that
that<00:06:19.500> would<00:06:19.620> be<00:06:19.770> a<00:06:19.800> really<00:06:20.280> really<00:06:20.669> cool<00:06:21.060> way

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
that would be a really really cool way

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.270 
that would be a really really cool way
to<00:06:21.389> use<00:06:21.570> them<00:06:21.960> is<00:06:22.169> that<00:06:22.530> you<00:06:22.680> could<00:06:22.860> have<00:06:23.039> like

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
to use them is that you could have like

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.180 
to use them is that you could have like
a<00:06:23.310> secret<00:06:23.669> base<00:06:24.169> or<00:06:25.169> one<00:06:25.349> side<00:06:25.560> is<00:06:25.710> exposed

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
a secret base or one side is exposed

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.629 
a secret base or one side is exposed
outwards<00:06:26.960> and<00:06:27.960> has<00:06:28.409> maybe<00:06:28.710> the<00:06:29.039> the<00:06:29.250> dirt<00:06:29.430> on

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
outwards and has maybe the the dirt on

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.089 
outwards and has maybe the the dirt on
one<00:06:30.180> side<00:06:30.449> and<00:06:30.720> then<00:06:31.199> the<00:06:31.409> other<00:06:31.440> side<00:06:31.770> would

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099 
one side and then the other side would

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:33.620 
one side and then the other side would
be<00:06:32.310> inwards<00:06:32.970> and<00:06:33.120> it<00:06:33.210> would<00:06:33.300> have<00:06:33.449> like

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
be inwards and it would have like

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.560 
be inwards and it would have like
bookshelf<00:06:34.080> so<00:06:34.229> it<00:06:34.289> looks<00:06:34.470> pretty<00:06:35.099> nice<00:06:35.570> maybe

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
bookshelf so it looks pretty nice maybe

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.269 
bookshelf so it looks pretty nice maybe
in<00:06:36.870> like<00:06:36.900> a<00:06:37.050> future<00:06:37.380> update<00:06:37.529> the<00:06:37.979> the

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:38.279 
in like a future update the the

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.070 
in like a future update the the
vanishing<00:06:38.639> blocks<00:06:38.880> will<00:06:39.120> be<00:06:39.300> be<00:06:39.840> able<00:06:39.930> to

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
vanishing blocks will be be able to

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.790 
vanishing blocks will be be able to
support

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
support

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.390 
support
that<00:06:40.949> the<00:06:41.129> hybrid<00:06:41.930> gradiated<00:06:42.979> mixed<00:06:43.979> block

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
that the hybrid gradiated mixed block

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.790 
that the hybrid gradiated mixed block
things<00:06:44.909> but<00:06:45.389> I<00:06:45.419> guess<00:06:45.840> right<00:06:46.289> now<00:06:46.319> it<00:06:46.500> doesn't

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
things but I guess right now it doesn't

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.680 
things but I guess right now it doesn't
but<00:06:47.159> still<00:06:47.490> it's<00:06:47.879> still<00:06:48.030> pretty<00:06:48.270> cool

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
but still it's still pretty cool

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.719 
but still it's still pretty cool
like<00:06:48.960> if<00:06:49.139> you<00:06:49.229> wanted<00:06:49.470> to<00:06:49.590> have<00:06:49.740> a<00:06:49.770> house<00:06:50.310> even

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
like if you wanted to have a house even

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.140 
like if you wanted to have a house even
that<00:06:51.210> had<00:06:51.509> for<00:06:52.199> example<00:06:52.860> the<00:06:53.550> outside<00:06:53.909> being

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
that had for example the outside being

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.510 
that had for example the outside being
bricks<00:06:54.449> and<00:06:54.750> the<00:06:54.900> inside<00:06:55.259> looking<00:06:55.710> like<00:06:56.009> wood
