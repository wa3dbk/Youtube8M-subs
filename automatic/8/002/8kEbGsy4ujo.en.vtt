out an axe real quick so that way mining
this<00:05:47.879> stone<00:05:48.180> would<00:05:48.330> be<00:05:48.449> a<00:05:48.479> bit<00:05:48.719> faster<00:05:49.229> but

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
this stone would be a bit faster but

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.749 
this stone would be a bit faster but
