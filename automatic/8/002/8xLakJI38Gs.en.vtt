 they noticed that in this part cris hits 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.420
 with the metal bar on the back 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.420
 run video 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.099
 we can see that besides that the fight is 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.690
 almost equal some parts are changed 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.690

 sticks a knife in the leg to wesker 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.410
 you will notice that wesker throws them into those tubes 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.780
 If you are going to imitate something, imitate how well 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.849
 crap xddddd good if you know in the 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.319
 resident evil 5 best care works 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.319
 with eurobonds and remains of this one 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.020
 sitting 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.629
 and remember in the same wesker dies 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.910
 when he was leaving and chrysler shoot with the 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.769
 rocket launcher and now look how is the 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.220
 Transformation and Death of Hosting in the 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.220
 movie 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.480
 its low but what the fuck on top 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.460
 transformation is like the plagues of 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.570
 Resident Evil 4 dies the most 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.700
 stupid wow 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.800
 good good they have fixed that a member 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.630
 of stars prefers to face a 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.170
 huge mansion full of zombies 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.630
 junkers spiders bees snakes dogs 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.060
 zombies a giant snake a plant 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.340
 buggers some bugs that go through the roof 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.290
 crows and a tirant before going out 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.140
 the main door and kill the four 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.330
 zombie dogs that there are xddddd besides not 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.280
 It is important that a strap crosses with its 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.500
 claws and that you exploit a mansion in 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.840
 the face if you call yourself wesker you will survive 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.790
 in resident evil you can appreciate the 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.670
 diversity of living beings that there is in a 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.980
 good xddddd city this is not a 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.990
 curiosity but when Krauser rubs 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.850
 with the knife lion and it shows the wound 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.890
 have noticed that when lion throws him the 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.600
 knife in the hand to salazar after 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.540
 this does not have the mark of the wound in 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.790
 the hand you have noticed that when krauser you 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.890
 it hurts with the tm but the knife takes you out 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.800
 more life than when a zombie shoots you 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.810
 with the rocket launcher because there are no children 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.800
 zombies in no resident delivery 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.539
 evil 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.030
 in my opinion the fight against jack 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.099
 krauser is the longest of the game if you've 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.960
 played mercenaries you can notice that 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.610
 in the town and at the military base there 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.099
 open places than in the story mode 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.379
 they 're not good friends that's all for 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.449
 today although it is a pity that the video 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.520
 be so short because I wanted the video 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.440
 is not equal to all copypaste that 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.840
 there are other curiosities videos 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.610
 I am ball fire mercenary I hope that 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.789
 you liked the video and even the 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.789
 next
