00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.810
 hello it oleg i am now 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.429
 I will try to review on comment 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.639
 some moments of the game in the fifth 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.059
 the civilization that I won first 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.250
 after the release of addon brave new world for 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.189
 shoshone 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.510
 she was laid out without voice acting 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:26.099
 the settings were following pangea 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.670
 small map of the eighth level 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.250
 difficulty max and fast 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.550
 speed 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.670
 respectively shona plus five others 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.969
 civilizations 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.969
 all win types included 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.850
 game one city fast fight and fast 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.829
 movement he generated 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.949
 not a bad start for science 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.930
 location with a mountain near the river also 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.449
 beside 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.460
 the only tundra prevents well 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.950
 maybe this is further somehow 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.259
 compensate 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.229
 but I decided to continue here and go 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:20.170
 try on science 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.170
 the more there are enough resources 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.970
 base the city you can see that here 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:33.729
 additional 8 and 8 cells formed 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.729
 and we go tracker 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.570
 on them 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:49.580
 because to go to the tundra 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:55.060
 useless from already visible ruins in the city 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.060
 we choose again the tracker to create 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.240
 explore and choose archers in order 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.800
 to aim at the temple of artemis 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.880
 which is useful to us with growth 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:15.520
 cities 10 percent plus and still she 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:19.870
 extra points great engineers 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.870
 who will help us in the future 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.320
 on the next move tracker 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:35.030
 go to the ruins and see what you can choose 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.250
 any bonus that we want in 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.600
 further on the following ruins already 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:46.990
 that's chosen I missed a few 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:52.550
 moves to show what was created next 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:58.459
 ranger he, too, went up that is on 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:02.870
 north we have in the south south pole and us 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.080
 not yet needed and changed the choice of the temple 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.080
 artemis 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.500
 one 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.500
 neighbor we met in the twelfth year 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:25.180
 it turned out to be a brazilian on the idea of ​​brazil 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:29.050
 dimensional and not really should worry us 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:33.970
 created the temple of artemis in the twentieth year 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:38.560
 on the fifty fifth move met 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:42.880
 the remaining 2 are not open civilization 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.400
 among all civilizations were two 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:51.020
 civilizations that absorb 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:54.590
 city ​​states is venice and austria 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:04:00.200
 them to the ideologies came second and took 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:04.550
 order since I thought it would allow 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.820
 I avoid big unrest due to 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:11.990
 the fact that a neighbor also took 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:15.160
 the order of brazil what for brazil was 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.440
 big plus then because she 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.030
 time to convert me faster 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.030
 how do we get the same ideology 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:31.520
 on the one hundred and forty fifth turn we came 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:37.670
 first suitcase what is brazil 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:43.820
 envelope zero us your faith not faith but 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:49.570
 culture yes and to convert the rest 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.570
 not much time left 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:58.430
 I turned 151 very long 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:02.120
 because I spent a lot of time for 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:07.460
 In order to figure out what's all the same 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:12.080
 I don’t have enough time for science 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.370
 long branches scientific science I did not 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.320
 so much 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:23.110
 I hardly have time to explore and 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:27.220
 launch a ship into space before 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:31.340
 Brazil converts all these our 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.550
 countries for themselves and prevail over us 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.560
 cultural victory 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:41.620
 in general in this addon brave new world 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.490
 science is severely curtailed with each city 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:49.810
 add five percent to technology 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:53.590
 plus it has the larger towns in 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.590
 longer study 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.060
 rarely science 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:04.129
 rationalism and is also available in 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:07.940
 renaissance but there politicians shuffled 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:11.780
 so what became a very controversial century 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:16.370
 and in the ideology of the order of sciences 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:22.240
 reduced and moved away from the factories slightly 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:26.599
 away if you take no bonus then 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:30.349
 it turns out 3 we have one bonus she 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:35.389
 It turned out as if all the same 2 science from 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:37.580
 factories the whole thing was complicated here in 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:44.379
 thinking about where to go next 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:50.590
 and then I decided to move to the side 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:53.590
 lunch diplomacy we won 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.590
 diplomatic 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.349
 I also wanted to say a few words about 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.300
 what with the introduction 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:04.210
 caravans was not profitable at all 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.340
 fight 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:11.139
 especially one city because its 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.000
 easy to cut off all the money right away 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:19.129
 are decreasing 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.319
 significant enough and not just one 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:25.180
 city ​​if the country is not very big then 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:29.509
 and isolate is very simple 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:35.690
 from caravans and to other countries that 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:39.590
 deprives them of funding we are on the third 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:45.110
 place in the results of all 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:49.490
 of previous games from victories, I was higher 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:54.669
 of all your previous victories on this in 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.669
 Generally, thank you all bye
