colorway off towards the Baron shoe but

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.969 
colorway off towards the Baron shoe but
you<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.809> close<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you know it's as close as we can get and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.730 
you know it's as close as we can get and
I<00:01:05.369> really<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.600> tropical<00:01:07.170> feel<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.560> like

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
I really like that tropical feel I like

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
I really like that tropical feel I like
I<00:01:07.950> think<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.400> gives<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.850> nice<00:01:09.119> pop<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
I think it gives it a nice pop to the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840 
I think it gives it a nice pop to the
shoe<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.680> an<00:01:10.770> overall<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.729> know

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
shoe because it's an overall you know

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.600 
shoe because it's an overall you know
basic<00:01:12.390> colorway<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> Air<00:01:13.740> Jordan<00:01:13.770> 13<00:01:14.310> but

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
basic colorway to the Air Jordan 13 but

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.580
