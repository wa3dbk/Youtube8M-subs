00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:07.709
 hello good night this video is done 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.200
 to tell us how to change them between a 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.960
 mexican itunes store account and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.640
 American sometimes people have 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.710
 two beads Nestor beads 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.019
 the very simple reason the American store 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.029
 has many more things as you can 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.420
 have two itunes store accounts very 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.340
 simple 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.530
 If we live in Mexico, what we have 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.930
 is a Mexican credit card and for 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.360
 When we open an account, we will 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.770
 Take the Mexican iTunes Store to 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.870
 have an American we will have to 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.510
 buy a gift card in the usa 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.980
 that we can register and with her 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.050
 can buy in the itunes store 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.540
 American towards the end of the video 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.940
 We will see how to register an account in 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.190
 the american itunes store but first 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.739
 let's start with the fact that a 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.570
 someone who already has two accounts can 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.239
 be changing between one and the other 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.390
 let's click on the icon then 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.850
 of adjustments 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.640
 and let's go down on this screen 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.640
 where itunes store and appstore says 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.250
 then here comes our idea of 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.259
 Manzana 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.509
 in this case and at this time I had 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.310
 the american itunes store but in 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.110
 no part says that I am in effects 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.179
 I'm especially I know that this is the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.840
 user of the American here then 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.780
 I'm going to click right on this line 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.289
 and I get this picture where here comes 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.820
 the air of the appstore and here I will give 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.820
 click on disconnect 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.560
 then we are open here so that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.619
 let's put our idea of ​​apple and our 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.630
 password of the other account that we have 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.080
 now I'm going to connect the account 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.350
 in my Mexican case 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.700
 then here I will write my idea 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.290
 because it will be the mail with which I 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.750
 register and register the card 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.750
 credit the password and I'll give it 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.170
 click on connect 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.290
 we see the connection process 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.450
 and then it connects here would come the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.000
 apple leader and I already have open now 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.390
 this dialogue at this time if I go to 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.750
 the appstore will be in the appstore 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.780
 Mexican yes 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.090
 again I give a click here to 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.640
 disconnect me yes and then here I should 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.760
 say disconnect let's go from 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.739
 now to start the process for those who 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.239
 they do not have two itunes store accounts 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.959
 who can have two itunes accounts 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.769
 store then right now I was 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.319
 with my idea of ​​Mexico but I went to 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.230
 buy a USA gift card and 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.500
 I want to create an account for itunes 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.500
 American store so I'm going to 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.700
 click here and then tell me all 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.660
 these options where I tell you 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.130
 log off 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.140
 what I want is to disconnect my account 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.500
 current to go to the account to go to 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.140
 create the new account 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.080
 and then here I will have to say 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.900
 create a new idea in case I do not have a 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.400
 idea for the account for the itunes store 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.129
 United States 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.950
 then asks me what this to 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:16.300
 this you want to connect here on the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.450

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.489
 and I'm going to choose, I'm going to click on the 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.900
 I said and a stage since I chose 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.020
 then I'm going to click on 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.260
 following 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.439
 I'm going down 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.819
 I will accept the conditions and I will 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.099
 click here to accept 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.689
 and I will go filling the data that I 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.930
 they ask what I'm going to do is that here 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.189
 I have to use a different email 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.469
 what am I using in the appstore 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:52.590
 Mexican so you must have another 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:54.269
 mail account already activated if I go to 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.560
 put the cons in the password that 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.859
 I want you to use the same 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.450
 password for your two itunes store and 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.069
 You'll start filling the data to 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.950
 down as it comes in another video 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.129
 explained as we are already inside the 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.840
 concept that we are in the US then 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.359
 and nothing else fill the data and you're going to 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.280
 ask what you want to pay with 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.500
 credit card or card 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.000
 gift on the following screens 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.239
 That's where you're going to click on 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.770
 gift card and you're going to write down the 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.020
 number that comes the gift card 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.060
 on the back that would be the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.070
 way of being able to have two accounts 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.870
 itunes store and the way of being 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.940
 exchanging between one and the other as it is 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.650
 tell him to disconnect simply and 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.169
 put the data either one or the other 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.270
 well I hope this video serves me 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.529
 I roll a little bit but I think for the 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.689
 people who 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:45.899
 have two accounts will be a lot 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:48.889
 much use a greeting to all and even 

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:48.889
 the next video
