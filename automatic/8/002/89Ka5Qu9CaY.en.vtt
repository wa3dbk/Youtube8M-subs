00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's sing...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(1)There is no name so sweet on earth

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
No name so sweet in heaven,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The Name before his wondrous birth

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
To Christ the Saviour given.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We love to sing around our King,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And hail him blessed Jesus

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
For there's no word ear ever heard

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So dear, so sweet as Jesus.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
(2)And, when he hung upon the tree,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
They wrote this Name above him

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That all might see the reason we

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
For evermore must love him

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We love to sing around our King,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And hail him blessed Jesus

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
For there's no word ear ever heard

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So dear, so sweet as Jesus.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(3)So now, upon his Father's throne,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Almighty to release us

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
From sin and pains, he gladly reigns,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The Prince and Saviour Jesus.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We love to sing around our King,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And hail him blessed Jesus

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
For there's no word ear ever heard

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So dear, so sweet as Jesus.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(4)To Jesus ev'ry knee shall bow,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And ev'ry tongue confess him,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And we unite with saints in light,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Our only Lord to bless him.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We love to sing around our King,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And hail him blessed Jesus;

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
For there's no word ear ever heard

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So dear, so sweet as Jesus.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Amen!
