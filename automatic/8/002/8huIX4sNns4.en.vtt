 revised with respect to the original model that appeared before in the market

 there are some very significant changes such as the replacement of 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 metallic finish present in the previous models but the novelty of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.070

 although to make the most of it 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.460
 previously we will have to install the software that is included next to the

 being five of them completely programmable with the option to record 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:16.179

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.099
 Key combinations for later active 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.480

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.040
 doing any other task not 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.490
