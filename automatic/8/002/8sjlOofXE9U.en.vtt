that in the packaging so the holster for
the<00:02:09.910> knife<00:02:10.149> actually<00:02:10.690> cleared<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.290> up<00:02:11.440> pretty

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
the knife actually cleared it up pretty

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.830 
the knife actually cleared it up pretty
you<00:02:12.160> know<00:02:12.190> I've<00:02:12.579> straightened<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.150> out<00:02:13.239> okay

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
you know I've straightened it out okay

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.930 
you know I've straightened it out okay
but<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.650> how<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:14.890> has<00:02:14.920> these<00:02:15.280> rivets<00:02:15.579> going

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
but I like how it has these rivets going

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.490 
but I like how it has these rivets going
on<00:02:16.090> at<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.269> bottom<00:02:16.480> well<00:02:17.140> know<00:02:17.260> why<00:02:17.350> it's

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
on at the bottom well know why it's

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.229 
on at the bottom well know why it's
painted<00:02:17.890> all<00:02:18.010> black<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.000> silver

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
painted all black and just a silver

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.910 
painted all black and just a silver
streak<00:02:19.690> going<00:02:19.900> across<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.320> top<00:02:20.350> something

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
streak going across the top something

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.949 
streak going across the top something
like<00:02:21.100> this<00:02:21.220> I'd<00:02:21.400> expect<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.790> see<00:02:21.880> all<00:02:22.239> silver<00:02:22.750> I

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
like this I'd expect to see all silver I

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.020 
like this I'd expect to see all silver I
don't<00:02:23.500> know<00:02:23.620> maybe<00:02:23.860> it's<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.130> specific<00:02:24.400> kind<00:02:24.880> of

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
don't know maybe it's a specific kind of

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.330 
don't know maybe it's a specific kind of
knife<00:02:25.269> but<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.109> knife<00:02:26.139> itself<00:02:26.739> does<00:02:27.070> hold

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
knife but the knife itself does hold

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.620 
knife but the knife itself does hold
pretty<00:02:27.609> well<00:02:27.790> in<00:02:27.880> his<00:02:28.000> hand<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.359> like<00:02:28.449> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
pretty well in his hand I like the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.509 
pretty well in his hand I like the
rivets<00:02:28.930> on<00:02:29.079> the<00:02:29.109> handle<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.769> think<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.310> really

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
rivets on the handle I think that really

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.380 
rivets on the handle I think that really
helps<00:02:30.940> have

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
helps have

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.500 
helps have
him<00:02:31.630> hold<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.200> knife<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:33.130> both<00:02:33.400> hands<00:02:33.970> gripped

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
him hold the knife so both hands gripped

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.720 
him hold the knife so both hands gripped
the<00:02:34.630> knife<00:02:34.810> pretty<00:02:35.290> well<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.190> stays

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
the knife pretty well and it stays

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.960 
the knife pretty well and it stays
pretty<00:02:37.180> nicely<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.959> same<00:02:38.440> thing<00:02:38.470> with<00:02:38.970> this

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
pretty nicely and same thing with this

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.900 
pretty nicely and same thing with this
side<00:02:40.420> over<00:02:40.780> here<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:42.010> that's<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.430> little<00:02:42.640> looser

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
side over here so that's a little looser

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.550 
side over here so that's a little looser
on<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.270> side<00:02:43.480> now<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:43.750> side<00:02:43.959> has<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> trigger

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
on this side now this side has a trigger

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.290 
on this side now this side has a trigger
finger<00:02:44.800> sticking<00:02:45.310> out<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:45.700> when<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:45.910> do<00:02:46.090> have

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
finger sticking out so when you do have

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.320 
finger sticking out so when you do have
him<00:02:46.450> holding<00:02:46.750> his<00:02:46.959> guns<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:48.130> does<00:02:48.580> go<00:02:49.180> in

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
him holding his guns it does go in

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.970 
him holding his guns it does go in
nicely<00:02:49.780> through<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.080> trigger<00:02:50.350> hole<00:02:50.620> like

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
nicely through the trigger hole like

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.210 
nicely through the trigger hole like
that<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:52.360> side<00:02:52.720> over<00:02:52.930> here<00:02:53.080> on<00:02:53.740> his<00:02:53.860> left

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
that on this side over here on his left

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.370 
that on this side over here on his left
hand<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:55.000> don't<00:02:55.150> really<00:02:55.240> get<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:55.690> function

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
hand you don't really get that function

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.320 
hand you don't really get that function
so<00:02:56.680> much<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.100> looks<00:02:57.130> like<00:02:57.610> it's<00:02:57.850> sticking<00:02:58.120> out

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
so much it looks like it's sticking out

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.120 
so much it looks like it's sticking out
but<00:02:58.540> it's<00:02:58.660> not<00:02:58.870> there<00:02:59.230> all<00:02:59.380> together<00:02:59.680> right

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
but it's not there all together right

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.270 
but it's not there all together right
there<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.780> yeah<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.470> get<00:03:02.620> kind<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.069> fake

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
there and yeah so you get kind of fake

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.490 
there and yeah so you get kind of fake
it<00:03:03.310> but<00:03:03.820> it's<00:03:04.060> not<00:03:04.270> really<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.959> know<00:03:04.989> doing

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
it but it's not really you know doing

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.680 
it but it's not really you know doing
the<00:03:05.530> same<00:03:05.830> kind<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.160> deal<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.360> can<00:03:07.540> see

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
the same kind of deal so you can see

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.509 
the same kind of deal so you can see
that<00:03:07.840> he's<00:03:07.930> got<00:03:08.140> sculpted<00:03:08.770> fingernails<00:03:09.250> there

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
that he's got sculpted fingernails there

another<00:03:11.890> thing<00:03:12.130> that's<00:03:12.220> kind<00:03:12.550> of<00:03:12.580> trippy

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
another thing that's kind of trippy

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.100 
another thing that's kind of trippy
about<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.269> is<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> same

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
about this is that this is the same

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.840 
about this is that this is the same
exact<00:03:14.470> head<00:03:14.680> scope<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.250> we<00:03:15.340> got<00:03:15.550> for<00:03:15.760> the

really important for three three-quarter
inch<00:04:45.810> figures<00:04:46.170> because<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.530> weapons<00:04:46.860> are<00:04:47.070> so

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
inch figures because the weapons are so

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.130 
inch figures because the weapons are so
small<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:48.000> only<00:04:48.210> weapon<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.660> he<00:04:48.780> cannot

small the only weapon that he cannot
store<00:04:49.770> is<00:04:50.130> this<00:04:50.820> bigger<00:04:51.150> one<00:04:51.390> right<00:04:51.600> here<00:04:51.900> so

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
store is this bigger one right here so

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.650 
store is this bigger one right here so
you<00:04:52.890> know<00:04:53.010> that's<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:53.460> that's<00:04:53.940> cool<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.330> like

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660

that

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.750 
that
so<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.500> articulation<00:04:56.100> of<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.280> figure<00:04:56.310> is

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
so the articulation of the figure is

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.910 
so the articulation of the figure is
awesome<00:04:57.240> his<00:04:57.390> head<00:04:57.600> moves<00:04:57.780> very<00:04:58.320> far<00:04:58.680> back
