00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
stake one of those wooden skewers of

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.430 
stake one of those wooden skewers of
some<00:04:58.190> sort<00:04:58.490> of<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:58.820> chopstick<00:04:59.330> maybe<00:04:59.539> and<00:05:00.139> put

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
some sort of a chopstick maybe and put

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.860 
some sort of a chopstick maybe and put
it<00:05:00.530> in<00:05:00.650> place<00:05:01.160> of<00:05:01.370> this<00:05:01.460> one<00:05:01.639> here<00:05:01.970> after<00:05:02.720> you

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
it in place of this one here after you

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.390 
it in place of this one here after you
unpin<00:05:03.229> it<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.590> start<00:05:03.919> tightening<00:05:04.099> it<00:05:04.310> up

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400

making sure you keep your you know Turks
in<00:05:07.460> formation<00:05:07.940> because<00:05:08.150> if<00:05:08.630> you<00:05:08.750> tighten<00:05:08.930> it

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
in formation because if you tighten it

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.920 
in formation because if you tighten it
up<00:05:09.080> too<00:05:09.289> fast<00:05:09.530> or<00:05:09.889> too<00:05:09.919> hard<00:05:10.340> it'll<00:05:11.180> lose<00:05:11.780> the

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
up too fast or too hard it'll lose the

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.480 
up too fast or too hard it'll lose the
shape<00:05:12.169> and<00:05:12.349> you<00:05:12.409> got<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.590> redo<00:05:12.770> it<00:05:12.860> again<00:05:12.919> so

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
shape and you got to redo it again so

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.710 
shape and you got to redo it again so
take<00:05:13.699> your<00:05:13.789> time<00:05:13.940> tighten<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.330> up<00:05:14.389> bit<00:05:14.599> by<00:05:14.630> bit

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
take your time tighten it up bit by bit

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.360 
take your time tighten it up bit by bit
and<00:05:15.139> then<00:05:15.860> this<00:05:16.069> will<00:05:16.280> give<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.669> a<00:05:18.370> nice

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.080 
and then this will give you a nice
toggle<00:05:20.560> like<00:05:21.560> that<00:05:21.710> right<00:05:21.860> there<00:05:21.919> you<00:05:22.070> see<00:05:22.370> my

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
toggle like that right there you see my

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.300 
toggle like that right there you see my
wrist<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:26.590> you<00:05:27.590> have<00:05:27.710> two<00:05:27.860> course<00:05:28.130> trains

wrist and you have two course trains
running<00:05:28.490> down<00:05:28.669> after<00:05:28.849> you<00:05:28.909> get<00:05:29.000> it<00:05:29.090> all

tighten<00:05:46.789> it<00:05:46.820> up<00:05:46.909> it<00:05:47.060> has<00:05:47.150> a<00:05:47.180> tendency<00:05:47.270> to<00:05:47.719> kind

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
tighten it up it has a tendency to kind

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.839 
tighten it up it has a tendency to kind
of<00:05:47.960> get<00:05:48.139> pushed<00:05:48.409> down<00:05:48.469> a<00:05:48.590> little<00:05:48.830> bit<00:05:48.979> and<00:05:49.219> that

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
of get pushed down a little bit and that

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.749 
of get pushed down a little bit and that
will<00:05:50.000> keep<00:05:50.210> it<00:05:50.360> firm<00:05:50.690> to<00:05:51.320> where<00:05:51.530> it'll<00:05:52.310> stay<00:05:52.520> up

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
will keep it firm to where it'll stay up

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.409 
will keep it firm to where it'll stay up
on<00:05:52.969> the<00:05:53.150> top<00:05:53.360> and<00:05:53.389> not<00:05:53.780> be<00:05:53.930> indented<00:05:54.550> okay<00:05:55.550> and

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
on the top and not be indented okay and

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.990 
on the top and not be indented okay and
then<00:05:56.659> once<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:56.990> do<00:05:57.110> that<00:05:57.139> and<00:05:57.800> it's<00:05:58.610> you<00:05:58.909> know

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
then once you do that and it's you know

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.700 
then once you do that and it's you know
and<00:05:59.180> you<00:05:59.300> got<00:05:59.479> it<00:05:59.630> positioned<00:05:59.810> right<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:00.590> it's

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
and you got it positioned right and it's

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.689 
and you got it positioned right and it's
about<00:06:00.770> as<00:06:00.949> tight<00:06:01.070> as<00:06:01.190> you<00:06:01.219> want<00:06:01.370> to<00:06:01.430> get<00:06:01.580> it
