00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.080
 hello everyone so I'm coming back 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.690
 finally to announce the results 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.820
 of a contest then indeed I finally 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.530
 because the closing of the contest was 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.690
 made about a week ago a 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.830
 little bit less than that so I have you 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.029
 a little bit languishing but 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.380
 actually as you know in this 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.720
 moment I do not necessarily too much the 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.010
 time no matter anyway I 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.140
 did not expect you to wait anymore 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.760
 for a long time that I first want to 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.580
 specify a little thing actually 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.670
 normally the custom looks like 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.010
 want to film the draw 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.050
 on the site random.org or on any 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.480
 what site 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.760
 in this genre there I do not have them 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.730
 did because already I find that a little 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.200
 boring I think it does not happen 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.340
 necessarily great on the camera or 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.250
 then you have to download a program 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.440
 especially brief it did not say too much 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.329
 and I assume that you 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.260
 Trust 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.760
 I hope that in any case if you have 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 participated in this contest makes you a 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.850
 little confidence anyway 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.590
 actually the purpose of this contest 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 it was to thank my subscribers for you 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.019
 thank so 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.840
 besides, I want to thank you 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.639
 again and then to have played the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.499
 game I hope it really had you 

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:13.689
 pleasure this little comment contest 

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:16.450
 I found it very nice me who 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.329
 was not necessarily for until then and 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.069
 Well, I've changed a little bit 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.240
 of opinion on it because I find that 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.560
 cool enough to make you win 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.060
 little things like that good so not everything 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.909
 time no longer that it becomes 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.219
 a habit but but actually I 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.109
 find it still pretty cool 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.450
 so short here i'm just going to you 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.849
 announce the winner's name since 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.109
 is a winner at the winner's bada 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:39.369
 by the way I do not think I actually 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.029
 two boys who attended my 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:46.270
 contest well pity because I know he 

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:50.560
 there are some but put so that's it 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.359
 Just ad like that if they like 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.999
 not to some bah listen this will be 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.319
 pity but actually normally 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.689
 there should be no worries since 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.159
 you are intelligent people 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.520
 so the winner 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.619
 these are raids 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.539
 in good it seems to me that it's that I 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.989
 not noted the name I have not my screen under 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.840
 eyes so here you have won 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.230
 if you watch the video if you miss the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.989
 video 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.030
 Well, I'll send a mail from 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.190
 anyway on on youtube 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.510
 so here's for the other baths in all 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.590
 case again thank you for participating 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.110
 it was really cool I do not know 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.379
 too much when will I be able to 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.790
 rearrange that kind of little stuff there 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.640
 but in any case I will try to 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.319
 do it again not I want 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.510
 apologize for my absence a little bit 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.190
 right now you know actually it's at 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.450
 did I change jobs all that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.190
 so everything is going very well it's for 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.130
 very good reasons but on the other hand 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.930
 actually my channel is getting a little 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.510
 little less sick my priority is for sure 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.069
 I do not hide it from you 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.480
 think you noticed that I 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.560

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.069

 I try to post you regularly 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.120
 but make-up of the day for example things 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.709
 like that so really I advise you 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.750

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.340

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.060

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.560
 youtube is actually born then that 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.970
