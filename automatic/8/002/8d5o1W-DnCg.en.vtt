00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.720
 hi i am a princess 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.360
 today we talk and with the most 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.540
 annoying characters fnaf namely both 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.540
 he used to be, I look carefully 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.600
 interesting and now friends are sure 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.230
 put likes if you want to see more 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.500
 video on this game and let's get started for 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 start talking about balun fight from old 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.730
 parts fnaf 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.189
 if we look at it closer it 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.430
 You may notice that he does not have it before 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.100
 the skeleton is very visible when he 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.920
 climbs on the ventilation inside his head 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.219
 nothing is the same if you look at it 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.170
 hands it can be understood that they can not 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.149
 be it to the skeleton as they are too 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.640
 thin and that is a balun bout it's just 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.890
 plastic doll and not a robot like 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.850
 many thought 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.000
 single electronic device 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.820
 which is inside them the body is 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.970
 special sound system 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.320
 and sensors and using this device 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.320
 balun bout can talk and laugh 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 however, the ability to move 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.950
 he is not provided but then how 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.130
 way it can move through 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.520
 ventilation 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.189
 that's what I want to explain to you now 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.890
 but first look at the puppet 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.400
 as you know she also has no endoskeleton 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.549
 and she generally is a regular doll and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.530
 but no matter how freely 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.430
 move around the pizzeria so as 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.079
 fully controlled by the baby shower which 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.439
 is in the body 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:50.430
 are puppets it means that balun 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.509
 the battle is also controlled by the baby’s soul and this 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.020
 can confirm 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.329
 one of the game files a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.909
 namely, if we take that moment when 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.429
 balun bout stands in the office and look at 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.710
 you can see him closer 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:08.690
 mouth something gray and similar to the two eyes 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.810
 maybe this is the ghost 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.690
 who runs this google and also 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.989
 can take into account the fact that the ghost of gray 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.650
 colors and how do you know all the ghosts of children 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:25.430
 From mini-games and also gray I don’t think 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.000
 that this is a coincidence my friends and now 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.530
 it remains only to understand whose soul can 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.720
 be inside a balun fight if you 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.049
 are there any options for this 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.349
 about or guess, be sure to write 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:45.410
 your comments and them and let's 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.410
 will continue we examined the balun battlefield from 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.590
 fnaf 2 and realized that he is not 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.769
 animatronic and now move on to 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.010
 the third part fnaf and compare 2 balun 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:01.579
 fighting amongst themselves the most obvious difference 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.940
 is of course the appearance as well 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.930
 the lack of a ball and a plate he fell 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.450
 became 3 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.569
 but there is another unusual difference 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.150
 which not everyone noticed and you can 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.150
 see only at the moment of skimmer 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.540
 when balun bout jumps on guard then 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.940
 the moment he opens his mouth wide but 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.040
 how is this possible since we 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.069
 look at the balun fight again 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.040
 but as you can see his mouth should not 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.410
 open and have a plastic head even 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.440
 there is no mechanism that has 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.389
 ordinary animatronics so there is 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.819
 just one guess 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:44.209
 and it is that phantoms 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.910
 are free to change yourself and just 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.880
 This is what we see in the example of a balun fight 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.490
 and now friends are the most interesting 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.000
 Many people think why a sprinter to attach 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.980
 the voice of a balun battle about it goes a lot 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.740
 different theories but the most 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.230
 common theory is that 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.170
 integrated electronic system 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.460
 for voice recognition with 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.910
 which sprint 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.580
 should and childish voice or laughter to 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.420
 entertain children in the pizzeria and constantly 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.900
 be near them and there and when we 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.970
 We include in the rooms the voice of balun battle 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.320
 this comes sprint 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.450
 and looking for children to play with them 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.770
 The theory is certainly good, but most likely 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:37.590
 is a myth and now I will explain why in 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.140
 one of the mini games on stage 01 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.680
 we see the sprint and golden freddy 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.750
 which amuse the children that means that 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.020
 the sprint was created before anyone else 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.030
 animatronics she was 50s and how 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.670
 Von Guy tells us that initially 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.820
 A recognition system was built in. 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.680
 voices that is so like event in the third 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.990
 parts of the game occur after events 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.450
 first part then we play 2023 and 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.520
 if you think of such a house by the time 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.580
 all electronics in sprint suit 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.580
 could easily fail 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.560
 this is also indicated by the fact that the whole 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.070
 his body is abnormal 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.210
 condition besides from his head sticking out 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.060
 sets of wires 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.060
 which is most likely responsible for the part 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.210
 electronics and possibly on the system 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.570
 voice recognition is therefore more likely 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.670
 the whole sprint system is not at all 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.920
 works and Kostya electronics in his 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.430
 Suit to the same mini game can be 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.930
 see rain dripping from the roof 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.960
 electronics could simply shut up 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.990
 therefore only its mechanical work 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.419
 there is an endoskeleton therefore he 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.780
 can't go to voice because of the program 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.360
 since it does not work for him and now 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.240
 my theory is about why she goes on 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.930
 the voice of the balun battle was already spoken in one of 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.120
 their videos and the fact that the guard jeremy from 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.789
 The second part of the fnaf is purple 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.039
 man can recognize this in one of 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:13.199
 mini games when purple man 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.870
 turns off Freddie and since he has 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:18.750
 a lever for turning off animatronics and he 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.080
 is at night a pizza guard guard 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.270
 clearly says that this is the rome then 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.349
 have he been the only guard 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:33.449
 to whom the balun fight came at night and 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:36.270
 made sounds and therefore as 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.979
 three sprintrapa is jeremy he 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.979
 hears the voice of a balun fight 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:44.280
 remembers him and therefore leads on 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:47.310
 familiar mura no voice also i have 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.039
 second theory about this which 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.560
 my sweet friends told me 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:55.440
 lies with the theory is that in one 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.740
 from my videos I said that Jeremy 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.710
 looking for my son and you personally my theory 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.219
 and so when he hears a childish voice 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:08.639
 began to think that it was his son and therefore 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:11.490
 goes to look for it thought these two theories 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.710
 ring true since we know 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.039
 that sprint is kind of ki 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.919
 the gods and his endoskeleton is responsible for 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:21.990
 moving and soul is jeremy responsible for 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:24.810
 all actions that this 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.690
 endoskeleth so my friends 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:30.719
 be sure to write in your comments 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:32.550
 to culture and believe most hope 

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:34.590
 release you liked 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.440
 talk about this video with all your 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.080
 friends and acquaintances perhaps they 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.550
 There will be options about this. 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.570
 be sure to put likes join 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.580
