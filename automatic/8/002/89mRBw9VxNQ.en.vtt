00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.690
 it is 7 o'clock sharp this is the beginning of 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.220
 the day for anthony originally from the 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.960
 moselle four years ago that he is at 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.210
 racing training center 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.320
 at just 16 years old helped the leader of 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.770
 his team's game 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.540
 the u17 which evolves in national the most 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.110
 high level of French football for 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.670
 young players it's racing that 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.510
 have offered me to come so I have not 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.210
 hesitated a second 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.719
 how did it happen with your parents 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.879
 wen took very well jean allu and I 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.790
 reduce it I wanted to come 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.160
 today day it is I get up I 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.370
 Guided ge after I come back in my 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.610
 charge our friends i'm going to school and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.530
 after school workouts a day 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.600
 maybe anthony will raise cut out 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.489
 will be a great footballer but for 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.430
 the moment the reality of training 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.530
 it's football but also school 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.630
 education is paramount places 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.970
 of professional players are rare there 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.429
 must ensure above all his back here 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.830
 u19 players prepare their bac 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.539
 pro trade 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.190
 it's like in sports studies actually 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.619
 did and ran after we trained 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.990
 in case it does not work the foundation there 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.520
 something after the side you want 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.479
 ask this question must of course 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.039
 suddenly before you really well 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.149
 worked at school and it's having the 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.860
 bac after we will see more 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.350
 even if that's the message it's pushing them 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.560
 to follow the studies everyone is not going 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.569
 to succeed, that's for sure, so studies 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.549
 can be a door of what we will say 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.670
 a little you still need to be graduates at 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.700
 case they do not succeed that can 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.740
 to be a promising young can get hurt 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.540
 it can put a brake on his career 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.070
 so 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.400
 in front of graduates it's all the time 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.870
 as in the locker room u15 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.510
 the atmosphere is good 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.590
 the crampons are there it's time to 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.870
 the training just ring 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.030
 the team evolves into a division of honor 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.610
 these budding footballers are trained 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.050
 by independent sports educators who 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:18.760
 must give them a taste for effort and 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:19.950
 develop their qualities we insist 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.090
 a lot about the individual technique 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.030
 really controlling the balloon the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.580
 mastery of technical gestures and 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.500
 then the most important of 2.1 points 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.590
 it's the state of mind 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.360
 the club mindset be regular and 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.540
 reliable that we can count on the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.170
 boy have a competitor mind 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.800
 have a mind where we want to win or we 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.800
 makes the efforts 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.720
 founded in 1972 the training center of the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.300
 racing club of strasbourg is one of 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.620
 oldest of France in 2006 the ja 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.260
 we even pick up a cup 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.930
 gambardella ten prestigious names are 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.300
 passed by there valerian ismael morgan 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.040
 schneider the one kevin gameiro but also 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.500
 legends of the time like albert 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.030
 gemmrich and arsene wenger who did 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.220
 their first class in the center as 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.320
 that coach young people today 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.720
 it's thierry brand who runs this 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.420
 prestigious institution in the center 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.160
 since 1990 he is the director 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.280
 for two years I have known them all 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.180
 the dacourt the gameiro and martin djetou 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.510
 david liot says they would have liked 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.189
 a little later 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.409
 jean alain fanchone tomatoes 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.269
 herminie all these players there were 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.010
 all there then clearly we want 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.900
 train players to play in league 1 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.159
 lille 2 1 not to do since one 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.540
 could also very well trained 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.370
 national players who have between 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.260
 quotation marks a pro status also status of 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.640
 federal player we clearly want 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.560
 that we pass players passing 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.860
 of formation strasbourg arrives at most 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.530
 high level 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.790
 so at least league 1 league 2 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.090
 incidentally but mostly league 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.440
 it's clear that the base is the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.760
 work is of course the work of equipped 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.200
 collective work 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.129
 but we at everyone's interest to what 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.359
 we are interested is the trajectory 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.519
 individual player 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.870
 players with high potential we try 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.760
 to upgrade them we try to make them 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.170
 play in the teams above we 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.659
 try to arrange a job for them 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.310
 time even sometimes they are allowed to 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.079
 miss two hours of classes they 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.129
 will catch up during the holidays for 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.500
 that they can train with a 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.560
 stronger group for example we have one 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.049
 who who morning is not going to 8 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.850
 to 10 who is in terminal but who can 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.100
 train with the first team 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.229
 with the national team so that's it 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.970
 we are ready to do it for and for 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.430
 tops for top level players 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.800
 the loss of the professional status of 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.780
 racing in 2011 had an impact on the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.849
 training center that is no longer 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.780
 labeled which has become a school of 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.120
 elite football 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.250
 the majority of players are Alsatian 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.500
 Recruitment is calm and level 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.330
 did not drop the wine 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.650
 Alsatians has good qualities and counts 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.510
 to make the good days of the team 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.949
 one in a few years I have full 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.139
 of friends they are racing fans of 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.090
 the first team and that's always 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.650
 pleasure when he said I'm going to the 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.900
 meinau this friday and killing see with 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.190
 me it always makes you happy because 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.330
 that you say you want in this club and 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.060
 this is one of the best bazas clubs in 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.870
 so evolved into a team and why not 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.050
 it's just the world 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.400
 we have a competitive state of mind and 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.139
 on the ground and friendship in the 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.320
 cloakrooms and we help each other on the 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.270
 field that's the main thing is we're going 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.510
 all make the efforts each one for 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.190
 the other 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.630
 so we think if we make the effort to 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.150
 someone and we know that the trim to do 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.889
 same for us so that's it 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.780
 first and foremost a need to be 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.830
 teammates we are good friends this is 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.830
 what makes the difference on the ground 

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:41.580
 here and 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.860
 that's the goal we get out of 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.170
 lot of players on a generation between 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.760
 1 and 3 3 is already huge and if we 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.630
 gets out of the kids that's already 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.190
 well we miss the look on 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.460
 the state of mind is on the side 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:01.200
 educational very important because if 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:03.960
 it's to bring in how we can 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.060
 to say rascals 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.490
 and then after that gives a 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.620
 bad image at the level above 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.170
 no it is the state of mind first of all he 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.930
 must we kids then necessarily 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.910
 we do not want vain sheep but he 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.470
 must in any case education the 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.200
 politeness it must be essential 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.430
 we want to fit men before 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.760
 train the players we need to train 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.760
 men 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.330
 the next generation is in training the center has 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.830
 still beautiful hours to live 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.690
 the young shoots of the root put 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.310
 all their heart to live their dream 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.260
 hope their efforts are 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.300
 rewarded the future of football 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.510
 Alsatian and racing will not be done 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.510
 without them
