a<00:00:19.590> short<00:00:19.920> video<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.369> show<00:00:20.550> how<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.850> works<00:00:21.500> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
a short video to show how it works so

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
move forward and move my hand in front

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
move forward and move my hand in front
of<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.629> see<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:42.989> lights<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.579> you<00:00:44.579> can

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
of it you see it lights right up you can

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.779 
of it you see it lights right up you can
see<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.719> center<00:00:46.079> says<00:00:46.350> heat<00:00:46.590> set<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> 67

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
see the center says heat set to 67

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.130 
see the center says heat set to 67
that's<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.120> current<00:00:48.420> setting<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
that's the current setting for the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.259 
that's the current setting for the
thermostat<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.550> at<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:50.820> top<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.239> can

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
thermostat and then at the top you can

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.830 
thermostat and then at the top you can
see<00:00:51.420> 69<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> little<00:00:52.710> bar<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.660> gonna

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
see 69 a little bar there the I'm gonna

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.240 
see 69 a little bar there the I'm gonna
zoom<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.379> bit<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> little

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
zoom in a little bit so you see a little

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.849 
zoom in a little bit so you see a little
better<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.510> obviously<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.199> thermostat

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
better the so obviously the thermostat

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.500 
better the so obviously the thermostat
setting<00:01:02.519> is<00:01:02.640> lower<00:01:02.879> than<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> current

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
setting is lower than the current

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.830 
setting is lower than the current
temperature<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.040> room<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.940> we're<00:01:06.510> fine

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
temperature in the room and we're fine

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.000 
temperature in the room and we're fine
with<00:01:07.440> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
with that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.300 
with that
now<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.930> Learning<00:01:10.260> Thermostat<00:01:10.440> has<00:01:10.980> a<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.280> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
now the Learning Thermostat has a lot of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.040 
now the Learning Thermostat has a lot of
settings<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> don't<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.690> open<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
settings and you don't have to open it

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.680 
settings and you don't have to open it
up<00:01:13.170> or<00:01:13.320> anything<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:15.240> actually

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
up or anything to do it it's actually

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.790 
up or anything to do it it's actually
quite<00:01:16.850> quite<00:01:17.850> simple<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.620> outer

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
quite quite simple that the the outer

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.210 
quite quite simple that the the outer
ring<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.900> control<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.070> see

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
ring here is a control and you can see

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.670 
ring here is a control and you can see
in<00:01:23.370> as<00:01:23.490> normal<00:01:24.090> mode<00:01:24.510> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.990> adjust<00:01:25.380> where

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
in as normal mode you can adjust where

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.220 
in as normal mode you can adjust where
you<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> thermostat<00:01:26.910> to<00:01:26.940> be<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.080> to

you want the thermostat to be we get to
a<00:01:28.260> point<00:01:28.410> where<00:01:28.620> it<00:01:28.710> would<00:01:28.800> start<00:01:29.040> heating<00:01:29.400> it

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
a point where it would start heating it

and I'll just leave it on heat because
yeah<00:02:14.010> right<00:02:14.340> now<00:02:14.459> that's<00:02:14.819> what<00:02:14.969> we<00:02:15.090> need<00:02:15.269> press

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
yeah right now that's what we need press

and<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.850> can<00:02:18.240> move<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:21.530> schedule<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.690> nest

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
and I can move to schedule and the nest

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900 
and I can move to schedule and the nest
is<00:02:25.110> Learning<00:02:25.500> Thermostat<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.550> it's

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
is Learning Thermostat so it's it's

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.810 
is Learning Thermostat so it's it's
currently<00:02:27.660> recording<00:02:28.220> when<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.550> have

currently recording when we have

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.510 
currently recording when we have
adjusted<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.570> now<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:31.530> haven't<00:02:31.950> done<00:02:32.250> anything

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
adjusted it now we haven't done anything

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.700 
adjusted it now we haven't done anything
really<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.240> Wednesday<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:33.870> kind<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.110> permits

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
really on Wednesday it's kind of permits

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.500 
really on Wednesday it's kind of permits
kind<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.010> suggesting<00:02:35.820> how<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.420> to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
kind of suggesting how it's going to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.840 
kind of suggesting how it's going to
work<00:02:36.660> through<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> week<00:02:37.430> when<00:02:38.430> we<00:02:38.520> get<00:02:38.670> to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
work through the week when we get to

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.550 
work through the week when we get to
Friday<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.390> Saturday<00:02:39.900> we'll<00:02:40.110> see<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.320> couple

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
Friday and Saturday we'll see a couple

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.440 
Friday and Saturday we'll see a couple
more<00:02:40.860> interesting<00:02:41.490> points<00:02:41.820> these<00:02:41.940> are<00:02:42.090> points

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
more interesting points these are points

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.570 
more interesting points these are points
where<00:02:42.570> we<00:02:42.690> actually<00:02:43.170> adjusted<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.830> some<00:02:44.460> of

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
where we actually adjusted it some of

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.460 
where we actually adjusted it some of
these<00:02:44.700> are<00:02:44.910> me<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.210> Debbie<00:02:45.390> fighting<00:02:46.110> over

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
these are me and Debbie fighting over

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.500 
these are me and Debbie fighting over
the<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:47.640> setting<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.240> thermostat<00:02:48.630> and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
the the setting for the thermostat and

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.090 
the the setting for the thermostat and
so<00:02:51.510> that's<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.900> schedule<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.410> as<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.980> get

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
so that's the schedule and as we get

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.250 
so that's the schedule and as we get
more<00:02:53.280> data<00:02:53.580> points<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.080> mast

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
more data points in the in the mast

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.080 
more data points in the in the mast
it'll<00:02:55.620> start<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.950> build<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.340> bigger<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.790> better

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
it'll start to build a bigger a better

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.090 
it'll start to build a bigger a better
schedule<00:02:58.280> energy<00:02:59.280> shows<00:02:59.670> us<00:03:00.290> what<00:03:01.290> our<00:03:01.320> usage

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
schedule energy shows us what our usage

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.970 
schedule energy shows us what our usage
has<00:03:02.250> been<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.850> for<00:03:03.090> example<00:03:03.570> Friday<00:03:04.560> had

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
has been so for example Friday had

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.860 
has been so for example Friday had
fairly<00:03:05.220> low<00:03:05.550> usage<00:03:06.060> only<00:03:06.300> seven<00:03:06.780> minutes

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
fairly low usage only seven minutes

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.690 
fairly low usage only seven minutes
because<00:03:07.290> yeah<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.950> was<00:03:08.070> when<00:03:08.190> we<00:03:08.340> installed

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
because yeah that was when we installed

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.020 
because yeah that was when we installed
it<00:03:08.900> Saturday<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.410> was<00:03:10.950> home<00:03:11.160> by<00:03:11.340> myself<00:03:11.820> pretty

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
it Saturday I was home by myself pretty

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.610 
it Saturday I was home by myself pretty
much<00:03:12.180> most<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.750> day<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.170> me<00:03:13.260> only<00:03:13.380> use

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
much most of the day and I me only use

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.720 
much most of the day and I me only use
it<00:03:13.770> for<00:03:13.890> 32<00:03:14.130> minutes

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
it for 32 minutes

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.720 
it for 32 minutes
but<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.720> Sunday<00:03:16.290> everyone<00:03:17.010> was<00:03:17.340> here<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.670> we

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
but on Sunday everyone was here and we

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.070 
but on Sunday everyone was here and we
used<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.060> for<00:03:18.209> an<00:03:18.270> hour<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.570> half<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:18.990> it

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
used it for an hour and a half so it

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.570 
used it for an hour and a half so it
kind<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.260> shows<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.620> how<00:03:19.800> long<00:03:20.010> you're<00:03:20.220> you're

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
kind of shows you how long you're you're

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.170 
kind of shows you how long you're you're
running<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.380> running<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.500> heater<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.180> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
running the running the heater and the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.490 
running the running the heater and the
air<00:03:24.300> conditioner<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.959> summer

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
air conditioner in the summer

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.800 
air conditioner in the summer
so<00:03:26.400> getting<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:28.280> settings<00:03:29.540> settings<00:03:30.540> is

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
so getting to settings settings is

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.460 
so getting to settings settings is
probably<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.320> biggest<00:03:31.530> menu<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.390> can<00:03:33.390> turn<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
probably the biggest menu I can turn the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.970 
probably the biggest menu I can turn the
fan<00:03:34.680> from<00:03:34.830> automatic<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.459> manual<00:03:36.739> lock<00:03:37.739> the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
fan from automatic to manual lock the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.960 
fan from automatic to manual lock the
system<00:03:38.370> if<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:38.610> wanted<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.480> example<00:03:39.570> make

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
system if I wanted to for example make

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.060 
system if I wanted to for example make
the<00:03:41.970> make<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.350> kids<00:03:43.560> couldn't<00:03:43.890> get

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
the make it so the kids couldn't get

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.509 
the make it so the kids couldn't get
into<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:46.560> then<00:03:46.800> whether<00:03:46.980> it's<00:03:47.190> on<00:03:47.400> the

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
into it and then whether it's on the

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.240 
into it and then whether it's on the
learning<00:03:47.880> schedule<00:03:48.090> or<00:03:48.420> not<00:03:49.220> what<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
learning schedule or not what the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.449 
learning schedule or not what the
brightness<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.800> screen<00:03:53.040> comes<00:03:53.280> on

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
brightness is that the screen comes on

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.920 
brightness is that the screen comes on
when<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:53.700> approach<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:56.630> clicking<00:03:57.630> as

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
when you approach that the clicking as

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.449 
when you approach that the clicking as
you<00:03:58.200> move<00:03:58.410> through<00:03:58.650> menu<00:03:58.860> items<00:03:59.130> I'll<00:03:59.280> stay

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
you move through menu items I'll stay

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.860 
you move through menu items I'll stay
quiet<00:03:59.760> for<00:03:59.880> a<00:03:59.940> second<00:04:02.450> maybe<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.600> can<00:04:03.750> hear

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
quiet for a second maybe you can hear

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.710 
quiet for a second maybe you can hear
that<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.050> don't<00:04:04.320> know<00:04:04.970> for<00:04:05.970> Fahrenheit<00:04:06.690> or
