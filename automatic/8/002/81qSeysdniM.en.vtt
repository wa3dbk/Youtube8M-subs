00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
engine at the back of the engine you can

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.180 
engine at the back of the engine you can
see<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.629> balancer<00:00:45.170> shaft<00:00:45.470> timing<00:00:46.129> is<00:00:46.309> out<00:00:46.809> and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
see the balancer shaft timing is out and

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.100 
see the balancer shaft timing is out and
the<00:00:49.190> reason<00:00:49.370> for<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.760> is<00:00:50.000> because<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.870> belt

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
the reason for that is because the belt

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.549 
the reason for that is because the belt
the<00:00:51.410> small<00:00:51.649> drive<00:00:51.980> belt<00:00:52.370> all<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.239> teeth<00:00:54.050> have

timing<00:03:48.030> belt<00:03:48.239> as<00:03:48.390> well<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.440> we<00:03:49.680> cut<00:03:49.890> this<00:03:50.069> just

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
timing belt as well so we cut this just

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.350 
timing belt as well so we cut this just
in<00:03:50.489> time<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:52.230> crankshaft<00:03:52.830> sensor<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.880> held<00:03:54.180> on

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
moved away and we line them up later on

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.290
