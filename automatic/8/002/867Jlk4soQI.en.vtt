to yank it out so easily and next up you

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.880 
to yank it out so easily and next up you
have<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:08.040> other<00:04:08.280> cable<00:04:08.580> it's<00:04:09.269> about<00:04:09.890> three

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
have the other cable it's about three

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.009 
have the other cable it's about three

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
other cable is the same length but this

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.539 
other cable is the same length but this
one<00:04:15.810> does<00:04:16.019> not<00:04:16.049> have<00:04:16.229> any<00:04:16.560> inline<00:04:16.890> microphone

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
and it also has a straight side to it

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.530 
and it also has a straight side to it
instead<00:04:22.470> of<00:04:22.530> your<00:04:23.250> angle<00:04:23.910> your<00:04:24.090> right<00:04:24.300> angle

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
instead of your angle your right angle

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.659 
instead of your angle your right angle
so<00:04:25.080> for<00:04:25.410> devices<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.130> want<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.400> use<00:04:26.490> that

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
on the downside they're not really

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.090 
on the downside they're not really
suited<00:05:54.520> for<00:05:54.730> DJ<00:05:55.120> use<00:05:55.390> because<00:05:56.170> of<00:05:56.200> the<00:05:56.380> issues

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
suited for DJ use because of the issues

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.650 
suited for DJ use because of the issues
that<00:05:57.130> we<00:05:57.370> mentioned<00:05:57.850> earlier<00:05:58.330> in<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.540> video

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
that we mentioned earlier in the video

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.070 
that we mentioned earlier in the video
and<00:05:59.140> also<00:06:00.040> they<00:06:00.400> do<00:06:00.460> not<00:06:00.670> have<00:06:01.090> a<00:06:01.120> swivel<00:06:01.840> or<00:06:02.050> a

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
and also they do not have a swivel or a

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.260 
and also they do not have a swivel or a
foldable<00:06:02.530> style<00:06:02.830> design<00:06:03.190> so<00:06:03.460> they<00:06:03.640> can<00:06:03.850> get

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
foldable style design so they can get

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.300 
foldable style design so they can get
down<00:06:04.510> into<00:06:04.780> a<00:06:04.810> smaller<00:06:05.260> construction<00:06:05.950> so<00:06:06.160> that

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
down into a smaller construction so that

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.130 
down into a smaller construction so that
way<00:06:06.430> you<00:06:06.490> can<00:06:06.820> carry<00:06:07.330> them<00:06:07.540> which<00:06:07.780> you<00:06:07.900> want<00:06:08.050> to

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
way you can carry them which you want to

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.990 
way you can carry them which you want to
go<00:06:08.260> or<00:06:08.590> you<00:06:08.620> can<00:06:08.830> store<00:06:09.040> them<00:06:09.250> so<00:06:09.730> they're<00:06:09.880> not

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
go or you can store them so they're not

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.600 
go or you can store them so they're not
really<00:06:10.300> really<00:06:10.600> big<00:06:10.930> but<00:06:11.320> as<00:06:11.560> you<00:06:11.800> can<00:06:11.890> see<00:06:11.950> the

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
really really big but as you can see the

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.820 
really really big but as you can see the
actual<00:06:13.000> case<00:06:13.210> that<00:06:13.240> holds<00:06:13.600> them<00:06:13.930> is<00:06:14.110> somewhat

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
actual case that holds them is somewhat

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.980 
actual case that holds them is somewhat
on<00:06:14.980> the<00:06:15.130> big<00:06:15.340> side<00:06:15.640> so<00:06:15.970> they<00:06:16.510> don't<00:06:16.690> really<00:06:16.900> get

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
on the big side so they don't really get

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.330 
on the big side so they don't really get
smaller<00:06:17.380> than<00:06:17.590> that<00:06:17.770> so<00:06:17.920> when<00:06:18.040> you're<00:06:18.130> ready

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
smaller than that so when you're ready

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.100 
smaller than that so when you're ready
to<00:06:18.400> go<00:06:18.640> with<00:06:18.820> them<00:06:19.000> they<00:06:19.300> will<00:06:19.450> be<00:06:19.630> kind<00:06:19.780> of<00:06:19.900> big

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
to go with them they will be kind of big

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.630 
to go with them they will be kind of big
and<00:06:20.140> they<00:06:20.620> don't<00:06:20.800> fold<00:06:21.040> down<00:06:21.220> into<00:06:21.250> any

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
and they don't fold down into any

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.690 
and they don't fold down into any
compact<00:06:22.150> size<00:06:22.900> or<00:06:23.350> design<00:06:23.860> so<00:06:24.250> you<00:06:24.280> can<00:06:24.520> take

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
compact size or design so you can take

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.430 
compact size or design so you can take
them<00:06:24.880> with<00:06:24.910> you<00:06:25.180> on<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.360> go<00:06:25.390> rather<00:06:26.050> than<00:06:26.170> that

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
them with you on the go rather than that

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.740 
them with you on the go rather than that
