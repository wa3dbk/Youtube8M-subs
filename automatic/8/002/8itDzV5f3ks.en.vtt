00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
things I got lucky on the first one hit

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.730 
things I got lucky on the first one hit
by<00:03:37.700> pad<00:03:37.940> small<00:03:38.810> for<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.050> poke<00:03:39.200> check<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.650> then

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
by pad small for the poke check and then

that<00:03:43.850> he<00:03:43.910> was<00:03:44.030> going<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.210> try<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.690> eke<00:03:45.250> feel

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
that he was going to try and eke feel

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.940 
that he was going to try and eke feel
