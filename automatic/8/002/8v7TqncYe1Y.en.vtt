as<00:01:16.280> soon<00:01:16.520> as<00:01:16.640> I've<00:01:16.790> done<00:01:16.970> this<00:01:17.149> which<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.509> gonna

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
as soon as I've done this which is gonna

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.770 
as soon as I've done this which is gonna
be<00:01:17.960> rubbish<00:01:18.590> but<00:01:19.369> because<00:01:19.700> of<00:01:19.729> this<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:20.240> have<00:01:20.750> to

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
be rubbish but because of this I have to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.260 
be rubbish but because of this I have to
do<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.290> which<00:01:22.009> results<00:01:22.490> in<00:01:22.610> less<00:01:22.880> of<00:01:23.090> this

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
do this which results in less of this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.660 
do this which results in less of this
which<00:01:23.990> therefore<00:01:24.320> results<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.220> less<00:01:25.490> of

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
which therefore results in less of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.060 
which therefore results in less of
videos<00:01:26.060> which<00:01:26.420> will<00:01:26.659> suck<00:01:26.990> now<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:27.710> hasn't
