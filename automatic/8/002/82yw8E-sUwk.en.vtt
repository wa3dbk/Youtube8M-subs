00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.820
 no no 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.570
 69 km according to him 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.120
 this kills tx5 why 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.600
 what is the actual consumption 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.120
 this kills 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.770
 150 horsepower diesel traction 4 x 2 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.390
 I do not tell you we started because we have already 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.390
 ripped off so they accompanied me 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.890
 here we are in full test of consumption 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:42.960
 with the mata cx-5 we have 31 kilometers 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.969
 intense traffic as you can see the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.729
 Madrid exit note is a 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.069
 bridge and that the people well want 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.530
 take advantage of these days of vacation 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:56.310
 At the moment we have an average of 4 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.799
 fair liters of average consumption as 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.049
 go slowly kilometers covering the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.530
 little tip of gas to try not to consume 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.530
 too 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.800
 kilometer 40 and 84 and we're 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.080
 absolutely unemployed less badly than the i 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.940
 stop this mazda cx-5 well then 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.739
 at least at this time we are standing 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.989
 Well, it will not consume anything of all 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.239
 ways this is going to penalize a little 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.310
 our consumption then good to stop and 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.660
 always start something else 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.180
 consume that if we go at a speed 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.010
 constant in any case good then 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.349
 are the real conditions of this 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.349
 test and what has to be will be 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.120
 We are both making changes between 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.120
 1,500 and 2,000 grams 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.290
 3.9 on average right now and nothing 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.290
 Well, wanting to go ahead km 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.390
 as for the engine after telling you 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.750
 that this 2.2 demand with technology 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.480
 skyactiv is pretty good for everything 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.640
 driving time are 150 horses in 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.820
 this case the 4 x 2 traction that allows 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.110
 with alacrity and lightness to face 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.610
 any kind of overtaking in 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.510
 any time of a generation with 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.680
 this six-speed manual change 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.300
 that are also pretty good and good 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.740
 another of the peculiarities of this mate 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.570
 x5 what we 're doing in this 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.500
 Consumption test is its 4 x 2 traction 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.270
 that does not allow you to access sites that 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.190
 you need a pure all-rounder but its 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.600
 height to the ground and its excellent attraction 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.260
 for sure it will allow you to shoot 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.880
 by dirt and gravel tracks and zones 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.230
 bumpy that you could not possibly 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.920
 do with a car with a contact with 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.920
 a normal saloon 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.680
 yes 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.280
 when you want to go 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.510
 650 horsepower 4 x 2 engine 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.430
 and cruising speed 120 currently 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.960
 of 49 despite the art 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.950
 we have got 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.060
 half way like that 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.060
 it's an average of 49 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.420
 to refuel with him and to rest 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.420
 so 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.790
 the geology because they are the law of opening 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.790
 the arms 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.720
 a car quite comfortable either for 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.630
 travel well be to move in the 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.910
 city adaptation to the car is fast is 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.620
 easy is simple the seats are 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.650
 quite comfortable as you can see back 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.390
 there is room to spare for three adults 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.580
 in addition a trunk of 503 liters tea 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.170
 allows you to carry everything you want 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.060
 in any kind of weekend getaway 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.800
 week or trip and the truth is that in 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.570
 As for convenience and practicality this 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.050
 mazda cx-5 meets pretty well the 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.050
 expectations 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.340
 barely 200 kilometers to the end of 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.340
 our 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.160
 and of course direct 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.439
 m 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.439
 what the consumption figures 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:50.919
 here we are in the inda dealer 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.669
 magda center in Almeria after 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:57.630
 600 km on board this mazda cx-5 150 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:59.720
 Diesel horses 4 x 2 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.790
 the final figure of consumption has been 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.270
 5.3 liters per 100 from Madrid to 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:09.660
 until here until AlmerÃ­a we have made a 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.780
 little bit of road meat program 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.130
 of more 15 to 20 kilometers of savings to the 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.280
 departure from madrid there has been something of 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:20.040
 jam then on highway of 120 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.620
 kilometers per hour and up to here and 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.900
 we have said 600 fair kilometers or more 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.090
 nor less than 5.3 is the average consumption that 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.930
 has made this panda x5 thank you for being 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.930
 there is soon bye
