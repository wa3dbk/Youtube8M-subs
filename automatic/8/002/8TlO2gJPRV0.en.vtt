00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.420
 Halo has shown how to make a mini soup 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.000
 cooks to heat we receive that 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.490
 which is very hot already 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.289
 two onions in front 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.119
 the bowl can stay that is whole 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.509
 well after that the broth has to be brought 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:29.289
 color forwards the mentally arrange a 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.289
 little earth could hang in there like that 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:40.969
 just act like the onions 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.430
 bit of aluminum foil because the pan with it 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.989
 The pan does not burn as we do 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.390
 now let the onions opened 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.390
 the cut surfaces down 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.079
 So let the aluminum foil on the sun 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.579
 roast properly so that 's right 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.500
 black is the onion partly already 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.079
 soon springer keeps the nice color in 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.150
 the soup only as you know it 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.490
 that will probably take 45 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.760
 minutes and then it goes on with the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.760
 rest 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.750
 by we could do 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.760
 so in the meantime , ever 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.060
 big pot and fill that as well as here 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.400
 two thirds with water on cold 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.450
 mind , of course , with the soups 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:06.720
 Always with cold water on and 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:11.550
 ever throw 800 parts of a hand 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.940
 buy remnants from a cellphone and 800 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.430
 gram 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.130
 who like it cold water pure bones where 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.770
 partly still skin and and also meat 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.360
 but it should also hang only the 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.360
 taste then forgiven for this 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:36.240
 then comes in the pot still a bunch 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.970
 soup greens as uncommon as they usually are 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.480
 carrots leek celery and parsley 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.250
 consists 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.510
 You can buy the picture you can 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.820
 but also adjust 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.920
 to buy the vegetables and it seems in 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.810
 I think as small as possible 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.280
 little pieces and her smaller the pieces 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.420
 the better I think then came the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.420
 taste in the broth 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.980
 It is also important that you each 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.050
 It can be left to it and there is 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.160
 Everything tastes just good 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.850
 Clean it after using a brush or 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:16.610
 in the moment under water so only at 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:16.610
 ties are the clear before soup 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:31.200
 this time really yellow turnip the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.670
 In the meantime medicine is really on now 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.940
 already slightly black and now here 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.320
 However, soloist Amran prefers it 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.050
 not bad and the good 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.430
 taste in the soup then you drink 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.630
 smell of the pretty skits 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.660
 really great take this mallory 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:54.950
 help piece mainz audio small 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:04:00.989
 more fans in the beating races 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.640
 and the same is inside 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:08.700
 Peter Siebel I know 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.470
 purely cut looks so right that 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.220
 which have a nice black color 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.220
 below 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:19.169
 I throw that on the stage 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.310
 this is what the bowl is all about 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.620
 It is also important that you also the 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.060
 aluminum foil does not oil but are so 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:30.390
 the much beauty black that's us 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.850
 finish with the banner brave 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.960
 with the cold water and things 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.540
 inside the plate and do the 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.260
 plate again 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:55.140
 as a spice we throw five leaves 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:05:04.979
 laurel and ca 6 trackers and 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:09.060
 a few grains pepper are about 20 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:11.280
 grains small handful just always that 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.479
 I can boil it time now 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.910
 and about two hours approximately 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.290
 Let's leave it that way , too 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.450
 now after two hours you can already see 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.890
 how the pain is reduced to about 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:28.020
 We wish you a third degree 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:36.289
 still with about a tablespoon 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:48.180
 a teaspoon of sugar and two teaspoons 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:50.700
 circle tastes good again 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.070
 and it's always about the sugar 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.419
 at the end to give because you noticed on 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.060
 not start in that so much yet 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:02.180
 a reduced how much do you really know 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:10.460
 need to try the very good 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:10.460
 take tasty as a bowl 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:23.789
 soup by that sees the big ones 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.150
 pieces of the clear broth then outside 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.150
 stay 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:44.260
 and the clear vegetable stock is ready 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.290
 clear chicken stock can be the chicken stock 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.210
 then refine or can one 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.120
 make long noodles like dumplings 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.130
 or simply based vegetables very nice 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.130
 spicy taste
