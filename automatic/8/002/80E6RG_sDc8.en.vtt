 to ward off all memories 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.650
 3 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.650
 the sea the original mountain 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.660
 he 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.349
 14:00 firstly business 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.300
 considering that it comes back to the fact 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.020
 he is ahead of little disappointed 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.360
 Why

 therefore the death of the artist 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.590
 common sense 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.230
 the second round 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.590
 after 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.850
 one thing is sure 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 he completes his party 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.140
 it is therefore appropriate 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.040
 diallo that goes through there 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
 the event but good 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.030
 a mouse 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.590
 to benefit from this type 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
 to receive legislative projects 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.670
 relief 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 they come with your common sense 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.580
 destination 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.390
 at least partly 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.840
 there is in the var at this level 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.170
 several employees

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.670
 13 hours 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.140
 I realized by 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.080
 she then continued their ebb of her role 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.990
 with his counterpart 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.990
 secondly why did they do too much 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 they are strong 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.449
 many 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.289
 prosecuted by the police 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:18.429

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:25.669
 here we go 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.569
 the party 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.569
 you have to shake hands 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.119
 with the reserve 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.359
 while the winner 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.299

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.469
 a race 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.269

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.099
 in group 6 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.529

 Paris hopes to reduce 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.139
 moreover several parliamentary inquiries 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.319
