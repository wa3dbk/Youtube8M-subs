00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
so this is a demo of the JHS panther

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.269 
so this is a demo of the JHS panther
analog<00:00:14.580> delay<00:00:15.650> when<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.680> was<00:00:16.800> looking<00:00:17.039> at<00:00:17.130> this

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
analog delay when I was looking at this

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.540 
analog delay when I was looking at this
and<00:00:17.640> other<00:00:18.240> high-end<00:00:18.960> analog<00:00:19.410> delays<00:00:19.830> there

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
and other high-end analog delays there

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.220 
and other high-end analog delays there
weren't<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> whole<00:00:20.789> lot<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.240> great<00:00:22.080> examples

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
weren't a whole lot of great examples

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.960 
weren't a whole lot of great examples
out<00:00:22.800> there<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:25.369> recordings<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.609> pedal

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
out there of recordings of this pedal

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.390 
out there of recordings of this pedal
that<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> could<00:00:27.930> find<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.230> least<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:29.310> were

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
that I could find at least that were

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.450 
that I could find at least that were
done<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:30.769> with<00:00:31.769> anything<00:00:31.980> other<00:00:32.219> than<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
done with with anything other than a

demonstrate some of the abilities at

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.840 
demonstrate some of the abilities at
this<00:00:45.480> pedal<00:00:45.950> presuming<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.010> you're

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
this pedal presuming that you're

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.220 
this pedal presuming that you're
probably<00:00:48.059> familiar<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.840> different

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
probably familiar with the different

probably familiar with the different
settings<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.590> whatnot<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.100> other<00:00:50.250> videos

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
settings and whatnot from other videos

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.910 
settings and whatnot from other videos
as<00:00:51.539> well<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:51.840> from<00:00:51.960> reading<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> DHS<00:00:52.590> site

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
as well as from reading on the DHS site

for you to be able to hear some sound

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.340 
for you to be able to hear some sound
sample<00:01:00.329> those<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> various<00:01:00.989> settings<00:01:01.170> of

this<00:01:01.410> pedal

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
this pedal

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.429 
this pedal
I'm<00:01:02.730> running<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.359> Nash<00:01:04.519> strap<00:01:05.519> through<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
I'm running a Nash strap through a

I'm running a Nash strap through a
through<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> pedal<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.220> Victoria

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
through the pedal and then into Victoria

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.679 
through the pedal and then into Victoria
Victoria<00:01:09.330> looks<00:01:10.189> three<00:01:11.189> by<00:01:11.310> twelve<00:01:11.580> combo<00:01:12.000> the
