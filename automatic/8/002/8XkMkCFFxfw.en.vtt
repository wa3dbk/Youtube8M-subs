 since then I have gained fame and been getting 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.440
 known and not as a super bomb and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.600
 also for the United States because the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.879

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.920

 IMF tickets are free and soldiers

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.149
 This year's draft she's already won. 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.390
 previously the entry of the first 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.060
 draft round the pitch so good that 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.010

 judges of each of the 32 teams in 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.070
 theoretically entitled to a choice in 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.619
 each round 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.720
 the order is made from the worst team to the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.909
 best type is the worst team in the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.530
 last season is entitled to the first 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.210
 choose the draft that the super champion 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.909
 bock theoretically would be better than 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.310
 daniel he gets the last choice of 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.110
 draft example I already spoke with the caxias 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.850
 this year and last season 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.380
 was the worst team in nfl 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.119
 he will stick with the first choice of the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.060
 draft was the super bowl champion has the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.750
 thirty-second choice 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.930
 the best team of mine was correct and still 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:55.180
 happy and from the second round 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:58.180
 the right to food by NGOs and a good 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.180
 men 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.470
 from the second round of the draft to 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.959
 choice of order is made by campaign 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.910
 of the children and as the case and if 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.680
 tricked campaign into three types of 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.200
 the first is 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.480
 wins in the division division said that 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.670
 dawned tie will lead to victory in 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.160
 conference and silva appeared under the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.709
 global load music with the choice of your 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:31.220
 time the player can save his team can 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:33.049
 being can not participate in the draft 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.209
 any player who has left the 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.099
 three years and has at least one 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.470
 year of college and some residents 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.959
 can do the fighting some neighborhood 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.940
 wanel event very famous united states 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.709
 in the area your American where 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.410
 players stand out can show 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:55.190
 your physical and technical skills 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:56.870
 before the old plant works the 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.150
 exchange system in the choice of 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.859
 credit with little time can negotiate their 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.870
 position of the draft 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.660
 negotiation usually revolves around 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.400
 an agreement for the exchange of players or 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.200
 for you to change your order of choice 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.970
 because they can ensure that 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.040
 I will choose a specific player they 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.670
 want to have no rule in the exchange of 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.829
 choices 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.900
 the team can change their turn of choice 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.850
 independent of the round for example the 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.829
 Broncos are the third choice in 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.019
 third voted for exchange with the services 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.389
 for the second round second choice 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.840
 so the second round ready will have 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.510
 two choices in the third 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.550
 are the compensatory things compared to 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.530
 compensatory choices as the 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.690
 name right kid is to compensate for loss 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.280
 that the team had destinies that grasses and 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.290
 chose to compensate his team 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.420
 had player losses per 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.519
 retirement or players who have been 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.290
 hired by other children she nf 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.060
 you can choose the right of choice 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.010
 time as a form of punishment 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.069
 an example of this was in 2007 when 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.720
 Pedro was penalized to record the plays 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.330
 of the defensive team of their opponents 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.430
 this year the pt was left with no choice in 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.160
 first round the player to get it 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.319
 can deny contract he can but 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.940
 next, wants to be frowned upon in the league and 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.860
 will be forced to stay a year without 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.380
 play with any type of penalty called 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.209
 holdouts then what happens to the 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.799
 Players that are not dealt with in 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.079
 partners who are not 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.359
 adapted it has right to sign with 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.739
 any team that has an interest in 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.780
 to hardware 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.460
 when is it there that night? 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.620
 nor whether in the player contract 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.190
 now there are some curiosities from the west 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.600
 with a boy pinto romario 7 the pepper 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.870
 It's the college with more players. 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.300
 adapted since 2000 are 83 players 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.940
 This can make a whole game is faithful. 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.770
 and in the last 30 years a fact in the lap 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.370
 in the old port was chosen in the first 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.320
 round of the draft was the year 1996 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.210
 this year the first with tech was 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.430
 chosen in the forty-second round 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.160
 which is in the second the tragedy 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.440
 each choice which is the consensus to 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.620
 seventh this year the first 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.479
 chosen quarterback because the 42nd choice 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.810
 in the second round with son Tony Benn 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:07.400
 by hired by the saints 18 in 2014 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.190
 was only the second year and neither 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.250
 the chosen athlete was the athlete who 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.199
 had only occurred before the year 1970 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.000
 and made some players are well 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.580
 in the shopping cart idec is a 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.530
 hour anthony thomas hand but he 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.120
 was drafted by kansas city as 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.100
 returer does not like a big thump 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.660
 because it 's interesting from the draft that neither 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.479
 always the player chosen in the first 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.850
 round is really right is faithful and that 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.100
 many players until they are chosen 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.100
 in seventh and sixth round of a star 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.520
 in the case tom brady new fit quarterback 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.820
 It was the choice number 199 of the sixth round 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.139
 2011 draft is the best is also one of the 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.199
 best quarterbacks in the history of

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.580
 quarterback went to because neymar

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:01.010
