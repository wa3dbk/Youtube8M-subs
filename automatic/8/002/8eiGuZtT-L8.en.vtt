00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.629
 well arrived at new door 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.660
 we are in milan close to the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.450
 Spanish historical bastions in particular 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.299
 right in the newportan neighborhood object 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.170
 of a large redevelopment and a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.960
 project that has been underway for ten years 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.720
 years we are in an area 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.910
 absolutely comfortable to reach with 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.880
 public transport in particular with three 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.579
 underground lines n2 with the stop 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.610
 by garibaldi fs m5 colleague viola 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.739
 garibaldi fx and the m3 with the stop of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.070
 republic as well as various tram lines 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.820
 like one 5 and 9 33 and others 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.160
 city ​​buses the ways they include 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.980
 they are avenue liberation via melchiorre 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.039
 joy of furnishing luigi sturzo corso como 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.500
 in piazza san gioachimo currently there 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.199
 we find in this part that it is that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.609
 we say that a bit of varesine and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.680
 name of the Varese area depends 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.900
 substantially 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.730
 by the fact that you once have here 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.310
 imagine there was a station 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.530
 railway that was simply the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.640
 truncation of the railway station 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.260
 of Milan 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.290
 the power plant that was in piazza della 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.820
 public was set back in piazza san 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.890
 Gioacchino with the so-called stations 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.780
 of Varese just because they were the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.540
 trains to Varese 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.460
 when it was then abandoned 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 subsequently this port backing out 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.970
 further creating the station 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 by garibaldi in the early years 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.509
 sixty the object of the station 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.090
 in short it was later then 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.460
 thought several times final to the total 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.720
 disposal and disposal with the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.840
 demolition of all this 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.720
 infrastructure because it was based a lot 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.880
 on the regulatory plan of 1953 which 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.979
 provided for the so-called equipped plans 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.500
 and the elimination of this airport 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.630
 railway needed according to the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.729
 project to create the new center 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.800
 directional of Milan to empty the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.360
 center of milan since the invasion of the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.250
 offices and the tertiary sector 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.260
 unfortunately this project did not have 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.269
 practically followed except for some 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.580
 sporadic intervention and for many years 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.730
 these remained absolutely a land 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.830
 empty and in particular in the area where 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.100
 we are now there was the so-called moon 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.840
 Varese park only in 2004 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.299
 the municipal administration has decided to 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.160
 start work creating what 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.830
 now you see behind me 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.930
 we are in this part where I am 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.630
 several architects intervened in 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.430
 particular cesar skins with skins 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.830
 architects for the part we say more 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.310
 towards the garibaldi station then pedersen 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.950
 fox associated with the most arcade m2p 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.620
 associated cino zucchi and architectural 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.769
 understood partnership to create all 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.360
 these sets of directional centers 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.370
 in fact all together with the houses 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.160
 the buildings he now sees for example 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.200
 via manthoné diamantini behind me is 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.319
 here I'm 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.330
 also the solar tower which is the building 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.030
 highest residential in Italy we speak 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.790
 of 37 floors a height of 143 meters 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.190
 together with airs alone even on the two 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.410
 smaller towers next to them stand out 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.480
 later also other buildings in 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.920
 particular the unicredit tower of which one is 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.220
 can see behind me 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.450
 the bolt we say that only that is 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.239
 85 meters high 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.760
 taking into account that altogether 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.650
 the building is 231 meters high and is spitting out 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.459
 therefore the tallest building in Italy 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.260
 the structure we say of these 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.700
 buildings especially those dedicated to 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.690
 offices are in reinforced concrete with 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.370
 the closure of chalmin steel and glass 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.410
 very shiny very clean in such a way 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.549
 to give a sense of modernity e 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.280
 also somehow appear one 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.920
 detachment from the consolidated fabric 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.260
 that can be found here in the neighborhood 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.500
 also the houses that are here in the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.959
 to my right for example they are all 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.600
 the parts of new port villas are 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.930
 create just to a lesser extent and more 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.340
 small with finishing touches 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.000
 dedicate a house so this already 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.079
 garments we understand the intended use 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.359
 so far as the view is concerned 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.789
 we can define an environment that has 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.039
 different types of materials 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.020
 based on intended use and also 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.300
 with light, sunlight or light 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.810
 artificial that comes from these 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.669
 a real atmosphere is created 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.459
 unique because by day it is a celella 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.649
 the reflection of sunlight while 

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:41.199
 in the evening you can very well see the 

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:42.189
 light of this buildings to be reflected towards 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.050
 the outside 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.479
 as far as hearing is concerned, this is one 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.159
 of the small islands we say species in 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.499
 this green part or even in the part 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.569
 behind why three squares are created la 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:54.459
 piazza lina bo bardi at piazza alvar 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.830
 aalto and the hunting gae aulenti then 

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:59.679
 also three large dedicated squares 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.169
 architectural characters you go to 

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:04.149
 create a small island where even the 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.349
 there is traffic noise but it is 

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:09.909
 very far away and also in the square that it is 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.800
 nice to hear even the sound of water 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.589
 since they are tanks with 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.079
 of water just a few centimeters 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:20.079
 as for touch maybe 

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:23.169
 some buildings can be appreciated for 

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:25.899
 hand different types from marble to 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.229
 steel and cement glass and so 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:29.199
 Street 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:31.809
 and if instead a path can hear 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.719
 different sensations that both stone and 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:36.369
 both the grit and the grass e 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.990
 this is very nice especially in one 

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:40.899
 city ​​like milan where it is appreciated 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.589
 so close to the grass and see it that way 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:44.050
 close 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:46.319
 regarding also taste and 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.729
 smell then we taste we can 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.919
 appreciate some places that are 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.389
 more developed reason they were already 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.819
 present for example in the part of 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.740
 course como but also on its own part 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.419
 of piazza gaudenti and so on it is 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.229
 just opened a new philosophy 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.360
 commercial new spirit of use of a 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.209
 then looking for new milan center 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.729
 to break away from piazza del duomo e 

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:13.869
 also the sense of smell is combined with this 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.800
 area is closely linked to the premises 

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:17.800
 but also because of being able to 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.929
 walk through all this green 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.800
 these plants also with the grass 

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:25.990
 because those who do not like to smell 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.810
 the freshly cut grass and feel them in 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.030
 a city like milan especially in one 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.879
 area so central because we are own 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.349
 behind the historic bastions of those 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:38.080
 of the ring road of the walls 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:41.139
 Spanish and absolutely amazing 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.419
 besides having filled a big gap 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.030
 that was inside the city of 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.430
 milano and therefore allowed the union 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.789
 among a more historical part is a part 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:56.069
 more modern that lacked well ends here 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:56.069
 the story of this corner of Milan
