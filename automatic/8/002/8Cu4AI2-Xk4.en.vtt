00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.830
 hi friends subscribers and new 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.020
 visitors in this video we are going to 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.050
 learn what recovery is for 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.300
 and how to use it 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.520
 to begin with I will mention that if not yet 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.040
 you have rooney recovery you watch the video 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.500
 how do I leave a link here and 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.730
 also in the description of the video well 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.730
 that we begin without more 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.080
 good recovery is a small system 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.480
 operative saved in a partition 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.309
 independent of our phone said 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.600
 partition is started by the manager 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.760
 boot and it offers us a great 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.970
 functionality like computing the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.550
 micro sd backups install the roms 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.559
 many updates leave the mobile 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.159
 with the defect values ​​among others 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.980
 more things 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:49.610
 I will teach you the basics and what more 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.610
 it is used 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.760
 well the first thing we will do is 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.390
 enter recovery and restarting 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.390
 our mobile 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.720
 here it is important that as soon as it leaves 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.280
 then that we do not press the key anymore 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.090
 volume or less volume both serve 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.090
 we press repeatedly 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.950
 well it's not that we have entered recovery 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.310
 we see eight sections install wine mac 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.320
 app store and so on those that are most 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.900
 they use are the first four and the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.540
 last so let's start with the first 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.220
 section that is installed for example 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.740
 when they tell us that we appreciate a 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.990
 flash file and I speak for recovery without 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.820
 waves we are going to install and 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.630
 we select the location where the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.250
 we download in the top part we 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.470
 indicates 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.130
 the internal memory the external memory or 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.510
 if we are using a usb or tg 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.090
 I had a phrase file speak in the 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.640
 external so I place it selected it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.659
 and how it installs without whites just 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.659
 slipped this bar 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.960
 and that's how a file was installed 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.820
 flexible that will always be in format 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.230
 zip or recovery 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.869
 anything that is installed by 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.840
 recovery is done from there in in store 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.330
 now we go to the wave section 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.610
 never give in forming data because this 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.110
 they will do a factory reset 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.170
 we always go in the first 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.690
 option in this list we will leave the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.610
 white available at this point I have 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.590
 to mention that everything you install 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.319
 by recovery he has his instructions and 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.720
 must follow it to the letter by 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.959
 example if they tell me install this without 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.200
 I'm just going to install waves and if you tell me 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.540
 as waves I do them before or after 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.120
 installing the flexible file depends on 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.209
 the instructions that leave us so 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.250
 I will explain the wolves one by one the 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.480
 Skillful first cool pérez clean cache 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.400
 the cache of our virtual machine 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.890
 Android dabill which serves to 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.980
 launch our apps the second 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.230
 wipe this system this format the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.840
 system partition the third wipe is 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.210
 cache that format the cache pressure the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.390
 fourth wipe will make a factory reset 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.920
 then comes the internal storage that 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.750
 format our internal memory and 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.490
 external decade 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.070
 that will also format our 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.510
 external memory the last one is only it 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.189
 uses a bait of people 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.920
 that also forma forma si 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.470
 they mark the option for example when we 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.349
 they say that we install something but before 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.040
 demos full wipes full wise is not to mark 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.430
 all not full white are just dabill cache 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.290
 cache and data so do not forget 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.880
 this is classic when they are told full 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.370
 white you already know what to mark 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.870
 although I also repeat again that this 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.820
 It depends on the instructions always 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.520
 follow the instructions given to you and 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.690
 when you already know that wise dialing slip 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.110
 the bar this way to fly 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.540
 remember to follow instructions because 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.720
 guayos can go before or after 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.660
 install file saber file 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.250
 now we go to the backup section what 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.510
 what is going to do this is to support everything 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.270
 our system with all our 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.760
 Installed applications configurations 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.709
 etcetera is what it would be like in 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.709
 windows a copy of the system image 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.060
 and we move nothing I suggest that what 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.370
 leave as is 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.490
 and again below we get a picture 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.830
 starace and there we choose where to save it 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.260
 I suggest saving the external memory 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.540
 because this weighs a lot depending on 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.290
 the applications you have will weigh between 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.419
 3 to 6 gigabytes and you also know that 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.010
 for example if by bird they have to 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.110
 offer your experience is going to format 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.240
 the external memory and then they would lose 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.970
 the backup they made so it's better 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.009
 save the external memory that will not happen 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.050
 nothing even if we were our mobile 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.719
 after choosing where to save it they give 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.900
 ok and just slide the bar is 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:04.939
 wipe and wait for the backup to be done 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.639
 that depending on the size you have 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:09.499
 will delay further the next section of the 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.089
 rest and as its name says 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:13.189
 will allow you to restore the backup that 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.779
 we made the backup is saved 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:17.029
 automatically so do not worry 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:20.139
 for example here I have a backup 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.139
 ready to restore 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.989
 I would simply slide the bar and 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.639
 would restore everything here they also choose 

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:30.579
 where they saved the backup without the memory 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.550
 internal or external or if they have a 

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:35.340
 You see knitting 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.100
 and the last section that I'm going to 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.980
 teaching is reboot when we give in 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.530
 reboot system we will go out of recovery and 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.050
 will start our phone normally if it 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.410
 we give in power off which is the following 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.170
 option will turn off the device and if you 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.050
 das in robot recovery the phone is 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.300
 will turn off and re-enter recovery 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.060
 the last option is not important as well 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.529
 that will broadcast it and now I'm going to teach you 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.260
 how to zip a zip 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:08.690
 to recover and for example I have 1 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.030
 that I had saved in external memory 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.300
 so I just place it and how I 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.520
 they indicated that it is without webs I do not wave 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.370
 I locate it and simply slid the bar 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.450
 I hope you do the process I'm going home 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.450
 and above 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.000
 this is elementary as I return it to 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.100
 repeat after doing flashing 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.060
 something 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.710
 by recovery always under robot guidance 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.450
 insist to get out of recovery and so 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.910
 our mobile will start normally 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.710
 although I repeat it again if I 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.080
 they indicate that after explaining something 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.070
 should do waves do it before giving 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.070
 the reboot systems 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.940
 and now we just wait for him to turn on 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.940
 our mobile 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.910
 we see that it has already started and this would be all 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.470
 friends a little tutorial on how to use 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.930
 recovery 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.760
 in a next video I will do a tutorial more 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.770
 visual how to restore a backup 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.050
 so do not forget to comment if it is that 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.610
 you have any doubt to give to the like and if 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.830
 you are a new visitor why not
