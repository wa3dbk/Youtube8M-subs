separate pieces as you guys can see

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.950 
separate pieces as you guys can see
while<00:01:14.640> i'm<00:01:14.670> installing<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.509> it's

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
while i'm installing it here it's

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
while i'm installing it here it's
actually<00:01:16.290> really<00:01:16.500> simple<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.189> total

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
actually really simple the total

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.219 
actually really simple the total
installation<00:01:18.390> process<00:01:18.570> should<00:01:18.960> take<00:01:18.990> about

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
installation process should take about

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.649 
installation process should take about
five<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.740> ten<00:01:20.070> minutes<00:01:20.100> I'm<00:01:21.090> actually<00:01:21.360> not

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
five to ten minutes I'm actually not

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.530 
five to ten minutes I'm actually not
that<00:01:21.930> great<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.799> an<00:01:23.490> installer<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> comes

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that great of an installer when it comes

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.600 
that great of an installer when it comes
to<00:01:24.750> screen<00:01:25.170> shields<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.460> actually

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
to screen shields but I think I actually

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.580 
to screen shields but I think I actually
did<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> fairly<00:01:27.270> decent<00:01:27.420> job<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.409> it

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
did a fairly decent job with this one it

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
did a fairly decent job with this one it
actually<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> lot<00:01:29.549> simpler<00:01:29.909> than

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
actually was a lot simpler than

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.899 
actually was a lot simpler than
installing<00:01:31.170> standard<00:01:31.650> screen<00:01:31.920> shields<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.400> am

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
installing standard screen shields I am

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.810 
installing standard screen shields I am
not<00:01:33.060> sure<00:01:33.270> why<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.259> bubbles<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.130> doesn't<00:01:35.520> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
not sure why the bubbles it doesn't it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
not sure why the bubbles it doesn't it
doesn't<00:01:35.880> bubble<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.540> easily<00:01:36.780> as<00:01:37.049> most<00:01:37.290> screen

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
doesn't bubble as easily as most screen

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.190 
doesn't bubble as easily as most screen
shields<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> noob<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
shields do so you can be a noob and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.660 
shields do so you can be a noob and
install<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.979> easily<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.280> don't<00:01:41.520> have

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
install it really easily and don't have

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.179 
install it really easily and don't have
to<00:01:41.759> worry<00:01:41.880> about<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.210> bubbling<00:01:42.979> now<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
to worry about it bubbling now with the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.679 
to worry about it bubbling now with the
iphone<00:01:44.490> 4<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.880> actually<00:01:45.180> receive<00:01:45.479> these

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
iphone 4 you actually receive these

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.260 
iphone 4 you actually receive these
sides<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.259> well<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.579> will<00:01:47.790> solve<00:01:48.090> your

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
sides as well so it will solve your

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.760 
sides as well so it will solve your
antennagate<00:01:48.869> issue<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.350> don't<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
antennagate issue you don't have to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.950 
antennagate issue you don't have to
worry<00:01:49.950> about<00:01:50.070> losing<00:01:50.939> signal<00:01:51.329> because<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
worry about losing signal because the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.530 
worry about losing signal because the
