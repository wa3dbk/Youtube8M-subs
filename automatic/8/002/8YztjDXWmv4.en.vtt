00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
this video will focus on a few ways that

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.619 
this video will focus on a few ways that
we<00:00:04.110> can<00:00:04.230> take<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> common<00:00:04.850> dry<00:00:05.850> erase<00:00:06.089> marker

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
we can take a common dry erase marker

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.850 
we can take a common dry erase marker
and<00:00:07.700> modify<00:00:08.700> it<00:00:08.870> so<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:09.900> it's<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.440> little<00:00:10.710> bit

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
and modify it so that it's a little bit

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.259 
and modify it so that it's a little bit
more<00:00:11.160> user<00:00:11.550> friendly

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
more user friendly

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.349

to<00:00:18.449> be<00:00:18.570> especially<00:00:19.260> convenient<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:20.160> I'll

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
to be especially convenient but I'll

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.950 
to be especially convenient but I'll
also<00:00:20.430> show<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.850> how<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.090> can<00:00:21.270> make<00:00:21.449> one<00:00:21.480> that

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
also show you how you can make one that

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.340 
also show you how you can make one that
works<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.410> any<00:00:22.650> dry<00:00:22.980> erase<00:00:23.250> board<00:00:24.140> first<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
works on any dry erase board first a

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.710 
works on any dry erase board first a
quick<00:00:25.680> note<00:00:25.949> about<00:00:25.980> dry<00:00:26.400> erase<00:00:26.640> boards<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
quick note about dry erase boards the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.390 
quick note about dry erase boards the
best<00:00:28.019> ones<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.500> made<00:00:28.680> from<00:00:28.949> tempered<00:00:29.160> glass

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
best ones are made from tempered glass

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.479 
best ones are made from tempered glass
and<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.449> made<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:30.960> using<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.009> scrap<00:00:32.279> piece

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and I made this one using a scrap piece

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.000 
and I made this one using a scrap piece
of<00:00:32.669> tempered<00:00:32.850> glass<00:00:33.380> which<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.620> spray-painted

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
of tempered glass which I spray-painted

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.139 
of tempered glass which I spray-painted
white<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:37.129> use<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.160> spray<00:00:38.550> adhesive

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
white and then I use it spray adhesive

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.619 
white and then I use it spray adhesive
to<00:00:39.410> fix<00:00:40.410> some<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.739> these<00:00:40.950> flexi<00:00:41.550> magnets<00:00:42.030> to

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
to fix some of these flexi magnets to

also<00:01:09.869> work<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.580> case<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.729> can't<00:01:11.970> do

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
also work in case you can't do

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.310 
also work in case you can't do
conversions<00:01:12.979> that's<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:15.140> 28<00:01:17.240> centimeters

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.450 
the PVC pipe PVC is pretty easy to cut
my<00:01:31.049> favorite<00:01:31.470> way<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.310> use<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
my favorite way to do it is to use a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.330 
my favorite way to do it is to use a
miter<00:01:32.729> saw<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> backer<00:01:34.020> board<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:34.860> sure<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
miter saw with a backer board be sure to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.190 
miter saw with a backer board be sure to
use<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> backer<00:01:35.759> board<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.630> keep<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> piece

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
use a backer board to keep the piece

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.310 
use a backer board to keep the piece
from<00:01:37.409> getting<00:01:37.680> sucked<00:01:37.979> into<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.430> blade<00:01:39.320> but

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
from getting sucked into the blade but

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.840 
from getting sucked into the blade but
if<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.619> don't<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> those<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.820> can

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
if you don't have one of those you can

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.219 
if you don't have one of those you can
also<00:01:42.390> use<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:44.030> handsaw<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:46.399> hacksaw<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:48.229> coping

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
also use a handsaw a hacksaw a coping

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.789 
also use a handsaw a hacksaw a coping
saw<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:50.250> believe<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:51.329> not<00:01:51.479> even<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:52.619> piece<00:01:52.770> of

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
saw or believe it or not even a piece of

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:13.170 
saw or believe it or not even a piece of
string

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.699 

this<00:02:14.180> method<00:02:14.629> will<00:02:14.810> take<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:15.140> little<00:02:15.500> bit<00:02:15.650> of

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
this method will take a little bit of

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.050 
this method will take a little bit of
sanding<00:02:16.160> though<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:18.519> probably<00:02:19.519> should<00:02:20.030> have

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
sanding though I probably should have

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.970 
sanding though I probably should have
mentioned<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:21.200> would<00:02:21.379> be<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.500> good<00:02:21.709> idea

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
mentioned that it would be a good idea

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.740 
mentioned that it would be a good idea
to<00:02:22.190> make<00:02:22.459> our<00:02:22.700> little<00:02:22.940> flat<00:02:23.120> spot<00:02:23.330> for<00:02:23.660> our

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
to make our little flat spot for our

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.630 
to make our little flat spot for our
magnet<00:02:24.459> before<00:02:25.459> we<00:02:25.700> cut<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.120> length<00:02:26.349> if<00:02:27.640> you

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
magnet before we cut it to length if you

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.490 
magnet before we cut it to length if you
don't<00:02:28.970> have<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.120> drill<00:02:29.269> press<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:30.319> do<00:02:30.410> it

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
don't have a drill press you can do it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.770 
don't have a drill press you can do it
the<00:02:30.560> old-fashioned<00:02:31.129> way<00:02:31.160> or<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:32.540> could

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
the old-fashioned way or you could

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:45.000 
the old-fashioned way or you could
probably<00:02:32.900> use<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.319> dremel<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.799> suppose

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.740 

the<00:02:46.010> next<00:02:46.310> step<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.790> cut<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.000> vinyl<00:02:47.420> tubing

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
the next step is to cut the vinyl tubing

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
stuff and let your glue cool down just a

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.180 
stuff and let your glue cool down just a
little<00:04:44.979> bit<00:04:45.750> so<00:04:46.750> as<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:47.020> not<00:04:47.259> melt<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:48.009> dry

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
little bit so as to not melt the dry

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.029 
little bit so as to not melt the dry
erase<00:04:48.370> board<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.870> will<00:04:52.990> still<00:04:53.259> stick<00:04:53.590> even<00:04:53.800> if

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
erase board it will still stick even if

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.529 
erase board it will still stick even if
it's<00:04:54.190> not<00:04:55.380> scalding<00:04:56.380> hot<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:57.389> that<00:04:58.389> is

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
it's not scalding hot and that is

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.689 
it's not scalding hot and that is
exactly<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:59.289> method<00:04:59.590> that<00:04:59.710> I<00:04:59.770> used<00:05:00.070> here<00:05:00.190> on

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
exactly the method that I used here on

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.629 
exactly the method that I used here on
this<00:05:01.060> cabinet<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:03.280> can<00:05:03.460> see<00:05:03.699> that<00:05:05.280> non<00:05:06.280> glass

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
this cabinet you can see that non glass

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.129 
this cabinet you can see that non glass
dry<00:05:06.940> erase<00:05:07.210> board<00:05:07.570> is<00:05:07.750> garbage<00:05:08.470> and<00:05:10.080> how<00:05:11.080> does

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
dry erase board is garbage and how does

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:23.060 
dry erase board is garbage and how does
this<00:05:11.440> method<00:05:11.680> hold<00:05:12.010> up<00:05:12.840> well<00:05:13.840> enough

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.180 

remember<00:05:23.880> how<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.030> glued<00:05:24.360> this<00:05:24.540> earlier<00:05:25.160> now<00:05:26.160> I

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
remember how I glued this earlier now I

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:36.760 
remember how I glued this earlier now I
want<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.580> cut<00:05:26.760> it<00:05:26.790> to<00:05:27.000> about<00:05:27.270> 3/4<00:05:28.200> of<00:05:28.260> an<00:05:28.470> inch

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:57.490 

close<00:05:37.770> enough

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.410 

you<00:05:58.070> can<00:05:58.220> still<00:05:58.430> make<00:05:58.580> out<00:05:58.700> the<00:05:58.760> shape<00:05:59.090> of<00:05:59.270> the

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
you can still make out the shape of the

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.260 
you can still make out the shape of the
dime<00:05:59.600> surprisingly<00:06:00.320> well<00:06:00.640> what<00:06:01.640> I've<00:06:01.760> done<00:06:01.970> is

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
dime surprisingly well what I've done is

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.270 
dime surprisingly well what I've done is
made<00:06:02.570> a<00:06:02.600> little<00:06:02.870> mold<00:06:03.110> using<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.710> foil<00:06:03.980> in<00:06:04.160> the

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
made a little mold using the foil in the

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.610 
made a little mold using the foil in the
dime<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:07.310> now<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:07.670> important<00:06:08.210> part<00:06:08.360> is<00:06:09.320> to

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
dime and now the important part is to

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:20.740 
dime and now the important part is to
get<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:09.950> glue<00:06:11.200> on<00:06:12.200> the<00:06:12.470> sides<00:06:19.450> and<00:06:20.450> I'm

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
get the glue on the sides and I'm

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:42.620 
get the glue on the sides and I'm
cutting<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.230> bottom<00:06:21.530> as<00:06:21.680> well

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.990 

well<00:06:43.320> sometimes<00:06:44.190> you<00:06:44.370> can<00:06:44.400> get<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:44.700> foil<00:06:44.940> to

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
well sometimes you can get the foil to

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.730 
well sometimes you can get the foil to
come<00:06:45.240> out<00:06:45.390> and<00:06:45.660> sometimes<00:06:46.020> you<00:06:46.500> can<00:06:46.830> not<00:06:47.270> but

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
come out and sometimes you can not but

00:06:48.740 --> 00:07:05.140 
come out and sometimes you can not but
ultimately<00:06:49.740> it<00:06:50.190> matters<00:06:50.670> very<00:06:50.760> little

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.210 

you
