00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.139 
with a darker foliage you grow this one
more<00:01:57.739> for<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.950> foliage<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.489> also<00:01:58.939> for<00:01:59.090> the

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
more for the foliage and also for the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.880 
more for the foliage and also for the
flowers<00:01:59.539> as<00:01:59.689> well<00:01:59.719> but<00:02:00.469> there's<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.679> good

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
flowers as well but there's a good

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.550 
flowers as well but there's a good
contrast<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.780> over<00:02:02.780> here<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:05.319> want<00:02:06.319> to<00:02:06.379> get<00:02:06.530> a

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
contrast and over here I want to get a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.680 
contrast and over here I want to get a
video<00:02:06.739> this<00:02:07.069> later<00:02:07.250> in<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:07.429> year<00:02:07.729> but<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.629> is

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
video this later in the year but this is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.190 
video this later in the year but this is
a<00:02:08.989> vitex<00:02:09.579> vitex<00:02:10.579> agnus<00:02:11.269> castus<00:02:11.299> and<00:02:11.989> i<00:02:12.019> might

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
a vitex vitex agnus castus and i might

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.080 
a vitex vitex agnus castus and i might
be<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.349> little<00:02:12.379> bit<00:02:12.620> off<00:02:12.769> but<00:02:13.069> this<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.849> called

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
be a little bit off but this is called

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.430 
be a little bit off but this is called
the<00:02:14.209> chest<00:02:14.540> tree<00:02:15.079> and<00:02:15.379> this<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.489> it's<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:17.440> shrub

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
the chest tree and this is it's a shrub

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.069 
the chest tree and this is it's a shrub
but<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:19.489> going<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.700> grow<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:19.910> be<00:02:20.239> you<00:02:20.930> know

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
but it's going to grow to be you know

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.809 
but it's going to grow to be you know
about<00:02:21.410> eight<00:02:21.620> feet<00:02:21.920> tall<00:02:22.220> by<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.519> end<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
about eight feet tall by the end of the

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.879 
about eight feet tall by the end of the
summer<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.569> have<00:02:23.870> these<00:02:23.989> really<00:02:24.319> fragrant

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:24.889 
summer and have these really fragrant

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.819 
summer and have these really fragrant
leaves<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:26.269> nice<00:02:26.420> purple<00:02:26.989> flower<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.739> as

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
leaves and a nice purple flower to it as

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.949 
leaves and a nice purple flower to it as
well<00:02:28.010> but<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.850> basically<00:02:29.030> dies<00:02:29.480> back<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
well but it basically dies back to the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.390 
well but it basically dies back to the
ground<00:02:30.170> every<00:02:30.350> year<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.769> it's<00:02:30.859> fairly<00:02:31.220> late

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
ground every year and it's fairly late

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.229 
ground every year and it's fairly late
to<00:02:31.549> emerge<00:02:31.819> as<00:02:32.030> well<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.790> then<00:02:34.790> there's<00:02:35.000> some

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
to emerge as well and then there's some

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.160 
to emerge as well and then there's some
nice<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:37.310> know<00:02:37.400> some<00:02:37.670> nice<00:02:37.849> pansies<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
nice you know some nice pansies in the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.770 
nice you know some nice pansies in the
the<00:02:39.530> pot<00:02:39.739> there<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.280> we<00:02:41.090> just<00:02:41.120> put<00:02:41.420> them<00:02:41.569> on<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
the pot there we we just put them on the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.490 
the pot there we we just put them on the
bird<00:02:41.959> feeder<00:02:42.230> hook

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.949 

and<00:02:44.740> then<00:02:44.950> there's<00:02:45.190> a

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
and then there's a

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.199 
and then there's a
there's<00:02:47.560> some<00:02:47.769> more<00:02:47.920> hanging<00:02:48.310> baskets<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.060> we

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
had the rain a couple days ago so our

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.449 
had the rain a couple days ago so our
gutters<00:02:52.090> drip<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.629> I<00:02:52.659> just<00:02:52.959> put<00:02:53.170> them<00:02:53.459> right

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
gutters drip so I just put them right

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.910 
gutters drip so I just put them right
beneath<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.909> gutters<00:02:55.239> there<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:56.439> catch<00:02:56.680> some

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
beneath the gutters there to catch some

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.860 
beneath the gutters there to catch some
of<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.129> water<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:01.120> we'll<00:03:01.269> move<00:03:01.360> across<00:03:01.720> the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
of that water so we'll move across the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.089 
of that water so we'll move across the
front<00:03:02.079> of<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.230> house<00:03:02.379> and<00:03:02.650> I've<00:03:02.739> got<00:03:02.769> some

able to see the main stem I mean it

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.420 
able to see the main stem I mean it
grows<00:03:26.859> that<00:03:27.129> quickly<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:31.120> then<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:31.780> here

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
grows that quickly and then this here

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.830 
grows that quickly and then this here
what<00:03:33.430> we're<00:03:33.579> looking<00:03:33.849> at<00:03:33.970> there<00:03:34.299> is<00:03:34.329> a<00:03:34.540> Marie

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
what we're looking at there is a Marie

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.069 
what we're looking at there is a Marie

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
I'm really a big fan of selective

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.879 
I'm really a big fan of selective
pruning<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:48.410> boxwood<00:05:49.410> the<00:05:49.500> nice<00:05:49.650> thing<00:05:49.860> about

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
pruning and boxwood the nice thing about

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.999 
pruning and boxwood the nice thing about
it<00:05:50.250> is<00:05:50.370> I've<00:05:50.819> selectively<00:05:51.330> proved<00:05:51.660> it<00:05:51.840> but<00:05:52.590> you

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
it is I've selectively proved it but you

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.040 
it is I've selectively proved it but you
know<00:05:53.130> after<00:05:53.370> two<00:05:53.699> or<00:05:53.849> three<00:05:53.880> years<00:05:54.300> of<00:05:54.509> no

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
know after two or three years of no

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.960 
know after two or three years of no
pruning<00:05:55.349> I<00:05:55.620> think<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:55.919> still<00:05:56.160> looks<00:05:56.370> very

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
pruning I think it still looks very

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.010 
pruning I think it still looks very
pleasing<00:05:57.479> and<00:05:58.789> then<00:05:59.789> here's<00:06:00.090> Lenten<00:06:00.509> rose<00:06:00.660> I
