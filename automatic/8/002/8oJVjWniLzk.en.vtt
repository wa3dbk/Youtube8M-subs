00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.099
 Through history 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.051
 silver has been used as money 

00:00:02.051 --> 00:00:04.068
 for more time and in more places than gold. 

00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:05.094
 To function as money, 

00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:08.044
 A monetary item must have certain characteristics: 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.084
 1. It must be a means of exchange, 

00:00:10.097 --> 00:00:13.071
 It must have liquidity and be easily redeemable. 

00:00:13.074 --> 00:00:16.041
 It must be easily transportable (precious metals 

00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:18.044
 have a high value-to-weight ratio) 

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:19.061
 And it must be durable. 

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:20.079
 2. To be a unit of measure: 

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:24.021
 it must be divisible into smaller units without destroying its value. 

00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:26.061
 Precious metals can be coined from ingots 

00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:29.086
 or melt into bars again, with low cost. 

00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:31.067
 It must be fungible, that is, 

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:34.055
 one unit or piece is equivalent to another unit, 

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:36.062
 reason why diamonds, works of art 

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:38.037
 or real estate is not suitable as money. 

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:41.041
 Must have a specific weight, or size or size 

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.018
 Verifiably reliable. 

00:00:43.018 --> 00:00:45.078
 The third characteristic is that it must be a store of value. 

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.015
 It must be durable in the long term and not perishable 

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.063
 or subject to deterioration. 

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:52.044
 It must have a stable value. 

00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:54.073
 It must be hard to fake and the genuine 

00:00:54.073 --> 00:00:56.038
 easily recognizable 

00:00:56.038 --> 00:00:58.042
 Currently silver is not used as money 

00:00:58.042 --> 00:00:59.084
 because it does not circulate. 

00:00:59.084 --> 00:01:02.084
 But it does provide a crucial role as a store of value. 

00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:04.084
 Why do gold and silver have value? 

00:01:04.091 --> 00:01:06.090
 "Why is gold sold at $ 20 an ounce?" 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.057
 "I do not know, because it's scarce." 

00:01:08.057 --> 00:01:10.065
 "A thousand men go out to look for gold. 

00:01:10.065 --> 00:01:12.005
 After six months one is lucky. 

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.043
 One thousand. 

00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:15.024
 ... represents not only your own work 

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:17.090
 but also that of other 999 ... 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.071
 That's ... 6,000 months in 500 years 

00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:23.035
 Scratching the mountain and going hungry and thirsty. 

00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:27.057
 ... what is for the human work necessary to find and extort it. " 

00:01:27.084 --> 00:01:30.086
 Let's think about how much energy, work, inventiveness and time 

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:33.092
 they are necessary to find that silver and refine it. 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.090
 "The mining company produces silver bars, 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.041
 whose composition is 93 to 97% pure silver. 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.028
 Then sell the bars to a refinery, where they are 

00:01:45.028 --> 00:01:48.058
 purified further to sell them to the industry. 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.090
 The action starts inside the mine, 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.055
 where geologists direct a detector-gun 

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:57.083
 to several points on the rocky surface. 

00:01:57.083 --> 00:02:01.008
 The device detects levels of 40 elements, 

00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.095
 including silver. Silver in its natural state 

00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:07.049
 It is not silver at all. 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.001
 It's coal gray. 

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:10.069
 Those sediments that look like silver 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.069
 They are really zinc and lead. 

00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:18.032
 Miners drill the silver-rich areas 

00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:20.006
 signaled by geologists 

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.016
 and insert dynamite cartridges 

00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:34.040
 After the explosion, the cars carry 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.058
 the pieces of rock, called ore, to the surface. 

00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:40.032
 Geologists then test the ore for heaps 

00:02:40.032 --> 00:02:42.060
 and mix it according to requirements, to achieve 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.086
 a consistent silver content per kg. of ore. 

00:02:48.014 --> 00:02:51.030
 The ore then goes to the first crusher, 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.019
 whose huge steel teeth 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.006
 divide the large pieces into smaller pieces, 

00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:58.042
 that, through a grill, fall to a 

00:02:58.042 --> 00:03:01.045
 second crusher that breaks them down 

00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:04.013
 in even smaller pieces. 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.018
 These go to oscillating cone crushers, 

00:03:09.018 --> 00:03:13.051
 that reduce them to tiny pieces. 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.099
 A belt transports the crushed ore to the ball mill. 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:26.003
 At this point, the pieces of ore measure about 6mm. 

00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:30.097
 While the mill cylinder rotates, 

00:03:30.097 --> 00:03:33.017
 inside they bounce some steel balls, 

00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:36.049
 grinding the ore to powder. 

00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:38.096
 A water circulation system 

00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:42.033
 drains the rich silver powder out of the cylinder and towards 

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:45.040
 Large tanks that keep the water moving. 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.086
 To separate and dissolve the metals that the powder contains, 

00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:50.078
 the workers pour acid. 

00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:55.029
 72 hours later, the rocky residue sits on the bottom. 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:57.067
 The solution, which contains dissolved silver, 

00:03:57.067 --> 00:04:00.021
 it is pumped through press filters. 

00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:02.063
 The filter plates are treated with a chemical 

00:04:02.063 --> 00:04:05.056
 based on zinc that attracts silver molecules. 

00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:07.061
 As the solution passes the filter 

00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:10.018
 the plates trap particles that contain silver, 

00:04:10.018 --> 00:04:13.061
 forming a layer of black powder called "precipitate". 

00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:15.099
 This precipitate is composed of approximately 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.083
 50% silver and 50% waste. This waste is a 

00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:23.066
 mixture of various metals, mud and other impurities. 

00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:27.050
 To separate the silver from the residue, the 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.033
 precipitated in a gas oven for a couple of hours. 

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:33.075
 In the laboratory of the mining company, the technicians 

00:04:33.075 --> 00:04:35.092
 continually test samples of the ore 

00:04:35.092 --> 00:04:38.041
 to determine the "law", the term for 

00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:42.008
 the amount of silver per kg. of ore. 

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:49.000
 Heat the samples at 1093 Â° C for one hour, 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.051
 to burn the impurities. What's left is silver 

00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:58.091
 and other metals, such as lead, zinc, copper, selenium and cadmium. 

00:04:59.034 --> 00:05:02.019
 The technicians then treat the samples with a 

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:04.037
 chemical product that prevents silver from being consumed 

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.075
 and put them back in the oven. 

00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:09.044
 When the samples are removed after one hour, 

00:05:09.044 --> 00:05:11.063
 all other metals have been removed 

00:05:11.063 --> 00:05:15.013
 and only the silver remains. 

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:21.026
 The silver is weighed and compared to the weight of the 

00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:25.009
 original sample, to calculate the law. The key to 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.086
 managing a profitable mine is to ensure that the law 

00:05:27.086 --> 00:05:32.009
 It is consistent within certain parameters. 

00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:36.021
 Back in the plant, the workers place the precipitate 

00:05:36.021 --> 00:05:38.072
 already dry inside an oven, along with chemicals 

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:41.018
 that prevent the combustion of silver. 

00:05:41.018 --> 00:05:44.025
 About 4 hours later, silver and waste 

00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:46.044
 They have separated and melted. 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.025
 The workers pour the melt into bar-shaped molds. 

00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:53.018
 Silver, being heavier, is deposited in the background 

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:56.063
 and the residues, which float on the surface, are removed. 

00:05:56.077 --> 00:06:00.080
 In less than 5 minutes, the molten silver cools and hardens, 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.056
 allowing to extract what is now a silver bar. 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.028
 The mining company sells the bars to refineries, 

00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:11.052
 to transform them into industrial grade silver. " 

00:06:12.018 --> 00:06:14.084
 It's crazy to think that all those tons of earth 

00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:17.013
 they were removed only to get an ounce of silver 

00:06:17.013 --> 00:06:19.056
 and at this moment we can buy it for less 

00:06:19.056 --> 00:06:21.029
 of the average cost of a dinner.
