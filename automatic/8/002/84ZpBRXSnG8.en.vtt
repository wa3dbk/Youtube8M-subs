00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
to auto which will automatically assign

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.410

your<00:01:06.990> scenes<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.500> color<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.070> create<00:01:08.430> new

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
your scenes of color as you create new

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
your scenes of color as you create new
scenes<00:01:11.360> but<00:01:12.360> that's<00:01:12.659> completely<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.650> I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
scenes but that's completely up to you I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.830 
scenes but that's completely up to you I
think<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.880> makes<00:01:15.119> things<00:01:15.299> more<00:01:15.570> neat<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
think that makes things more neat and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.929 
think that makes things more neat and
more<00:01:16.170> organized<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.549> but

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
more organized if you do do that but

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.730 
more organized if you do do that but
again<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.900> Europe<00:01:19.350> your

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
again that's you know Europe your

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.590 
again that's you know Europe your
preference<00:01:20.159> same<00:01:20.939> thing<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.420> group

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
preference same thing with your group

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080 
preference same thing with your group
color<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.920> set<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.909> specific

group color nine times up to ten just

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.249 
group color nine times up to ten just
leave<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.210> auto<00:01:27.450> because<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.080> makes

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
leave it on auto because it just makes

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you can make finding that sound a lot

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.990 
you can make finding that sound a lot
more<00:01:46.590> easier<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:47.790> you're<00:01:47.909> looking

down<00:01:48.299> at<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> hardware<00:01:48.960> controller<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
down at the hardware controller on the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.690 
down at the hardware controller on the
mk1<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:52.619> still<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.070> organized<00:01:53.490> because

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
mk1 you still can be organized because

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.389 
mk1 you still can be organized because
you<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.479> ability<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> still<00:01:55.710> visually

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
you have the ability to still visually

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.609 
you have the ability to still visually
see<00:01:56.640> where<00:01:57.149> your<00:01:57.360> sounds<00:01:57.899> or<00:01:58.020> color<00:01:58.259> assigned

see where your sounds or color assigned

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.249 
see where your sounds or color assigned
so<00:01:59.149> makes<00:02:00.149> no<00:02:00.270> difference<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.810> mean<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.170> know

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
so makes no difference I mean you know

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.569 
so makes no difference I mean you know
you<00:02:01.320> still<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> software<00:02:02.250> side<00:02:02.430> of

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you still have the software side of

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.639 
you still have the software side of
things<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.000> see<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.079> colors<00:02:04.439> if

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
things to see you know the colors if

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.119 
things to see you know the colors if
you're<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> mk1<00:02:06.380> okay<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.009> that's

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
you're on the mk1 okay so that's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.710

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
don't want to go over colors at all if

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.670

turns them all from mutes um you can do
this<00:03:00.989> from<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.439> the<00:03:01.620> hardware<00:03:01.980> as<00:03:02.099> well

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
this from the on the hardware as well

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.949 
this from the on the hardware as well

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.580 
up the patterns like so so when you come
into<00:03:17.040> your<00:03:17.129> patterns<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.609> can<00:03:17.729> right<00:03:17.909> click

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
into your patterns you can right click

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.039 
into your patterns you can right click
and<00:03:19.699> assign<00:03:20.699> colors<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:21.419> so<00:03:21.659> you<00:03:21.900> know<00:03:21.930> if

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
and assign colors like so you know if

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.439 
and assign colors like so you know if
you<00:03:22.169> want<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:23.010> your<00:03:23.159> patterns<00:03:23.609> neat<00:03:24.209> and

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
you want to have your patterns neat and

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.180 
you want to have your patterns neat and
organized<00:03:25.229> like<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.859> these<00:03:25.949> colors

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
organized like that and these colors

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.069 
organized like that and these colors
will<00:03:26.459> show<00:03:26.669> up<00:03:26.729> on<00:03:26.819> your<00:03:26.879> pads<00:03:27.209> if<00:03:27.449> you<00:03:27.959> have

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
will show up on your pads if you have

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.140 
will show up on your pads if you have
two<00:03:28.199> mk2<00:03:28.590> or<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.250> Machine<00:03:29.579> studio<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.299> I<00:03:32.150> felt

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
two mk2 or the Machine studio and I felt

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.849 
two mk2 or the Machine studio and I felt
this<00:03:33.269> was<00:03:33.479> some<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:34.109> know<00:03:34.229> important

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
this was some you know important

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.860 
this was some you know important
information<00:03:35.430> because<00:03:35.760> on<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.479> preference

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
information because on that preference

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.259 
information because on that preference
screen<00:03:37.229> it<00:03:37.799> didn't<00:03:38.069> have<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.459> ability<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.849> you

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
screen it didn't have the ability to you

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.300 
screen it didn't have the ability to you
know<00:03:39.329> have<00:03:39.989> default<00:03:40.379> in<00:03:40.560> your<00:03:40.709> patterns<00:03:41.040> so

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
know have default in your patterns so

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.569 
know have default in your patterns so
you<00:03:41.970> know<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.359> rather<00:03:43.169> set<00:03:43.560> up<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:44.099> know<00:03:44.189> Auto

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
you know a rather set up you know Auto

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.520 
you know a rather set up you know Auto
patterns<00:03:45.479> and<00:03:45.810> things<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.109> nature<00:03:46.199> so

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
patterns and things of that nature so

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.319 
patterns and things of that nature so
you<00:03:47.370> know<00:03:47.489> if<00:03:47.669> you<00:03:47.759> want<00:03:47.909> to<00:03:47.970> come<00:03:48.090> over<00:03:48.209> here

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
you know if you want to come over here

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.770 
you know if you want to come over here
and<00:03:48.659> just<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.079> know<00:03:49.109> create<00:03:49.530> patterns<00:03:49.979> and

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
and just you know create patterns and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.119 
and just you know create patterns and
you<00:03:51.780> know<00:03:51.870> come<00:03:52.109> in<00:03:52.229> here<00:03:52.379> in<00:03:52.470> color<00:03:52.680> assign

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
you know come in here in color assign

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.339 
you know come in here in color assign
them<00:03:53.310> that's<00:03:53.819> basically<00:03:54.269> how<00:03:54.449> you<00:03:54.509> do<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.900> and

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
them that's basically how you do it and

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.539 
them that's basically how you do it and
you<00:03:55.530> know<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.709> can<00:03:55.919> come<00:03:56.099> in<00:03:56.189> here<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.400> you

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
you know you can come in here and you

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.589 
you know you can come in here and you
know<00:03:56.639> you<00:03:56.699> can<00:03:56.879> move<00:03:56.970> them<00:03:57.150> around<00:03:57.439> you<00:03:58.439> know

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
know you can move them around you know

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.030 
know you can move them around you know
if<00:04:00.599> you<00:04:00.720> want<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.900> rearrange<00:04:01.349> your<00:04:01.650> patterns

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
if you want to rearrange your patterns

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.800 
if you want to rearrange your patterns
to<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> certain<00:04:02.669> way<00:04:02.849> or<00:04:02.879> you're<00:04:03.359> like<00:04:03.479> okay<00:04:03.780> I

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
to a certain way or you're like okay I

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.899 
to a certain way or you're like okay I
need<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.139> one<00:04:04.290> here<00:04:04.680> or<00:04:04.949> I<00:04:05.400> need<00:04:05.609> this<00:04:05.729> one

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
need this one here or I need this one

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.899 
need this one here or I need this one
here<00:04:06.419> it's<00:04:07.409> basically<00:04:07.769> how<00:04:07.949> you<00:04:08.009> do<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.370> and

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
here it's basically how you do it and

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.039 
here it's basically how you do it and
they<00:04:09.269> all<00:04:09.419> get<00:04:10.909> rearranged<00:04:11.909> like<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.299> like<00:04:12.900> you

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
they all get rearranged like so like you

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.179 
they all get rearranged like so like you
can<00:04:13.169> see<00:04:13.229> like<00:04:13.259> a<00:04:13.349> little<00:04:13.500> bit<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.739> color<00:04:13.919> right

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
can see like a little bit of color right

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.099 
can see like a little bit of color right
there<00:04:14.220> in<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.549> back<00:04:14.669> barely<00:04:15.120> if<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.900> come<00:04:16.049> over

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
there in the back barely if I come over

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.649 
there in the back barely if I come over
here<00:04:16.409> and<00:04:16.530> go<00:04:16.650> on<00:04:16.739> top<00:04:16.949> of<00:04:17.099> this<00:04:17.159> guy<00:04:17.539> and<00:04:18.539> he

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
here and go on top of this guy and he

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.020 
here and go on top of this guy and he
races<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.139> so<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.009> know<00:04:20.099> you<00:04:20.190> can<00:04:20.340> overwrite

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
races it so you know you can overwrite

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.680 
races it so you know you can overwrite
patterns<00:04:21.449> like<00:04:21.659> this<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:23.520> know

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
patterns like this you know

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.379 
patterns like this you know
this<00:04:25.690> basic<00:04:26.020> value<00:04:26.289> do<00:04:26.440> that<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.300> can

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
this basic value do that so you can

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.270 
this basic value do that so you can
imagine<00:04:28.539> how<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.870> works<00:04:29.139> for<00:04:29.229> scenes<00:04:29.530> you

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
imagine how that works for scenes you

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.499 
imagine how that works for scenes you
know<00:04:30.400> if<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:30.580> want<00:04:30.759> your<00:04:30.849> scenes<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.270> color

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
know if you want your scenes to color

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.809 
know if you want your scenes to color
coordinate<00:04:31.750> with<00:04:32.319> your<00:04:32.530> patterns<00:04:32.889> you<00:04:33.610> can<00:04:33.729> do

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
coordinate with your patterns you can do

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.960 
coordinate with your patterns you can do
that<00:04:34.000> too<00:04:34.240> if<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.430> makes<00:04:36.430> it<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.639> lot<00:04:36.759> more

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
that too if that makes it a lot more

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.260 
that too if that makes it a lot more
easier<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:38.340> find<00:04:39.340> your<00:04:39.490> patterns<00:04:39.849> like<00:04:40.090> this

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
easier to find your patterns like this

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.529 
easier to find your patterns like this
here<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:42.130> yeah<00:04:42.340> man<00:04:42.610> that's<00:04:42.880> pretty<00:04:43.030> much<00:04:43.270> it

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
here so yeah man that's pretty much it

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.029 
here so yeah man that's pretty much it
short<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.020> right<00:04:44.199> to<00:04:44.349> the<00:04:44.470> point

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
short and right to the point

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.969 
short and right to the point
your<00:04:45.880> boy<00:04:46.030> Fontaine<00:04:46.599> the<00:04:46.780> VIP<00:04:47.080> sound<00:04:47.500> lab<00:04:47.740> just

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
your boy Fontaine the VIP sound lab just

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.589 
your boy Fontaine the VIP sound lab just
doing<00:04:48.130> some<00:04:48.310> color<00:04:48.520> assignments<00:04:49.150> on<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.300> pads

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
doing some color assignments on the pads

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.439 
doing some color assignments on the pads
so<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.590> can<00:04:50.800> get<00:04:50.979> a<00:04:51.220> lot<00:04:51.520> more<00:04:51.550> neat<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.030> a<00:04:52.270> lot

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
so you can get a lot more neat and a lot

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.040 
so you can get a lot more neat and a lot
more<00:04:52.630> organized<00:04:53.020> than<00:04:53.319> your<00:04:53.440> productions<00:04:53.979> so

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
more organized than your productions so

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.240 
more organized than your productions so
it's<00:04:56.050> just<00:04:56.139> a<00:04:56.259> little<00:04:56.410> fun<00:04:56.620> little<00:04:56.740> tutorial

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
it's just a little fun little tutorial

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.740 
it's just a little fun little tutorial
you<00:04:57.430> know<00:04:57.550> just<00:04:58.210> going<00:04:58.389> through<00:04:58.479> some<00:04:58.720> of

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
you know just going through some of

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.120 
you know just going through some of
those<00:04:58.870> you<00:04:59.110> know<00:04:59.199> color<00:04:59.500> assignments<00:04:59.979> like

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
those you know color assignments like

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.399 
those you know color assignments like
that<00:05:00.389> so<00:05:02.370> that's<00:05:03.370> pretty<00:05:03.610> much<00:05:03.699> it<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:04.300> will<00:05:05.199> see

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
that so that's pretty much it I will see
