00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.230
 hi comrades camera ticos how are you 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.240
 my god for my beloved homeland I hope that 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.640
 you have taken those two faces with a voice to 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.279
 that you be recommended today I come to you 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.980
 teach to get the to that one worth 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.259
 tlc russian weapon from second to salt and ya 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.260
 we can unlock without having to 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.780
 have the damn xbox one but it's 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.239
 It is essential that we are a premium 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.370
 Once this requirement has been met, we should only 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.710
 complete an easy mission composed of 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.050
 two Soviet parties and we'll already have it 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.400
 we will have the Russian weapon, my god, a 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.400
 new Russian weapon in battlefield 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.110
 and gods that is a new Russian weapon god 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.970
 mine you do not notice the tension when we go 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.950
 to get a new Russian weapon is that 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.900
 it would have to make a good party the 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.850
 The first part of the mission is to 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.470
 get 10 patrol repairs 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.629
 which are those repairs that 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.030
 we make vehicles controlled by a 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.729
 member of our patrol the allies 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.250
 green is good for knots once 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.590
 let's do good repairs we will complete 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.420
 this part of the mission the second part 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.729
 of the mission tries to be in a 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.290
 helicopter for 10 minutes do what 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.170
 what you do and it does not matter if you're the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.290
 pilot gunner or passenger as they say 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.940
 it does not matter what the helicopter is 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.649
 they serve but I recommend doing it in a 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.960
 helicopter reconnaissance or 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.820
 attack by who of transport fails 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.070
 sometimes and today I have passed as 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.229
 about 10 minutes inside and they have not given me 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.789
 gallon and good once it is 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.310
 blocked this weapon we will see what is a 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.560
 exclusive weapon of self defense 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.850
 engineer the first defense weapon 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.009
 staff with a silencer 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.110
 custom already included which does not 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.090
 we can remove but which penalizes 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.590
 the weapon far less reach than the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.970
 conventional generators 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.710
 perfect if we want to go 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.350
 to the stealthy ones and we do not want to lose 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.330
 so much scope besides that the s 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.250
 vall is one of the few weapons of 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.740
 personal defense that we can add a 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.170
 coupling to improve its stability but 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.729
 on the contrary it is one of the weapons of 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.910
 personal defense with the most loader 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.190
 small 21 bullets and its stability is very 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.260
 bad so we'll have to put a 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.970
 obligatorily here I leave you a 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.890
 video explaining all about the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.200
 supporters of weapons if you have 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.760
 some doubt worth comrades and good 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.560
 Comrades hope you enjoyed the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.959
 elpidio I hope he gives to saray because 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.300
 says the legend there says a legend 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.130
 from youtube to see this between us 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.140
 it has a legend that if we give it to 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.459
 that exploits exploits the computer is 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.930
 exploit exploits computers in 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.720
 first place is wrong do not you think because 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.240
 I had but podcast starts but 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.040
 that you can not see and that you can not sell or you 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.380
 you can take it and it's fucking great so 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.460
 good strings see you in the next 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.250
 video 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.879
 now 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.879
 no no 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.720
 how is it 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:07.350
 cumulative 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.350
 you think of a way of relationship
