so<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.170> ecostar<00:00:34.649> there's<00:00:34.920> two<00:00:35.160> types<00:00:35.910> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
so with ecostar there's two types of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.850 
so with ecostar there's two types of
anti<00:00:36.780> idle<00:00:37.430> modes<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:39.960> simply

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
anti idle modes the first one is simply

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.799 
anti idle modes the first one is simply
a<00:00:40.890> timer<00:00:41.600> if<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.899> vehicle<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.530> park<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.809> we

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
a timer if the vehicle is in park and we

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.590 
a timer if the vehicle is in park and we
see<00:00:46.079> all<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> conditions<00:00:46.530> met<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.850> after<00:00:48.180> 15

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
see all the conditions met then after 15

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.250 
see all the conditions met then after 15
seconds<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.170> idling<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:50.460> shut<00:00:50.700> off<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> engine

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
seconds of idling we shut off the engine

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.529 
seconds of idling we shut off the engine
automatically<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.469> key<00:00:52.680> stays<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.329> we<00:00:54.329> simply

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
automatically the key stays on we simply

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.130 
automatically the key stays on we simply
shut<00:00:54.840> off<00:00:54.989> engine<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:56.399> driver<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:57.329> restart

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
shut off engine the driver can restart

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.860 
shut off engine the driver can restart
by<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> couple<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.309> ways<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.850> either<00:01:00.359> step

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
by a couple of ways they can either step

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.420 
by a couple of ways they can either step
on<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> service<00:01:01.500> brake<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> it'll

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
on the service brake and it'll

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.000 
on the service brake and it'll
re-energize<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.270> engine<00:01:03.780> or<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.799> can

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
re-energize the engine or they can

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.399 
re-energize the engine or they can
simply<00:01:05.519> turn<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> key<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.479> start<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
simply turn the key and start the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.590 
simply turn the key and start the
vehicle<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:07.979> normal<00:01:08.369> which<00:01:09.060> would<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.360> take

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
vehicle as normal which would then take

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.890 
vehicle as normal which would then take
us<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.290> system<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:12.060> second<00:01:12.659> way<00:01:12.869> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
us out of the system the second way that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.940 
us out of the system the second way that
this<00:01:13.260> ecostar<00:01:13.950> works<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:15.570> look<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
this ecostar works is we look for a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.340 
this ecostar works is we look for a
trigger<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.700> trigger<00:01:18.270> could<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> door

trigger a trigger could be a door

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.410 
trigger a trigger could be a door
opening<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.400> switch<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
opening it's a switch that we get a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.050 
opening it's a switch that we get a
signal<00:01:21.840> from<00:01:22.110> where<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.340> an<00:01:23.460> open<00:01:23.790> door

and the vehicles in park and here again

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.760 
and the vehicles in park and here again
all<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> conditions<00:01:27.000> are<00:01:27.390> met<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:28.350> shut<00:01:28.650> off

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
all the conditions are met we shut off

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.460 
all the conditions are met we shut off
the<00:01:28.920> engine<00:01:29.240> once<00:01:30.240> again<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.720> key<00:01:30.900> stays<00:01:31.200> on

he steps on or he or she steps on that
service<00:01:50.070> brake<00:01:50.310> vehicle<00:01:51.240> automatically

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
service brake vehicle automatically

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.530 
service brake vehicle automatically
starts<00:01:52.229> up<00:01:52.409> again<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.820> essence<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.270> save

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
starts up again so in essence you save

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.870 
starts up again so in essence you save
all<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.110> time<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.619> idling<00:01:56.040> during<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.640> time

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
all that time of idling during that time

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.600 
all that time of idling during that time
where<00:01:57.119> they're<00:01:57.270> outside<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> bus<00:01:58.250> now<00:01:59.250> if

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
where they're outside of the bus now if

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.480 
where they're outside of the bus now if
there<00:01:59.969> are<00:02:00.090> AC<00:02:00.619> requirements<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:02.189> don't

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
there are AC requirements so we don't

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.060 
there are AC requirements so we don't
shut<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.969> engine<00:02:03.420> off<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.229> there<00:02:04.409> are<00:02:04.439> special

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
shut the engine off so there are special

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.210 
shut the engine off so there are special
requirements<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.939> various<00:02:06.719> things<00:02:07.020> that

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
requirements and various things that

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.559 
requirements and various things that
will<00:02:08.220> prevent<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.729> bus<00:02:08.970> from<00:02:09.149> shutting<00:02:09.539> down

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
will prevent that bus from shutting down

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.400 
will prevent that bus from shutting down
so<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:11.430> essence<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.120> an<00:02:12.300> anti<00:02:12.599> idle<00:02:12.900> device

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so in essence it's an anti idle device

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.110 
so in essence it's an anti idle device
that's<00:02:13.800> used<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> driver<00:02:14.850> doesn't

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
that's used so that the driver doesn't
