comedic value to actually be good but

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.779 
comedic value to actually be good but
the<00:04:40.800> reason<00:04:40.949> why<00:04:41.190> it<00:04:41.250> sparked<00:04:41.729> the

the reason why it sparked the

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.240 
the reason why it sparked the
conversation<00:04:42.000> was<00:04:42.630> strictly<00:04:42.960> because<00:04:43.250> this

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
conversation was strictly because this

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.730 
conversation was strictly because this

anime freezing seems so sexualized to
the<00:04:46.860> point<00:04:47.130> of<00:04:47.310> why<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.660> serious<00:04:49.199> if<00:04:49.620> it's

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
the point of why is it serious if it's

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.770 
the point of why is it serious if it's
going<00:04:49.949> to<00:04:50.009> be<00:04:50.160> so<00:04:50.400> sexual<00:04:51.030> couldn't<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.750> just

this<00:04:54.210> kind<00:04:54.389> of<00:04:54.509> stuff<00:04:54.750> because<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:55.350> found<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.949> so

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
this kind of stuff because I found it so

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.920 
this kind of stuff because I found it so
hard<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.430> take<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:56.759> enemy<00:04:57.030> seriously<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:57.900> I

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
hard to take the enemy seriously and I

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.909 
hard to take the enemy seriously and I
felt<00:04:58.199> like<00:04:58.320> it<00:04:58.440> would<00:04:58.500> have<00:04:58.620> had<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.740> really

felt like it would have had a really

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.010 
felt like it would have had a really
good<00:04:59.070> story<00:04:59.310> had<00:04:59.550> it<00:04:59.580> been<00:04:59.759> not<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:00.360> overly

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
good story had it been not so overly

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.439
