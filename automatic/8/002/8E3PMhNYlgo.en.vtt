continued that were like during the same
timeline<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.180> divergent<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.840> still<00:01:46.140> loved<00:01:46.380> them

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
timeline as divergent I still loved them

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.340 
timeline as divergent I still loved them
I<00:01:46.860> highly<00:01:47.850> recommend<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.329> sefira<00:01:48.720> divergent

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
book like a discussion video because I

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.510 
book like a discussion video because I
actually<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> lot<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.439> say<00:02:07.590> about<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.829> but

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
actually have a lot to say about it but

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.490 
actually have a lot to say about it but
I<00:02:08.759> really<00:02:09.390> liked<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.869> was<00:02:09.899> probably<00:02:10.259> only<00:02:10.379> a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
I really liked it it was probably only a

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.740 
I really liked it it was probably only a
3.5<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.550> 5<00:02:11.760> though<00:02:12.000> maybe<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.480> three<00:02:12.660> out

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
3.5 out of 5 though maybe it's three out

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.460 
3.5 out of 5 though maybe it's three out
of<00:02:12.810> five

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
of five

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.350 
of five
it<00:02:13.560> was<00:02:13.680> super<00:02:14.040> compelling<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.730> was<00:02:14.940> reading<00:02:15.270> it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
it was super compelling I was reading it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.690 
it was super compelling I was reading it
non-stop<00:02:15.990> every<00:02:16.680> second<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.130> had<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.490> chance

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
non-stop every second I had the chance

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.670 
non-stop every second I had the chance
to<00:02:17.880> read<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.780> being<00:02:18.960> said<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.290> found

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
to read it but that being said I found

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.980 
to read it but that being said I found
that<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.190> was<00:02:20.220> really<00:02:20.610> repetitive<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.540> it

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
that it was really repetitive and it

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.630 
that it was really repetitive and it
used<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.320> lot<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> same<00:02:22.860> metaphors<00:02:23.490> like

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
used a lot of the same metaphors like

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.180 
used a lot of the same metaphors like
over<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.300> over<00:02:24.330> again<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:25.010> none<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
over and over again and none of the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.470 
over and over again and none of the
metaphors<00:02:26.520> weren't<00:02:26.730> good<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.060> was<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.360> like

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
metaphors weren't good it was just like

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.390 
metaphors weren't good it was just like
you<00:02:27.720> only<00:02:27.930> need<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.380> use<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.530> metaphor<00:02:28.830> once<00:02:29.160> per

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
you only need to use a metaphor once per

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.320 
you only need to use a metaphor once per
page<00:02:29.960> um<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:32.190> being<00:02:32.400> said<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.760> also<00:02:33.090> has<00:02:33.300> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
page um that being said it also has a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.140 
page um that being said it also has a
lot<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.810> sexual<00:02:34.290> content<00:02:34.740> where<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.580> felt<00:02:36.030> like

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
lot of sexual content where I felt like

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.030 
lot of sexual content where I felt like
it<00:02:36.270> wasn't<00:02:36.450> exactly<00:02:36.660> necessary<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.680> that

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
it wasn't exactly necessary to have that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.790 
it wasn't exactly necessary to have that
much<00:02:38.280> explicit<00:02:39.060> sexual<00:02:39.270> content<00:02:39.590> but<00:02:40.590> either

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
much explicit sexual content but either

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.260 
much explicit sexual content but either
way<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.460> liked<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.730> characters<00:02:42.120> I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
way I really liked the characters I

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.060 
way I really liked the characters I
really<00:02:42.510> liked<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.840> backstory<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.380> thoroughly

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
really liked the backstory I thoroughly

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.760 
really liked the backstory I thoroughly
enjoyed<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.810> wasn't<00:02:45.959> exactly<00:02:46.350> as

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
enjoyed it it just wasn't exactly as

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.060 
enjoyed it it just wasn't exactly as
awesome<00:02:47.280> as<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.520> think<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.940> could<00:02:48.390> have<00:02:48.600> been

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
awesome as I think it could have been

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.860 
awesome as I think it could have been
but<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.190> being<00:02:50.220> said<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.880> have<00:02:51.360> basically

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
but that being said I have basically

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.720 
but that being said I have basically
