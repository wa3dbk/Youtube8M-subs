 of you I have facilitated the task 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.630
 leaving the castle half-cocks though 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.360
 many others have finished the year instead 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.820
 built really well and therefore it is 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.110
 it was difficult to select only 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.050
 some to reward for this I have decided 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.489
 to give consolation prizes a 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.980

 I invite you to go and have a look 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.310
 then 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.640
 let's see a little start from the first the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.619
 first player to reward 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.229
 is the winner of the contest 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.780
 or let's say from the last award-winning 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.159
 we say from the green we say from 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.189
 to the last one from the last one that is created more 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.679
 salas thinks then the last we have 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.439
 decided to do a main ranking 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:39.530
 of six places so the sex is called 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:42.409
 der saibot hd right anna forbidden that is 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.299
 his castle is this a lot 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.429
 nice a fairly simple design with 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.310
 I liked a couple of colors and I have it 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.209
 wanted to reward I like the structure 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.799
 all the castles have been judged 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.659
 with the texture pack of course 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.599
 default to give everyone the same 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.979
 possibility in fifth place anna chi 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.159
 we have 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.739
 in fifth place we have xv believes hicks e 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.329
 pique faith if I remember correctly his 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:10.160
 castle is this here indeed this is 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.260
 the castle of xc fede I like the fact 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.420
 who has only accused a color color 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.269
 black makes it quite serious and also 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.370
 the interiors are pretty well done to me 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.769
 I like it I like it too 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.540
 the structure is very well built 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:29.680
 fifth place fourth place who is fourth 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.120
 place leo magic 96 euro magic 95 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.150
 obviously a good builder here 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.230
 this is his castle enough 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.940
 colored however as design is rather 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.500
 simple I liked it seems that 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.519
 interior was one of the few that has 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.790
 nice enough the interior I like 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:54.829
 a beautiful castle is a beautiful castle is 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:57.919
 done with subsequent third capacity 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:01.389
 place these are those awarded with i 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:04.459
 awards the first prizes just third place 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.650
 then in third place we have elbow 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.049
 press the 93 this is a castle 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.120
 rather strange detail here it is 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.579
 this is where I wanted to reward him because 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.769
 it's weird and it's also done with skill 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.440
 because they are all sand blocks 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.830
 that are held only on thanks to torches 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.319
 you see is very particular i like it 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.050
 because it is made almost entirely of sand 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.640
 you see there is a lot of sand a lot 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.510
 of sand that is held together 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.060
 thanks to the torches I like it I like it 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.560
 design looks very futuristic a lot 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.650
 original I said I would reward 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.599
 also the originality so here it is 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.180
 second place but I also remember them from 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:50.030
 only in second place we have the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:53.760
 b2 castle itself is suitable that 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.680
 here if I remember correctly , here it is 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.799
 here the castle of itself b2 I like it 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.480
 a lot of this because he also used it 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.549
 he a couple of colors so no 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.950
 exaggerate with colors but did one 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.450
 very nice structure with red hat and there 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.790
 are the designs of the clippers mi 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.410
 he likes a lot too, he took care of it 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.959
 I do not say much but still has 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.950
 then built a minimum of interiors 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.109
 because I like this as design as 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.229
 structure convinced me a lot 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.919
 I wanted to reward him because he really is 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.950
 beautiful a beautiful castle then in first place 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.180
 finally the winner 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.630
 some of you might have guessed it 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:38.070
 because I passed by it before it is 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:41.460
 this here and the castle of maraschin 98 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.350
 here it is as you see this is a 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.570
 castle definitely of another level 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:52.950
 I don't know I hope he or she created 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.110
 honestly without copying it from someone 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.270
 other also put some with a 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.120
 signpost for the judges before of 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.210
 I don't care about this judgment 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.220
 read made her a lot of cheste 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.690
 I don't understand why we give ourselves 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.780
 I don't know what he has a live look at 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.000
 written in here we see from the crisis 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.700
 curiosity has left a note to 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.680
 judges don't know who the judge is a 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.720
 they use maraschin mara for friends yes 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.100
 call mara first of all let me say 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.919
 that the entire castle was designed e 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.139
 built by me with the use of on the block e 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.139
 you didn't hear bla bla bla bla bla bla 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.630
 ok i hope the castle like it goes 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.280
 well it's ok there was no need to 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.040
 sign up st cagata 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.610
 however the beautiful castle inside is not 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.930
 it was done particularly well though 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:50.140
 the outside is very nice very nice me 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:54.390
 like it because it looks pretty serious 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:57.730
 the structure is extremely detailed 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.710
 very very characteristic I never have 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.790
 seen a construction made in this 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.100
 way 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.720
 so he convinced me very well 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.090
 there is certainly a way to make that roof 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.400
 It took a long time, so I decided 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:14.320
 to give the first prize to him of course 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.560
 all the others who arrived from 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.630
 third place down will receive prizes 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.580
 to obviously descend with the quality of the 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.380
 prize 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.920
 go see the ranking on the 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.000
 forum 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.950
 to know where you are at 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.540
 this time it's all I leave you 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:39.640
 obviously all the information 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:42.010
 description lion is also anna out there 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.870
 we have just realized that in this 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.120
 castle the euro took the ci 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.080
 this lion was a sign for 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:54.310
 to judge the break the block now I have 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.610
 already judged, however, I think it means 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.140
 this block so i would break it 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.760
 I'm afraid that happens 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.760
 probably will race the world 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.099
 look 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:18.939
 well this makes it even more epic 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:25.029
 but a transforming castle is yes 

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:27.159
 changing so yes it categorizes this 

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:30.699
 castle ends up in first place e 

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:32.349
 the others then climb first place 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:36.580
 elvo presley 

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:43.029
 second place maraschin third place if 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:46.110
 b2 and the others remain the same and yes it is 

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:49.270
 yes it is a castle will turn boys a 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:52.709
 does not stand comparison with others 

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.709
 epic epic
