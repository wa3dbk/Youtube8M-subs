 many attributes of this very 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.539

 money first of all here we draw 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.670

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:39.329
 another physiognomy we have money 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:46.620

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:49.079
 no bills here still draw his house, too, 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.230
 having a house associating often with 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.770
 welfare is not so but the door is all like 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.840
 it is necessary 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:02.579
 that there is still a car draw and that's it 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.820
 it's there for example, money from him 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:11.400
 there are 100 thousand rubles 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.100
 the house costs 20 million rubles and cars 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.000
 labor dear on off-road 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:25.490
 worth 2 million wealthy person yes 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:35.939
 it seems like it all costs 22 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:38.670
 million 100 thousand rubles and all this about 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.950
 he can say all this with pride 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.890
 this is mine 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:48.060
 that's why he smiles at all this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:53.189
 has the so -called right 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.040
 property ie can sell 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.840
 change gift even cut out if 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.430
 get tired of it all him 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.920
 can dispose of as though 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.790
 here is the financial terminology here is this 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:12.240
 the thing is all here it is called 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.460
 assets of assets at 22 million 100 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.410
 thousand rubles 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.730
 does that mean he's rich well 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.760
 wealth scale everyone understands by 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.470
 differently in principle as we see is enough 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:33.410
 wealthy person seems to be there 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:39.120
 another country can be an example 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:42.480
 a little detail picture saying 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:49.170
 that this man out of his 100,000 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:52.350
 80 thousand rubles credit cards are withdrawn 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.920
 this is our credit card magnetic 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.830
 strip 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.680
 this number and slug up to 80 thousand rubles 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:07.980
 he bought a house by taking a loan from a bank 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:11.280
 called a mortgage loan and according to it 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.530
 There is still a debt of 12 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.860
 million rubles but also a car 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.150
 then he bought by borrowing money 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.120
 let's say diversity say that u 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.720
 more often they have a bank and mother-in-law he still has 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.250
 let's give it back 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.720
 debt 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:43.140
 more often cars more often they still have to give 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:47.870
 one and a half million rubles and all this 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.550
 here in common people are called debts 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.310
 in simple terms financially 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.770
 in the language of all this 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.770
 called commitment 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.120
 agree paintings are already a little less 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.430
 happy so this is real and 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.880
 the well-being of this person is real and 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.310
 the welfare of this person 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.130
 denoted by such a term as 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.880
 equity 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.920
 which is nothing but a difference 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.990
 between assets 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.730
 notice between the market value of those 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.870
 assets that can be converted 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:36.190
 money is little money is money 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.190
 assets minus liabilities 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:51.610
 let's talk a little more about 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:51.610
 equity own 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.500
 how do I remind you that it is calculated as 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.660
 market value of all assets for 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.620
 deduct amount of liabilities 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.830
 that is, all he has is an order 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.780
 minus the sum of all his debt 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.660
 let's consider case 1 what will 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.370
 if the obligation is greater than the asset that is 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.620
 net worth less than 00 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.100
 write it like this so as not to be confused with the letter 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.580
 and commitments what is it 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:31.510
 means one very simple thing 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.510
 his debts 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:47.680
 exceed the value of the property and it is on 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.680
 really cause for sadness 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.970
 This means that such a person can 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.530
 live only at the expense of current income as 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.200
 only he loses his current income he 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.250
 gets into trouble he needs more than 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.580
 can consider the second case 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.710
 equity is big and what is it 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:19.330
 mean this is actually a reason for 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:19.330
 joy because man has more 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.290
 what should 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:37.250
 and here is the rule it is executed in 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.190
 anyway regardless of size 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.930
 assets a person may have assets on 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.240
 100 million dollars per billion 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.860
 dollars but if skillfully 150 million 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.590
 dollars or a half billion dollars 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:56.320
 liabilities that is debts he sorry 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.320
 just furious 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:06.069
 whatever we say no matter what 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:10.240
 asset size and if he has his own 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:12.370
 capital is greater than zero he may have 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.449
 he is not rich yet depends on what 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.379
 size this difference 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:20.279
 what is the value of equity but 

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:23.219
 he already has something of his own 

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:27.969
 that's about how equity 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:30.669
 connected with everything else as regards 

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:33.210
 well-being person ie income 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:33.210
 costs 

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:37.870
 various types of expenses 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.860
 how are the assets classified we are with you 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:43.330
 let's talk our souls by the way 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.139
 how much is our man really rich 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.090
 from the first example 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:48.090
 what is his net worth
