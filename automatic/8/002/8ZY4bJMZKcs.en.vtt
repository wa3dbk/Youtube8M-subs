00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
works where there's a neutral base where

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.950 
works where there's a neutral base where
you<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.130> see<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.490> gray<00:00:23.730> flag<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> west<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
you can see the gray flag on the west of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.740 
you can see the gray flag on the west of
the<00:00:25.080> mini-map<00:00:25.820> so<00:00:26.820> basically<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.359> works<00:00:27.510> just

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the mini-map so basically it works just

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.550 
the mini-map so basically it works just
like<00:00:28.080> taking<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.859> basin<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.990> current<00:00:31.380> World

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
like taking a basin in the current World

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.710 
like taking a basin in the current World
of<00:00:31.710> Tanks<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:33.000> tanks<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.570> in

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
of Tanks the more tanks you have in

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.069 
of Tanks the more tanks you have in
there<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.860> get<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.370> tick<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> say<00:00:36.660> for

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
there you get one tick so to say for

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.479 
there you get one tick so to say for
every<00:00:37.200> tank<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:37.980> there<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.309> every

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
every tank you have in there for every

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.979 
every tank you have in there for every
second<00:00:38.880> and<00:00:39.870> once<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.200> reach<00:00:40.350> 100<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.980> win

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
second and once you reach 100 you win

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.740 
second and once you reach 100 you win
however<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.290> difference<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.750> both

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
however the difference is that both

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.270 
however the difference is that both
teams<00:00:46.020> are<00:00:46.260> trying<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> take<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> same<00:00:47.070> base

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
teams are trying to take the same base

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.940 
teams are trying to take the same base
which<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.180> quite<00:00:48.540> exciting<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.500> i<00:00:49.649> think

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
which is quite exciting really i think

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.750 
which is quite exciting really i think
it's<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.820> great<00:00:51.059> game<00:00:51.270> mode<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:51.750> played<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
it's it's a great game mode I played it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
it's it's a great game mode I played it
I'd<00:00:53.760> say<00:00:53.969> about<00:00:54.000> probably<00:00:54.539> 50<00:00:54.899> times<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
I'd say about probably 50 times on the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
I'd say about probably 50 times on the
the<00:00:55.950> test<00:00:56.190> realm<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.420> works<00:00:57.600> out

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the test realm and I think it works out

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.750 
the test realm and I think it works out
quite<00:00:57.960> well<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.559> when<00:00:58.770> more<00:00:59.010> people<00:00:59.399> figure

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
quite well and when more people figure

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
quite well and when more people figure
out<00:00:59.789> how<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> play<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.079> think<00:01:01.350> he'll<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.649> very

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
out how to play it I think he'll be very

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.019 
out how to play it I think he'll be very
interesting<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> what<00:01:04.949> happens<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:06.029 
interesting so what happens just to

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:08.899 
interesting so what happens just to
clarify<00:01:06.209> if<00:01:06.840> both<00:01:07.319> teams<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.950> inside<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
clarify if both teams are inside the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.899 
clarify if both teams are inside the
neutral<00:01:09.299> base<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.929> the<00:01:10.109> same<00:01:10.319> time<00:01:10.819> well<00:01:11.819> it

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
neutral base at the same time well it

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.519 
neutral base at the same time well it
gets<00:01:11.999> held<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.749> as<00:01:12.929> far<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:13.499> aware

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:13.529 
gets held up and as far as I'm aware

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:15.739 
gets held up and as far as I'm aware
even<00:01:14.009> if<00:01:14.249> they've<00:01:14.429> got<00:01:14.670> six<00:01:15.029> tanks<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.539> there

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:15.749 
even if they've got six tanks in there

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:18.649 
even if they've got six tanks in there
and<00:01:15.959> you've<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.469> just<00:01:16.920> one<00:01:17.249> tank<00:01:17.819> if<00:01:18.450> you're

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
and you've got just one tank if you're

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.019 
and you've got just one tank if you're
in<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:18.990> yourself<00:01:19.139> you<00:01:19.799> stop<00:01:20.249> their<00:01:20.520> capping

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:21.029 
in there yourself you stop their capping

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:24.980 
in there yourself you stop their capping
however<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.020> doesn't<00:01:22.670> decay<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:24.299> stays<00:01:24.719> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
however it doesn't decay it stays the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.399 
however it doesn't decay it stays the
same<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:26.630> once<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.779> either<00:01:27.899> get<00:01:28.109> killed

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
same and then once you either get killed

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.870 
same and then once you either get killed
or<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.709> leave<00:01:28.859> the<00:01:28.979> cap<00:01:29.159> circle<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:29.759> will

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
or you leave the cap circle it will

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.330 
or you leave the cap circle it will
carry<00:01:30.149> on<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.599> so<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.560> encounter<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.279> be

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
carry on going so the encounter can be

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.769 
carry on going so the encounter can be
played<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.700> quite<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.969> few<00:01:33.090> different<00:01:33.389> maps

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:33.779 
played on quite a few different maps

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:35.779 
played on quite a few different maps
here<00:01:34.349> I'm<00:01:34.529> going<00:01:34.709> to<00:01:34.799> put<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.399> maps<00:01:35.609> up

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
back to the gameplay we can see I'm

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.759 
back to the gameplay we can see I'm
playing<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.700> tier<00:02:23.999> 6<00:02:24.569> French<00:02:25.049> tank<00:02:25.439> destroyer

playing a tier 6 French tank destroyer
and<00:02:26.150> we<00:02:27.150> saw<00:02:27.359> I<00:02:27.389> took<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.810> good<00:02:28.379> chunk<00:02:28.439> out<00:02:28.859> that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
and we saw I took a good chunk out that

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.449 
and we saw I took a good chunk out that
is<00:02:29.459> eight<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.469> he<00:02:31.469> hit<00:02:31.680> me<00:02:31.709> rather<00:02:32.040> bad<00:02:32.310> as

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
is eight but he hit me rather bad as

is eight but he hit me rather bad as
well<00:02:32.609> this<00:02:33.420> tank<00:02:33.689> always<00:02:33.930> reminds<00:02:34.260> me<00:02:34.409> a<00:02:34.439> bit

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
well this tank always reminds me a bit

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.379 
well this tank always reminds me a bit
of<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.829> land<00:02:35.310> raider<00:02:36.709> um<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:38.849> yeah<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.120> was<00:02:39.239> quite

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
of a land raider um so yeah it was quite

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.539 
of a land raider um so yeah it was quite
impressed<00:02:39.750> if<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.049> 260<00:02:40.739> d<00:02:40.889> was<00:02:41.069> able<00:02:41.340> to

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
impressed if the 260 d was able to

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:48.890 
impressed if the 260 d was able to
penetrate<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.230> easily<00:02:43.919> the<00:02:47.419> is-8<00:02:48.419> nose

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
penetrate that is easily the is-8 nose

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.390 
penetrate that is easily the is-8 nose
at<00:02:49.139> the<00:02:49.200> front<00:02:49.439> is<00:02:49.530> very<00:02:49.739> weak<00:02:49.919> and<00:02:50.189> here<00:02:50.310> we

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
at the front is very weak and here we

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.979 
at the front is very weak and here we
can<00:02:50.519> see<00:02:50.760> I've<00:02:50.879> entered<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.389> neutral<00:02:51.810> base

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
can see I've entered the neutral base

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.619 
can see I've entered the neutral base

number another ARL is homing in on me so

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.439 
number another ARL is homing in on me so
i'm<00:03:16.980> using<00:03:17.189> what<00:03:17.400> cover<00:03:17.639> i<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.239> neutral

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
i'm using what cover i can in a neutral

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:22.580 
i'm using what cover i can in a neutral
base<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:20.569> with<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.689> maps<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.169> just<00:03:22.379> saw

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
base and with the maps that you just saw

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.999 
base and with the maps that you just saw
quite<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.549> few<00:03:23.639> of<00:03:23.849> them<00:03:24.209> are<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:25.439> neutral<00:03:25.829> base

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:26.009 
quite a few of them are the neutral base

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.449 
quite a few of them are the neutral base
has<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:27.090> think<00:03:27.449> it's<00:03:27.599> a<00:03:27.659> custom<00:03:28.079> app<00:03:28.229> and<00:03:28.889> for

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
has a I think it's a custom app and for

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.499 
has a I think it's a custom app and for
example<00:03:30.919> on<00:03:31.919> El<00:03:32.340> halugh<00:03:32.669> it's<00:03:33.509> got<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:34.129> big<00:03:35.509> load

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:36.509 
example on El halugh it's got a big load

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:37.999 
example on El halugh it's got a big load
of<00:03:36.659> rocks<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.199> middle<00:03:37.439> which<00:03:37.560> people<00:03:37.919> can

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:38.009 
of rocks in the middle which people can

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.039 
of rocks in the middle which people can
hide<00:03:38.280> behind<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:39.269> some<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.569> them<00:03:39.750> are<00:03:39.840> very

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
hide behind so some of them are very

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.039 
hide behind so some of them are very
open<00:03:40.639> malinovka<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:42.120> neutral<00:03:42.449> base<00:03:42.629> is<00:03:42.840> very

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
open malinovka the neutral base is very

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.999 
open malinovka the neutral base is very
very<00:03:43.259> open<00:03:43.680> but<00:03:44.370> some<00:03:44.639> of<00:03:44.729> them<00:03:45.019> searches<00:03:46.019> as

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:47.009 
very open but some of them searches as

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:48.740 
very open but some of them searches as
they<00:03:47.699> all<00:03:47.819> halloo<00:03:48.060> if<00:03:48.120> i<00:03:48.239> just<00:03:48.389> talked<00:03:48.599> about

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
they all halloo if i just talked about

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.189 
they all halloo if i just talked about
it's<00:03:49.620> it's<00:03:49.889> got<00:03:50.220> places<00:03:50.759> to<00:03:50.970> hide<00:03:51.150> behind<00:03:51.329> so

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
it's it's got places to hide behind so

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.719 
it's it's got places to hide behind so
people<00:03:52.500> actually<00:03:52.680> physically<00:03:53.310> have<00:03:53.519> too

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
people actually physically have too

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.990 
people actually physically have too
often<00:03:54.680> suicide<00:03:55.680> rush<00:03:55.919> maybe<00:03:56.159> down<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.519> try<00:03:56.879> and

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
often suicide rush maybe down to try and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.939 
often suicide rush maybe down to try and
get<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.239> interrupt<00:03:57.719> off<00:03:57.900> which<00:03:58.139> is<00:03:58.169> which<00:03:58.919> is

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
get that interrupt off which is which is

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:04.099 
get that interrupt off which is which is
quite<00:03:59.310> exciting<00:04:01.729> so<00:04:02.729> yeah<00:04:03.209> all<00:04:03.389> in<00:04:03.599> all<00:04:03.719> and

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
quite exciting so yeah all in all and

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.119 
quite exciting so yeah all in all and
what<00:04:04.319> do<00:04:04.409> I<00:04:04.469> think<00:04:04.500> about<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:05.009> encounter

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
what do I think about the encounter

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.390 
what do I think about the encounter
types<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:06.239> think<00:04:07.109> it's<00:04:07.259> it's<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.680> great<00:04:08.040> addition

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
types I think it's it's a great addition

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.300 
types I think it's it's a great addition
to<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.699> game<00:04:08.969> adds<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.689> bit<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:09.870> variety<00:04:10.310> the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
to the game adds a bit of variety the

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.189 
to the game adds a bit of variety the
only<00:04:11.549> thing<00:04:11.789> that<00:04:11.969> I<00:04:12.000> think<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.479> could<00:04:12.659> harm<00:04:12.930> is

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
only thing that I think it could harm is

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.860 
only thing that I think it could harm is
there<00:04:13.340> you're<00:04:14.340> gonna<00:04:14.579> get<00:04:14.879> probably<00:04:15.389> quite<00:04:15.840> a

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
there you're gonna get probably quite a

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.069 
there you're gonna get probably quite a
lot<00:04:16.259> less<00:04:16.469> experience<00:04:17.159> because<00:04:17.959> after<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
lot less experience because after the

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.039 
lot less experience because after the
about<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:19.409> 50<00:04:19.709> games<00:04:19.949> I've<00:04:20.250> played<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:21.049> figured

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
about the 50 games I've played I figured

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.409 
about the 50 games I've played I figured
out<00:04:22.169> that<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:23.070> games<00:04:23.310> are<00:04:23.460> quicker<00:04:23.760> which<00:04:24.270> is

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
out that the games are quicker which is

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.300 
out that the games are quicker which is
good<00:04:24.659> more<00:04:25.080> action-packed<00:04:25.440> straight<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.219> the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
good more action-packed straight to the

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.070 
good more action-packed straight to the
point<00:04:26.460> less<00:04:26.880> camping

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
point less camping

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.309 
point less camping
however<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:29.250> often<00:04:30.240> find<00:04:30.479> that<00:04:30.689> maybe<00:04:30.960> half

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
however you often find that maybe half

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.100 
however you often find that maybe half
the<00:04:31.349> other<00:04:31.680> team<00:04:31.949> do<00:04:32.159> not<00:04:32.340> die<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:33.150> people's

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
the other team do not die so people's

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.809 
the other team do not die so people's
averages<00:04:34.530> experience<00:04:35.189> are<00:04:35.370> probably<00:04:35.639> going

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
averages experience are probably going

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.589 
averages experience are probably going
to<00:04:35.939> nosedive<00:04:36.650> but<00:04:37.650> that's<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:38.419> region<00:04:39.419> for

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
to nosedive but that's a region for

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.619 
to nosedive but that's a region for
stats<00:04:40.020> whores<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:40.699> their<00:04:41.699> variety<00:04:42.360> that<00:04:42.509> the

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
stats whores and their variety that the

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.390 
stats whores and their variety that the
encounter<00:04:43.139> brings<00:04:43.469> to<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.650> game<00:04:43.860> is<00:04:44.099> is

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
encounter brings to the game is is
