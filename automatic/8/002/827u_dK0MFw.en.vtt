00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.429 
it this is actually a case that I got at
AT&amp;T<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:42.060> girl<00:03:42.269> there<00:03:42.479> had<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.049> her<00:03:43.229> phone

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
AT&amp;T the girl there had one on her phone

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.619 
AT&amp;T the girl there had one on her phone
and<00:03:43.500> she<00:03:43.769> said<00:03:43.979> that<00:03:44.159> it's<00:03:44.400> really<00:03:45.389> good<00:03:45.540> at

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
and she said that it's really good at

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.569 
and she said that it's really good at
protecting<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.229> because<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.979> actually<00:03:47.220> goes

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
protecting it because it actually goes

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.949 
protecting it because it actually goes
all<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.790> way<00:03:47.879> around<00:03:48.239> because<00:03:48.479> she<00:03:48.720> said<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
all the way around because she said the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.119 
all the way around because she said the
front<00:03:49.169> and<00:03:49.379> the<00:03:49.439> back<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:49.919> phone<00:03:50.099> is

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
front and the back of this phone is

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.259 
front and the back of this phone is
glass<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:50.970> it's<00:03:51.419> prone<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.609> break<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:53.909> I<00:03:54.060> did

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
glass so it's prone to break and I did

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.539 
glass so it's prone to break and I did
buy<00:03:54.419> the<00:03:54.479> Apple<00:03:54.720> care<00:03:55.019> as<00:03:55.169> well<00:03:55.349> so<00:03:55.709> hopefully

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
buy the Apple care as well so hopefully

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.559 
buy the Apple care as well so hopefully
nothing<00:03:56.669> will<00:03:56.879> happen<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.150> it

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
nothing will happen to it

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.449 
nothing will happen to it
I'm<00:03:58.199> not<00:03:58.349> really<00:03:58.500> crazy<00:03:58.680> about<00:03:58.919> the<00:03:59.099> case<00:03:59.280> if

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
I'm not really crazy about the case if

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.309 
I'm not really crazy about the case if
you<00:03:59.549> know<00:03:59.699> of<00:03:59.790> any<00:03:59.939> places<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.479> sell<00:04:00.930> two

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319
