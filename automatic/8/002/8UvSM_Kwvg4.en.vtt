00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
in this first video I'm going to go

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:02.899 
in this first video I'm going to go
through<00:00:01.740> printing<00:00:02.220> spreadsheets<00:00:02.730> in

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
through printing spreadsheets in

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.530 
through printing spreadsheets in
Microsoft<00:00:03.360> Excel

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
Microsoft Excel

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.670 
Microsoft Excel
so<00:00:06.540> if<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.720> see<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.080> have<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.290> Microsoft

so if you see that I have a Microsoft

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.410 
so if you see that I have a Microsoft
Excel<00:00:08.069> spreadsheet<00:00:08.099> here<00:00:08.760> with<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.059> range<00:00:09.269> of

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
Excel spreadsheet here with the range of

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.650 
Excel spreadsheet here with the range of
columns<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.110> rows<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:11.330> what<00:00:12.330> normally

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
columns and rows and what normally

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.910 
columns and rows and what normally
happens<00:00:12.719> when<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.139> go<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> print<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
happens when you go to print a

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.550 
happens when you go to print a
spreadsheet<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.000> go<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.150> file<00:00:16.699> print<00:00:18.560> you

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
spreadsheet and you go to file print you

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.200 
spreadsheet and you go to file print you
can<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.220> not<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.699> print<00:00:20.939> all

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
can see that it's not going to print all

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.300 
can see that it's not going to print all
of<00:00:21.359> my<00:00:21.510> columns<00:00:21.900> okay<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.130> heading

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
of my columns okay so it's heading

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.179 
of my columns okay so it's heading
manage<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.670> go<00:00:23.820> from<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.570> midges<00:00:25.080> score<00:00:25.410> go

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
manage to go from a to midges score go

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.160 
manage to go from a to midges score go
to<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> home<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:27.269> actually<00:00:27.660> only<00:00:27.810> going<00:00:27.990> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
to the home it's actually only going to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.380 
to the home it's actually only going to
print<00:00:29.119> these<00:00:30.119> cells<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:31.260> page<00:00:32.149> they<00:00:33.149> might

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
print these cells on one page they might

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.000 
print these cells on one page they might
want<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.050> most<00:00:34.260> people<00:00:34.620> want<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.829> get

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
want that but most people want to get

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.830 
want that but most people want to get
all<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.670> onto<00:00:36.320> one<00:00:37.320> page<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.719> what

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
all of this onto one page and so what

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.790 
all of this onto one page and so what
I'm<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:41.059> in<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> print<00:00:42.420> settings

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
I'm going to do is in the print settings

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.639 
I'm going to do is in the print settings
file<00:00:43.800> print<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.969> always<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.780> two<00:00:46.079> things<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
file print I always do two things to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
file print I always do two things to
start<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.160> first<00:00:47.820> thing<00:00:48.059> I'll<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.329> I'll

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
start with first thing I'll do is I'll

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.360 
start with first thing I'll do is I'll
have<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> look<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.289> spreadsheet<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.039> I

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
have a look at the spreadsheet and I

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.040 
have a look at the spreadsheet and I
think<00:00:50.610> why<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> best<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> print<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
think why is it best to print it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.709 
think why is it best to print it
landscape<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:53.129> portrait<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:54.570> this

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
landscape or portrait and then this

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
landscape or portrait and then this
example<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:55.620> there's<00:00:55.800> more<00:00:55.949> width<00:00:56.219> than

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
example because there's more width than

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.250 
example because there's more width than
hi<00:00:56.730> I'm<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> change<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> page

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
hi I'm going to change the page

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.729 
hi I'm going to change the page
orientation<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:59.460> landscape<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.590> see

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
orientation to landscape you can see

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.200 
orientation to landscape you can see
already<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.129> I've<00:01:02.309> got<00:01:02.520> most<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> data

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
already that I've got most of the data

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.170 
already that I've got most of the data
now<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.769> page<00:01:05.010> however<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:06.030> still

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
now in on one page however it's still

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.960 
now in on one page however it's still
spread<00:01:06.570> across<00:01:06.750> three<00:01:06.840> pages<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.760> click

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
spread across three pages so if I click

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060 
spread across three pages so if I click
on<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.540> simply<00:01:10.439> pointing<00:01:10.740> those<00:01:10.860> two

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
on this is simply pointing those two

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490 
on this is simply pointing those two
values<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> second<00:01:12.299> page<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.290> it's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
values on the second page and it's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.730 
values on the second page and it's
putting<00:01:13.710> those<00:01:13.979> three<00:01:14.280> columns<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> third

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
putting those three columns on the third

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
putting those three columns on the third
so<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> next<00:01:17.040> thing<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.299> go<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
so the next thing that I do is I go to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.550 
so the next thing that I do is I go to
page<00:01:18.840> setup<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:21.150> what<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.990> change<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
page setup and what I do is I change the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.490 
page setup and what I do is I change the
margins<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> lowest<00:01:24.750> possible<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
margins to the lowest possible on the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.249 
margins to the lowest possible on the
left<00:01:25.970> always<00:01:26.970> leave<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.479> bit<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
left always leave a little bit here and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
left always leave a little bit here and
in<00:01:28.979> case<00:01:29.189> you've<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.369> printer<00:01:29.880> settings<00:01:30.270> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
in case you've got printer settings that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.649 
in case you've got printer settings that
poor<00:01:30.659> margin<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.119> always<00:01:33.240> change<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
poor margin on and I always change the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.359 
poor margin on and I always change the
ones<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.960> top<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.350> well<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.340> case

this example it's all actually fit on

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.719 
this example it's all actually fit on
one<00:01:42.960> page<00:01:43.409> 1<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.280> 1

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
one page 1 of 1

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.539 
one page 1 of 1
now<00:01:45.630> that's<00:01:45.840> fine<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
now that's fine for what if you have a

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.050 
now that's fine for what if you have a
page<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.930> range<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.560> columns<00:01:49.799> they<00:01:50.549> extend

page or a range of columns they extend

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.510 
page or a range of columns they extend
outside<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.439> even<00:01:52.710> once<00:01:53.009> I've<00:01:53.189> changed

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
outside that so even once I've changed

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.209 
outside that so even once I've changed
the<00:01:53.610> orientation<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.600> margins<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:56.070> I

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the orientation and the margins if I

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.219 
the orientation and the margins if I
still<00:01:56.520> got<00:01:56.700> columns<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.079> another

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
still got columns going on to another

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.249 
still got columns going on to another
page<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:59.250> what<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> mean<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:00.719> I've<00:02:00.840> got<00:02:00.869> more

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
page is what I mean so if I've got more

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.160 
page is what I mean so if I've got more
columns<00:02:03.710> let's<00:02:04.710> say<00:02:04.920> here<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.659> now<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.899> go<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
columns let's say here and now I go to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.100 
columns let's say here and now I go to
file<00:02:07.469> print<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:09.509> see<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.899> those<00:02:10.080> two

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
file print you see that those two

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.200 
file print you see that those two

hello page orientation and the changing

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.810 
hello page orientation and the changing
margins<00:02:15.050> does<00:02:15.620> not<00:02:15.830> solve<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.220> problem<00:02:16.670> it

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
margins does not solve this problem it

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.780 
margins does not solve this problem it
still<00:02:17.330> spreads<00:02:17.690> across<00:02:17.870> two<00:02:18.290> pages<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:19.550> once

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
still spreads across two pages so once

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.730 
still spreads across two pages so once
I've<00:02:19.970> done<00:02:20.000> those<00:02:20.300> two<00:02:20.540> things<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.350> final

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
I've done those two things the final

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.060 
I've done those two things the final
thing<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:21.980> do<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.370> go<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.670> page<00:02:22.970> setup<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:24.070> then

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
thing I do is go to page setup and then

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.310 
thing I do is go to page setup and then
click<00:02:25.280> on<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.090> page<00:02:26.330> tab<00:02:26.630> here<00:02:26.960> I<00:02:27.110> can

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
click on this on the page tab here I can

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.040 
click on this on the page tab here I can
kind<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.560> fit<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.190> one<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:29.180> it's<00:02:29.360> fitting<00:02:29.720> one

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
kind of fit to one so it's fitting one

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.520 
kind of fit to one so it's fitting one
page<00:02:30.350> wide<00:02:31.340> by<00:02:31.940> one<00:02:32.210> page<00:02:32.480> tall

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
page wide by one page tall

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.710 
page wide by one page tall
so<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.160> will<00:02:34.310> put<00:02:34.610> everything<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.330> one<00:02:35.480> page

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
so this will put everything on one page

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.320 
so this will put everything on one page
and<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.440> will<00:02:36.470> scale<00:02:36.980> all<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.030> spreadsheet

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
and it will scale all of the spreadsheet

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.400 
and it will scale all of the spreadsheet
or<00:02:38.810> all<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.500> cells<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:40.100> want<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.910> print<00:02:41.410> it

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
or all of the cells I want to print it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.270 
or all of the cells I want to print it
to<00:02:42.650> fill<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.830> normal<00:02:43.190> page<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:43.970> press<00:02:44.150> ok<00:02:44.480> you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
to fill a normal page so I press ok you

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.570 
to fill a normal page so I press ok you
can<00:02:46.280> see<00:02:46.460> that<00:02:46.610> it's<00:02:46.760> all<00:02:46.880> film<00:02:47.120> or<00:02:47.360> page<00:02:47.600> there

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
can see that it's all film or page there

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.620 
can see that it's all film or page there
another<00:02:49.580> thing<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.000> might<00:02:50.210> want<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.480> do

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
another thing that I might want to do

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.080 
another thing that I might want to do

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
and then I would press print and it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.940 
and then I would press print and it
would<00:02:53.180> print<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.540> lot<00:02:53.660> more<00:02:53.930> page<00:02:54.170> another

one<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.000> print<00:03:05.270> these<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:08.060> what<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.330> can<00:03:08.420> do<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.840> I

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
one to print these so what I can do is I

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.590 
one to print these so what I can do is I
can<00:03:09.020> select<00:03:09.500> these<00:03:09.680> columns<00:03:10.210> go<00:03:11.210> to<00:03:11.270> page

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
can select these columns go to page

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.840 
can select these columns go to page
layout<00:03:12.370> print<00:03:13.370> area<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.060> set<00:03:14.780> print<00:03:15.170> area

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
layout print area and set print area

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.880 
layout print area and set print area
what<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:17.060> will<00:03:17.240> do<00:03:17.360> if<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.990> go<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.200> file<00:03:18.560> print

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
what that will do if I go to file print

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.560 
what that will do if I go to file print
now<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:20.390> will<00:03:20.510> only<00:03:20.720> print<00:03:21.080> those<00:03:21.350> columns

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
now it will only print those columns

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.700 
now it will only print those columns
okay<00:03:23.570> so<00:03:23.630> that's<00:03:23.900> very<00:03:24.080> useful<00:03:24.290> if<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:24.590> only

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
okay so that's very useful if you only

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.740 
okay so that's very useful if you only
want<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.100> print<00:03:25.310> certain<00:03:25.970> parts<00:03:26.390> on<00:03:26.630> the

want to print certain parts on the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.630 
want to print certain parts on the
