00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
lot on the blog but you know a beige

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.699 
lot on the blog but you know a beige
tile<00:01:47.700> bathroom<00:01:48.209> or<00:01:48.420> beige<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:49.050> white<00:01:49.080> in<00:01:49.560> this

tile bathroom or beige and white in this

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.359 
tile bathroom or beige and white in this
case<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.310> really<00:01:51.149> quite<00:01:51.479> versatile<00:01:52.140> i<00:01:52.380> got

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
case is really quite versatile i got

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.880 
case is really quite versatile i got
these<00:01:53.520> beige<00:01:53.789> tiles<00:01:54.330> at<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.720> time<00:01:54.959> from<00:01:55.679> home

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
these beige tiles at the time from home

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.219 
these beige tiles at the time from home
depot<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:57.330> they<00:01:57.420> were<00:01:57.479> probably<00:01:57.569> made<00:01:58.020> by

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
depot I think they were probably made by

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.949 
depot I think they were probably made by
United<00:01:59.039> States<00:01:59.340> ceramic<00:01:59.940> tile<00:02:00.209> they<00:02:00.899> were

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
United States ceramic tile they were

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.309 
United States ceramic tile they were
about<00:02:01.729> twenty<00:02:02.729> cents<00:02:03.090> each<00:02:03.300> as<00:02:03.539> I<00:02:03.660> recall<00:02:04.050> and

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
about twenty cents each as I recall and

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.440 
about twenty cents each as I recall and
I<00:02:04.709> could<00:02:04.860> take<00:02:05.039> back<00:02:05.069> my<00:02:05.399> extras<00:02:05.819> if<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.090> wanted

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
I could take back my extras if I wanted

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.130 
I could take back my extras if I wanted
I<00:02:10.190> matched<00:02:11.190> them<00:02:11.640> with<00:02:11.880> white<00:02:12.300> bull<00:02:12.540> nose<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
I matched them with white bull nose and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.440 
I matched them with white bull nose and
on<00:02:14.010> my<00:02:14.220> floor<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:15.020> have<00:02:16.020> american<00:02:16.709> olean

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
on my floor I have american olean

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.479 
on my floor I have american olean
pinwheel<00:02:18.450> tile<00:02:18.810> which<00:02:19.380> with<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.010> white<00:02:20.220> dot

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
pinwheel tile which with the white dot

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.080 
pinwheel tile which with the white dot
so<00:02:20.819> this<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.150> very<00:02:21.300> satin<00:02:21.840> finish<00:02:22.640> my<00:02:23.640> tiles

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
so this is a very satin finish my tiles

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.080 
so this is a very satin finish my tiles
are<00:02:24.299> glossing<00:02:24.840> my

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090
