 easy there we are at houses-laffitte at 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.230
 milk so I think everything is 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.849
 said it's very very complicated so go 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.949
 you said it rendezvous on Tuesday at 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.930
 houses-laffitte for this price the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.420
 forest of saint germain on 1200 meters 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.230
 it's a race reserved for horses 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.640
 that we know well 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.079
 unfortunately in this kind of 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.559
 competition there is everything that can 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.210
 happen to you 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.100
 did you bring your ball 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.690
 of crystal we do not have a lot of 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.980
 data in hand because already at the level 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.450
 data from the field it can be 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.940
 easy there are more than they are 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.289
 announced on Monday there are some who will fall 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.239
 rainy now is it okay 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.250
 to be sufficient to evolve the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.750
 field i'm not sure i think that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.980
 the land is going to be good supple wines 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.629
 after there is the eternal question of 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.010
 Laffitte houses a platoon platoon 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.760
 three platoons she platoon will go 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.250
 faster than the other 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.780
 which will happen but actually he 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.290
 must the crystal ball we will try 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.970
 to take her out 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.560
 go we'll get out of it at once 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.700
 your crystal ball in another 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.010
 lucio selection 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.710
 so here what you pay shon leucate 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.820
 myasun the twilight of the gods on the 5th 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.909
 bariz the website the 14 minister of state 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.890
 the 15th gore and the royal prize 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.509
 so we start with sq and where 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.070
 passionate you had placed him at the top of 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 our selection was a brave horse 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.880
 who always answer from there to 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.420
 put it in first position as a 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.490
 solid foundation 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.350
 it's really pink and its light sauce 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.820
 dry is in a euphoric form 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.140
 they almost all get scalded 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.700
 that they have a quintÃ© in a straight line he has 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.860
 still won a quintÃ© recently with 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.299
 quincy key to people that was the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 big note at the event of 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.720
 strasbourg which is an event in 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.280
 which there was a turning before 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.950
 all the races in a straight line was 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.030
 good then certainly he was penalized on 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.229
 the racetrack after two victories over 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.450
 the racecourse of fontainebleau 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.189
 this penalty he will get out 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.290
 it's now more places that 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.610
 takes rather than wins but it's a 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.140
 horse who is capable I think of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.759
 win a second event because 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.729
 this event was a little bit more 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.620
 hollow what he ran before 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.209
 okay let's continue with leucate myasun 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.700
 before we listen to you about it we 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.110
 have a first field info our 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.530
 reporter went to meet 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.819
 christian baillet makes the drops wanted 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.230
 marry or calais he won made of 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.709
 pro groups a and the line is obviously 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.110
 to win 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.209
 it happens that a Quebecois I wanted that 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.470
 pleasure now my choice of words 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:37.060
 I consider that he is well enough 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:38.950
 for him he would be doing that himself the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.019
 earth day there is no graph he has 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.760
 preferred to be according to choice but good 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.450
 you know at the age that he has now 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.500
 the arrival around enjoyed his lease and the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.120
 says he's a good servant 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.620
 the other day he tweaked his 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.170
 preparation second race with conditions 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.760
 there is everything for him it's a horse he 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.170
 is absolutely admirable he's all the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.030
 time on arrival he won several 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.530
 events he won group iii that's 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.980
 the specialist of houses laffitte 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.269
 he has a counter-performance during his 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.099
 last three perfs it was precisely 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.670
 here at houses-laffitte but he had 18 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.500
 by rope 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.390
 so the horse could not do 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.709
 the arrival that day otherwise it's all 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.690
 the time on arrival and something that is 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.430
 funny too, it's almost the only 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.440
 in the case in this case there in this 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.030
 event he ran handicap in two 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.260
 years it means that we really 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.450
 course wisely at this level of 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.620
 competition and at the level of morale this 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.970
 there he was not affected at all 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.739
 beg monitor tells us that 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.030
 is getting older and like us but the horse at 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.769
 level of his morale he's always 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.030
 intact and that's almost a hit 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.530
 sure on arrival at houses-laffitte it 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.829
 is almost always he lives well and in 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.440
 more for our statisticians friends he at 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.449
 77% of success on this course it is 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.919
 really very interesting to place it 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.120
 for me in second place it can 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.500
 even win but he's sons will have the 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.840
 preferably it's the great ones 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.549
 here it is, it is a formidable commune 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.410
 with the twilight of the gods 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.760
 so here too we have a race of 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.739
 reference you'll see it's very 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.389
 speaking we are on April 13 on this 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.220
 course it was sublime to be a little 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.109
 shorter pardon here you go see 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.400
 the circles and he's getting speed on 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.139
 see him it's undeniable he took 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.060
 speed he finds the passage there he comes 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.440
 they are boards at the best of the track 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.720
 we can not express ourselves too much 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.579
 he will end up in the back of the five 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.870
 first there too it was not even this 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.459
 what is the role ans and you'll see at 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.000
 given moment at the arrival post it can 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.579
 not speak 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.870
 the very important data here is that 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.459
 the race we see here go on 1000 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.109
 m and that we are in the process 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.210
 to analyze these over 1200 meters 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.639
 if you add 200 m to the race 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.439
 just 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.729
 here the igen horse maybe the race 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.900
 there is a given note that is very 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.879
 important is that they wear the 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.469
 full blinkers has not had them since a 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.300
 year and a half and the last time he 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:34.099
 had he had won he really 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.110
 a lot of things for him I 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.289
 I have not put it in mind I regret it a 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.990
 little bit already but it's a good base 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.520
 of the race with mia sun good he has the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.960
 poker shot and the two bases behind 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.620
 and the agreement of the pass it is necessary that it 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.449
 is going really well 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.669
 when horse stars who when that's 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.169
 the goal when we targeted the race and 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.099
 saw that he wronged guys there and then saw his 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.659
 race the last time we go ahead and 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.310
 shows with a small rope number 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.930
 to by jenji if we do not have much for 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.969
 go ahead so it's going to be either in 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.259
 head be of hernani matters and after he 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.949
 go all the way at the right time he can 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.439
 maybe even win 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.330
 We hope we continue in the fourth 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.250
 position you have salt that barry 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.150
 it is a horse trained in the provinces that 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.310
 made a good comeback in a 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.020
 handicap less raised than that of the day 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.310
 but formula 1 there are small 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.370
 questions with him he was 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.379
 driven in the past by john damon 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.969
 regularly noted it in 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.189
 events finishing very very fast 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.689
 now he has changed training the 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.159
 back to school excellent but a good level 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.339
 less is a small handicap on 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:33.080
 the Bordeaux racecourse clearly 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.699
 the level of an event now at 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.020
 level of the condition I have some 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.219
 doubts there is a back to school race 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.360
 will be the second return of race 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.339
 still a lot of negative points 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.830
 but at the level of value it's very 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:45.500
 good for a fifth place 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.520
 position we have the 6 3 yves so he 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.930
 did two reentry races this 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.939
 year we feel that it is a subject 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.710
 perfectible and that he finds a 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:53.360
 commitment to point named he has a profile 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.979
 which is a bit similar to twilight 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.509
 eyes it is a horse that has been caught 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.439
 of speed recently on a distance a 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.319
 little bit shorter 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:02.960
 it's very good houses laffitte and this 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:05.750
 to performance that suggests that 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.949
 it's worth a quintÃ© now is that 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.569
 it is for this time where for once 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.020
 after or a little later in 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.539
 the season 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.979
 I do not know how much it is 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.599
 clearly a good chance before you 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.979
 do not know you do not know but 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:16.779
 the coach the threshold and we have a 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.710
 second field info 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:20.270
 our reporter went to the 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.760
 meet the mikan the angles 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.190
 watch the video it's very interesting 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.080
 you have a lot but how much is it removed 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.610
 a word a number to come from horse who 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.590
 holds an advantage to houses laffitte 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.770
 I think there are 200 more games 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.000
 and if we cover a good number 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.320
 he may be at the finish of the quintÃ© in 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.210
 all the cases he proved before because 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.030
 that he has finished yes yes yes well 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.810
 made twice it falls well 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.690
 normally he should find his way 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.430
 in these tests is a matter of 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.669
 field is what it would be no better in 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.770
 soft ground vying weezy so little to 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:54.479
 little his chain report to all the guys 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.470
 this value is a glass of water 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.389
 or later he can win his quintÃ© 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.860
 exactly the ideal for him it would be 14 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:03.780
 100 m but he does not have so you have 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.150
 heard the jailer that strong mouth 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.690
 it is true that they hand the winner 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.940
 potential 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.770
 it means that during the year 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.320
 he's going to type his name 5.5 that's obvious 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.669
 but the 1400 meters of them told Semil 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.600
 warned that a race a little fast 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.210
 will be better than a thousand 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.010
 now will that be enough 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.780
 to finish in the first five on 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.580
 will see me well I believe in it 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.690
 Give us a little crush for 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.979
 this meeting you have a little 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.720
 nugget hanoune then it will be in the 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:30.180
 second test third second 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.190
 handicap test the 807 gentry it's 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.139
 a choice that won a quintÃ© on this 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.490
 precise course that is found well 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:36.660
 placed in focus because compared to 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.580
 his quintÃ© I think there are six or seven 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.810
 pounds less is now that 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.660
 I never think it's necessary to take this 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.830
 horse bay gentry is the 807 the 807 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.720
 here we went around the question 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.310

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.220
