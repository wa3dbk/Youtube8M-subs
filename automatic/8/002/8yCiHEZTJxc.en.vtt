pictures it takes both this and the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.550 
pictures it takes both this and the
iPhone<00:01:05.010> will<00:01:05.189> take<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.900> 720p<00:01:06.900> high-definition

video<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.520> got<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> feeling<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> video<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
video I got a feeling the video and the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.390 
video I got a feeling the video and the
picture<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.590> probably<00:01:10.860> gonna<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.130> better<00:01:11.280> on

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
picture is probably gonna be better on

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.600 
picture is probably gonna be better on
the<00:01:11.520> iPhone<00:01:11.820> 4<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.619> that's<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.770> guess<00:01:14.100> just

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the iPhone 4 that's that's a guess just

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.179 
the iPhone 4 that's that's a guess just
based<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> saw<00:01:15.450> obviously<00:01:15.930> can't<00:01:16.380> say

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
based on what I saw obviously can't say

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.330 
based on what I saw obviously can't say
for<00:01:17.250> sure<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:18.799> both<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.830> them<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.159> going<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
for sure but both of them are going to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.789 
for sure but both of them are going to
do<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> great<00:01:20.670> job<00:01:20.850> either<00:01:21.090> way<00:01:21.799> this

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
do a great job either way this

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.960 
do a great job either way this
definitely<00:01:23.280> doesn't<00:01:23.430> replace<00:01:23.820> my

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
definitely doesn't replace my

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
definitely doesn't replace my
point-and-shoot<00:01:24.630> unfortunately<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.860> an

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
doesn't match up to it but it's a good

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
resolution screen than this but

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.389 
resolution screen than this but
ultimately<00:02:00.990> you're<00:02:01.680> talking<00:02:01.979> about<00:02:02.070> screen

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
ultimately you're talking about screen

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.859 
ultimately you're talking about screen
density<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:02.939> they're<00:02:03.060> real<00:02:03.329> similar<00:02:03.719> they're

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
density and they're real similar they're

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870 
density and they're real similar they're
almost<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.320> same<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:05.250> big<00:02:05.399> difference<00:02:05.729> is

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
almost the same the big difference is

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.639 
almost the same the big difference is

the new iPhone 4 is going to use a

the new iPhone 4 is going to use a
higher<00:02:07.979> quality<00:02:08.690> IPS<00:02:09.690> display<00:02:11.120> side-by-side

higher quality IPS display side-by-side

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
the iPhone 4

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.080 
the iPhone 4
probably<00:02:13.560> look<00:02:13.800> better<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:15.060> I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
probably look better but it's like I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.750 
probably look better but it's like I
mentioned<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:15.600> my<00:02:15.690> first<00:02:15.720> video<00:02:16.760> side-by-side

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
mentioned in my first video side-by-side

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.310 
mentioned in my first video side-by-side
you<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:18.000> tell<00:02:18.330> one<00:02:18.480> from<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.660> other<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:19.140> on

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
you can tell one from the other but on

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.750 
you can tell one from the other but on
their<00:02:19.530> own<00:02:19.560> I'm<00:02:20.280> you're<00:02:20.520> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.700> be

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
their own I'm you're going to be

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.400 
their own I'm you're going to be
satisfied<00:02:21.210> either<00:02:21.390> way<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.840> screen<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.260> this

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
satisfied either way the screen on this

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.950 
satisfied either way the screen on this
looks<00:02:22.680> amazing

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
looks amazing

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.900 
looks amazing
and<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.500> don't<00:02:25.560> think<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.070> screen<00:02:26.430> ultimately

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
and I don't think the screen ultimately

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.570 
and I don't think the screen ultimately
is<00:02:27.030> going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.240> be<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> deciding<00:02:27.930> factor<00:02:28.580> between

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
is going to be a deciding factor between

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.900 
is going to be a deciding factor between
buying<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.240> or<00:02:30.750> buying<00:02:31.380> an<00:02:31.530> iPhone<00:02:31.890> 4<00:02:32.250> I

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
buying this or buying an iPhone 4 I

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.500 
buying this or buying an iPhone 4 I
think<00:02:33.480> they're<00:02:33.750> both<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.140> look<00:02:34.290> good

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
think they're both going to look good

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.270 
think they're both going to look good
build<00:02:36.510> quality<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:37.200> mentioned<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.070> in<00:02:38.220> my

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
build quality I mentioned that in my

build quality I mentioned that in my
first<00:02:38.520> video<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.820> think<00:02:39.060> Apple<00:02:39.180> did<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.510> great

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
first video I think Apple did a great

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.830 
first video I think Apple did a great
job<00:02:39.980> with<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.700> phone<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.300> their<00:02:42.720> other

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.210 
job with with this phone and their other
phones<00:02:43.200> as<00:02:43.380> far<00:02:43.530> as<00:02:43.620> build<00:02:43.800> quality<00:02:44.010> is

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
phones as far as build quality is

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.890 
phones as far as build quality is
concerned<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.180> new<00:02:45.330> phone<00:02:45.570> has<00:02:45.720> got<00:02:45.870> a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
it's built really well but it's

anybody<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.440> can<00:03:43.590> do<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.830> amazing<00:03:44.040> thing

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
anybody you can do this amazing thing

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.830 
anybody you can do this amazing thing
with<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.580> computer<00:03:44.940> but<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.090> gotta<00:03:45.330> set<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.720> up

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
with a computer but you gotta set it up

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.690 
with a computer but you gotta set it up
first<00:03:46.080> even<00:03:46.770> if<00:03:46.890> it's<00:03:47.040> simple<00:03:47.220> they're<00:03:47.550> not

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
first even if it's simple they're not

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.220 
first even if it's simple they're not
gonna<00:03:47.850> want<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.150> do<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.900> think<00:03:49.110> Apple

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
gonna want to do it and I think Apple

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.199 
gonna want to do it and I think Apple
really<00:03:49.590> nailed<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.010> with<00:03:50.190> what<00:03:50.610> building<00:03:51.000> into

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
really nailed it with what building into

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.430 
really nailed it with what building into
the<00:03:51.330> OS<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.720> think<00:03:51.900> people<00:03:52.080> are<00:03:52.170> going<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.350> be

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
the OS I think people are going to be

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.020 
the OS I think people are going to be
much<00:03:52.620> happier<00:03:52.890> with<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:55.790> think<00:03:56.790> they

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
much happier with that and I think they

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.550 
much happier with that and I think they
nailed<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.480> think<00:03:57.720> they're<00:03:58.080> gonna<00:03:58.260> be<00:03:58.350> the

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
nailed it I think they're gonna be the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.890 
nailed it I think they're gonna be the
ones<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.890> really<00:03:59.040> push<00:03:59.370> video<00:04:00.030> chat<00:04:00.330> into<00:04:00.720> the
