00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
target fiber target finder the reason I

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.399 
target fiber target finder the reason I
have<00:01:06.060> full<00:01:06.240> metal<00:01:06.479> jackets<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.290> not

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
have full metal jackets because it's not

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.719 
have full metal jackets because it's not
the<00:01:07.590> strongest<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.070> machine<00:01:08.369> gun<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the strongest that machine gun in the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.330 
the strongest that machine gun in the
whole<00:01:09.049> setup<00:01:10.049> actually<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> most

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
whole setup actually it is the most

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.429 
whole setup actually it is the most
balanced<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.900> actually<00:01:13.049> stronger

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
balanced one but it's actually stronger

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.030 
balanced one but it's actually stronger
than<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> ls<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.520> tee<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.409> stronger

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
than the ls a tee but it is stronger

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.649 
than the ls a tee but it is stronger
than<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> first<00:01:17.460> line<00:01:17.700> machine<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.060> too<00:01:18.210> but

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
than the first line machine on too but

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.140 
than the first line machine on too but
it's<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:18.960> stronger<00:01:19.320> than<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> qbb<00:01:20.040> LSW<00:01:20.150> so

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it's not stronger than the qbb LSW so

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.700 
it's not stronger than the qbb LSW so
that's<00:01:21.330> why<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.600> need<00:01:21.720> full<00:01:22.170> metal<00:01:22.380> jacket<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that's why we need full metal jacket to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.820 
that's why we need full metal jacket to
make<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.670> match<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.380> other<00:01:25.560> one

full<00:01:33.180> metal<00:01:33.390> jackets<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> more<00:01:34.020> power<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
full metal jackets we have more power to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.840 
full metal jackets we have more power to
the<00:01:34.680> weapon<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.549> got<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the weapon and then we got the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
the weapon and then we got the
photographer<00:01:36.450> ender<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> make<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> easier<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
photographer ender to make it easier to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.429 
photographer ender to make it easier to
find<00:01:38.009> targets<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> whole<00:01:39.150> map<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.380> is

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
find targets and the whole map so it is

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.590 
find targets and the whole map so it is
awesome<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.549> has<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> long<00:01:42.030> range<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.509> it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
awesome and it has the long range for it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 
awesome and it has the long range for it
so<00:01:43.049> might<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.380> well<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.130> target

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
so might as well just for the target

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.700 
so might as well just for the target
finder<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.020> pretty<00:01:46.439> strong

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
finder and because it is pretty strong

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.230 
finder and because it is pretty strong
and<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.280> pretty<00:01:47.490> much<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> long

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and it's a pretty much of a long

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
and it's a pretty much of a long
distance<00:01:48.899> weapon<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> wild<00:01:50.070> cards

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
distance weapon and then the wild cards

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.550 
distance weapon and then the wild cards
we<00:01:50.340> got<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.759> perk<00:01:50.970> 1<00:01:51.180> greed<00:01:51.600> which<00:01:52.110> will<00:01:52.380> add

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
we got the perk 1 greed which will add

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
we got the perk 1 greed which will add
us<00:01:52.740> an<00:01:52.920> extra<00:01:53.189> perk<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.700> perkone<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.780> have

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
us an extra perk for perkone gonna have

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.660 
us an extra perk for perkone gonna have
we're<00:01:55.530> gonna<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.950> light<00:01:56.130> weight<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
we're gonna have the light weight in the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
we're gonna have the light weight in the
hardline<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.540> region<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.229> light

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
hardline the region have we have light

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.780 
hardline the region have we have light
weight<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.130> weapon<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.520> kind<00:01:59.700> of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
weight because the weapon is kind of

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.910 
weight because the weapon is kind of
heavy<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.930> move<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.140> lot<00:02:01.380> faster<00:02:01.409> on

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
heavy so we have to move a lot faster on

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.889 
heavy so we have to move a lot faster on
the<00:02:02.009> map<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.700> want<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.840> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the map if you want to like get in a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.120 
the map if you want to like get in a
certain<00:02:04.049> position<00:02:04.229> around<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.740> map<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.100> you

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
certain position around the map that you

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.130 
certain position around the map that you
host<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:06.090> gotta<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.479> there<00:02:06.659> first<00:02:06.719> guy
