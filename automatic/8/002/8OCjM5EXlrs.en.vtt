leave only one remaining which is the
one<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.039> need<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> tuck<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.909> last<00:01:39.149> strand

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
one you now need to tuck the last strand

00:01:39.479 --> 00:02:02.359 
one you now need to tuck the last strand
under<00:01:59.810> now<00:02:00.810> turn<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.229> splice<00:02:01.530> upside<00:02:02.100> down

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
under now turn the splice upside down

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
under now turn the splice upside down
and<00:02:02.729> check<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.090> all<00:02:03.210> legs<00:02:03.539> are<00:02:03.810> equal<00:02:04.319> height

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
and check that all legs are equal height

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.390 
and check that all legs are equal height
and<00:02:04.920> equally<00:02:05.310> spaced

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.010 

we<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.580> now<00:02:11.700> look<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.060> repeat<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.510> process

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
we can now look to repeat the process

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:38.230 
we can now look to repeat the process
remembering<00:02:13.830> over<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.820> under<00:02:15.240> one

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.970 

once<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.390> get<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.600> this<00:02:39.840> stage<00:02:40.140> you're<00:02:40.710> able

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
once you get to this stage you're able

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.890 
once you get to this stage you're able
to<00:02:41.100> tighten<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.610> splice<00:02:41.940> by<00:02:42.300> pulling<00:02:42.780> them

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
to tighten the splice by pulling them

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.780 
to tighten the splice by pulling them
from<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.200> bottom<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:44.280> will<00:02:44.490> visibly

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
from the bottom this will visibly

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:56.399 
from the bottom this will visibly
tighten<00:02:45.600> each<00:02:45.900> strand

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.720 

continue<00:02:57.409> the<00:02:57.530> process<00:02:57.739> another<00:02:58.370> full

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
continue the process another full

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.319 
continue the process another full
rotation<00:02:59.230> following<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.620> over-and-under<00:03:04.329> we

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
rotation following the over-and-under we

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.720 
rotation following the over-and-under we
can<00:03:05.510> now<00:03:05.689> start<00:03:05.749> to<00:03:06.170> tape<00:03:06.499> at<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.739> splice<00:03:07.129> to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
can now start to tape at the splice to

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:17.770 
can now start to tape at the splice to
retain<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.269> strength<00:03:16.420> we're<00:03:17.420> looking<00:03:17.659> to

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
retain the strength we're looking to

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.839 
retain the strength we're looking to
tuck<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.109> first<00:03:18.379> strand<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.459> second

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
tuck the first strand and the second

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.789 
tuck the first strand and the second
strand<00:03:20.120> but<00:03:20.659> then<00:03:20.810> rather<00:03:21.019> than<00:03:21.200> tucking<00:03:21.680> the

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
strand but then rather than tucking the

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.550 
strand but then rather than tucking the
third<00:03:22.069> go<00:03:22.939> back<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.419> first<00:03:23.689> and<00:03:24.109> tuck<00:03:24.349> this

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
third go back to the first and tuck this

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:57.030 
third go back to the first and tuck this
one<00:03:24.769> again

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.980 

at<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.250> point<00:03:58.580> we're<00:03:59.000> ready<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.390> cut<00:03:59.600> off<00:03:59.780> the
