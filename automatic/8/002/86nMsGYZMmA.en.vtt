00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
touching the ground

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.270 
touching the ground
and<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.960> thing<00:00:48.140> to<00:00:48.350> like<00:00:48.560> moves<00:00:48.860> like<00:00:49.070> this

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
and the thing to like moves like this

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.640 
and the thing to like moves like this
especially<00:00:49.700> air<00:00:50.180> time<00:00:50.420> loose<00:00:50.629> there's<00:00:51.470> never

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
especially air time loose there's never

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.380 
especially air time loose there's never
you<00:00:51.770> throw<00:00:51.950> yourself<00:00:52.250> in<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:52.430> air<00:00:52.580> your<00:00:53.120> body

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
you throw yourself in the air your body

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.790 
you throw yourself in the air your body
will<00:00:53.660> go<00:00:53.780> wherever<00:00:53.960> your<00:00:54.200> head<00:00:54.350> directs<00:00:54.650> you

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
will go wherever your head directs you

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.380 
will go wherever your head directs you
so<00:00:55.220> meaning<00:00:55.489> if<00:00:55.580> you<00:00:55.670> look<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:55.970> left<00:00:56.210> and

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
so meaning if you look to the left and

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.049 
so meaning if you look to the left and
you<00:00:56.510> jump<00:00:56.930> you're<00:00:57.170> gonna<00:00:57.290> go<00:00:57.590> left<00:00:57.970> if<00:00:58.970> you

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
you jump you're gonna go left if you

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.160 
you jump you're gonna go left if you
look<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.360> right<00:00:59.510> you're<00:00:59.720> gonna<00:00:59.809> go<00:00:59.989> right

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
look to the right you're gonna go right

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.750 
look to the right you're gonna go right
so<00:01:00.470> this<00:01:00.650> move<00:01:00.860> you<00:01:01.190> want<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.400> go<00:01:01.520> back

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
so this move you want to go back

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.640 
so this move you want to go back
straight<00:01:02.150> you<00:01:02.510> look<00:01:02.720> straight<00:01:03.080> up<00:01:03.260> like<00:01:03.500> that

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
straight you look straight up like that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.609 
straight you look straight up like that
you<00:01:04.010> bring<00:01:04.190> your<00:01:04.309> chest<00:01:04.550> out<00:01:04.760> as<00:01:04.940> well<00:01:05.119> so

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
you bring your chest out as well so

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.109 
you bring your chest out as well so
pretty<00:01:06.619> much<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.250> kind<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.580> momentum<00:01:07.970> move

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
pretty much it's kind of a momentum move

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.420 
pretty much it's kind of a momentum move
meaning<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:08.780> I<00:01:09.020> throw<00:01:09.530> myself<00:01:09.680> this<00:01:10.190> way

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
meaning that I throw myself this way

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.460 
meaning that I throw myself this way
then<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:11.270> use<00:01:11.509> that<00:01:11.720> momentum<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.259> launch

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
then I use that momentum to launch

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.210 
then I use that momentum to launch
myself<00:01:12.680> backwards<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:13.850> it's<00:01:13.970> like<00:01:14.090> one<00:01:14.330> two

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
myself backwards so it's like one two

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.590 
myself backwards so it's like one two
okay<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.250> at<00:01:16.729> first<00:01:16.940> you're<00:01:17.210> gonna<00:01:17.330> keep

okay and at first you're gonna keep

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.030 
okay and at first you're gonna keep
looking<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.080> way<00:01:18.259> you're<00:01:18.500> gonna<00:01:18.590> be<00:01:18.740> scared

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
looking that way you're gonna be scared

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.380 
looking that way you're gonna be scared
you're<00:01:19.220> gonna<00:01:19.310> go<00:01:19.550> to<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.759> slide<00:01:19.970> like<00:01:20.210> it's

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
you're gonna go to the slide like it's

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
you will learn to start going backwards

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.180 
you will learn to start going backwards
perfectly

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190
