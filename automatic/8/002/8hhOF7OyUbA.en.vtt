00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 the family is the first place where the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.360
 puppy of man learns to live with 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.240
 people who did not choose him he learns 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.179
 what it means to be together 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.420
 learn that there is a hierarchy there are 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.480
 the grandparents the parents the children 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.460
 learn that there is a masculine universe is 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
 a feminine universe with its own 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.869
 functions I think the family is that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.960
 place where unlike out in the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.719
 world the sum is not zero ie outside e 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.880
 I win you lose zero sum the family 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.010
 that weird place where if I win 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.809
 you win too, if I'm okay you're fine 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.010
 you too and therefore you are rooting for 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.079
 the other 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 and it is the place where we learn to live 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.059
 all not only children but us too 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.350
 parents learn again how it exists 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.199
 in the world and therefore it is a place 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.829
 affection is fundamental to the world 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.920
 the love between an open man and a woman 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.809
 to life generative are the image of 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.910
 all this the first the most 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.030
 important image or then cascade 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.890
 the whole society basically innervates 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.159
 around this relationship 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.020
 the acceptance of difference 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.170
 man and woman are fundamental 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.619
 one for the other because they are totally 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.450
 not overlapping man must embody 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.240
 the role of the guide but somehow 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.479
 to lead from below is the woman with the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 his acceptance with his submission 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.590
 manages to make the man look up 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.259
 and also in this case a work of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.360
 team in which, however, the roles are never 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.850
 overlapping between the other man and woman 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.740
 do not speak the same language must 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.079
 learn to translate and it takes years 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.210
 to understand that the woman speaks for 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.880
 to express itself the man speaks for 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.740
 communicate concepts and therefore there is a 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.229
 translation work to the work of 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.540
 team and this can be seen very well in the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.460
 towards children because the father must 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.740
 be the one who puts the walls that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.210
 what he says here you have to stop this is the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.130
 reality 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.140
 learn that beyond which you cannot go 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.150
 mother instead the floor is what 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.330
 welcomes the mother teaches life 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:13.140
 the father to die that is to work on 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.230
 self to sacrifice itself to understand that life 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.540
 in short, it is not just total enjoyment 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.520
 breastfeeding as for breastfeeding babies 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.120
 of the mother and here too it is a work of 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.790
 team 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.250
 the return of this anyway 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.220
 good that is generated from a meeting 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.190
 initial then it is beautiful to see how it is 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.740
 develops in history becomes first one 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.740
 mutual donation between spouses or between 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.310
 the man and the woman then becomes one 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.010
 donation to children and then children a 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.590
 in turn it is not excluded that they will donate 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.150
 yourself for the parents by welcoming him back 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:57.330
 at home the family father mother children 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:01.920
 grandparents grandchildren is irreplaceable because not 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:05.330
 there is no other institutional reality or 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:11.040
 non-institutional that can produce 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.860
 social and even cultural human goods 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.900
 politicians like family 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.940
 but no today we don't want any more 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.340
 this we are convinced anthropology 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.420
 who is trying to become dominant 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.390
 also thanks to the ideology of gender e 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.970
 the one who wants the free man free from 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.600
 any link free from any comparison 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.170
 free from any difference where by 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.280
 difference always means 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.130
 discrimination injustice 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.290
 I also heard people who are now 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.840
 to cohabit that say mace took 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.090
 a child is well, no problem 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.130
 so why ande marry madama that 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.799
 serves means that they want to snatch us 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.720
 the most beautiful things we have the name 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.840
 of the father and mother replaced by 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.660
 parent 1 parent 2 and when le 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.810
 families are separated because or divided 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.750
 that this is a drama that makes us suffer 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.450
 parent 3 parent 4 and maybe third 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.670
 parent marriage and five parents 6 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.720
 children cannot be denied this 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.730
 fundamental right of 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.680
 to relate to a father a mother of 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.160
 get to know them what it captures, however, the ga 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.980
 it would not be possible to have a 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.040
 comparison because each of us is a 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.590
 male or female and that's it 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.720
 we must confront the figure of 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.480
 own sex and with the other we can help 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.730
 races you can not get along can 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.190
 run away from home but must have had them 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.990
 because it is a fundamental right 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.870
 like that of the name that's why 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.120
 the gender ideology carries with it more 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.490
 that private choice brings with it 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.220
 the idea that the family does not exist 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.950
 heterosexual dad and mom male e 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.480
 female etc. but there are families 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.770
 that is, of forms like saying the most 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.840
 variables we speak of families 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.650
 rainbow no to give the idea of ​​a 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.780
 mixture also of components for which 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.630
 families can exist and even up 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.560
 with 345 subjects that can be 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.850
 obviously of sexual characteristics 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.430
 completely different 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.260
 tied to all this chaos and the 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.490
 then huge problem and the problem 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.040
 the education of children 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.300
 I think this topic a lot 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.880
 fascinating because each of us 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.280
 before the words freedom in front of the 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.530
 word justice it is clear that it is 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.530
 immediately fascinated but the 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.360
 problem is not justice and freedom 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.210
 here is the problem of going to check 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:46.000
 the reason for these differences 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:48.640
 I am particularly restless when 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.919
 many people start talking about 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:57.910
 family in the plural the family that 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:02.500
 a mother father and grandchildren grandparents 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.960
 and so beyond marriage and says it a 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.729
 great parliament and says it 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.590
 constitution at the base of the family 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.210
 natural today we forget and 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.669
 we are convinced that the family is 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.600
 formed by the mother with her children because 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.760
 this is what comes to us 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.790
 also represented by the TV but the 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.830
 family rests on a bond that is 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.610
 the one between the husband and the wife he is 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:27.520
 as strong as it is fragile and what is the 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.260
 reason why the family is attacked 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.789
 because the family is the place of the 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.550
 relations 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:40.300
 the relationship is the real sore point 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:43.120
 that is the strength of man but 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.669
 it is also the point where this attack occurs 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.000
 is triggering what you mean 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:52.390
 natural family based on marriage 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.810
 Article 29 of the constitution says the 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.570
 republic recognizes the family as 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:02.770
 natural society founded on marriage 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:06.130
 that is, it does not say establishes but recognizes 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:10.599
 that is, takes note of a fact of nature is 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:13.270
 this has simple consequences if there 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:16.870
 family and consequently the 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:19.330
 marriage is an institution of the state 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:23.169
 the state is authorized to modify it 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:25.120
 discipline it but if it is a matter of nature 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:27.550
 of which the state must simply 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.560
 take note 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.080
 no intervention is possible here 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.729
 because the natural family is that 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:38.130
 made up of a man a woman 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:40.150
 I repeat anthropological fact is not changeable 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.660
 through the expression of a 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.660
 parliament
