00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
waterfall in the floating tree thing

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260 
waterfall in the floating tree thing
that<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.409> was<00:01:49.500> talking<00:01:49.650> about<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.120> of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.550 
there alright let's go alright so back
over<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.750> way<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.360> the<00:02:00.360> tree<00:02:00.780> alright

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
over this way we have the tree alright

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.820 
over this way we have the tree alright
so<00:02:01.979> let's<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.400> here<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.780> spawned<00:02:04.229> facing

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
so let's go up here and I spawned facing

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.920 
so let's go up here and I spawned facing
this<00:02:05.070> way<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.400> believe<00:02:05.729> right<00:02:05.970> no<00:02:06.420> no<00:02:06.479> no<00:02:06.630> this

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
this way I believe right no no no this

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.019 
this way I believe right no no no this
way<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.740> way<00:02:07.920> right<00:02:08.099> here<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.609> it<00:02:08.729> should<00:02:08.999> be

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:09.029 
way this way right here so it should be

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.140 
way this way right here so it should be
right<00:02:09.420> behind<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.989> spawn<00:02:10.319> which<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.310> way

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
right behind the spawn which is this way

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.699 
right behind the spawn which is this way
and<00:02:12.300> you'll<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:13.080> you're<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.560> right

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
and you'll know you're going to right

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.350 
and you'll know you're going to right
lane<00:02:13.860> when<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.099> see<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.430> little<00:02:14.670> weird

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
lane when you see this little weird

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.150 
lane when you see this little weird
cliff<00:02:15.750> here<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.019> guess<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.410> really<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> crazy

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
cliff here I guess it really is a crazy

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.490 
cliff here I guess it really is a crazy
cliff<00:02:17.610> if<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.660> know<00:02:18.780> what<00:02:18.900> I'm<00:02:18.989> saying<00:02:19.260> but

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
cliff if you know what I'm saying but

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.960 
cliff if you know what I'm saying but
let's<00:02:19.739> keep<00:02:19.920> going<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:21.230> we'll<00:02:22.230> see<00:02:22.970> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
let's keep going here and we'll see the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.470 
let's keep going here and we'll see the
great<00:02:24.860> floating<00:02:25.860> tree<00:02:26.190> thing<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.879> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
great floating tree thing and the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.220 
great floating tree thing and the
waterfall

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
waterfall

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.259 
waterfall
hopefully<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.890> waterfall<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.459> there<00:02:29.670> you

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
hopefully the waterfall is there you

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.970 
hopefully the waterfall is there you
sometimes<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.810> spawns<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.379> sometimes<00:02:31.799> it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
sometimes it spawns and sometimes it

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.140 
sometimes it spawns and sometimes it
doesn't<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.340> don't<00:02:32.370> know<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.060> off

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
doesn't I don't know it's on and off

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.420 
doesn't I don't know it's on and off
I've<00:02:33.540> seen<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.230> sometimes<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.190> is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
I've seen it and sometimes it just is

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.940 
I've seen it and sometimes it just is
gone<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.260> might<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.590> it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
gone so you might get it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.259 
gone so you might get it
just<00:02:38.220> keep<00:02:38.370> your<00:02:38.489> oh<00:02:38.549> there<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.879> is<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.239> you

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
just keep your oh there it is so you

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.449 
just keep your oh there it is so you
might<00:02:39.540> get<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.840> sometimes<00:02:40.260> last<00:02:40.950> time<00:02:41.129> I<00:02:41.220> tried

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
might get it sometimes last time I tried

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.120 
might get it sometimes last time I tried
to<00:02:41.489> see<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:41.940> didn't<00:02:42.209> really<00:02:42.569> work<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.260> same

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
to see it it didn't really work and same

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.770 
to see it it didn't really work and same
for<00:02:44.160> lava<00:02:44.489> pits<00:02:44.880> sometimes<00:02:45.269> there's<00:02:45.510> lava

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
for lava pits sometimes there's lava

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.979 
for lava pits sometimes there's lava
here<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.549> yes<00:02:47.549> there's<00:02:48.180> lava<00:02:48.510> here<00:02:48.630> right<00:02:48.810> now

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
here and yes there's lava here right now

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.140 
here and yes there's lava here right now
but<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.560> spawn<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.280> there<00:02:50.700> might<00:02:50.940> not<00:02:51.090> be

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
but if you spawn in there might not be

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.569 
but if you spawn in there might not be
water<00:02:51.480> there<00:02:51.599> so<00:02:52.079> it's<00:02:52.560> it's<00:02:52.769> whatever<00:02:52.980> but

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
water there so it's it's whatever but

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.670 
water there so it's it's whatever but
this<00:02:53.730> tree<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.360> here<00:02:54.780> every<00:02:55.049> time<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.260> come<00:02:55.530> in

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
this tree is here every time I come in

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.100 
this tree is here every time I come in
so<00:02:55.860> it's<00:02:56.010> good<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.940> that's<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:57.959> a

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
so it's good but that's it this is a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.869 
so it's good but that's it this is a
huge<00:02:58.260> waterfall<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.430> thought<00:02:59.549> this<00:02:59.730> was

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
huge waterfall I just thought this was

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.690 
huge waterfall I just thought this was
really<00:03:00.120> cool<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:01.470> all<00:03:01.739> than<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.370> tree

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
really cool and all than that is tree

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.789 
really cool and all than that is tree
right<00:03:02.879> here<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.180> floating<00:03:03.450> tree<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.620> on

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
right here this floating tree on the on

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.710 
right here this floating tree on the on
these<00:03:04.950> blocks<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:05.549> just<00:03:05.819> really<00:03:06.060> nice<00:03:06.209> so

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
these blocks here just really nice so

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.750 
these blocks here just really nice so
yeah<00:03:07.379> it's<00:03:07.590> pretty<00:03:07.739> much<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.310> just<00:03:08.370> want<00:03:08.670> to
