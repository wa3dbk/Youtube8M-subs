00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
on Lennox Lewis more than what is in our

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.219 
on Lennox Lewis more than what is in our
five<00:01:49.259> six<00:01:49.799> seven<00:01:50.040> eight<00:01:50.460> years<00:01:51.180> ago<00:01:51.360> maybe<00:01:51.899> ten

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
five six seven eight years ago maybe ten

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.160 
five six seven eight years ago maybe ten
ten<00:01:52.860> years<00:01:53.100> ago<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.149> does<00:01:54.600> he<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.840> chance

ten years ago so does he have a chance

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.950 
ten years ago so does he have a chance
in<00:01:55.409> reality<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.040> don't<00:01:56.399> think<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:57.149> he<00:01:57.600> does

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
in reality I don't think so if he does

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.179 
in reality I don't think so if he does
it'll<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.290> one<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> biggest<00:01:58.680> upsets<00:01:59.189> in

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
it'll be one of the biggest upsets in
