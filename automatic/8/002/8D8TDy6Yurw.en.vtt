00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:15.010
 in remote times dominated by the 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:21.240
 witchcraft where terror reigns a 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:25.510
 legend tells the story of a stranger 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.990
 which was reduced to slavery but 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.990
 freed 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.510
 to fight evil 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.160
 where did you learn to fight like that 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.480
 with the demons 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.720
 why did you come to get me 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.150
 a bewitched army has reduced our 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.630
 enslaved population 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:01.980
 the mountains of corpses and the rivers 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:05.840
 of blood can not stop me 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.840
 we need you 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:14.270
 whatever happens whatever you see 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.270
 we will not be able to go back 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.340
 their aromas and innumerable 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.340
 we are 47 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.729
 it's time to finish 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.930
 I'm not afraid of you, you should 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.930
 However 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.200
 come on
