00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.380

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:11.120
 I was told by van Ohlen 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.680
 you read it sustainably 90 or else there 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.810
 I've been in Chile for a long time 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.700
 Today, no reaction is welcome 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.340
 nothing happens because you are you looking at 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.190
 not at all 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.270
 the little points have to be all 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.780
 romped fast lived 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.270
 That is a skill that took place at 90 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.970
 take Klink top uses for it have 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.940
 it human because I have to go car which 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.000
 etiquette ketterer human being is 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.590
 Everything is not true how long we have been 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.110
 need that is not true 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.890
 now you are looking for the gears custom match 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.190
 This rums to what you the car 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.250
 on 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.720
 here you want to see that the cart does not matter 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.580
 whether man all the fourth gear and that 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.330

 right and we do not have to slow down 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.100
 if you want to turn you have to 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.160
 decide 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.170

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.670
 driver's license we wanted each other 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.330

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.970

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.690
 you can not be there because no 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.690
 understanding more left turn 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.670
 what the car has to suffer in one already 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.560
 the right thousands of damage to that 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.260
 car and eat 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.989
 Look at your archive again 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.080
 back in fashion I probably have 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.910
 a dickfelligkeit of 3000 on and 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.040
 In it driver's license I will Monday to the 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.720
 you can get away on it 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.610
 and I'll make your name there in the world 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.350
 and not suitable for cooling one 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.840
 motor vehicle and he will become the 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.870
 papers decided again 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.750
 that's not how it goes 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.850
 I would not be two years old but car 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.510
 want to drive so much that has fallen in love with you 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.979
 I have not experienced 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.470
 I'm talking about the road traffic to 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.080
 circuit yawning with bus driving of the driver 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.510
 which prohibits wanted to enter 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.740
 out you did not understand anything and 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.300
 such people may be allowed on the street 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.650
 You do not want to leave this with the car 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.610
 is and not normal behavior that is 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.990
 but morbidly that's yes yes yes 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.639
 human children like you the thing there 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.210
 in the beginning really and soul this 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:02.680
 speak 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:04.900
 it pats 1000 times 1000 mark always others 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.030
 are to blame that is very strange if 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.620
 I hold on to this that's what 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.160
 is to stick here with one 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.510
 fingerprint that's what you bring to it 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.850
 that's the pathological one 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.340
 my kindness clogged the whole species 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:22.720
 power and turn and break the puke 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.210
 another people property around than when 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.699
 But that's a shit 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.389
 Do not worry me which millimeter 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.800
 that belongs to how or what you have to 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.810
 break everything 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.820
 not everything is not yours 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.370
 shit doberan the sole property 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.289
 how does shit talk? 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.870
 push jumping destroying everything 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:48.099
 Bistro strictly but driving a car we are happy 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:51.130
 On the left you may be interested in all that 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:54.300
 everything is not normal is not easy 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:57.010
 pass right before left or go too 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.620
 monika huber's vocal color stands in the way of 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.450
 behave at red bulls 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.470
 readiness to brake prevails in the 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.370
 classic readiness to brake me that 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.410
 Take away gas 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.400
 for me means to brake on the book 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.229
 is on the brake 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.950
 I'm not stupid, I'm not 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.690
 brake but as you slow down German 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.610
 namely sick is not sick 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.680
 yes later to prevent 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.169
 the red wines falls down from the sky and 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.720
 You do not even see one when you first 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:26.590
 not understood at all and we on it 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.210
 and without the shield to drive without 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.249
 the bike broke 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.389
 you drive me a parking lot 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:34.389
 torments the car
