00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
thrifting 1499 and see capacity it has

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:11.830 
thrifting 1499 and see capacity it has
500<00:01:03.469> gigabytes<00:01:03.890> of<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:05.420> Sony<00:01:08.920> for<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:11.270> imac

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
500 gigabytes of the Sony for the imac

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.270 
500 gigabytes of the Sony for the imac
it<00:01:12.140> comes<00:01:12.799> standard<00:01:13.549> with<00:01:13.870> 640<00:01:14.870> so<00:01:15.440> 140<00:01:15.979> more

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
it comes standard with 640 so 140 more

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.120 
it comes standard with 640 so 140 more
then<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:16.790> can<00:01:16.940> add<00:01:17.150> up<00:01:17.390> on<00:01:17.600> dollars<00:01:18.380> for<00:01:19.100> one

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
then you can add up on dollars for one

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:29.710 
then you can add up on dollars for one
terabyte<00:01:23.590> then<00:01:24.880> let's<00:01:25.880> see<00:01:28.180> speed<00:01:29.180> that's

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
terabyte then let's see speed that's

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.030 
terabyte then let's see speed that's
pretty<00:01:29.960> much<00:01:30.170> all<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.500> same<00:01:30.530> in<00:01:30.890> all

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
pretty much all the same in all

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.719 
pretty much all the same in all
computer's<00:01:33.670> processor<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.560> two<00:01:37.250> point

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
computer's processor it is a two point

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.500 
computer's processor it is a two point
eight<00:01:38.439> core<00:01:39.439> 2<00:01:39.740> duo<00:01:41.380> this<00:01:42.380> one<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:42.950> believe<00:01:43.510> will

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
eight core 2 duo this one I believe will

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.740 
eight core 2 duo this one I believe will
go<00:01:44.689> back<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:49.030> 2.66<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.509> sony

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
go back so this is a 2.66 so the sony

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.020 
go back so this is a 2.66 so the sony
veo<00:01:51.080> has<00:01:51.939> advantage<00:01:52.939> right<00:01:53.180> there<00:01:53.540> a<00:01:53.979> faster

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
veo has advantage right there a faster

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.440 
veo has advantage right there a faster
processor<00:01:56.979> just<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.220> just<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.759> small<00:01:59.030> advantage

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
processor just a just a small advantage

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.469 
processor just a just a small advantage
but<00:01:59.630> still<00:01:59.689> a<00:02:00.310> advantage<00:02:03.310> let's<00:02:04.310> see<00:02:04.579> display

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
but still a advantage let's see display

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.089 
but still a advantage let's see display
is<00:02:05.869> resolution<00:02:06.579> 1680<00:02:07.579> x<00:02:07.820> 1050<00:02:08.530> 20<00:02:09.530> inches<00:02:09.979> okay

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
is resolution 1680 x 1050 20 inches okay

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.449 
is resolution 1680 x 1050 20 inches okay
the<00:02:13.099> app<00:02:13.459> will<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.880> know<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.239> doesn't<00:02:14.540> say<00:02:14.720> it

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
the app will you know it doesn't say it

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.380 
the app will you know it doesn't say it
is<00:02:16.459> a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
is a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.440 
is a
it<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.500> full<00:02:18.860> 1080<00:02:19.430> i'm<00:02:19.700> pretty<00:02:20.150> sure

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
it is full 1080 i'm pretty sure

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.559 
it is full 1080 i'm pretty sure
somebody's<00:02:21.380> probably<00:02:21.620> i<00:02:21.890> say<00:02:22.100> it's<00:02:22.250> not<00:02:22.569> but

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
somebody's probably i say it's not but

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.160 
somebody's probably i say it's not but
i'm<00:02:23.840> pretty<00:02:24.020> sure<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.590> full<00:02:24.920> 19<00:02:25.750> by<00:02:26.750> 12

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
i'm pretty sure it's the full 19 by 12

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.850 
i'm pretty sure it's the full 19 by 12
and<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:29.750> has<00:02:29.959> 24<00:02:30.620> inches<00:02:31.240> so<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:33.050> imac<00:02:33.470> does

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
and it has 24 inches so the imac does

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.330 
and it has 24 inches so the imac does
have<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.340> better<00:02:35.890> better<00:02:36.890> screen<00:02:37.370> resolution

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
have the better better screen resolution

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.720 
have the better better screen resolution
ask<00:02:40.780> for<00:02:41.780> graphics<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:42.920> got<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.250> new<00:02:43.370> vidya

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
have graphics cards right let's go back

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.380 
have graphics cards right let's go back
we<00:03:02.690> have<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:04.150> 9400<00:03:05.150> m<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.830> it's<00:03:07.070> just<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.519> next

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
we have the 9400 m so it's just the next

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.080 
we have the 9400 m so it's just the next
level<00:03:08.720> up<00:03:08.930> not<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:10.130> big<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.430> different<00:03:10.940> but

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
level up not that big of different but

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.910 
level up not that big of different but
it<00:03:11.360> is<00:03:11.570> different<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> slightly

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
it is different so it is a slightly

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:21.490 
it is different so it is a slightly
better<00:03:13.190> graphics<00:03:13.790> card<00:03:18.130> memory<00:03:19.300> now<00:03:20.300> this<00:03:20.959> is

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
better graphics card memory now this is

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.530 
better graphics card memory now this is
important<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.610> everybody<00:03:23.000> says<00:03:23.239> is

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
important and that I everybody says is

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.680 
important and that I everybody says is
not<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.049> important<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:26.180> comes<00:03:26.570> with

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
not so important but this comes with

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:35.080 
not so important but this comes with

not<00:03:43.459> going<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.670> be<00:03:43.730> using<00:03:43.910> until<00:03:44.600> you're<00:03:44.780> using

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
not going to be using until you're using

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.670 
not going to be using until you're using
other<00:03:45.709> stuff<00:03:46.220> but<00:03:46.549> uh<00:03:46.989> so<00:03:47.989> basically<00:03:48.410> they

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
other stuff but uh so basically they

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.850 
other stuff but uh so basically they
have<00:03:49.630> they<00:03:50.630> both<00:03:50.840> have<00:03:50.989> four<00:03:51.200> gigs<00:03:51.440> but<00:03:51.620> this

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
have they both have four gigs but this

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.370 
have they both have four gigs but this
has<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.810> speed<00:03:55.329> is<00:03:57.130> 1066<00:03:58.720> compared<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.810> 800

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
has a the speed is 1066 compared to 800

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.880 
has a the speed is 1066 compared to 800
so<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.890> is<00:04:01.040> going<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.400> be<00:04:01.430> faster<00:04:02.350> so<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.530> imac

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
so it is going to be faster so the imac

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.890 
so it is going to be faster so the imac
does<00:04:04.310> one<00:04:04.579> on<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.940> part<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:08.480> far<00:04:08.690> they

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
does one on that part so so far they

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.560 
does one on that part so so far they
both<00:04:09.590> computers<00:04:09.910> roughly<00:04:10.910> have<00:04:11.060> around<00:04:11.420> the

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
both computers roughly have around the

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.050 
both computers roughly have around the
same<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:12.549> hard<00:04:13.549> drive<00:04:13.760> space<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.920> sony<00:04:16.729> one

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
same a hard drive space the sony one

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.529 
same a hard drive space the sony one
does<00:04:17.720> have<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:19.419> faster<00:04:20.419> processor<00:04:22.450> around<00:04:23.450> the

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
does have a faster processor around the

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.740 
does have a faster processor around the
same<00:04:23.780> graphics<00:04:24.260> card<00:04:25.060> but<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.210> imac<00:04:26.539> has

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
same graphics card but the imac has

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.039 
same graphics card but the imac has
better<00:04:27.050> resolution<00:04:27.440> and
