00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.070
 Of course, the difficult question is still 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.230
 guy will get the engine to 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.290
 turn a pulley this policy is made 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.220
 in a brain, he wants to know that by 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.450
 wep security at lower speed line 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.190
 Elections must take the details do not 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.380
 there are two types of associations of these 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.119
 plan this kind of association of 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.360
 axes are different and this type of 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.770
 association that is precisely axis 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.200
 different in the speed here 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.610
 belt is single speed near is the 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.040
 same in both cases 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.260
 not here when clothing strolls 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.610
 is the same angular velocity 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.770
 this means that this type of connection 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.770
 here it has the same angular velocity 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.570
 same frequency then we are already 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.630
 start eliminating the repair 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.489
 aas fiscal year three rounds 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.489
 after three are arrested in the same month 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.410
 must have the same 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.090
 frequency and same angular velocity 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.980
 while that connection of a taster 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.679
 chosen for 3 here has to have the 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.270
 same linear velocity 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:10.939
 if you're going to have to analyze this type 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.639
 connection with this type of connection in 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.340
 What is it that will be best for you? 

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:18.200
 one the tape with the smaller one is seriously tape 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.539
 with lower speed dna 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.069
 if you get eliminated through it here 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.619
 Do you think of an answer for example? 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:27.859
 Let's go the other way, even in the letter he 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.499
 speak thus the choices 2 and 3 nÃ© 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.869
 in this type of connection to choices 2 and 3 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:35.060
 already with different real speed and 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.759
 will have bigger ray have the smaller 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.349
 often already fury that their homes have 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.380
 same frequency 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:47.479
 the letter is the letter refers to p2 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.429
 speed is different is not with two 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.469
 especially in the speed of air already 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:56.299
 stuck in the letter early even though 23 with 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.149
 different frequency can not in 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:05.349
 oblige the same frequency as this type 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:08.349
 3g connection not frequently 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.349
 language 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.970
 So Sergio made different 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.980
 speeds the dubbing front frequently 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.769
 do with that deletion could 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.530
 arrive at the answer that the letter is this 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.290
 connection is less because things 13 do not 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.170
 with map speed which more points 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.200
 to this point of faith and to create 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.849
 higher low cost will generate less discrete 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.159
 but if you run here it was even climbing 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.909
 a new scale of fewer turns and more 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.370
 laps, do not you? 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.140
 So with every turn I got - back 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.450
 on the other side of the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.220
 lower frequency and little year tape 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.220
 slower it will still come
