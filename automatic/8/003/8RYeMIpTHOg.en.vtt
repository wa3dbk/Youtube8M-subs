little clip here that surfing gear you

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.130 
little clip here that surfing gear you
can<00:03:46.070> just<00:03:47.380> unclip<00:03:48.380> this<00:03:48.530> clip<00:03:48.830> here<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.840> then

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
can just unclip this clip here and then

what you do is there's two these two
pipes<00:03:57.800> here<00:03:58.130> when<00:03:58.670> these<00:03:58.790> are<00:03:59.030> drainage<00:03:59.510> fuel

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
pipes here when these are drainage fuel

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.920 
pipes here when these are drainage fuel
drain<00:04:00.680> little<00:04:01.670> pipes<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:03.560> just<00:04:03.920> lead<00:04:04.520> to

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
drain little pipes that just lead to

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.020 
drain little pipes that just lead to
