00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
really multi-dimensional so that's

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.830 
really multi-dimensional so that's
constructivist<00:02:56.250> on<00:02:56.459> my<00:02:56.580> middle<00:02:56.790> finger<00:02:56.880> and

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
dark so if you're doing a smoky eye then

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.180 
dark so if you're doing a smoky eye then
you<00:03:09.390> want<00:03:09.660> sort<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.050> brown<00:03:10.350> tone<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:11.010> one's

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
multi-dimensional so for me they're

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.450 
multi-dimensional so for me they're
worth<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.860> investment

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460
