future<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.410> think<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.549> know<00:02:33.640> growing<00:02:34.000> fish

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
future I think and you know growing fish

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.750 
future I think and you know growing fish
is<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.540> we're<00:02:34.660> farmers<00:02:35.079> we're<00:02:35.620> not<00:02:35.769> we're

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
is that we're farmers we're not we're

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.850 
is that we're farmers we're not we're
not<00:02:36.790> as<00:02:37.090> much<00:02:37.239> fishermen<00:02:37.780> as<00:02:37.930> somebody<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:38.799> a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
not as much fishermen as somebody in a

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.590 
not as much fishermen as somebody in a
boat<00:02:39.040> would<00:02:39.190> be<00:02:39.370> but<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:39.970> know<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.120> our<00:02:40.329> crop

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
boat would be but you know to our crop

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.660 
boat would be but you know to our crop
is<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:41.079> fish<00:02:42.720> at<00:02:43.720> first<00:02:44.350> these<00:02:44.769> salmon<00:02:45.280> farms

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
is is fish at first these salmon farms

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.690 
is is fish at first these salmon farms
seemed<00:02:46.239> like<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> good<00:02:46.720> idea<00:02:47.100> more<00:02:48.100> fish<00:02:48.370> for

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
seemed like a good idea more fish for

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.880 
seemed like a good idea more fish for
people<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.150> eat<00:02:49.359> and<00:02:49.630> less<00:02:49.840> pressure<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.350> wild

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
people to eat and less pressure on wild

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.670 
people to eat and less pressure on wild
fish<00:02:51.359> but<00:02:52.359> the<00:02:52.510> farms<00:02:52.870> themselves<00:02:53.530> have

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
fish but the farms themselves have

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.890 
fish but the farms themselves have
become<00:02:53.829> a<00:02:54.220> new<00:02:54.400> threat<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.060> survival<00:02:55.269> of

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
become a new threat to the survival of
