00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
session to Barkley predicting it to be a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.729 
session to Barkley predicting it to be a
defense<00:03:50.160> um<00:03:50.480> offensive<00:03:51.480> set<00:03:51.930> or<00:03:52.079> defenses

that<00:03:52.769> but<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.220> has<00:03:53.400> actually<00:03:54.060> has<00:03:54.180> yer<00:03:54.359> Akane

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
that but it has actually has yer Akane

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.839 
that but it has actually has yer Akane
which<00:03:55.109> I<00:03:55.169> was<00:03:55.319> like<00:03:55.470> whoa<00:03:55.799> that's<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.639> pretty

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
which I was like whoa that's a pretty

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.030 
which I was like whoa that's a pretty
useful<00:03:57.450> move<00:03:57.870> because<00:03:58.169> since<00:03:58.440> this<00:03:58.680> thing<00:03:58.739> is

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
useful move because since this thing is
