float a little bit and let these expand
I'm<00:01:18.090> gonna<00:01:18.299> expand<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:20.070> I'll

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
of times I over seed my cells when I use

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.490 
of times I over seed my cells when I use
these<00:03:22.820> seeds<00:03:23.209> out<00:03:23.420> here<00:03:23.810> because<00:03:24.140> there's<00:03:24.440> a

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
these seeds out here because there's a

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.020 
these seeds out here because there's a
lot<00:03:24.530> more<00:03:24.829> room<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.519> do<00:03:25.670> more<00:03:25.850> with

them<00:03:27.010> with<00:03:28.010> these<00:03:28.220> peat<00:03:28.610> pellets<00:03:28.760> I'm<00:03:29.090> gonna

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
them with these peat pellets I'm gonna

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.729 
them with these peat pellets I'm gonna
take<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.959> clump<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.440> three<00:03:30.769> seeds<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:32.739> drop

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
take a clump of three seeds and drop

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.920 
take a clump of three seeds and drop
them<00:03:34.209> into<00:03:35.209> each<00:03:35.390> hole

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
them into each hole

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.479 
them into each hole
you're<00:03:36.350> not<00:03:36.530> going<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.739> divide<00:03:37.070> these<00:03:37.250> it's

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
you're not going to divide these it's

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.960 
you're not going to divide these it's
fine<00:03:37.760> if<00:03:37.970> all<00:03:38.090> three<00:03:38.329> plants<00:03:38.600> come<00:03:38.900> up<00:03:39.940> basil

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
fine if all three plants come up basil

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.840 
fine if all three plants come up basil
loves<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.870> one<00:03:42.049> weather<00:03:42.290> loves<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:42.980> water<00:03:43.220> if

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
loves the one weather loves the water if

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.850 
loves the one weather loves the water if
there's<00:03:44.150> three<00:03:44.450> plants<00:03:44.750> in<00:03:44.959> one<00:03:45.140> space<00:03:45.470> and

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
there's three plants in one space and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.920 
there's three plants in one space and
you're<00:03:46.040> taking<00:03:46.430> care<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.820> all<00:03:47.000> of<00:03:47.630> them<00:03:47.750> are

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
you're taking care of it all of them are

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.539 
you're taking care of it all of them are
gonna<00:03:48.049> grow<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:51.940> then<00:03:52.940> once<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:55.220> put<00:03:55.250> the

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
gonna grow and then once you put the

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.370 
gonna grow and then once you put the
seeds<00:03:55.850> right<00:03:55.970> into<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.450> cut<00:03:56.660> hole<00:03:56.840> you're

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
seeds right into the cut hole you're

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.460 
seeds right into the cut hole you're
gonna<00:03:57.500> have<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:58.690> mix<00:03:59.690> them<00:03:59.900> in<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.079> little<00:04:00.290> bit

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
gonna have to mix them in a little bit

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.250 
gonna have to mix them in a little bit
it's<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:00.920> little<00:04:01.190> bit<00:04:01.310> challenging<00:04:02.019> but<00:04:03.019> just

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
it's a little bit challenging but just

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.750 
it's a little bit challenging but just
mix<00:04:03.470> them<00:04:03.560> around<00:04:03.709> you're<00:04:04.130> also<00:04:04.370> putting<00:04:04.670> in

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
mix them around you're also putting in

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.360 
mix them around you're also putting in
three<00:04:05.030> seeds<00:04:05.360> for<00:04:05.930> some<00:04:06.140> reason<00:04:06.500> if<00:04:06.680> one<00:04:07.070> falls

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
three seeds for some reason if one falls

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.670 
three seeds for some reason if one falls
out<00:04:07.610> or<00:04:07.640> only<00:04:08.390> one<00:04:08.690> gets<00:04:08.930> buried<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.410> still

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
out or only one gets buried you still

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.940 
out or only one gets buried you still
get<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:09.859> plan<00:04:10.130> here<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:12.290> you're<00:04:12.560> mixing<00:04:12.859> a

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
get a plan here and you're mixing a

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.400 
get a plan here and you're mixing a
quarter<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.340> an<00:04:13.430> inch<00:04:13.930> but<00:04:14.930> I'm<00:04:15.049> really<00:04:15.260> just

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
quarter of an inch but I'm really just

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.250 
quarter of an inch but I'm really just
kind<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.799> scooping<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.750> hoping<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:18.049> press

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
kind of scooping it and hoping to press

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.680 
kind of scooping it and hoping to press
the<00:04:18.440> seeds<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.890> then<00:04:19.010> with<00:04:19.220> your<00:04:19.370> thumb<00:04:19.690> press

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
the seeds and then with your thumb press

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.480 
the seeds and then with your thumb press
it<00:04:20.870> down<00:04:20.989> press<00:04:21.349> them<00:04:21.560> in

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.070 

and<00:04:26.490> that's<00:04:26.790> how<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.270> would<00:04:27.540> use<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.840> peat

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
and that's how I would use the peat

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.010 
and that's how I would use the peat
pellets<00:04:29.030> there's<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.120> little<00:04:30.360> bit<00:04:30.480> water<00:04:30.750> left

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
pellets there's a little bit water left

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.150 
pellets there's a little bit water left
that's<00:04:31.380> fine<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:33.120> don't<00:04:33.150> want<00:04:33.480> water<00:04:34.160> excess

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
that's fine you don't want water excess

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.830 
that's fine you don't want water excess
water<00:04:35.430> in<00:04:35.670> here<00:04:35.820> so<00:04:35.970> whenever<00:04:36.150> these<00:04:36.480> start

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
water in here so whenever these start

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.390 
water in here so whenever these start
looking<00:04:37.110> like<00:04:37.140> they're<00:04:37.440> drying<00:04:37.710> out<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.280> they

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
looking like they're drying out and they

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.220 
looking like they're drying out and they
will<00:04:38.550> turn<00:04:38.700> light<00:04:38.940> brown<00:04:39.150> on<00:04:39.180> top<00:04:39.330> add<00:04:39.900> some

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
will turn light brown on top add some

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.080 
will turn light brown on top add some
water<00:04:40.440> let<00:04:41.340> them<00:04:41.490> absorb<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.000> water

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
water let them absorb the water

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.910 
water let them absorb the water
whatever's<00:04:42.600> left<00:04:42.810> after<00:04:42.930> 20<00:04:43.410> minutes<00:04:43.560> go

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
whatever's left after 20 minutes go

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.310 
whatever's left after 20 minutes go
ahead<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.340> drain<00:04:44.580> it<00:04:44.760> out<00:04:44.880> they<00:04:45.720> also<00:04:45.930> come

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
ahead and drain it out they also come

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.380 
ahead and drain it out they also come
with<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.500> dome<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.550> idea<00:04:47.940> with<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.180> dome

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
with a dome and the idea with the dome

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.630 
with a dome and the idea with the dome
so<00:04:49.140> originally<00:04:49.560> just<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.890> keep<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.220> moisture

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
so originally just to keep the moisture

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.580 
so originally just to keep the moisture
in<00:04:50.670> but<00:04:51.300> I<00:04:51.330> found<00:04:51.660> over<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:51.990> years<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.440> when

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
in but I found over the years that when

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.800 
in but I found over the years that when
you<00:04:52.680> put<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:52.890> dome<00:04:53.130> on<00:04:53.310> top<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.700> something<00:04:54.090> you

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
you put a dome on top of something you

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.720 
you put a dome on top of something you
create<00:04:55.200> a<00:04:55.230> great<00:04:55.560> environment<00:04:56.070> for<00:04:56.160> fungus<00:04:56.610> to

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
create a great environment for fungus to

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.670 
create a great environment for fungus to
grow<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.090> just<00:04:57.270> recommend<00:04:57.720> don't<00:04:58.230> use<00:04:58.560> the

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
grow and I just recommend don't use the

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.980 
grow and I just recommend don't use the
dome<00:04:58.860> in<00:04:59.220> fact<00:04:59.580> I<00:04:59.850> use<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.300> domes<00:05:00.510> is<00:05:00.720> another

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
dome in fact I use the domes is another

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.850 
dome in fact I use the domes is another
planting<00:05:01.470> area<00:05:01.800> for<00:05:02.430> like<00:05:03.440> here's<00:05:04.440> some<00:05:04.500> seed

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
planting area for like here's some seed

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.720 
planting area for like here's some seed
cells<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:06.560> would<00:05:07.560> just<00:05:07.680> drop<00:05:07.950> them<00:05:08.430> in<00:05:08.460> there

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
cells I would just drop them in there

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.190 
cells I would just drop them in there
fill<00:05:09.030> this<00:05:09.120> with<00:05:09.300> water<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.780> I<00:05:09.840> have<00:05:09.960> another

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
fill this with water and I have another

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.970 
fill this with water and I have another
tray<00:05:10.980> to<00:05:11.850> start<00:05:12.120> seeds<00:05:12.419> in<00:05:12.630> I'll<00:05:13.590> do<00:05:13.800> other

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
tray to start seeds in I'll do other

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.680 
tray to start seeds in I'll do other
videos<00:05:14.070> that<00:05:14.640> show<00:05:14.880> you<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.150> growth<00:05:15.360> of<00:05:15.390> these

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
videos that show you the growth of these

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.450 
videos that show you the growth of these
how<00:05:15.960> to<00:05:16.020> transplant<00:05:16.440> them<00:05:16.800> how<00:05:16.950> to<00:05:16.980> take<00:05:17.250> care

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
how to transplant them how to take care

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.340 
how to transplant them how to take care
of<00:05:17.550> them<00:05:17.640> but<00:05:18.180> this<00:05:18.300> is<00:05:18.360> how<00:05:18.600> you<00:05:18.630> seed<00:05:19.020> start

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
of them but this is how you seed start

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.280 
of them but this is how you seed start
them<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.650> again<00:05:19.980> remember<00:05:20.940> you<00:05:21.480> can<00:05:21.510> buy<00:05:21.840> lots

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
them and again remember you can buy lots
