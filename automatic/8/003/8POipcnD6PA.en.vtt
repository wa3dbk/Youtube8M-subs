00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
cast iron it can cause water rings in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.540 
cast iron it can cause water rings in
the<00:00:42.090> cast<00:00:42.330> iron<00:00:42.540> very<00:00:42.900> quickly<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:44.400> your

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
benefit we're going to let that sit

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.900 
benefit we're going to let that sit
there<00:00:46.320> we're<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.800> watch<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.250> clock<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
there we're going to watch the clock and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.610 
there we're going to watch the clock and
we're<00:00:48.330> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.020> water<00:00:49.290> ring

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we're going to have this water ring

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.140 
we're going to have this water ring
developed<00:00:50.040> so<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.400> see<00:00:50.580> what<00:00:50.880> can<00:00:51.090> happen

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
developed so you can see what can happen

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.760 
developed so you can see what can happen
here<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.990> then<00:00:52.140> we'll<00:00:52.260> talk<00:00:52.380> a<00:00:52.440> little<00:00:52.620> bit

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
about taking care of that so you can get

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.510 
about taking care of that so you can get
what<00:00:54.660> rid<00:00:54.900> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> water<00:00:55.290> ring<00:00:55.650> if<00:00:56.100> somebody

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
what rid of the water ring if somebody

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.300 
what rid of the water ring if somebody
ever<00:00:56.670> does<00:00:56.970> put<00:00:57.210> their<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:57.720> on<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.470> saw<00:00:58.740> so

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
ever does put their can on your saw so

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.770 
ever does put their can on your saw so
let's<00:00:59.910> see<00:01:00.060> what<00:01:00.210> happens<00:01:00.570> here

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
let's see what happens here

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.679 
let's see what happens here
oh<00:01:04.219> we<00:01:05.219> lollygag<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:05.999> drink<00:01:06.240> coffee<00:01:06.479> for

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
oh we lollygag and drink coffee for

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.469 
oh we lollygag and drink coffee for
about<00:01:07.079> ten<00:01:07.320> minutes

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.630 

now<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.539> can<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:13.229> there's<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.710> ring<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.460> in

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
now I can see there's a ring here in

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.489 
now I can see there's a ring here in
fact<00:01:15.450> there's<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.719> dot<00:01:15.929> there<00:01:16.170> where<00:01:16.319> there's<00:01:16.469> a

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
fact there's a dot there where there's a

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:19.399 
fact there's a dot there where there's a
little<00:01:16.740> rust<00:01:17.219> formed<00:01:17.700> already<00:01:17.999> so<00:01:18.869> there's<00:01:19.170> my

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
little rust formed already so there's my

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.059 
little rust formed already so there's my
ring<00:01:19.909> there's<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.210> rough<00:01:21.479> spot<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
ring there's that rough spot so the

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.090 
ring there's that rough spot so the
problem<00:01:23.579> is<00:01:23.670> obvious<00:01:24.329> you<00:01:24.929> set<00:01:25.259> down<00:01:25.530> anything

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
problem is obvious you set down anything

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.219 
problem is obvious you set down anything
that's<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> sweat<00:01:27.149> and<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.899> can<00:01:28.049> get

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that's going to sweat and you can get

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.929 
that's going to sweat and you can get
these<00:01:28.409> rings<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:28.979> ten<00:01:29.249> minutes<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> pretty

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
these rings now ten minutes is a pretty

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.200 
these rings now ten minutes is a pretty
long<00:01:30.149> time<00:01:30.479> I've<00:01:31.079> seen<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.530> happen<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:32.429> just

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
long time I've seen this happen in just

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.020 
long time I've seen this happen in just
seconds<00:01:34.170> mostly<00:01:35.039> in<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.219> summertime<00:01:35.729> when

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
seconds mostly in the summertime when

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.029 
seconds mostly in the summertime when
it's<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.509> really<00:01:36.840> hot<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:38.009> just

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
it's really really hot and that can just

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.440 
it's really really hot and that can just
drips<00:01:38.819> right<00:01:38.909> now

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
drips right now

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.779 
drips right now
so<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:39.990> problem<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.859> we've<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.549> ring

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
so now problem is we've got the ring

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.389 
so now problem is we've got the ring
what<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.179> you<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.740> what<00:01:43.740> I'm<00:01:43.859> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.219> is

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
what do you do what I'm going to do is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.690 
what do you do what I'm going to do is
give<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.939> shot<00:01:45.389> of<00:01:45.920> liquid<00:01:46.920> wrench<00:01:47.159> product

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
give it a shot of liquid wrench product

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.739 
give it a shot of liquid wrench product
so<00:01:47.789> this<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.030> something<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.359> use<00:01:48.509> when<00:01:48.659> I'm

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
so this is something I use when I'm

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:52.389 
so this is something I use when I'm
working<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> car<00:01:49.409> has<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:50.009> rust<00:01:50.549> Buster<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
working on the car has a rust Buster and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.459 
working on the car has a rust Buster and
then<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.429> little<00:01:56.240> real<00:01:57.240> fine<00:01:57.569> sandpaper<00:01:58.079> this

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
then a little real fine sandpaper this

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.309 
then a little real fine sandpaper this
is<00:01:58.619> 500<00:01:59.130> grit<00:01:59.279> sandpaper<00:01:59.749> wrapped<00:02:00.749> on<00:02:00.959> a<00:02:00.990> block

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
is 500 grit sandpaper wrapped on a block

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.919
