00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:21.780 

you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.729 

okay<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:22.909> that<00:03:23.420> is<00:03:23.450> how<00:03:23.659> I<00:03:23.840> do<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.230> first<00:03:24.469> part

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
okay so that is how I do the first part

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.069 
okay so that is how I do the first part
hopefully<00:03:25.519> it<00:03:25.670> was<00:03:25.790> really<00:03:26.120> really<00:03:26.390> easy<00:03:26.689> to

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
hopefully it was really really easy to

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.589 
hopefully it was really really easy to
understand<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.489> then<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.849> just<00:03:29.090> kind<00:03:29.299> of<00:03:29.359> phone

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
understand and then I just kind of phone

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.479 
understand and then I just kind of phone
at<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> bottom<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.859> ends<00:03:31.159> won't<00:03:31.340> be

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
at the bottom so that the ends won't be

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.270 
at the bottom so that the ends won't be
loose<00:03:31.730> that's<00:03:32.659> just<00:03:32.840> kind<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.049> what<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.230> do<00:03:33.349> and

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
loose that's just kind of what I do and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.920 
loose that's just kind of what I do and
this<00:03:34.430> is<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.819> reason<00:03:34.969> why<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.180> do<00:03:35.420> all<00:03:35.540> this<00:03:35.780> is

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
this is the reason why I do all this is

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.899 
this is the reason why I do all this is
because<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.799> definitely<00:03:37.219> figure<00:03:37.370> out<00:03:37.609> a<00:03:37.639> soak

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
because you definitely figure out a soak

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.789 
because you definitely figure out a soak
in<00:03:38.090> water<00:03:38.329> and<00:03:38.719> the<00:03:38.870> conditioner<00:03:39.379> which<00:03:39.650> is

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
in water and the conditioner which is

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.429 
in water and the conditioner which is
moisture<00:03:40.280> instead<00:03:40.849> of<00:03:40.969> the<00:03:41.150> stripping<00:03:42.109> and

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
moisture instead of the stripping and

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.789 
moisture instead of the stripping and
drying<00:03:43.400> chlorine<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:44.359> I'm<00:03:45.230> not<00:03:45.469> sure<00:03:45.530> I've

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
drying chlorine so I'm not sure I've

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.110 
drying chlorine so I'm not sure I've
showed<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.069> guys<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.400> first<00:03:46.549> part<00:03:46.849> I'm<00:03:46.970> gonna

because it uh I think it's waterproof
I'm<00:04:09.139> pretty<00:04:09.319> sure<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:09.859> sweat<00:04:10.159> proof<00:04:10.370> because

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
I'm pretty sure it's sweat proof because

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:22.690 
I'm pretty sure it's sweat proof because

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
just really like that look then I'm

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.140 
just really like that look then I'm
going<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.860> be<00:04:42.980> taking<00:04:43.280> like<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.730> random

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
going to be taking like a random

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.790 
going to be taking like a random
scrunchie<00:04:44.630> you<00:04:44.780> really<00:04:45.050> want<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.260> supportive

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
scrunchie you really want a supportive

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.680 
scrunchie you really want a supportive
scrunchie<00:04:46.190> not<00:04:46.400> like<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.640> rubber<00:04:46.880> band<00:04:47.150> because

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
scrunchie not like a rubber band because

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.630 
scrunchie not like a rubber band because
I<00:04:47.990> might<00:04:48.200> be<00:04:48.320> time<00:04:48.560> all<00:04:48.770> four<00:04:49.190> of<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.400> braids

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
I might be time all four of the braids

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.760 
I might be time all four of the braids
together<00:04:50.000> because<00:04:50.600> something<00:04:51.380> with<00:04:51.530> this

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
together because something with this

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.920 
together because something with this
would<00:04:52.130> just<00:04:52.280> be<00:04:52.400> too<00:04:52.670> loose<00:04:52.850> for<00:04:52.910> me<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.660> and

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
would just be too loose for me so and

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.590 
would just be too loose for me so and
that<00:04:54.410> all<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.770> braids<00:04:55.010> like<00:04:55.190> that<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.880> then

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
that all the braids like that and then

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.290 
that all the braids like that and then
um<00:04:56.960> these<00:04:57.590> boots<00:04:57.860> feel<00:04:58.040> really<00:04:58.340> cool<00:04:58.550> but<00:04:59.120> I'm

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
um these boots feel really cool but I'm

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.910 
um these boots feel really cool but I'm
