00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
everybody's talking about the actual

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.510 
everybody's talking about the actual
exterior<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> car<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> most

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
exterior of the car but the most

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.240 
exterior of the car but the most
important<00:01:03.030> thing<00:01:03.500> that<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.650> happening<00:01:04.799> with

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
important thing that is happening with

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.649 
important thing that is happening with
these<00:01:05.309> new<00:01:05.460> regulation<00:01:06.000> changes<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
these new regulation changes is the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
these new regulation changes is the
actual<00:01:06.960> engine<00:01:07.439> because<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> v6

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
actual engine because when I have a v6

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.310 
actual engine because when I have a v6
engine<00:01:09.299> we're<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.720> which<00:01:09.960> engine

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
engine we're going to see which engine

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.080 
engine we're going to see which engine
is<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.100> much<00:01:11.310> more<00:01:11.340> reliable<00:01:11.820> than

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
is going to be much more reliable than

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.840 
is going to be much more reliable than
others<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.600> obviously<00:01:13.439> who<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> be

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
others and obviously who is going to be

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.969 
others and obviously who is going to be
looking<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.299> more<00:01:15.509> downforce<00:01:15.950> instead<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
looking for more downforce instead of

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.600 
looking for more downforce instead of
actual<00:01:17.729> engine<00:01:18.420> performance<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.250> we<00:01:20.250> already

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
actual engine performance and we already

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.969 
actual engine performance and we already
know<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.840> red<00:01:21.840> bull<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.920> be

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
know that red bull or going to be

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.530 
know that red bull or going to be
concentrating<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.610> downforce<00:01:24.240> because

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
concentrating on downforce because

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.190 
concentrating on downforce because
that's<00:01:25.140> always<00:01:25.979> been<00:01:26.250> their<00:01:26.880> way<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.840> doing

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
that's always been their way of doing

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.990 
that's always been their way of doing
things<00:01:28.409> I'll<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:28.979> very<00:01:29.189> surprised<00:01:29.579> they<00:01:29.880> don't

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
things I'll be very surprised they don't

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.880 
things I'll be very surprised they don't
concentrate<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.509> down<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:31.020> Stacy<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> Eva

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
concentrate on down for Stacy a Eva

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.410 
concentrate on down for Stacy a Eva
we're<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.180> wait<00:01:33.270> until

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
we're going to have to wait until

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.950 
we're going to have to wait until
testing<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> find<00:01:34.229> out<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:35.759> course

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
testing to find out and of course

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.910 
testing to find out and of course
reliability<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.140> going<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.439> another<00:01:37.650> issue

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
reliability is going to be another issue

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.890 
reliability is going to be another issue
because<00:01:38.909> we're<00:01:39.060> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> see<00:01:39.360> which<00:01:39.659> cars

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
because we're going to see which cars

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.780 
because we're going to see which cars
are<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.259> more<00:01:40.470> reliable<00:01:40.740> than<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
are going to be more reliable than the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
are going to be more reliable than the
others<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> huge<00:01:43.560> factor

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
others it's going to be a huge factor

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.910 
others it's going to be a huge factor

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
if you guys remember in 2005 I think it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.120 
if you guys remember in 2005 I think it
was<00:02:16.460> they<00:02:17.330> actually<00:02:17.630> had<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:18.020> fast<00:02:18.470> car<00:02:18.650> but

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
was they actually had a fast car but

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.880 
was they actually had a fast car but
because<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.640> their<00:02:19.910> terrible<00:02:20.890> reliability

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
because of their terrible reliability

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.190 
because of their terrible reliability
they<00:02:22.580> actually<00:02:23.270> didn't<00:02:23.660> do<00:02:23.780> well<00:02:23.990> on<00:02:24.050> the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
they actually didn't do well on the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.380 
they actually didn't do well on the
championship<00:02:24.770> unfortunately<00:02:25.370> now<00:02:26.210> in<00:02:26.360> terms

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
going on here i'm racing with my racing

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.110 
going on here i'm racing with my racing
world<00:03:00.680> horse<00:03:00.980> but<00:03:01.160> for<00:03:01.280> some<00:03:01.400> reason<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.940> game

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
world horse but for some reason the game

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.660 
world horse but for some reason the game
was<00:03:02.330> picking<00:03:02.630> up<00:03:02.750> my<00:03:02.990> wheel<00:03:03.800> as<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.100> controller

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
was picking up my wheel as a controller

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.790 
was picking up my wheel as a controller
so<00:03:05.210> it<00:03:05.300> made<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.450> very<00:03:05.570> difficult<00:03:06.020> to<00:03:06.470> drive

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
so it made it very difficult to drive

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.620 
so it made it very difficult to drive
but<00:03:07.640> anyway<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:07.940> guys<00:03:08.120> tell<00:03:08.330> me<00:03:08.360> what<00:03:08.540> you
