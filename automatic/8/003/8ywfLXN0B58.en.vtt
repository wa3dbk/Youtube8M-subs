00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.190
 Do you know that when you jumped like that 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.590
 and who, then, is simply broken 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.620
 I think it's really awful 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.189
 and for me that was for very often the 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.170
 case 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.730
 and that's just not so on 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.670
 At that time I also thought about it 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.449
 What can I do against it 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:33.250
 and my biggest secret tip I say 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:35.360
 There is a lot to drink right now 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.949
 why the lips are healthier 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.720
 It actually seems easy 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.059
 when you think about our body 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.800
 consists of at least 70 percent water 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.409
 it really follows that we 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.299
 need to drink enough and if we have that 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.760
 just do nothing then the dries 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:51.080
 body from the inside and that means 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.059
 our skin will be much too 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.769
 drier and of course the skin 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.750
 the lips when I was little 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.580
 I always pretty dry lips and 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.290
 I remember very well how 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.290
 my father always came to me and 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.640
 you're completely dry he loves god 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.530
 I'm always annoyed the little tip 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.909
 here labello is not that way 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.289
 Great as he looks 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.810
 He only does that honestly 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:26.619
 honesty the reality contains 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.450
 namely parabens and paraffin parabens 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.689
 is a kind of preservative and 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.030
 paraffin it to me though so healthy and 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.259
 Everything you think or are minerals 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.560
 inside and york but not like that 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.999
 it means simply petroleum and that 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.049
 can not be healthy for the body 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.479
 and maybe you already have that 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.130
 noticed if you use several times a day 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.049
 and then to look the labello 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.340
 Forgets like I have that too 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.710
 made to look the rag 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.030
 forgot at home and I saw 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.939
 terrible from my skin 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.249
 dried up without end and then simply 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.759
 shows how dependent these two substances are 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.889
 do 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.359
 I believe if I patent something 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:08.179
 let it be because then it would definitely be 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.100
 the word labello effect 100pro because it 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.050
 the body is just like an addiction 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.670
 gets so used to the skin 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.290
 can not save itself and 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.299
 you are grateful then 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.069
 alone in the rain name dry skin 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.980
 the lips without your capello 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.560
 I therefore simply recommend you 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.590
 try as healthy things as possible 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.969
 possible to make your lips and 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.030
 the tip with the water really drink 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:35.090
 I take it seriously, for example 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.370
 quite often olive oil on the lips over 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.670
 night in the day is no matter they were 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.989
 shine through and beautiful from the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:51.230
 great is the lip balm of halverde 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:54.049
 and that is also the case with eco test winner 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.760
 become and if someone there test winner 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.579
 will be on then especially on the 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.459
 safety of the materials with regard to 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:05.389
 tested the human body and how 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.900
 said this lip care is waiting 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:11.769
 otherwise they kept a small of 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:20.629
 I always like to use it 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:22.909
 you should see grape seed oil and that it 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.750
 very nice because grape seed oil contains 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.569
 important antioxidants and it needs 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.760
 just the body and you will see 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.500
 if you settle your I can tell you 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.169
 assure the first four weeks will be 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.629
 but after that you can do it all 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:42.280
 very happy lips 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.280
 and yes it is normal at first
