00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.849
 here we have flower in the past use of its 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.889
 armament devices that will be 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.289
 distributing throughout 2013 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.330
 alcatel are meant to be one of 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.849
 the best manufacturers has started it 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.830
 well with your pop line basically these 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.720
 devices have good hardware to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.580
 a price too tight what 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.039
 would lead to being sales top these 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.769
 devices on this occasion we have the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.869
 team 50 35 a device that barely 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.640
 manages to scratch the mid-low range in 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.350
 as to specifications because in 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.090
 reality is a team that achieves very well 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.130
 its purpose 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 going into detail with the physical aspect 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.660
 of the construction material is plastic 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.480
 but with different textures ahead 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 from behind as well as the sides 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.300
 starting from the front we have the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.000
 4.5 inch wide screen 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.920
 covered by dragon red type which is a 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.170
 type of scratch-resistant cover but not 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.840
 manages to grant greater durability than a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.790
 corning gorilla glass in the part 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.800
 we have a small upper chamber 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.530
 gea quality and sensors 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.970
 proximity and lighting in the part 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 Bottom three buttons are observed 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.399
 Typical capacitives of android ice cream 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.800
 sandwich the sides are enough 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.020
 clean down is only the entrance 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.550
 microusb on the sides are the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.560
 volume buttons and in the part 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.470
 top is the headphone jack 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.270
 standard 3.5 as well as the button 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.759
 lit on the back 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.100
 we found a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.960
 with flash led 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.490
 Alcatel has given us a big surprise the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.570
 team is able to start in 6 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.729
 seconds to use immediately 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.350
 to talk about this imperative we have 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.770
 to talk about hardware in their insides 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.620
 It has a dual-core mediatek processor 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.650
 65-77 running a gigahertz accompanied 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.360
 of 512 megabytes of ram what will give 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.430
 as a result small lax in the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.530
 user interface however the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.400
 experience will not be seen totally 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.920
 Depleted by hardware 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.020
 the team of bring manufactures android ice 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.730
 cream sanwich 4.0 to the layer of 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.470
 personalization that the cat chose he did not 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.390
 it is very intrusive in the bar 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.399
 notifications we find icons of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.550
 shortcut for bluetooth wifi 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.860
 3g data gps rotation and profiles 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.410
 called on the other hand the applications 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.480
 that brings start are pretty clean at 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.590
 Android 4.0 kernel to which 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.660
 thanks enough to economize 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.150
 as for internal memory available for 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.980
 the user to 1.2 gigabyte so 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.319
 we will have to opt for microsd cards 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.870
 up to 32 GB to store our 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.569
 videos pictures movies and from the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.110
 4.5 inch beaches qhd resolution 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.540
 960 multitouch transitive hour of 5 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.549
 points also incorporates protection 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.380
 dragon retail that gives us a bit of 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.750
 durability 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.670
 the screen responds quite well and in 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.510
 no time have I noticed braces author 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.510
 staff after 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.130
 the 5 megapixel camera takes videos to 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.050
 640 p with a quality that leaves a lot 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.120
 wish in dark places the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.040
 photographs taken with the flash are 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.150
 decent and fulfill their role for the 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.340
 public that will direct 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.459
 to upload them either on facebook twitter 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.379
 instagram etcetera the photographs 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.939
 taken indoors have much more 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.939
 quality leaving a good taste 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.010
 This equipment is made for 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.260
 beginners of intermediate users 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.840
 who want an agile smartphone but without 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.340
 be expensive the games run so 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.510
 nice although I have noticed that there 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.819
 some like 'new that costs you 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.799
 I work however for most of 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.989
 casual games do their job 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.989
 in terms of web experience 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.209
 the truth do not wait for great minutes the 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.700
 camera is pretty standard and does not have 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.319
 extras but as I had repeated this 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.909
 Equipment is for beginners and users 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.870
 who like to take casual photographs 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.849
 for networks 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.470
 something that I did not like anything about this 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.090
 team is rough we close with your 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.610
 smartphone of its category and has opted 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.140
 for one gigabyte of required ROM memory 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.330
 to move android in a fluid way and 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.890
 no jams when we open more than three 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.170
 applications in the processes start 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.360
 which causes us to lose time to 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.930
 have to restart the activity in the 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.239
 that stays in the background 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.829
 I liked this team in general because 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.270
 It has a very affordable price for 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.950
 medium-low range 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.900
 however not everything that the interface of 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.270
 user is depleted due to the rom that 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.340
 chose alcatel however I also notice 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.200
 that the plastic is very fragile and can 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.030
 be susceptible to support when falling 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.490
 since very putting it is all for now 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.620
 we appreciate having been tuning 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.340
 this new analysis of the alcatel one 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.760
 touch 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.310
 export follow us and remember to give me 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.520
