so how does it work I put this it's

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.450 
so how does it work I put this it's
moving<00:01:44.000> up<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.750> down<00:01:44.930> really<00:01:45.259> fast<00:01:45.680> you're

love<00:02:01.220> this<00:02:02.000> is<00:02:02.330> on<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.720> piston<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:04.310> poll

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
love this is on the piston the poll

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.859 
love this is on the piston the poll
updates<00:02:05.450> its<00:02:05.990> location<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.850> doesn't<00:02:08.390> stay

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
updates its location so it doesn't stay

updates its location so it doesn't stay
on<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.140> pressure<00:02:09.619> plate<00:02:10.150> so<00:02:11.150> guys<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:12.080> is

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
on the pressure plate so guys this is

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.240 
on the pressure plate so guys this is
the<00:02:13.420> invisible<00:02:14.420> touch

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
