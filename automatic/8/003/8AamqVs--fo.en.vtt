and<00:01:43.799> calls<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> fish<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:44.729> well<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.210> just

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
and calls in the fish as well it just

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.149 
and calls in the fish as well it just
gives<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.869> little<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.409> different<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.070> an

gives a little bit different of an

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.179 
gives a little bit different of an
action<00:01:47.579> than<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.600> types<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.409> inline<00:01:49.770> spinners

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
action than the types of inline spinners

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.830 
action than the types of inline spinners
that<00:01:50.220> we've<00:01:50.610> shown<00:01:50.850> previously<00:01:51.119> and

that we've shown previously and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.719 
that we've shown previously and
sometimes<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.100> make<00:01:53.340> all<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
sometimes that can make all the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.910 
sometimes that can make all the
difference<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.180> world<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.140> action<00:01:55.680> of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
difference in the world is the action of

difference in the world is the action of
the<00:01:56.070> lure<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.640> last<00:01:57.299> layer<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.719> we're

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
the lure and the last layer that we're

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.690 
the lure and the last layer that we're
going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> look<00:01:58.200> at<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.680> obviously<00:01:59.460> quite

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
going to look at is obviously quite

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.030 
going to look at is obviously quite
different<00:02:00.180> than<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.360> previous<00:02:00.630> ones<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
different than the previous ones this is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.940 
different than the previous ones this is
the<00:02:02.340> classic<00:02:03.119> Rapala<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.960> as<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.710> tell

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the classic Rapala and as you can tell

right<00:02:05.189> away<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.729> differs<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> lot<00:02:06.540> from<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
right away it differs a lot from the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.900 
right away it differs a lot from the
other<00:02:07.020> lures<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.680> we've<00:02:07.860> looked<00:02:08.039> at<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.610> that
