right on the money there it is now all
I've<00:00:32.700> got<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.300> cut<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> plug<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.870> fit<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
I've got to do is cut a plug to fit that

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.650 
I've got to do is cut a plug to fit that
hole<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:37.550> drill<00:00:38.550> press<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.239> best<00:00:39.450> way<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
hole a drill press is the best way to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.090 
hole a drill press is the best way to
cut<00:00:39.930> these<00:00:40.079> plugs<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
cut these plugs but I can go with the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.670 
cut these plugs but I can go with the
hand<00:00:41.309> drill<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> don't<00:00:43.230> always<00:00:43.500> bother

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
hand drill to so I don't always bother

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
hand drill to so I don't always bother
with<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> drill<00:00:44.280> press<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:45.090> got<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> be

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
with the drill press you got to be

00:00:45.390 --> 00:01:08.990 
with the drill press you got to be
steady<00:00:45.860> go<00:00:46.860> slow<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.340> blow<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> chips<00:00:48.059> out

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.270 

there<00:01:10.000> we<00:01:10.150> go<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:10.630> hard<00:01:11.410> maple<00:01:11.620> plug<00:01:12.010> that

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
there we go a hard maple plug that

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:21.980 
there we go a hard maple plug that
matches<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.910> hole

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.789 

I<00:01:26.750> picked<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.840> pretty<00:01:27.960> hard<00:01:28.290> piece<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.650> maple

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
I picked a pretty hard piece of maple

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.280 
I picked a pretty hard piece of maple
and<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.190> just<00:01:29.400> gonna<00:01:29.600> cut<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.659> down<00:01:30.780> right<00:01:31.260> now

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and I'm just gonna cut it down right now

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.500 
and I'm just gonna cut it down right now
I<00:01:31.860> waited<00:01:32.369> about<00:01:32.460> 10<00:01:32.790> minutes<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.330> probably

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
I waited about 10 minutes is probably

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.200 
I waited about 10 minutes is probably
not<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.260> way<00:01:34.380> dry<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.880> cut<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
not all the way dry that you can cut it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.240 
not all the way dry that you can cut it
when<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.509> swollen<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.229> shrinks<00:01:38.040> down

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
when it's swollen up and shrinks down

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.120 
when it's swollen up and shrinks down
below<00:01:38.610> actually

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.740 

I'll<00:01:47.130> use<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.610> tuners<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.120> show<00:01:48.300> me<00:01:48.480> where<00:01:48.660> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
I'll use the tuners to show me where to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:02:00.140 
I'll use the tuners to show me where to
drill<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> new<00:01:49.260> screw<00:01:49.620> hole<00:01:51.320> right<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:59.150> so

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
drill the new screw hole right there so

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.240 
drill the new screw hole right there so
that's<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.900> extractor<00:02:01.470> in<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.740> plug<00:02:01.950> cutter

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that's the extractor in the plug cutter

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.870 
that's the extractor in the plug cutter
now<00:02:03.210> let's<00:02:03.510> look<00:02:03.690> at<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> drill<00:02:04.230> bit<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:05.070> 3/16

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
now let's look at the drill bit the 3/16

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.270 
now let's look at the drill bit the 3/16
drill<00:02:05.940> bit<00:02:06.300> is<00:02:06.480> to<00:02:06.690> size<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> hole<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.920> match<00:02:08.100> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
drill bit is to size a hole to match the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.880 
drill bit is to size a hole to match the
plugs<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.780> drill<00:02:10.020> holes<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.680> can

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
plugs and to drill holes out so you can

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.680 
plugs and to drill holes out so you can
plug<00:02:11.100> them<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.400> could<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> strap<00:02:12.120> button<00:02:12.540> in

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
plug them it could be a strap button in

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.780 
plug them it could be a strap button in
my<00:02:12.720> case<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.650> four<00:02:14.070> mounting<00:02:14.280> screw

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
my case it's the four mounting screw

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.760 
my case it's the four mounting screw
holes<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.420> neck<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> guy<00:02:16.410> stripped

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
holes in this neck that a guy stripped

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.760 
holes in this neck that a guy stripped
out<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.850> use<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.060> with<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.440> guide<00:02:19.440> block

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
out and you use it with the guide block

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:46.190 
out and you use it with the guide block
to<00:02:20.370> keep<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:20.820> center

some<00:03:26.890> of<00:03:27.010> these<00:03:27.100> were<00:03:27.310> pretty<00:03:27.520> big<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.940> wallow

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
some of these were pretty big and wallow

some of these were pretty big and wallow
doubt<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:29.020> drilled<00:03:29.320> them<00:03:29.470> out<00:03:29.650> with<00:03:29.770> a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
doubt and I drilled them out with a

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.880 
doubt and I drilled them out with a
drill<00:03:30.070> bit<00:03:30.280> use<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.820> bigger<00:03:31.000> plugs<00:03:31.360> for<00:03:31.660> them

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
drill bit use the bigger plugs for them

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.030 
drill bit use the bigger plugs for them

I<00:03:33.070> think<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:33.820> have<00:03:33.970> one<00:03:34.180> more<00:03:34.210> here<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.690> one

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
I think I have one more here and one

I think I have one more here and one
more<00:03:35.110> there<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.380> get<00:03:35.590> then<00:03:36.460> the<00:03:36.670> little<00:03:36.970> ones

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
more there to get then the little ones
