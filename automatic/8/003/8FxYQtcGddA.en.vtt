 basil and many others here for example 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.350

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.840
 more to make celery juice from broccoli 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.730
 chard beet leaves and here it was 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.190
 very interesting idea when i saw 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.829
 I really liked it because usually 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.890
 beet leaves then we throw and here 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.260
 offer to smoothie and add and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.240
 turn out very useful here so that 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.820
 now I know where to put beet leaves 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.710
 what else can you put parsley smoothies 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.980
 kohlrabi cabbage back 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.390
 Well, in every way and fruit is already us 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:28.210
 habitually still from unusual ingredients 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.370
 aloe juice I think many grow aloe on 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.170
 windowsills but few thought of 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.290
 add aloe juice 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.330
 its food is usually used by and in 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.040
 medical purposes there but dig in 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 a cold or something like that 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.720
 and here you can add to smoothies 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.960
 also very useful because 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.480
 shaft and contains vitamin b12 well 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.790
 germinated sprouts for smoothies is true 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.430
 for many vegetarians is no longer news 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.600
 Wheatgrass juice is offered 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.690
 do here as a sweetener 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.890
 the author of the book offers dates here and 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.320
 agave syrup 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.330
 but agave syrup in Russia is not 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.349
 very often you will meet but honey and 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.170
 dates are quite good sweeteners 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.819
 the author of the book advises not 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.879
 start immediately with a lot of 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.010
 greens in smoothies first add smoothies 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.650
 more fruit for us it is more 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.010
 habitually and slowly increase 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.630
 the amount of these green ingredients 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.940
 so you slowly get used to 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.600
 unusual taste smoothies and you will be more 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.060
 greens consume here a lot of ideas 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.710
 not to smooth it is not necessary 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.020
 by the way cook strictly here for this 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.290
 recipes i 'm going to cook now 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.060
 blueberry smoothie idea recipes I took from 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.069
 the author of this book but in general 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.140
 redesigned for themselves and for those products 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.950
 which I now have in stock 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.200
 here the author has recipes with blueberries 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.819
 he respects blueberries very much 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.220
 says that it is useful for sight 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.040
 contains many antioxidants 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.520
 of course blueberries do not improve vision but 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.650
 it strengthens the eyes and reduces 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.520
 the possibility of new problems 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.400
 with eyesight 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.950
 so blueberries should be eaten as much as possible 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.660
 more often now I just bought 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.900
 frozen blueberries and try and 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.170
 add a book to everything 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.750
 worthwhile if you want to dial too 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.660
 different ideas for smoothies and juices then 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.319
 I advise you this book in infobox under 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.270
 this video I will give a reference to the Russian 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.890
 online stores in which you can 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.110
 buy this book 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.720
 Well, now I'll talk about a smoothie which 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.520
 I'm going to make a smoothie 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.010
 I'll take blueberry slides 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:50.500
 me blueberry frozen one apple 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.260
 a third cup of water is plain clean 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.630
 drinking water and finally the most important thing 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.360
 pour out your smoothie I'll add a few 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.870
 sprigs of parsley and dill and 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.400
 a few fresh basil leaves 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.020
 it would be nice to add mint 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.770
 but 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.590
 mint is not from the apple we extract the core 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.600
 clean yabla which i wo n't because 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.280
 so that a cocktail will be healthier 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.560
 just cut an apple at will you 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.110
 can peel your apple 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.210
 from basil I will take only leaves 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.060
 because but the stalk of basil is already 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.740
 old enough hard like that 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.440
 that I won't add it to a cocktail 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.440
 now laid basil apples 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:42.810

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:55.130
 uplander add chernyak here

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.340
 snack and more it can be used on 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.280
 breakfast is such a cocktail with me 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.800
 it turned out very unusual thick and 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.560
 taste by the way is also very unusual but to me 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.420
 love such a nice combination 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.040
 sour fruits with herbs 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.760

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.980

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.450
