there's<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.099> lot<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.369> different<00:00:26.640> reasons<00:00:27.000> why

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
there's a lot of different reasons why

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.660 
there's a lot of different reasons why
the<00:00:27.240> jigging<00:00:27.720> rap<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.199> effective<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.250> one

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the jigging rap is so effective but one

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.189 
the jigging rap is so effective but one
of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> biggest<00:00:30.150> reasons<00:00:30.539> why<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.779> because

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
of the biggest reasons why is because

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.130 
of the biggest reasons why is because
it's<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.800> erratic<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.700> constantly<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.719> moving

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
it's so erratic it constantly is moving

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.540 
it's so erratic it constantly is moving
and<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> shows<00:00:34.559> those<00:00:34.710> fish<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.280> there<00:00:35.489> in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and it shows those fish out there in

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.160 
and it shows those fish out there in
that<00:00:35.640> open<00:00:35.880> water<00:00:36.030> something<00:00:36.719> they<00:00:36.930> haven't

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that open water something they haven't

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
that open water something they haven't
seen<00:00:37.559> they<00:00:37.829> don't<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.550> always<00:00:38.730> see

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
seen they don't see that they always see

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.310 
seen they don't see that they always see
all<00:00:39.180> these<00:00:39.300> different<00:00:39.450> baits<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:39.989> there<00:00:40.200> but

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
all these different baits out there but

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.229 
all these different baits out there but
this<00:00:40.530> bait<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.610> something<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> works

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
this bait is just something that works

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.549 
this bait is just something that works
for<00:00:42.390> large<00:00:42.660> enough<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:42.960> works<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.350> walleye

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
for large enough that works for walleye

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.250 
for large enough that works for walleye
it<00:00:44.190> works<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.550> multiple<00:00:45.090> species<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.809> it's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
it works for multiple species and it's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.540 
it works for multiple species and it's
just<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.559> erratic<00:00:46.950> action<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.399> really

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
just that erratic action that really

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.200 
just that erratic action that really
triggers<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.969> bite<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:50.430> jigging<00:00:50.700> wrap<00:00:50.850> is

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
triggers that bite the jigging wrap is

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.369 
triggers that bite the jigging wrap is
basically<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.680> heavier<00:00:53.750> jigging<00:00:54.750> bait<00:00:54.989> that

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
basically a heavier jigging bait that

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.139 
basically a heavier jigging bait that
allows<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> fish<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.430> deep<00:00:56.640> water<00:00:56.940> in

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
allows you to fish in deep water in

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.540 
allows you to fish in deep water in
shallow<00:00:57.780> water<00:00:58.079> both<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.190> look<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.460> it

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
shallow water both but if you look at it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.819 
shallow water both but if you look at it
as<00:00:59.640> two<00:00:59.910> smaller<00:01:00.239> hooks<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.629> both<00:01:00.660> ends<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
as two smaller hooks on both ends and

up with it and then just a softer tip
rod<00:01:31.920> medium<00:01:32.369> heavy<00:01:32.579> I'm<00:01:33.150> something<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
rod medium heavy I'm something with a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.819 
rod medium heavy I'm something with a
little<00:01:33.750> bit<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> backbone<00:01:34.290> towards<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> back

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
little bit of backbone towards the back

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.230 
little bit of backbone towards the back
but<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.040> want<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.400> bit<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.579> tip<00:01:35.790> toward

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
but you want a little bit of tip toward

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.030 
but you want a little bit of tip toward
really<00:01:36.540> allows<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.049> bait<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.740> move<00:01:37.920> around

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
really allows that bait to move around

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710 
really allows that bait to move around
and<00:01:38.520> dart<00:01:38.700> around<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:39.390> keep<00:01:39.570> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and dart around and really keep that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.600 
and dart around and really keep that
action<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:41.040> last<00:01:41.220> thing<00:01:41.400> because

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
action and then one last thing because

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.819 
action and then one last thing because
it's<00:01:42.000> bait<00:01:42.210> reaction<00:01:42.960> actually<00:01:43.170> differently

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it's bait reaction actually differently

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.160 
it's bait reaction actually differently
it's<00:01:44.070> always<00:01:44.610> moving<00:01:44.700> around<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.960> cause

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
it's always moving around it can cause

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719 
it's always moving around it can cause
lines<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.670> for

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
lines with so what I like to do that for

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.670 
lines with so what I like to do that for
like<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.939> little<00:01:48.090> snap<00:01:48.390> swivel<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
like a little snap swivel right on the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
like a little snap swivel right on the
head<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.729> eliminates

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
head of it and that really eliminates

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.370 
head of it and that really eliminates
that<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.659> don't<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.079> any<00:01:52.259> issues

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that so you don't they have any issues

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.289 
that so you don't they have any issues
with<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.710> or<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.040> put<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> swivel<00:01:54.210> up

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
with that or you just put a swivel up

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.990 
with that or you just put a swivel up
line<00:01:54.630> tie<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> swivel<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.560> line<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.759> just

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
line tie a swivel up line and that just

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.899 
line tie a swivel up line and that just
seems<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.680> solve<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.770> issue<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.549> basically

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
seems to solve that issue so basically

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910 
seems to solve that issue so basically
what<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.180> when<00:02:00.479> I'm<00:02:00.600> fishing<00:02:01.110> out<00:02:01.469> deep<00:02:01.710> I'm

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
what I when I'm fishing out deep I'm

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.310 
what I when I'm fishing out deep I'm
looking<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.399> areas<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.790> Fisher<00:02:03.630> are<00:02:04.110> going

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
looking for areas that Fisher are going

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.050 
looking for areas that Fisher are going
to<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.439> moving<00:02:04.619> into

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
to be moving into

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.639 
to be moving into
a really<00:02:05.390> good<00:02:05.540> pre-spawn<00:02:06.020> techniques<00:02:06.500> or

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
a really good pre-spawn techniques or

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.040 
a really good pre-spawn techniques or
post-spawn<00:02:07.369> but<00:02:08.179> i'm<00:02:08.270> get<00:02:08.450> out<00:02:08.569> here<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.810> little

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
post-spawn but i'm get out here a little

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.440 
post-spawn but i'm get out here a little
bit<00:02:09.200> deeper<00:02:09.380> water<00:02:09.709> 15<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.729> 20<00:02:11.030> foot<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.300> water

bit deeper water 15 to 20 foot of water

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.350 
bit deeper water 15 to 20 foot of water
but<00:02:12.489> realistically<00:02:13.489> i'm<00:02:13.760> you're<00:02:13.970> looking<00:02:14.270> at

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
but realistically i'm you're looking at

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.320 
but realistically i'm you're looking at
my<00:02:14.480> graphs<00:02:14.780> now<00:02:15.140> I'm<00:02:15.470> watching<00:02:15.739> my<00:02:16.099> babe<00:02:16.340> come

off the bottom I'm snapping around in

this dart and over here and starting

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.420 
this dart and over here and starting
over<00:02:21.319> they're<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:21.860> starting<00:02:22.160> here<00:02:22.310> and

sudden if I see a fish move up off the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.000 
sudden if I see a fish move up off the
bottom<00:02:27.610> I'll<00:02:28.610> snap<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.269> snap<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.930> snap<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.800> and

stop<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.360> that's<00:02:32.450> when<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:32.959> they

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
stop and that's when you do they

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.930 
stop and that's when you do they
normally<00:02:33.920> buy<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.099> because<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.519> has<00:02:34.670> such<00:02:34.910> a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
normally buy it because it has such a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.180 
normally buy it because it has such a
great<00:02:35.209> action<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:36.319> when<00:02:36.500> I'm<00:02:36.590> snapping<00:02:37.100> that

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
great action that when I'm snapping that

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.759 
great action that when I'm snapping that
bait<00:02:37.430> up<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.790> down<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.330> it's<00:02:38.810> going<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:39.590> way
