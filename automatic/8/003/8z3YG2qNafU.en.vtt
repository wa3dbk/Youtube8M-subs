00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.700
 a lot of rio de janeiro people do not know 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.700
 Where do these vacancies come from? 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.150
 if this project was created here the region 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.919
 preserve our waters but felt the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.899
 more than 10 million people in the river 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.329
 January is important, I always spoke 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.970
 People, this water goes to Rio. 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:35.329
 the staff uses iran from January at 10am 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.600
 it's getting dirty then she's a 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:56.960
 new and more distance from who I 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:58.820
 look at the business and it 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.769
 producers to join the project when 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.769
 give them the project they target areas 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.800
 mainly areas on the riverbanks 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.020
 and in the tone of the springs and 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.479
 conservation of the forest 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.720
 restoration of these areas 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.780
 priorities as I have here next 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.869
 something close to 6 hectares of 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.330
 reforestation is when the forest has 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.729
 adult I have more or less some 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.259
 thing about imprisoning 600 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.520
 tons of carbon and I am 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.369
 little tiny 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.009
 now I wonder if all the great 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.200
 landowners of that country to make a 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.410
 little of what I'm doing here 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.880
 all with my partners 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:45.679
 I think the world would be much better. 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.770
 even better we will complete and 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.450
 now it is with this project but some 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.840
 others here in the region a million 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.709
 trees planted more than 350 jobs 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.810
 generated another 300 informal 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.429
 and we are managing to convert 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.399
 those who lived from the 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:07.190
 deforestation of illegal logging 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.539
 So you can now work for 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.539
 recomposition of the forest 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.340
 free table only holds 45 gave up and 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:25.300
 It provides tips but it does not play me like 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:28.810
 It's at the top Yes I know the project started 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.580
 already notice the forms coming more mine 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.790
 animals comes another worthy role because 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.550
 I did not have certain species not alive 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.069
 did not see here and today us through 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.260
 reforestation is being 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.970
 native trees that are the source of 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.269
 food for animals 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.239
 so they are coming back 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.680
 This is the nature for us is everything is 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.840
 life right 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.790
 It is the future of the generation that we have 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.959
 in many little ones 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.870
 we thank you, it's the work that is 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.019
 being done because besides being 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.880
 bringing benefit to the family for the 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.530
 community greater benefit is being 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.530
 for the children 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.440
 our water today cerealista clarinha you 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.489
 sees babel fish was taking over everything 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.560
 I have not had it all before. 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.220
 this project was a blessing in France 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.220
 security
