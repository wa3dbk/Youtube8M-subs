games 2015 out in San Mateo California
and<00:00:13.870> I<00:00:13.929> wanted<00:00:14.110> to<00:00:14.200> do<00:00:14.259> a<00:00:14.290> three<00:00:14.620> part<00:00:14.860> video

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
and I wanted to do a three part video

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.340 
and I wanted to do a three part video
series<00:00:15.190> to<00:00:15.610> show<00:00:15.639> you<00:00:15.879> the<00:00:16.480> design<00:00:16.840> the

building of it and all the electronics

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.550 
building of it and all the electronics
and<00:00:19.150> everything<00:00:19.210> that<00:00:19.570> goes<00:00:19.720> into<00:00:20.080> building<00:00:20.260> a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
and everything that goes into building a

one pound combat robot so in part one
we're<00:00:23.530> going<00:00:23.620> to<00:00:23.680> talk<00:00:23.920> about<00:00:24.040> the<00:00:24.310> overall

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
we're going to talk about the overall

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:33.060 
we're going to talk about the overall
design<00:00:24.910> of<00:00:25.750> Sergeant<00:00:26.170> cuddles

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.710 

this<00:00:34.070> is<00:00:34.370> sergeant<00:00:35.090> cuddles

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
this is sergeant cuddles

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.320 
this is sergeant cuddles
sergeant<00:00:36.140> cuddles<00:00:36.440> is<00:00:36.650> a<00:00:36.680> one-pound<00:00:37.520> combat

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
sergeant cuddles is a one-pound combat

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.500 
sergeant cuddles is a one-pound combat
robot<00:00:38.810> that<00:00:39.650> uses<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.040> spinning<00:00:40.820> drum<00:00:41.180> to

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
robot that uses a spinning drum to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.990 
robot that uses a spinning drum to
attack<00:00:41.870> opponents<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:42.920> is<00:00:43.130> not<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.640> first

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
attack opponents this is not the first

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.660 
attack opponents this is not the first
design<00:00:44.540> that<00:00:45.020> I<00:00:45.050> had<00:00:45.470> for<00:00:45.950> sergeant<00:00:46.400> cuddles

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
design that I had for sergeant cuddles

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.670 
design that I had for sergeant cuddles
the<00:00:47.090> very<00:00:47.300> first<00:00:47.600> design<00:00:47.809> was<00:00:48.140> actually<00:00:48.320> this

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
the very first design was actually this

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.950 
the very first design was actually this
bar<00:00:49.280> spinner<00:00:49.640> that<00:00:49.760> sat<00:00:50.180> in<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.449> front<00:00:50.660> and

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
bar spinner that sat in the front and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.260 
bar spinner that sat in the front and
the<00:00:51.500> design<00:00:51.800> just<00:00:52.040> really<00:00:52.430> didn't<00:00:52.760> work<00:00:53.090> out

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
the design just really didn't work out

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.240 
the design just really didn't work out
so<00:00:53.480> I<00:00:53.510> had<00:00:53.660> to<00:00:53.750> change<00:00:54.110> it<00:00:54.410> by<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.860> week<00:00:55.070> before

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
so I had to change it by the week before

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.070 
so I had to change it by the week before
the<00:00:55.489> competition<00:00:56.150> I<00:00:56.300> built<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:56.660> whole<00:00:56.840> thing

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
the competition I built this whole thing

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.320 
the competition I built this whole thing
about<00:00:57.260> three<00:00:57.590> days<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.309> some<00:00:58.879> of<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.030> design

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
about three days so some of the design

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.790 
about three days so some of the design
was<00:00:59.480> a<00:00:59.540> little<00:00:59.809> bit<00:00:59.900> rushed<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.559> I'll<00:01:00.620> talk

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
was a little bit rushed and I'll talk

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.340 
was a little bit rushed and I'll talk
about<00:01:00.830> that<00:01:01.160> bit<00:01:01.309> later<00:01:01.519> I<00:01:01.730> have<00:01:02.540> some<00:01:02.840> early

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
about that bit later I have some early

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.860 
about that bit later I have some early
tests<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.190> weapon<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:04.670> ultimately<00:01:05.600> what

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
tests of the weapon and ultimately what

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.260 
tests of the weapon and ultimately what
happened<00:01:06.409> was<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.860> was<00:01:06.979> way<00:01:07.250> too<00:01:07.280> front<00:01:08.030> heavy

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
happened was it was way too front heavy

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.539 
happened was it was way too front heavy
and<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:09.200> whole<00:01:09.440> robot<00:01:09.650> would<00:01:09.979> want<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.280> shift

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
and the whole robot would want to shift

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.550 
and the whole robot would want to shift
around<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:11.720> just<00:01:11.960> really<00:01:12.260> wasn't

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
around and it just really wasn't

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.130 
around and it just really wasn't
drivable<00:01:13.370> it<00:01:13.790> did<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.240> lot<00:01:14.510> of<00:01:14.659> damage<00:01:14.930> to

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
drivable it did a lot of damage to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.260 
drivable it did a lot of damage to
whatever<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:15.740> hit<00:01:15.979> but<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.700> couldn't<00:01:17.150> get

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
whatever it hit but you couldn't get

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.820 
whatever it hit but you couldn't get
around<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.690> arena<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.080> this<00:01:18.260> was<00:01:18.440> a<00:01:18.470> bit<00:01:18.650> of<00:01:18.740> a

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
around the arena so this was a bit of a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.270 
around the arena so this was a bit of a
compromise<00:01:19.659> both<00:01:20.659> versions<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.650> this<00:01:21.950> are

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
compromise both versions of this are

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.240 
compromise both versions of this are
centered<00:01:22.850> around<00:01:23.049> this<00:01:24.049> central<00:01:24.590> chassis

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
centered around this central chassis

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.620 
centered around this central chassis
which<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.520> machined<00:01:25.909> out<00:01:26.000> of<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.180> single<00:01:26.390> piece

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
which is machined out of a single piece

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.250 
which is machined out of a single piece
of<00:01:26.890> UHMWPE<00:01:27.890> or<00:01:28.729> ultra<00:01:29.390> high<00:01:29.600> molecular<00:01:29.630> weight

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
very slippery and a little bit flexible

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.889 
very slippery and a little bit flexible
material<00:01:48.679> there<00:01:49.219> is<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.490> little<00:01:50.030> bit<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.539> give

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
material there is a little bit of give

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.310 
material there is a little bit of give
to<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:51.259> chassis<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:51.859> not<00:01:52.070> much<00:01:53.079> they<00:01:54.079> bounce

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
to the chassis but not much they bounce

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.340 
to the chassis but not much they bounce
a<00:01:54.530> little<00:01:54.679> bit<00:01:54.950> they're<00:01:55.219> a<00:01:55.250> little<00:01:55.549> hard<00:01:55.909> and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
a little bit they're a little hard and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.289 
a little bit they're a little hard and
when<00:01:57.350> things<00:01:57.710> hit<00:01:58.009> against<00:01:58.490> them<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.880> absorbs

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
when things hit against them it absorbs

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.840 
when things hit against them it absorbs
a<00:01:59.390> lot<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.719> impact<00:02:00.170> as<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:01.100> can<00:02:01.399> see<00:02:01.609> with

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
a lot of the impact as you can see with

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.880 
a lot of the impact as you can see with
some<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.689> marks<00:02:03.049> along<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.619> edge<00:02:03.740> of

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
some of the marks along the edge of

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.859 
some of the marks along the edge of
Sergeant<00:02:04.280> cuddles<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:04.969> just<00:02:05.270> kind<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.570> chews

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
Sergeant cuddles it just kind of chews

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.419 
Sergeant cuddles it just kind of chews
into<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.289> little<00:02:06.560> bit<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.890> doesn't<00:02:07.189> really

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
into a little bit and doesn't really

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.180 
into a little bit and doesn't really
snap<00:02:07.880> using<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.960> central<00:02:09.350> chassis<00:02:09.860> design

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
snap using the central chassis design

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.550 
snap using the central chassis design
allowed<00:02:10.670> me<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:10.970> make<00:02:11.510> very<00:02:11.840> few<00:02:12.080> custom

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
allowed me to make very few custom

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.860 
allowed me to make very few custom
components<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.280> had<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.030> main<00:02:14.240> chassis<00:02:14.720> which

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
components I had the main chassis which

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.500 
components I had the main chassis which
was<00:02:15.080> relatively<00:02:15.500> complicated<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.340> make<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.760> had

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
was relatively complicated to make I had

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.960 
was relatively complicated to make I had
the<00:02:17.660> actual<00:02:18.020> drum<00:02:18.500> itself<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.280> then<00:02:19.819> the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
the actual drum itself and then the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.030 
the actual drum itself and then the
armor<00:02:20.330> plates<00:02:20.630> top<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.230> bottom<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:21.920> other

armor plates top and bottom but other
than<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.310> everything<00:02:22.910> pretty<00:02:23.240> much<00:02:23.300> pressed

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
than that everything pretty much pressed

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.510 
than that everything pretty much pressed
fit<00:02:24.140> into<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.620> chassis<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.220> there<00:02:25.340> really

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
fit into the chassis and there really

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.480 
fit into the chassis and there really
wasn't<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.970> lot<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.300> break<00:02:26.569> and<00:02:27.069> even<00:02:28.069> after<00:02:28.370> all

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
wasn't a lot to break and even after all

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.430 
wasn't a lot to break and even after all
the<00:02:28.610> damage<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.000> happened<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.750> Sergeant

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
the damage that happened to Sergeant

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.870 
the damage that happened to Sergeant
cuddles<00:02:30.740> I<00:02:30.890> really<00:02:31.220> didn't<00:02:31.430> have<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.640> replace

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
cuddles I really didn't have to replace

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.820 
cuddles I really didn't have to replace
anything<00:02:32.360> other<00:02:32.510> than<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:32.990> top<00:02:33.230> panel<00:02:33.470> if<00:02:33.740> I

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
anything other than this top panel if I

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.540 
anything other than this top panel if I
wanted<00:02:34.130> just<00:02:34.400> for<00:02:34.580> cosmetics<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:36.590> UHMW<00:02:37.400> works

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
wanted just for cosmetics the UHMW works

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.040 
wanted just for cosmetics the UHMW works
really<00:02:37.819> great<00:02:38.000> for<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.330> chassis<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> only

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
really great for the chassis the only

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.140 
really great for the chassis the only
problem<00:02:39.380> was<00:02:39.500> machining<00:02:40.159> it<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.790> was<00:02:40.909> really

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
problem was machining it it was really

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.270 
problem was machining it it was really
difficult<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.599> machine<00:02:41.950> initially<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.010> grabbed

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
difficult to machine initially I grabbed

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.280 
difficult to machine initially I grabbed
just<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.760> know<00:02:43.879> some<00:02:44.150> my<00:02:44.299> standard<00:02:44.720> tooling

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
just you know some my standard tooling

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.990 
just you know some my standard tooling
cut<00:02:45.769> into<00:02:46.129> it<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.400> noticed<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.819> just

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
cut into it and I noticed it just

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.059 
cut into it and I noticed it just
instantly<00:02:47.480> kind<00:02:47.659> of<00:02:47.810> swelled<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.409> expanded

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
instantly kind of swelled and expanded

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.250 
instantly kind of swelled and expanded
it<00:02:49.519> is<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> soft<00:02:50.180> plastic<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:50.870> when<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.049> cut

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
it is a soft plastic so when you cut

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.110 
it is a soft plastic so when you cut
into<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:51.769> kind<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.010> wants<00:02:52.159> to<00:02:52.400> expand<00:02:52.939> a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
into it it kind of wants to expand a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.240 
into it it kind of wants to expand a
little<00:02:53.209> bit<00:02:53.470> think<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.650> as<00:02:54.799> being<00:02:54.980> like

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
little bit think of it as being like

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.679 
little bit think of it as being like
under<00:02:55.489> compression<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.239> when<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.480> cut

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
under compression so you when you cut

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.170 
under compression so you when you cut
into<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:56.989> kind<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.319> swells<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.860> little<00:02:58.099> bit<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.150> I

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
into it kind of swells a little bit so I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.699 
into it kind of swells a little bit so I
do<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.360> little<00:02:59.569> bit<00:02:59.659> of<00:02:59.720> looking<00:02:59.840> online<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.620> I

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
do a little bit of looking online and I

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.860 
do a little bit of looking online and I
found<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:01.189> you<00:03:01.340> need<00:03:01.599> extremely<00:03:02.599> sharp

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
found that you need extremely sharp

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.830 
found that you need extremely sharp
tooling<00:03:03.440> high-speed<00:03:04.010> steel<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.790> one<00:03:05.569> of<00:03:05.720> the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
tooling high-speed steel is one of the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.020 
tooling high-speed steel is one of the
only<00:03:05.989> things<00:03:06.349> other<00:03:06.620> than<00:03:06.709> carbide<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.879> is

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
only things other than carbide that is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.789 
only things other than carbide that is
sharp<00:03:08.269> enough<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.540> cut<00:03:08.659> this<00:03:09.019> stuff<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.500> if

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
sharp enough to cut this stuff and if

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.220 
sharp enough to cut this stuff and if
you<00:03:09.920> have<00:03:10.069> any<00:03:10.190> coated<00:03:10.760> tooling<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.750> coating

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
you have any coated tooling that coating

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.679 
you have any coated tooling that coating
is<00:03:12.409> just<00:03:12.920> thick<00:03:13.340> enough<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.879> it<00:03:14.150> cuts<00:03:14.480> down

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
is just thick enough that it cuts down

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.690 
is just thick enough that it cuts down
on<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.019> surface<00:03:15.200> edge<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.799> it's<00:03:15.920> not<00:03:16.220> sharp

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
on the surface edge and it's not sharp

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.270 
on the surface edge and it's not sharp
enough<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:17.090> cut<00:03:17.359> UHMW<00:03:18.260> so<00:03:18.859> I<00:03:18.890> end<00:03:19.040> up<00:03:19.159> getting

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
enough to cut UHMW so I end up getting

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.119 
enough to cut UHMW so I end up getting
one<00:03:19.879> of<00:03:20.000> these<00:03:20.209> this<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.599> a<00:03:20.810> zero<00:03:21.409> flute<00:03:21.739> or<00:03:21.950> a

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
one of these this is a zero flute or a

one of these this is a zero flute or a
flute<00:03:22.519> bit<00:03:22.819> and<00:03:23.090> it's<00:03:23.959> kind<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.319> faceted<00:03:24.829> along

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
flute bit and it's kind of faceted along

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.879 
flute bit and it's kind of faceted along
here<00:03:25.519> it<00:03:25.579> has<00:03:25.790> one<00:03:26.150> spiral<00:03:26.900> flute<00:03:27.170> along<00:03:27.650> it

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
here it has one spiral flute along it

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.970 
here it has one spiral flute along it
that<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.159> extremely<00:03:28.970> sharp<00:03:29.510> cuts<00:03:30.409> your<00:03:30.590> skin

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
that is extremely sharp cuts your skin

using this I was able to cut through

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.599 
using this I was able to cut through
this<00:03:35.690> stuff<00:03:35.959> like<00:03:36.109> butter<00:03:36.379> really<00:03:37.159> quickly

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.699 
and help to pull those chips out you
have<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.819> do<00:03:40.909> it<00:03:41.030> really<00:03:41.389> slow<00:03:41.720> rpm<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:42.440> think<00:03:42.650> I

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
have to do it really slow rpm I think I

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.190 
have to do it really slow rpm I think I
did<00:03:42.859> something<00:03:43.190> like<00:03:43.280> 500<00:03:44.150> rpm<00:03:44.569> or<00:03:44.780> slower

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
did something like 500 rpm or slower

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.869 
did something like 500 rpm or slower
kind<00:03:45.859> of<00:03:45.920> like<00:03:46.010> what<00:03:46.099> you<00:03:46.220> would<00:03:46.340> do<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.459> steel

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
kind of like what you would do a steel

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.110 
kind of like what you would do a steel
and<00:03:47.209> I<00:03:47.569> did<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> relatively<00:03:48.440> fast<00:03:48.799> feed<00:03:49.250> rate<00:03:49.519> so

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
and I did a relatively fast feed rate so

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.819 
and I did a relatively fast feed rate so
that<00:03:50.269> as<00:03:50.359> it<00:03:50.389> cut<00:03:50.750> through<00:03:51.019> was<00:03:51.230> able<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.530> make

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
that as it cut through was able to make

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.729 
that as it cut through was able to make
large<00:03:52.190> carving<00:03:53.120> chunks<00:03:53.660> out<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.230> material

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
large carving chunks out of the material

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.920 
large carving chunks out of the material
and<00:03:54.919> get<00:03:55.430> them<00:03:55.609> out<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.849> there<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:56.150> still<00:03:56.629> cut

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
and get them out of there I still cut

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.020 
and get them out of there I still cut
with<00:03:57.169> a<00:03:57.349> shop<00:03:57.650> vac<00:03:57.919> to<00:03:58.190> excavate<00:03:58.760> all<00:03:58.790> the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
with a shop vac to excavate all the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.129 
with a shop vac to excavate all the
chips<00:03:59.299> because<00:03:59.449> as<00:03:59.660> I<00:03:59.780> started<00:04:00.079> getting

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
chips because as I started getting

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.710 
chips because as I started getting
further<00:04:01.040> down<00:04:01.489> they<00:04:01.760> would<00:04:01.910> kind<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.209> build<00:04:02.480> up

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
further down they would kind of build up

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.689 
further down they would kind of build up
and<00:04:02.989> get<00:04:03.139> in<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.319> way<00:04:03.440> so<00:04:03.500> it<00:04:04.280> took<00:04:04.459> a<00:04:04.579> little

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
and get in the way so it took a little

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.159 
and get in the way so it took a little
bit<00:04:04.819> of<00:04:04.940> patience<00:04:05.389> and<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.540> went<00:04:05.720> through<00:04:05.780> a<00:04:05.959> lot

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
bit of patience and I went through a lot

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.470 
bit of patience and I went through a lot
of<00:04:06.230> different<00:04:06.530> jassi's<00:04:07.069> but<00:04:07.340> after<00:04:08.090> I<00:04:08.120> figured

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
of different jassi's but after I figured

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.479 
of different jassi's but after I figured
out<00:04:08.599> I<00:04:08.660> got<00:04:08.959> a<00:04:08.989> really<00:04:09.260> good<00:04:09.530> finish<00:04:09.799> off<00:04:10.129> of<00:04:10.370> it

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
out I got a really good finish off of it

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.189 
out I got a really good finish off of it
and<00:04:10.639> I<00:04:11.000> was<00:04:11.120> able<00:04:11.299> to<00:04:11.329> crank<00:04:11.629> these<00:04:11.780> out<00:04:11.989> about

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
and I was able to crank these out about

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.309 
and I was able to crank these out about
20<00:04:12.470> minutes<00:04:12.859> both<00:04:13.819> designs<00:04:14.359> were<00:04:14.720> done<00:04:14.750> in

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
20 minutes both designs were done in

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.259 
20 minutes both designs were done in
SolidWorks<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:16.430> if<00:04:16.579> we<00:04:16.699> look<00:04:16.880> at<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.120> old

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
SolidWorks and if we look at the old

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.719 
SolidWorks and if we look at the old
design<00:04:17.660> versus<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.289> new<00:04:18.440> design<00:04:18.799> although

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
design versus the new design although

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.610 
design versus the new design although
they<00:04:19.880> look<00:04:20.060> pretty<00:04:20.449> different<00:04:20.750> they<00:04:21.199> actually

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
they look pretty different they actually

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.100 
they look pretty different they actually
share<00:04:21.859> a<00:04:21.889> lot<00:04:22.099> of<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.220> same<00:04:22.490> components<00:04:23.210> if<00:04:23.330> we

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
share a lot of the same components if we

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.560 
share a lot of the same components if we
isolate<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:25.160> chassis<00:04:25.820> on<00:04:25.940> both<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.330> them<00:04:26.419> you

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
isolate the chassis on both of them you

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.180 
isolate the chassis on both of them you
can<00:04:26.720> see<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.080> chassis<00:04:27.530> has<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.740> lot<00:04:28.159> of

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
can see that the chassis has a lot of

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.149 
can see that the chassis has a lot of
similar<00:04:28.669> components<00:04:29.210> between<00:04:29.389> the<00:04:29.810> two<00:04:30.159> the

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
similar components between the two the

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.899 
similar components between the two the
main<00:04:31.940> cavity<00:04:32.780> as<00:04:33.020> well<00:04:33.620> as<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:34.190> wheel<00:04:34.490> and

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:34.909 
main cavity as well as the wheel and

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.330 
main cavity as well as the wheel and
motor<00:04:35.210> mounts<00:04:35.780> are<00:04:35.900> shared<00:04:36.710> between<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.310> two

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
motor mounts are shared between the two

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.550 
motor mounts are shared between the two
chassis<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:38.449> whole<00:04:38.780> design<00:04:39.080> worked<00:04:39.320> pretty

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
chassis the whole design worked pretty

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.350 
chassis the whole design worked pretty
well<00:04:39.800> on<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.099> old<00:04:40.220> chassis<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.789> just<00:04:41.060> need<00:04:41.240> to

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
well on the old chassis I just need to

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.659 
well on the old chassis I just need to
shift<00:04:41.750> some<00:04:41.960> stuff<00:04:41.990> around<00:04:42.349> so<00:04:42.860> you<00:04:43.310> notice

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
shift some stuff around so you notice

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.779 
shift some stuff around so you notice
that<00:04:43.699> the<00:04:44.710> wheels<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.190> motors<00:04:46.580> on<00:04:46.760> the

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
that the wheels and the motors on the

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.969 
that the wheels and the motors on the
old<00:04:47.060> one<00:04:47.360> sat<00:04:47.659> towards<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.199> back<00:04:48.409> and<00:04:48.800> on<00:04:48.860> the

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
old one sat towards the back and on the

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.770 
old one sat towards the back and on the
new<00:04:49.159> one<00:04:49.430> they<00:04:49.639> sit<00:04:49.909> more<00:04:50.180> towards<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.750> middle

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
new one they sit more towards the middle

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.529 
new one they sit more towards the middle
or<00:04:51.260> closer<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:51.949> the<00:04:52.460> weapon<00:04:52.970> which<00:04:53.150> is<00:04:53.180> where

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
or closer to the weapon which is where

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.230 
or closer to the weapon which is where
most<00:04:53.810> of<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.169> weight<00:04:54.409> sits<00:04:54.860> this<00:04:55.400> helps<00:04:55.849> it<00:04:56.000> to

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
most of the weight sits this helps it to

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.969 
most of the weight sits this helps it to
drive<00:04:56.630> a<00:04:56.659> little<00:04:56.930> bit<00:04:57.050> better<00:04:57.320> as<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:57.800> more

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
drive a little bit better as it more

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:58.510 
drive a little bit better as it more
even

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
even

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.790 
even
distributes<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.210> weight<00:04:59.240> along<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.500> whole

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
distributes the weight along the whole

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.619 
distributes the weight along the whole
robot<00:05:01.069> and<00:05:01.580> gives<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.150> more<00:05:02.300> traction

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
robot and gives it more traction

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.550 
robot and gives it more traction
ultimately<00:05:03.879> really<00:05:04.879> only<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.449> motors<00:05:06.080> mount

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
ultimately really only the motors mount

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.070 
ultimately really only the motors mount
to<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.190> chassis<00:05:07.669> itself<00:05:08.300> they<00:05:08.479> kind<00:05:08.720> of<00:05:08.780> press

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
to the chassis itself they kind of press

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.270 
to the chassis itself they kind of press
fit<00:05:09.319> in<00:05:09.440> here<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:09.800> there's<00:05:09.979> these<00:05:10.099> little

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
fit in here and there's these little

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.089 
fit in here and there's these little
tabs<00:05:10.639> that<00:05:10.970> slide<00:05:11.750> inside<00:05:12.199> on<00:05:12.409> top<00:05:12.650> of<00:05:12.889> that

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
tabs that slide inside on top of that

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.879 
tabs that slide inside on top of that
and<00:05:13.509> the<00:05:14.509> weapon<00:05:14.780> drawn<00:05:14.990> mounts<00:05:15.409> up<00:05:15.560> here<00:05:15.800> and

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
and the weapon drawn mounts up here and

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.200 
and the weapon drawn mounts up here and
we'll<00:05:15.979> talk<00:05:16.159> about<00:05:16.310> that<00:05:16.430> later<00:05:16.580> but

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
we'll talk about that later but

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.180 
we'll talk about that later but
everything<00:05:17.509> else<00:05:17.659> just<00:05:17.900> kind<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:18.229> is<00:05:18.560> nestled

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
everything else just kind of is nestled

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.339 
everything else just kind of is nestled
inside<00:05:19.400> this<00:05:19.789> milk<00:05:20.060> cavity<00:05:20.509> so<00:05:20.960> I<00:05:20.990> needed<00:05:21.229> a

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
inside this milk cavity so I needed a

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.950 
inside this milk cavity so I needed a
way<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.530> keep<00:05:21.949> it<00:05:22.099> all<00:05:22.190> contained<00:05:22.699> so<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:23.720> have

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
way to keep it all contained so I have

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.050 
way to keep it all contained so I have
these<00:05:24.169> little<00:05:24.229> armor<00:05:24.860> plates<00:05:25.190> which<00:05:25.520> one<00:05:25.879> goes

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
these little armor plates which one goes

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.510 
these little armor plates which one goes
on<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.330> top<00:05:26.539> one<00:05:27.050> goes<00:05:27.080> on<00:05:27.379> the<00:05:27.500> bottom<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.039> it

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
on the top one goes on the bottom and it

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.369 
on the top one goes on the bottom and it
keeps<00:05:28.759> everything<00:05:29.090> secured<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:29.960> contained

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
keeps everything secured and contained

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.830 
keeps everything secured and contained
inside<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:31.130> compartments<00:05:31.729> and<00:05:31.880> also<00:05:32.539> adds<00:05:32.720> a

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
inside the compartments and also adds a

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.390 
inside the compartments and also adds a
little<00:05:32.990> bit<00:05:33.080> of<00:05:33.199> structural<00:05:33.650> rigidity<00:05:33.830> to

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
little bit of structural rigidity to

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.210

of materials that they have g10 is a

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.649 
of materials that they have g10 is a
version<00:06:07.759> of<00:06:07.940> Garrett<00:06:08.240> light<00:06:08.360> there's<00:06:08.569> all

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
version of Garrett light there's all

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.360 
version of Garrett light there's all
sorts<00:06:08.930> of<00:06:08.990> different<00:06:09.229> versions<00:06:09.860> of<00:06:10.009> it<00:06:10.159> and

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
sorts of different versions of it and

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.969 
sorts of different versions of it and
g10<00:06:11.090> is<00:06:11.240> really<00:06:11.509> good<00:06:11.659> for<00:06:11.840> impact<00:06:12.319> resistance

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
g10 is really good for impact resistance

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.309 
g10 is really good for impact resistance
and<00:06:13.159> just<00:06:13.250> tensile<00:06:13.849> strength<00:06:14.150> so<00:06:14.449> it's<00:06:15.169> good

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
and just tensile strength so it's good

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.589 
and just tensile strength so it's good
stuff<00:06:15.500> for<00:06:15.710> that<00:06:15.800> the<00:06:16.250> only<00:06:16.490> downside<00:06:17.360> to<00:06:17.389> this

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
stuff for that the only downside to this

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.420 
stuff for that the only downside to this
is<00:06:17.659> once<00:06:17.990> again<00:06:18.139> machining<00:06:18.800> all<00:06:18.949> these<00:06:19.159> kind

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
is once again machining all these kind

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.580 
is once again machining all these kind
of<00:06:19.550> weird<00:06:19.759> exotic<00:06:20.180> materials<00:06:20.659> have<00:06:20.870> downsides

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
of weird exotic materials have downsides

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.070 
of weird exotic materials have downsides
to<00:06:21.830> machining<00:06:22.279> them<00:06:22.460> you<00:06:23.000> can<00:06:23.389> machine<00:06:23.690> this

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
to machining them you can machine this

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.290 
to machining them you can machine this
with<00:06:24.319> normal<00:06:24.770> tooling<00:06:25.279> but<00:06:25.789> because<00:06:26.120> it's

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
with normal tooling but because it's

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.320 
with normal tooling but because it's
highly<00:06:26.539> abrasive<00:06:27.110> the<00:06:27.590> more<00:06:27.919> you<00:06:28.250> machine<00:06:29.180> it

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
highly abrasive the more you machine it

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.659 
highly abrasive the more you machine it
with<00:06:29.479> that<00:06:29.690> tool<00:06:29.990> it<00:06:30.469> will<00:06:30.770> just<00:06:31.039> wear<00:06:31.250> it<00:06:31.430> down

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
with that tool it will just wear it down

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.790 
with that tool it will just wear it down
you're<00:06:32.150> supposed<00:06:32.599> to<00:06:32.719> use<00:06:33.020> like<00:06:33.319> a<00:06:33.349> diamond

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
you're supposed to use like a diamond

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.529 
you're supposed to use like a diamond
impregnated<00:06:34.400> carbide<00:06:34.849> or<00:06:35.029> something<00:06:35.389> like

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
impregnated carbide or something like

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.600 
impregnated carbide or something like
that<00:06:35.779> that<00:06:35.990> kind<00:06:36.139> of<00:06:36.319> self<00:06:36.529> sharpens<00:06:37.009> but<00:06:37.340> I

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
that that kind of self sharpens but I

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.550 
that that kind of self sharpens but I
didn't<00:06:38.389> want<00:06:38.509> to<00:06:38.569> buy<00:06:38.719> any<00:06:38.930> of<00:06:39.050> that<00:06:39.169> so<00:06:39.319> I<00:06:39.349> just

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
didn't want to buy any of that so I just

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.469 
didn't want to buy any of that so I just
kind<00:06:39.740> of<00:06:39.770> use<00:06:39.949> an<00:06:40.099> inexpensive<00:06:40.310> carbide<00:06:41.180> tool

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
kind of use an inexpensive carbide tool

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.080 
kind of use an inexpensive carbide tool
I<00:06:41.810> tried<00:06:42.620> like<00:06:42.770> a<00:06:42.830> burr<00:06:43.250> you<00:06:43.639> know<00:06:43.819> for<00:06:44.060> a

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
I tried like a burr you know for a

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.839 
I tried like a burr you know for a
dremel<00:06:44.840> that<00:06:45.289> didn't<00:06:45.620> work<00:06:46.069> very<00:06:46.099> well<00:06:46.460> so<00:06:46.789> I

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
dremel that didn't work very well so I

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.730 
dremel that didn't work very well so I
just<00:06:47.060> used<00:06:47.270> you<00:06:47.539> know<00:06:47.569> some<00:06:47.900> tooling<00:06:48.259> I<00:06:48.409> had<00:06:48.620> on

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
just used you know some tooling I had on

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.709 
just used you know some tooling I had on
hand<00:06:48.770> and<00:06:49.310> there<00:06:49.699> really<00:06:49.940> wasn't<00:06:50.240> that<00:06:50.509> much

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
hand and there really wasn't that much

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:52.809 
hand and there really wasn't that much
of<00:06:50.900> it<00:06:51.020> to<00:06:51.139> cut<00:06:51.409> it<00:06:51.830> drills<00:06:52.250> pretty<00:06:52.580> good

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
of it to cut it drills pretty good

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:54.399 
of it to cut it drills pretty good
although<00:06:53.150> you<00:06:53.210> need<00:06:53.599> to<00:06:53.750> use<00:06:53.870> some<00:06:54.139> kind<00:06:54.319> of

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:54.409 
although you need to use some kind of

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:56.769 
although you need to use some kind of
countersink<00:06:55.009> to<00:06:55.130> clean<00:06:55.340> up<00:06:55.490> the<00:06:55.639> holes<00:06:55.819> and<00:06:56.120> I

00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:56.779 
countersink to clean up the holes and I

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:59.320 
countersink to clean up the holes and I
did<00:06:56.960> make<00:06:57.169> a<00:06:57.199> couple<00:06:57.529> extra<00:06:57.800> plates<00:06:58.400> because

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
did make a couple extra plates because

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.110 
did make a couple extra plates because
as<00:06:59.630> you<00:06:59.810> can<00:06:59.990> see<00:07:00.199> it<00:07:00.349> does<00:07:00.680> get<00:07:01.009> torn<00:07:01.370> up<00:07:01.580> if<00:07:01.849> it

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
as you can see it does get torn up if it

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.999 
as you can see it does get torn up if it
starts<00:07:02.449> getting<00:07:02.599> hit<00:07:03.020> a<00:07:03.050> lot<00:07:03.110> because<00:07:03.800> this<00:07:03.949> is

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:04.009 
starts getting hit a lot because this is
