00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
knife in there again sharp edge against

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.880 
knife in there again sharp edge against
the<00:02:23.310> grease<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.050> makes<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.349> very<00:02:25.560> tight

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
the grease and that makes a very tight

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.479 
the grease and that makes a very tight
fit<00:02:26.130> when<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.150> comes<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.380> forks<00:02:28.920> actually

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
fit when it comes to the forks actually

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.130 
fit when it comes to the forks actually
there's<00:02:29.640> something<00:02:29.670> very<00:02:29.970> simple<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.930> said

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
there's something very simple so said

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.170 
there's something very simple so said
you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.349> just<00:02:31.470> use<00:02:31.650> old<00:02:31.950> recycle<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
you can just use old recycle the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.280 
priority mail boxes and we can cut off
and<00:02:35.880> here<00:02:36.120> wouldn't<00:02:36.569> get<00:02:36.690> used<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.110> anything

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
and here wouldn't get used for anything

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.990 
and here wouldn't get used for anything
else<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.970> fold<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.930> half<00:02:41.000> like

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
else and we can fold that in half like

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.420 
else and we can fold that in half like
this<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.660> then<00:02:43.650> I'm<00:02:43.800> going<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.980> take<00:02:44.160> my
