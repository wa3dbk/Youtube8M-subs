actually<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.840> develop<00:01:16.200> something<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.530> will

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
actually do develop something that will

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.630 
actually do develop something that will
that's<00:01:16.920> why<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.070> guys<00:01:17.220> won't<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.490> any

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that's why you guys won't see any

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
that's why you guys won't see any
supporting<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.540> bio<00:01:18.720> grow<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> other

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
supporting like bio grow and other

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440 
supporting like bio grow and other
things<00:01:19.650> purely<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.640> something<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.240> bio

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
things purely because something like bio

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.840 
things purely because something like bio
grow<00:01:21.780> included<00:01:22.530> products<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.369> technically

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
grow included products in it technically

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.480 
grow included products in it technically
that<00:01:24.330> might<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.290> water<00:01:25.500> violations<00:01:26.280> so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
that might be water violations so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.620 
that might be water violations so
therefore<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:26.909> you're<00:01:27.030> taking<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.540> you're

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
therefore if you're taking it you're

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
therefore if you're taking it you're
using<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.110> banned<00:01:28.320> substance<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.009> if

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.749 
not particularly bioavailable orally but
you<00:01:37.439> would<00:01:37.590> still<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.950> breaking<00:01:38.400> rules<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you would still be breaking rules the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.880 
you would still be breaking rules the
people<00:01:38.970> who<00:01:39.060> took<00:01:39.240> bio<00:01:39.509> grow<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.140> example<00:01:40.650> or

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
people who took bio grow for example or

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.219 
people who took bio grow for example or
technically<00:01:41.340> breaking<00:01:41.880> water<00:01:42.299> rules<00:01:42.630> but

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
technically breaking water rules but

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.480 
technically breaking water rules but
there's<00:01:43.409> no<00:01:43.560> reason<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.920> believe<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.220> those

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
there's no reason to believe that those

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
there's no reason to believe that those
peptides<00:01:44.790> are<00:01:45.329> orally<00:01:45.600> active<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
peptides are orally active and that

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.630 
peptides are orally active and that
you're<00:01:46.530> actually<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> make<00:01:47.130> gains<00:01:47.369> off

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you're actually going to make gains off

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.300 
you're actually going to make gains off
of<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.509> that's<00:01:48.659> kind<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.079> catch-22<00:01:49.770> there

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
of it so that's kind of a catch-22 there

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.649 
of it so that's kind of a catch-22 there
it's<00:01:50.490> kind<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.850> telling<00:01:51.210> people<00:01:51.240> will<00:01:51.570> if

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it's kind of like telling people will if

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.630 
it's kind of like telling people will if
you<00:01:51.780> drink<00:01:52.020> trenbolone<00:01:52.409> you're<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.130> natural

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you drink trenbolone you're not natural

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.580 
you drink trenbolone you're not natural
anymore<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.180> you're<00:01:54.659> stupid<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.530> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
anymore but you're stupid so you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.899 
anymore but you're stupid so you
sell<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> same<00:01:56.130> sort<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.369> thing<00:01:56.430> marketed

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
sell the same sort of thing marketed

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.959 
sell the same sort of thing marketed
there<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> problem<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.969> what

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
there and so the problem is that what

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.030 
there and so the problem is that what
ends<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.689> happening<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.229> every<00:02:01.530> time<00:02:01.710> any

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
ends up happening is that every time any

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
ends up happening is that every time any
product<00:02:02.460> does<00:02:02.700> come<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.420> seems<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.810> have

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
product does come out that seems to have

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.690 
product does come out that seems to have
a<00:02:03.990> true<00:02:04.350> anabolic<00:02:04.950> fact<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> capable

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
a true anabolic fact that is a capable

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.609 
a true anabolic fact that is a capable
of<00:02:06.060> helping<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.719> gain<00:02:06.869> muscle<00:02:07.259> mass<00:02:07.290> there

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
of helping you gain muscle mass there

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.839 
of helping you gain muscle mass there
been<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> few<00:02:07.950> over<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> years<00:02:08.280> what<00:02:08.610> ends<00:02:08.789> up

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
been a few over the years what ends up

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.809 
been a few over the years what ends up
happening<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:10.160> anabolic<00:02:11.160> drugs<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
happening because anabolic drugs in the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.490 
happening because anabolic drugs in the
United<00:02:12.239> States<00:02:12.420> are<00:02:12.690> /<00:02:13.170> script

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
and only what ends up happening anything

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.700 
and only what ends up happening anything
that's<00:02:15.360> going<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.600> build<00:02:15.840> muscle<00:02:15.990> mass<00:02:16.320> once

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
that's going to build muscle mass once

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.770 
that's going to build muscle mass once
it<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:16.860> determined<00:02:17.480> scientifically<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.570> it

it is determined scientifically that it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.390 
it is determined scientifically that it
actually<00:02:18.960> does<00:02:19.350> help<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.710> build<00:02:19.890> muscle<00:02:20.040> mass

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400
