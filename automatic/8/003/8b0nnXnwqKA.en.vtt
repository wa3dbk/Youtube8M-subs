00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
a daisy cutter so I'm trying to use

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.040 
a daisy cutter so I'm trying to use
whatever<00:00:21.980> I<00:00:22.190> have<00:00:22.490> not<00:00:23.270> to<00:00:23.420> buy<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:23.600> bunch<00:00:23.869> of

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
whatever I have not to buy a bunch of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.040 
whatever I have not to buy a bunch of
stuff<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:24.500> this<00:00:24.920> is<00:00:25.100> how<00:00:25.279> I<00:00:25.340> do<00:00:25.490> my<00:00:25.810> middle<00:00:26.810> part

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
stuff so this is how I do my middle part

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.439 
stuff so this is how I do my middle part
so<00:00:27.859> I<00:00:27.890> roll<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:28.550> dough<00:00:28.760> enough<00:00:29.240> my

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
so I roll the dough enough my

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.880 
so I roll the dough enough my
cauliflower<00:00:31.419> but<00:00:32.419> this<00:00:32.689> make<00:00:33.109> sure<00:00:33.140> it's<00:00:33.679> nice

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
cauliflower but this make sure it's nice

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.459 
cauliflower but this make sure it's nice
and<00:00:33.949> smooth

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
and smooth

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:43.169 
and smooth
okay<00:00:36.499> and<00:00:37.190> after<00:00:37.960> this<00:00:38.960> flower<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:39.649> cut<00:00:39.920> in<00:00:40.100> half

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.209 

so<00:00:44.179> just<00:00:44.479> cut<00:00:44.719> in<00:00:44.870> half<00:00:45.229> this<00:00:45.469> flower<00:00:45.799> just

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
so just cut in half this flower just

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.799 
so just cut in half this flower just
like<00:00:46.549> this<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:47.629> have<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.049> two<00:00:48.409> pieces<00:00:49.600> if<00:00:50.600> I

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
like this so I have a two pieces if I

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.789 
like this so I have a two pieces if I
take<00:00:51.019> my<00:00:51.170> phone<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.920> I<00:00:52.129> take<00:00:52.629> my<00:00:53.629> elbow<00:00:54.350> tool

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
take my phone and I take my elbow tool

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.529 
take my phone and I take my elbow tool
and<00:00:55.760> I'm<00:00:56.299> just<00:00:56.329> going<00:00:56.569> to<00:00:56.780> go<00:00:56.929> like<00:00:56.959> this<00:00:57.109> to

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
and I'm just going to go like this to

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.809 
and I'm just going to go like this to
make<00:00:59.539> it<00:00:59.569> spin<00:00:59.989> there<00:01:00.199> a<00:01:00.229> little<00:01:00.889> earlier<00:01:01.429> just

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
make it spin there a little earlier just

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:09.760 
make it spin there a little earlier just
like<00:01:02.809> this<00:01:07.780> so<00:01:08.780> that's<00:01:08.990> all<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:09.140> do

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
like this so that's all I do

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.020 
like this so that's all I do
and<00:01:10.000> after<00:01:11.000> I<00:01:11.060> take<00:01:11.570> this<00:01:11.780> part<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:13.160> just<00:01:13.220> roll

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
and after I take this part and just roll

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.290 
and after I take this part and just roll
it<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.800> can<00:01:15.800> do<00:01:15.980> it<00:01:16.070> inside<00:01:16.250> or<00:01:16.730> you<00:01:16.850> can<00:01:17.030> do<00:01:17.180> it

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
it you can do it inside or you can do it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.880 
it you can do it inside or you can do it
outside<00:01:17.480> so<00:01:18.490> just<00:01:19.490> like<00:01:19.700> this<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:21.830> is

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
outside so just like this and this is

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.550 
outside so just like this and this is
what<00:01:22.160> I<00:01:22.190> have<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:25.330> after<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.600> insert<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.320> wire

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
what I have and after I insert the wire

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.840 
what I have and after I insert the wire
in<00:01:27.830> there<00:01:30.100> you<00:01:31.100> can<00:01:31.250> dip<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.550> in<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.760> glue<00:01:31.970> also

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
in there you can dip it in the glue also

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.130 
in there you can dip it in the glue also
still<00:01:34.850> if<00:01:34.910> I<00:01:35.000> put<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.390> inside

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
still if I put it inside

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.240 
still if I put it inside
make<00:01:36.860> sure<00:01:37.130> it's<00:01:37.340> paid<00:01:37.580> nicely<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:39.110> after<00:01:39.860> I

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
make sure it's paid nicely and after I

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.770 
make sure it's paid nicely and after I
just<00:01:40.700> hand<00:01:41.120> in<00:01:41.620> I<00:01:42.620> just<00:01:43.250> hand<00:01:43.460> them<00:01:43.550> on<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.210> cup

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
just hand in I just hand them on the cup

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.700 
just hand in I just hand them on the cup
holder<00:01:46.180> just<00:01:47.180> like<00:01:47.330> this<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.870> let<00:01:48.110> them<00:01:48.290> dry

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
holder just like this and let them dry

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.230 
holder just like this and let them dry
until<00:01:49.159> it's<00:01:49.580> nice<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:49.880> dry<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.680> I<00:01:52.580> would<00:01:53.060> need

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
until it's nice and dry so I would need

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.910 
until it's nice and dry so I would need
probably<00:01:53.990> about<00:01:54.170> 35<00:01:54.890> pieces<00:01:55.220> for<00:01:55.760> one<00:01:56.510> flower

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
probably about 35 pieces for one flower

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.200 
probably about 35 pieces for one flower
and<00:01:57.920> after<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.460> I'll<00:01:58.760> just<00:01:59.650> make<00:02:00.650> petals<00:02:01.640> I

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
and after that I'll just make petals I

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.390 
and after that I'll just make petals I
make<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> smaller<00:02:02.870> ones<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:04.040> then<00:02:04.190> make<00:02:04.370> a

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
make a smaller ones and then make a

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.550 
make a smaller ones and then make a
bigger<00:02:04.729> one<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:05.120> I'll<00:02:05.900> probably<00:02:06.200> make<00:02:06.409> about

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
bigger one so I'll probably make about

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.559 
bigger one so I'll probably make about
five<00:02:06.979> smaller<00:02:07.400> ones<00:02:07.700> about<00:02:08.689> like<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:09.049> sec

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
five smaller ones about like a sec

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.740 
five smaller ones about like a sec
the<00:02:09.989> bigger<00:02:10.170> size<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.849> how<00:02:12.030> idea<00:02:12.390> just

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the bigger size so this is how idea just

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:26.440 
the bigger size so this is how idea just
cut<00:02:13.049> it<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:14.790> sure<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.180> nice<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.390> clean

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.839 

this<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.659> wasn't<00:02:27.840> clean<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.890> use<00:02:29.159> my<00:02:29.549> phone

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
this one wasn't clean just use my phone

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.839 
this one wasn't clean just use my phone
again<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.659> I<00:02:31.620> use<00:02:31.769> my<00:02:32.040> bowl<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.470> just<00:02:34.470> make<00:02:34.650> it

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
again and I use my bowl to just make it

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:45.080 
again and I use my bowl to just make it
edges<00:02:35.849> little<00:02:36.209> thinner<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.109> this<00:02:44.090> so

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
edges little thinner just like this so

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.430 
edges little thinner just like this so
when<00:02:45.299> they're<00:02:45.420> gonna<00:02:45.569> put<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.049> wire<00:02:46.230> inside

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
when they're gonna put the wire inside

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.009 
when they're gonna put the wire inside
dip<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.799> glue<00:02:50.480> just<00:02:51.480> put<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> wire

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
dip it in the glue just put a wire

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.920 
dip it in the glue just put a wire
inside<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:56.099> just<00:02:56.129> want<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.639> let<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:56.879> dry<00:02:57.030> on

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
inside and I just want to let it dry on

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.759 
inside and I just want to let it dry on
my<00:02:58.170> apple<00:02:58.769> tree<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.220> got<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.879> from<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.239> store<00:03:00.769> so

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
my apple tree I got it from the store so

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.160 
my apple tree I got it from the store so
just<00:03:02.010> put<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.220> my<00:03:02.819> apple<00:03:03.180> tree<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.659> let<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.109> dry

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170
