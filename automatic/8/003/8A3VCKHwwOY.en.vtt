okay<00:00:01.380> I'd<00:00:01.469> like<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.740> continue<00:00:02.100> by<00:00:02.399> finishing

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
okay I'd like to continue by finishing

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.970 
okay I'd like to continue by finishing
up<00:00:03.120> my<00:00:03.859> discussion<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:05.069> tuning<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.980> segue

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
up my discussion on tuning and segue

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.140 
up my discussion on tuning and segue
into<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:09.120> beginnings<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.750> double<00:00:10.139> stops<00:00:11.150> for

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
into the beginnings of double stops for

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.600 
into the beginnings of double stops for
both<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.840> need<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.049> know<00:00:13.320> how<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.620> use<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.370> bow

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
both you need to know how to use the bow

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.779 
both you need to know how to use the bow
in<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.330> way<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.750> doesn't<00:00:15.980> disrupt<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.520> pitch

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
in a way that doesn't disrupt the pitch

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.529 
in a way that doesn't disrupt the pitch
if<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.990> add<00:00:19.289> too<00:00:19.650> much<00:00:19.680> bow<00:00:20.100> weight<00:00:20.369> or<00:00:21.300> you're

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
if you add too much bow weight or you're

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.929 
if you add too much bow weight or you're
sliding<00:00:22.260> between<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.460> birds<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
sliding between the birds and the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.970 
sliding between the birds and the
fingerboard<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.779> don't<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> steady<00:00:25.560> or

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
fingerboard you don't have a steady or

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.050 
fingerboard you don't have a steady or
sustained<00:00:26.430> tone<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.840> disrupts

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
sustained tone and it disrupts

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.150 
sustained tone and it disrupts
dramatically<00:00:30.060> what<00:00:30.990> you're<00:00:31.140> trying<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.650> hear

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
dramatically what you're trying to hear

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.530 
dramatically what you're trying to hear
so<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.960> actually<00:00:34.140> bend<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.710> string

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
so that you can actually bend the string

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.110 
so that you can actually bend the string
out<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.780> tune<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.320> your<00:00:37.469> right<00:00:37.680> hand<00:00:38.120> which

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
out of tune with your right hand which

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400 
out of tune with your right hand which
has<00:00:39.300> nothing<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.050> left<00:00:40.230> hand

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
has nothing to do with your left hand

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.190 
has nothing to do with your left hand
being<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.980> tune<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.899> my<00:00:42.899> advice<00:00:43.170> for

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
being out of tune so my advice for

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.510 
being out of tune so my advice for
tuning<00:00:44.390> when<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.480> first<00:00:45.719> start<00:00:46.020> tuning<00:00:46.520> put

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
tuning when you first start tuning put

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.850 
tuning when you first start tuning put
your<00:00:47.670> bow<00:00:47.820> at<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.000> tip<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.629> start<00:00:49.559> balancing

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
your bow at the tip and start balancing

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:58.599 
your bow at the tip and start balancing
on<00:00:50.340> two<00:00:50.550> strings<00:00:53.059> small<00:00:54.059> motions<00:00:54.890> motions

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.330 

after<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.000> small<00:01:01.070> keeping<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> bow

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
after you can do small keeping the bow

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520 
after you can do small keeping the bow
on<00:01:02.520> two<00:01:02.670> strings

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
on two strings

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.800 
on two strings
longer

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.020 

full<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:14.990> sustained<00:01:15.380> bows<00:01:15.680> but<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:16.700> want<00:01:16.909> to

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
full and sustained bows but you want to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.580 
full and sustained bows but you want to
be<00:01:17.150> able<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.390> do<00:01:17.600> that<00:01:17.750> while<00:01:17.990> you're<00:01:18.170> tuning

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
be able to do that while you're tuning

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.580 
be able to do that while you're tuning
your<00:01:18.770> instrument<00:01:19.720> so<00:01:20.720> that<00:01:20.900> you<00:01:21.050> can<00:01:21.229> listen

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
your instrument so that you can listen

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.800 
your instrument so that you can listen
carefully<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.640> not<00:01:23.060> be<00:01:23.800> distracted<00:01:24.800> or

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
carefully and not be distracted or

carefully and not be distracted or
confused<00:01:26.810> by<00:01:27.619> things<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.280> bow<00:01:28.490> are

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
confused by things that you bow are

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.350 
confused by things that you bow are
doing<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.750> just<00:01:29.930> focus<00:01:30.470> on<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.710> intonation

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
doing you just focus on the intonation

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.420 
doing you just focus on the intonation
now<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.660> to<00:01:32.960> begin<00:01:33.350> double<00:01:33.770> stop<00:01:33.979> studies

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
now to the to begin double stop studies

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.670 
now to the to begin double stop studies
you<00:01:34.940> must<00:01:35.180> also<00:01:35.390> be<00:01:35.630> able<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.140> do<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.500> same

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
you must also be able to do the same

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.520 
you must also be able to do the same
thing<00:01:36.979> double<00:01:37.759> stops<00:01:38.000> are<00:01:38.810> produced<00:01:39.290> by

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
thing double stops are produced by

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.649 
thing double stops are produced by
putting<00:01:40.220> your<00:01:40.340> bowing<00:01:40.580> two<00:01:40.790> strings<00:01:41.180> playing

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
putting your bowing two strings playing

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.350 
putting your bowing two strings playing
two<00:01:41.900> notes<00:01:41.930> at<00:01:42.320> once<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.830> then<00:01:43.400> as<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.970> term

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
two notes at once and then as the term

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.279 
two notes at once and then as the term
stops<00:01:44.979> implies<00:01:45.979> you're<00:01:46.670> stopping<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.930> string

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
stops implies you're stopping the string

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.219 
stops implies you're stopping the string
and<00:01:48.649> double<00:01:49.580> stop<00:01:49.789> injury<00:01:50.270> stopping<00:01:51.020> two

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
and double stop injury stopping two

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.770 
and double stop injury stopping two
strings<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:51.830> you're<00:01:52.670> actually<00:01:52.880> creating<00:01:53.300> two

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
strings so you're actually creating two

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.330 
strings so you're actually creating two
pitches<00:01:54.050> and<00:01:54.229> you're<00:01:54.560> pulling<00:01:54.950> them<00:01:55.130> together

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
pitches and you're pulling them together

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.460 
pitches and you're pulling them together
at<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.700> same<00:01:55.880> time<00:01:56.119> we're<00:01:56.990> going<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.289> do

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
at the same time we're going to do

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.050 
at the same time we're going to do
introduction<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.399> double<00:01:58.670> stops<00:01:58.850> which

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
introduction the double stops which

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.850 
introduction the double stops which
means<00:01:59.090> you're<00:01:59.450> only<00:01:59.539> going<00:01:59.869> to<00:01:59.990> do<00:02:00.200> one<00:02:00.500> stop

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
means you're only going to do one stop

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.980 
means you're only going to do one stop
but<00:02:01.610> you're<00:02:01.759> going<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.090> bow<00:02:02.270> with<00:02:02.539> an<00:02:02.690> open

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
but you're going to bow with an open

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.350 
but you're going to bow with an open
string<00:02:03.259> okay<00:02:05.020> if<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.770> have<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.910> ability<00:02:08.330> to

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
string okay if you have the ability to

string okay if you have the ability to
play<00:02:08.660> on<00:02:08.780> two<00:02:08.929> strings<00:02:09.289> you're<00:02:09.500> ready<00:02:09.709> for

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
play on two strings you're ready for

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.360 
play on two strings you're ready for
this<00:02:11.290> all<00:02:12.290> right<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.620> first<00:02:12.800> thing<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.130> want<00:02:13.280> to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
for flutter beats we call them beats but

for flutter beats we call them beats but
it's<00:02:37.000> flutter<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.570> distortion<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.560> sound

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
it's flutter a distortion in the sound

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.580 
it's flutter a distortion in the sound
if<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.480> go<00:02:40.660> too<00:02:40.870> low

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.520 

you'll<00:02:44.160> hear<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.459> noise<00:02:45.170> just<00:02:46.170> sounds<00:02:46.410> out

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
you'll hear that noise just sounds out

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.010 
you'll hear that noise just sounds out
of<00:02:46.620> tune<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.980> Psalms

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.130 

closer<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.950> being<00:02:52.160> in<00:02:52.280> tune<00:02:52.550> make<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.180> smoother

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.040 

then<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.770> rings<00:02:57.950> pure

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
then it rings pure

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.000 
then it rings pure
now<00:03:00.770> if<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.010> leave<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.490> one<00:03:01.760> there<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.770> I<00:03:03.770> play

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
now if I leave that one there and I play

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.100 
now if I leave that one there and I play
with<00:03:04.130> open<00:03:04.580> D<00:03:04.850> string<00:03:07.360> it's<00:03:08.360> not<00:03:08.600> going<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.930> be

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
with open D string it's not going to be

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.050 
with open D string it's not going to be
a<00:03:09.320> smooth<00:03:09.680> sail

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
a smooth sail

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.970 
a smooth sail
my<00:03:11.660> ticket<00:03:12.020> that<00:03:12.200> sounds<00:03:12.440> alright<00:03:12.590> but<00:03:12.860> what

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
my ticket that sounds alright but what

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.020 
my ticket that sounds alright but what
happens<00:03:13.280> if<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.459> go<00:03:13.610> lower

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.710 

did<00:03:17.450> he<00:03:17.510> get<00:03:17.660> smoothing

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.490 

really<00:03:22.290> smooth

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
really smooth

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.400 
really smooth
that's<00:03:24.980> where<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.160> got<00:03:25.310> rid<00:03:25.520> of<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.670> beats<00:03:26.410> now

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
that's where I got rid of the beats now

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.970 
that's where I got rid of the beats now
if<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.590> leave<00:03:27.800> it<00:03:27.830> there<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.220> play<00:03:28.430> with<00:03:28.490> Albany

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
if I leave it there and play with Albany

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.089 
if I leave it there and play with Albany
it's<00:03:30.980> significantly<00:03:31.790> low

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.729 

to<00:03:37.099> make<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.400> smooth<00:03:37.730> so<00:03:38.480> what<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.260> shows<00:03:39.319> you

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
to make it smooth so what that shows you

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.710 
to make it smooth so what that shows you
is<00:03:39.769> there's<00:03:40.370> not<00:03:40.519> just<00:03:40.580> one<00:03:40.819> place<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.510> play

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
is there's not just one place to play

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.930 
is there's not just one place to play
your<00:03:41.989> beat<00:03:42.170> all<00:03:42.890> right<00:03:43.099> depending<00:03:43.640> on<00:03:43.730> what

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
your beat all right depending on what

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.660 
your beat all right depending on what
note<00:03:44.150> you're<00:03:44.180> aiming<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.470> now<00:03:45.890> there's<00:03:46.580> a

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
note you're aiming it to now there's a

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.610 
note you're aiming it to now there's a
lot<00:03:46.849> of<00:03:47.000> theory<00:03:47.269> behind<00:03:47.420> this<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.379> first

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
lot of theory behind this the first

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.080 
lot of theory behind this the first
thing<00:03:48.739> I'm<00:03:48.860> going<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.129> say<00:03:49.370> is<00:03:49.519> if<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:49.910> already

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
thing I'm going to say is if you already

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.270 
thing I'm going to say is if you already
you're<00:03:50.390> studying<00:03:50.629> theory<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.860> know<00:03:52.040> what

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
you're studying theory and you know what

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.190 
you're studying theory and you know what
your<00:03:52.549> perfect<00:03:52.970> integrals<00:03:53.390> are<00:03:53.540> your<00:03:53.810> fourths

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
your perfect integrals are your fourths

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.100 
your perfect integrals are your fourths
fifths<00:03:54.790> your<00:03:55.790> octaves<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.420> your<00:03:56.540> unisons

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
fifths your octaves and your unisons

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.350 
fifths your octaves and your unisons
then<00:03:57.349> you<00:03:57.530> have<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:57.769> head<00:03:58.549> start<00:03:58.580> on<00:03:59.000> all<00:03:59.209> this

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
then you have a head start on all this

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.210 
then you have a head start on all this
if<00:03:59.840> you're<00:04:00.080> not<00:04:00.260> perhaps<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:01.010> should<00:04:01.190> ask

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
if you're not perhaps you should ask

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.490 
if you're not perhaps you should ask
your<00:04:01.610> teacher<00:04:01.790> if<00:04:01.970> it's<00:04:02.299> okay<00:04:02.599> if<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:03.319> get<00:04:03.440> a

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
your teacher if it's okay if you get a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.039 
your teacher if it's okay if you get a
theory<00:04:03.920> book<00:04:04.160> theory<00:04:04.970> time<00:04:05.299> is<00:04:05.540> one<00:04:05.720> book<00:04:05.900> that

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
theory book theory time is one book that

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.979 
theory book theory time is one book that
I<00:04:06.080> use<00:04:06.290> with<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.590> other<00:04:06.739> students

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
I use with the other students

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.470 
I use with the other students
it's<00:04:08.989> up<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.290> your<00:04:09.410> teacher<00:04:09.560> but<00:04:09.860> if<00:04:10.130> you're

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
it's up to your teacher but if you're

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.180 
it's up to your teacher but if you're
doing<00:04:11.480> theory<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.230> helps<00:04:12.500> your<00:04:12.650> knowledge<00:04:13.040> of

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
doing theory it helps your knowledge of

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.370 
doing theory it helps your knowledge of
