the shimmery Brown with the matte Brown

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.740 
the shimmery Brown with the matte Brown
on<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> flat<00:00:41.399> shader<00:00:41.670> brush<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.239> put<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.540> all

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
on a flat shader brush and put it all

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.290 
on a flat shader brush and put it all
over<00:00:43.110> our<00:00:43.140> lid<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:44.730> gonna<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.120> two

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
over our lid and we gonna do this two

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.299 
over our lid and we gonna do this two
three<00:00:45.480> times<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.590> color<00:00:46.800> payoff<00:00:47.010> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
three times because the color payoff is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.639 
three times because the color payoff is
not<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.879> great<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.930> probably<00:00:49.379> had

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
not that great but if you probably had

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.650 
not that great but if you probably had
come<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.280> had<00:00:50.399> probably<00:00:50.940> concealed<00:00:51.510> my

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
come if I had probably concealed my

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
come if I had probably concealed my
eyelids<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.320> powder<00:00:52.590> them<00:00:53.039> before<00:00:53.430> doing

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
eyelids and powder them before doing

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.100 
eyelids and powder them before doing
this<00:00:53.789> eye<00:00:53.940> makeup<00:00:54.300> look<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.570> probably<00:00:54.870> would

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
this eye makeup look I probably would

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.869 
this eye makeup look I probably would
have<00:00:55.140> got<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> little<00:00:55.590> bit<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.190> better<00:00:56.460> color

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
have got a little bit of better color

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.939 
have got a little bit of better color
payoff<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.260> low<00:00:58.379> key<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:58.620> gonna<00:00:58.800> take

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
payoff but it's a low key I'm gonna take

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.979 
payoff but it's a low key I'm gonna take
the<00:00:59.039> product<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> three<00:00:59.760> times<00:00:59.969> I'll<00:01:00.719> even

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the product to three times I'll even

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.270 
the product to three times I'll even
show<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.410> third<00:01:01.590> time<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:01.890> taking<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
show the third time I'm taking the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280 
show the third time I'm taking the
product<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> flat<00:01:03.539> shader<00:01:03.840> brush<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
product on the flat shader brush and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
product on the flat shader brush and
just<00:01:04.350> put<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.710> nicely<00:01:04.890> all<00:01:05.400> over<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:05.850> lid<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
just put it nicely all over my lid and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.179 
just put it nicely all over my lid and
you<00:01:06.659> need<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.900> blend<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.380> well<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.830> matte

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
you need to blend it well because matte

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.280 
you need to blend it well because matte
shades<00:01:08.549> usually<00:01:09.000> don't<00:01:09.210> blend<00:01:09.600> very<00:01:09.720> well<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
shades usually don't blend very well and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.380 
shades usually don't blend very well and
that's<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:11.040> reason<00:01:11.070> why<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:11.850> mixing<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that's one reason why I'm mixing the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.690 
that's one reason why I'm mixing the
shimmery<00:01:12.750> color<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.560> matte<00:01:13.740> color<00:01:14.100> just

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
shimmery color with the matte color just

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.999 
shimmery color with the matte color just
to<00:01:14.850> make<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.570> little<00:01:15.720> bit<00:01:16.049> more<00:01:16.229> easier<00:01:16.799> to

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
to make it a little bit more easier to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.310 
to make it a little bit more easier to
blend<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.360> I'm<00:01:18.509> taking<00:01:18.990> my

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
blend and if you can see I'm taking my

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.190 
blend and if you can see I'm taking my
brush<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.830> semicircle<00:01:20.729> shape<00:01:20.810> around<00:01:21.810> my

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
brush in semicircle shape around my

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.080 
brush in semicircle shape around my
crease<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.770> now<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.369> taking<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> fluffy

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
crease and now I'm taking the fluffy

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.880 
crease and now I'm taking the fluffy
brush<00:01:24.119> again<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.810> blending<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.530> crease

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
brush again and just blending the crease

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.190 
brush again and just blending the crease
area<00:01:26.159> again<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.840> looks<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
area again so that it it just looks a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.469 
area again so that it it just looks a
little<00:01:28.229> more<00:01:28.619> seamless<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.250> blends<00:01:30.119> together

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
little more seamless and blends together

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.060 
little more seamless and blends together
when<00:01:31.700> also<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.970> take<00:01:33.150> any<00:01:33.619> black<00:01:34.619> Kajal

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
when also you can take any black Kajal

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130 
when also you can take any black Kajal
