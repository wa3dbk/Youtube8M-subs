brokers needs fixed or anything enough
damage<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:29.580> thing<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.210> talked

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
damage and one thing you know we talked

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.540 
damage and one thing you know we talked
about<00:00:30.570> props<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.349> talked<00:00:31.590> about<00:00:31.679> tires<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
about props we talked about tires and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.090 
about props we talked about tires and
the<00:00:33.540> next<00:00:33.809> thing<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.200> right<00:00:34.469> here<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.920> lower

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the next thing is right here the lower

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.420 
the next thing is right here the lower
unit<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.870> lower<00:00:37.079> unit<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.680> from<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.280> here

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
unit the lower unit is from here to here

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.340 
unit the lower unit is from here to here
this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.059> where<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> gears<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.140> what

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
this is where the gears are that's what

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.900 
this is where the gears are that's what
turns<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.860> profits<00:00:41.340> where<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> exhaust

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
turns the profits where the exhaust

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970 
turns the profits where the exhaust
comes<00:00:42.210> out<00:00:42.450> where<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> motor<00:00:43.350> picks<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
comes out where the motor picks up the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.299 
comes out where the motor picks up the
water<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:45.180> there's<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.680> problem<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
water and there's a the problem with the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.240 
water and there's a the problem with the
lower<00:00:47.489> unit<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.969> being<00:00:48.329> down<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.989> low<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.649> it

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
lower unit is being down so low is it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.189 
lower unit is being down so low is it
wants<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.760> hit<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.149> bottom<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> come

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
wants to hit the bottom like if you come

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.810 
wants to hit the bottom like if you come
into<00:00:52.410> shallow<00:00:52.710> places<00:00:53.100> which<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.640> where<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
into shallow places which is where I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.569 
into shallow places which is where I
like<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.090> fish<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> lot<00:00:55.010> lower<00:00:56.010> unit<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
like to fish a lot lower unit is the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.360 
like to fish a lot lower unit is the
first<00:00:56.820> thing<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.149> hit<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.390> ground<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.370> it's

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
first thing to hit the ground so it's

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.250 
first thing to hit the ground so it's
easy<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.180> damaged<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.899> got<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
easy for it to get damaged so you got to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.080 
easy for it to get damaged so you got to
pay<00:01:01.379> attention<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:02.129> try<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.910> into

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
pay attention and try not to get into

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.969 
pay attention and try not to get into
too<00:01:03.359> shallow<00:01:03.660> water<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.260> around<00:01:04.470> those<00:01:04.619> rocks

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
too shallow water get around those rocks

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.370 
too shallow water get around those rocks
and<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.400> some<00:01:05.700> damage<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> propeller<00:01:06.720> but

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and do some damage to the propeller but

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.770 
and do some damage to the propeller but
the<00:01:07.500> lower<00:01:07.650> unit<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.820> say<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.210> way<00:01:09.540> down

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the lower unit like I say it's way down

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
the lower unit like I say it's way down
there<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.530> bottom<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.340> deep<00:01:11.580> as

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
there it's the bottom that's as deep as

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.270 
there it's the bottom that's as deep as
it<00:01:11.880> goes<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.750> down<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.619> people<00:01:14.010> oh<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it goes if it's down to people oh the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.969 
it goes if it's down to people oh the
boat<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.850> anything<00:01:15.659> that's<00:01:15.750> down<00:01:16.020> there<00:01:16.290> lower

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
boat so anything that's down there lower

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.550 
boat so anything that's down there lower
units<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:19.080> gonna<00:01:19.350> get

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
units going to get it so it's gonna get

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.560 
units going to get it so it's gonna get
dinged<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:20.280> time<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> time<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.240> like

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570

just<00:01:35.670> by<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:35.909> holding<00:01:36.360> onto<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:36.900> this

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
just by just holding onto it like this

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.289 
just by just holding onto it like this
and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.100> other<00:01:38.250> thing<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.759> creates

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and the other thing is is that creates

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.359 
and the other thing is is that creates
air<00:01:39.900> bubbles<00:01:40.409> when<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.710> motor<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.130> going

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
air bubbles when that motor is going

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.130 
air bubbles when that motor is going
through<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> water<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:42.000> 70<00:01:42.420> plus<00:01:42.659> mile<00:01:42.930> an

through the water at 70 plus mile an
hour

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
hour

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.620 
hour
if<00:01:44.140> there's<00:01:44.500> any<00:01:44.920> little<00:01:45.310> any<00:01:46.030> little<00:01:46.180> catch

on the edge of those props or on that
front<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:48.759> these<00:01:48.909> on<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.329> fins<00:01:49.630> that's<00:01:50.469> going

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
front of these on the fins that's going

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.469 
front of these on the fins that's going
to<00:01:50.740> cause<00:01:50.950> create<00:01:51.670> turbulence<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.390> it's

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
to cause create turbulence and it's

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.060 
to cause create turbulence and it's
going<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.659> cause<00:01:52.840> air<00:01:53.170> bubbles<00:01:53.560> so<00:01:53.740> what<00:01:54.009> you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070
