00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello, my good todays 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.130
 the video will be about organizing about how i 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.259
 I keep my bags 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.090
 it was your request so i hope that 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.400
 I will satisfy your curiosity I hope that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.630
 you will be interested 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.799
 originally when the question became 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.809
 conservation amount that is when 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.400
 increased their number I wanted 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.350
 do as here on this picture 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.330
 quite comfortable in principle thing 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.400
 only thing but you must be between 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 cabinet door and shelves sufficient 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.300
 space to make it all good 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.060
 shut down and while i went thought 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.650
 try on it suits me it does not fit 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.380
 moved there other things about them I tell you 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.090
 I will tell in the following videos and me 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.710
 the question remains how their crap 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.440
 not my bags at the end then 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.840
 The main criteria in choosing yes I have 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.700
 there was still accessibility ie everything 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.079
 my bags were in sight so I easy 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.640
 it was missing that day was so 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.980
 some kind of deep shelf they are so front 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.899
 rows and very very somewhere standing there 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.539
 through all here it is liza that is to 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.270
 in the morning I simply could quickly 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.270
 take the bag shift the contents and all 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.399
 go i'm ready that's why i tell you 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.710
 I offer my version it is very simple 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.600
 he lies on the surface and he finds himself 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.350
 very convenient for our apartment so 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.360
 let's see my option in essence 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.979
 This is the usual hanger that we bought in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.610
 the hardware store you bought it 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.880
 whom 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.930
 but they are in any store where 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.259
 furniture for sale 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.030
 she herself is from iron and from her goes 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.490
 round this stone hanger goes to 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.229
 the principle of a three-tiered so call that 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.079
 there is on the first tier 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.420
 but now she's usually guests 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.119
 which us comes on the third tier 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.520
 hang all my big bags that is like 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.740
 the rule for sure I still have one 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.720
 here hang in the summer a little but about it 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.869
 a little later 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.790
 as I hang and not two, and here's one 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.840
 which most often found large 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.540
 it means no more expected 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.670
 go bags that are medium in size 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.090
 Generally about this thing semicircle she goes 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.200
 for an umbrella you can hang my umbrella and 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.729
 two of my bags are hanging bright which are like 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.479
 just fit here is great 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.060
 fit 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.270
 what good is this hanger she is very 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.670
 stable that is she and even if i am here 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.530
 all hang nothing hang no she here 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.160
 lean toward that is she will 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.340
 still stand part of their bags 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.040
 which are usually stored in summer here hell 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.680
 on this one hook in the winter I clean 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.200
 fake box if i have a hanger 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.840
 this side is here to this side of the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.900
 I have a box on such wings 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.910
 yes it is short too bought in full 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.010
 it is like Kiev buttons which 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.550
 they themselves are doing this and that he is here I 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.920
 I take out and here I get all my 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.730
 small bags that I do not wear 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.730
 Essences in winter and autumn 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.360
 crying and sports bag in general how much 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.260
 need means it is very convenient to store in this 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.300
 place because it is more convenient for me to know what 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.459
 small bag no money and even if 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.530
 in the winter they will be needed then I am just on 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.180
 just getting this box and no 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.040
 problems and mine 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.690
 say when I come in before you hang 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.120
 sleep where I get completely the inside 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.569
 so let's say I already showed you and she 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.980
 I also kept on one of the wings and 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.959
 here she stands in a small handbag 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.090
 which I am currently currently active 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.849
 our basically this whole system i 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.790
 I hope you like the idea you have 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.739
 maybe something is possible 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.900
 suitable for your interior because 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.690
 very simple and at the same time she is not 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.299
 looks loaded somehow me on for 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.610
 me looks like chaotic chaos 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.850
 uncomfortable 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.890
 lay everything in sight and comfortable use 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.480
