00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
one-handed cartwheel so what you can do

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.990 
one-handed cartwheel so what you can do
is<00:01:51.470> just<00:01:52.470> go<00:01:52.619> into<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.830> cartwheel<00:01:53.160> and<00:01:53.520> your

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
is just go into a cartwheel and your

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.029 
is just go into a cartwheel and your
spotter<00:01:54.390> should<00:01:55.289> bring<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:55.649> legs<00:01:55.830> together

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
spotter should bring your legs together

spotter should bring your legs together
and<00:01:56.580> snap<00:01:57.270> them<00:01:57.539> debt<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.960> push<00:01:58.259> them<00:01:58.440> down

and snap them debt like push them down

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.430 
and snap them debt like push them down
for<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.970> get<00:02:00.209> that<00:02:00.330> snapping<00:02:00.660> motion

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
for you so you get that snapping motion

for you so you get that snapping motion
ok<00:02:02.040> go<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.730> try<00:02:05.960> ok<00:02:06.960> ready

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.130 

so<00:02:10.569> cartwheel<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:13.720> doesn't<00:02:14.020> look<00:02:14.080> that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
so cartwheel and it doesn't look that

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.820 
so cartwheel and it doesn't look that
great<00:02:14.709> but<00:02:15.099> just<00:02:15.180> put<00:02:16.180> yourself<00:02:16.510> up<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.680> this

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
great but just put yourself up so this

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.160 
great but just put yourself up so this
is<00:02:17.860> what<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.130> looks<00:02:18.310> like<00:02:18.400> without<00:02:18.520> water<00:02:19.170> so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
is what it looks like without water so

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.800 
is what it looks like without water so
just<00:02:20.349> back<00:02:20.470> up

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.949 

so<00:02:23.380> again<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:24.370> cannot<00:02:24.670> see<00:02:24.849> me<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:25.690> can<00:02:25.780> be

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
so again you cannot see me so you can be

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.920 
so again you cannot see me so you can be
in<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.050> lunge<00:02:26.290> position<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.360> just<00:02:28.660> kick

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
in a lunge position I like to just kick

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.430 
in a lunge position I like to just kick
up<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.739> I<00:02:29.770> get<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> little<00:02:30.280> bit<00:02:30.430> more<00:02:30.580> momentum

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.580 

come<00:02:35.440> on<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.880> that's<00:02:37.180> just<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.420> roundoff<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:38.080> mean

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
come on so that's just a roundoff I mean

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.040 
come on so that's just a roundoff I mean
a<00:02:38.830> few<00:02:39.099> people<00:02:39.370> take<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.610> few<00:02:39.849> extra<00:02:39.910> steps<00:02:40.180> how

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
a few people take a few extra steps how

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.620 
a few people take a few extra steps how
depends<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:41.590> how<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.739> are<00:02:42.099> but<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:43.180> do<00:02:43.450> one

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
depends on how you are but I just do one

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.979 
depends on how you are but I just do one
step<00:02:43.900> sometimes<00:02:44.709> I'll<00:02:44.860> take<00:02:45.010> two<00:02:45.660> okay<00:02:46.660> our

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
step sometimes I'll take two okay our

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.500 
step sometimes I'll take two okay our
next<00:02:47.110> one<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.800> roundoff<00:02:48.190> rebound<00:02:48.640> you

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
next one is a roundoff rebound you

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.270 
next one is a roundoff rebound you
should<00:02:49.720> be<00:02:49.810> able<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.050> do<00:02:50.170> like<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.349> roundoff<00:02:50.920> to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
should be able to do like a roundoff to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.650 
should be able to do like a roundoff to
actually<00:02:51.519> get<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.730> rebound<00:02:52.090> part<00:02:52.330> really

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.620 
actually get the rebound part really
well<00:02:52.870> okay<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.640> one<00:02:54.880> we<00:02:55.420> don't<00:02:55.510> really

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
well okay so this one we don't really

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.479 
well okay so this one we don't really
need<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.989> spotter<00:02:56.290> but<00:02:57.040> if<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.280> feel<00:02:57.459> more

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
need a spotter but if you feel more

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.160

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
comfortable with a spider standing there

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.380 
comfortable with a spider standing there
you<00:02:59.440> can<00:02:59.769> use<00:02:59.950> them<00:03:00.160> but<00:03:00.819> what's<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.120> we<00:03:01.239> do

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390

you're going over and you help putting
your<00:03:07.390> feet<00:03:07.540> together<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:08.680> can<00:03:08.830> tell<00:03:09.069> them<00:03:09.190> to

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
your feet together you can tell them to

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.839 
your feet together you can tell them to
do<00:03:09.489> that<00:03:09.700> but<00:03:10.540> then<00:03:10.810> I'll<00:03:11.290> all<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.069> should<00:03:12.430> do<00:03:12.610> is

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
do that but then I'll all I should do is

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.820 
do that but then I'll all I should do is
just<00:03:13.239> keep<00:03:13.420> your<00:03:13.569> legs<00:03:13.750> together<00:03:13.900> they

shouldn't snap you down with this one

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.600 
shouldn't snap you down with this one
because<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.260> should<00:03:17.620> do<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.799> by<00:03:17.920> yourself<00:03:18.310> and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
because you should do it by yourself and

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.880 
because you should do it by yourself and
because<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.180> really<00:03:19.450> have<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.810> like<00:03:19.989> learn<00:03:20.680> it

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
because you really have to like learn it

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.820 
because you really have to like learn it
and<00:03:21.040> push<00:03:21.370> up<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.750> round<00:03:23.049> off<00:03:23.170> rebound<00:03:23.380> is

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
and push up so round off rebound is

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.849 
and push up so round off rebound is
where<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.819> go<00:03:24.940> round<00:03:25.239> off<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:26.230> land<00:03:26.560> and

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
where you go round off and you land and

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.349
