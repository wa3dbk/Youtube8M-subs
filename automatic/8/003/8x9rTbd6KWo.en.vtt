they won't get a nice space those
different<00:04:31.860> settings<00:04:32.220> what<00:04:32.490> sound

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.610 

I<00:04:36.600> had<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.720> volume<00:04:37.900> all<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.140> way<00:04:38.200> up<00:04:38.290> on<00:04:38.560> my

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
I had the volume all the way up on my

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.470 
I had the volume all the way up on my
blasting<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.490> know<00:04:39.580> I<00:04:39.610> coming<00:04:40.270> here<00:04:40.420> and

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
blasting you know I coming here and

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.830 
blasting you know I coming here and
enough<00:04:40.690> I'm<00:04:40.870> gonna<00:04:41.050> have<00:04:41.140> respect<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:41.590> space

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.320 

but<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:47.380> think<00:04:48.370> it's<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> excellent<00:04:49.030> type<00:04:49.210> of

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
but I think it's the excellent type of

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.900 
but I think it's the excellent type of
bass<00:04:49.510> or<00:04:49.930> if<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:50.110> do<00:04:50.290> and<00:04:51.120> I'm<00:04:52.120> being<00:04:53.700> some<00:04:54.700> pop

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
bass or if you do and I'm being some pop

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.680 
bass or if you do and I'm being some pop
I'm<00:04:55.120> sure<00:04:55.410> I'm<00:04:56.410> not<00:04:56.470> too<00:04:56.560> sure<00:04:56.860> about<00:04:56.890> rock

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
I'm sure I'm not too sure about rock

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.850 
I'm sure I'm not too sure about rock
probably<00:04:58.690> you<00:04:58.810> have<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.050> change<00:04:59.320> your<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.650> NAPA

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
probably you have to change your a NAPA

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.880 
probably you have to change your a NAPA
