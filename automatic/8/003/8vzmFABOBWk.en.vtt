00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 with his five family friends 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.370
 Corinne was certain that the product 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.620
 already existed 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.349
 yet their idea is totally 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.150
 innovative recycled cardboard huts 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.799
 and flexible exists nowhere 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.719
 elsewhere not even abroad 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.580
 you can really create the form of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.470
 the Kabbalah you want these two 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 games in one you can create a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.560
 shape of the hut so that can be a 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.220
 octagonal shape that can be at 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.990
 labyrinths 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 it can be a house with different 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.859
 small rooms where children can get 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.179
 hide and then the child can decorate 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.099
 the cabin so really the innovative side 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.800
 it's for the first time build 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 the hut we want to create his universe 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.129
 created his decor created his world and you 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.270
 will see that children created actually to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.829
 each time whenever they 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.270
 stand out the kabbalah is worth creating a 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.610
 form of different huts that will be 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.500
 never the same the idea is related to his 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.120
 childhood his father was advertising and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.980
 often bring cartons that do not 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.570
 served more at home with his two 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.410
 brothers Corinne used it then for 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.390
 create huts 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.739
 these huts my house are 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.930
 marketed since the month of 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.180
 September before corinne to test his 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.460
 produced at recreation centers 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.470
 result a non-hazardous solid product 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.720
 but especially very educational for 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.340
 children with the notch system they 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.229
 learn to master their actions but 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.479
 not only that will also allow 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.920
 to develop creativity and 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.000
 the imagination the child as he goes 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.100
 create a hut every time 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.810
 different and also the imagination 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.070
 creativity since he's decorated it 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.380
 according to his own desires 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.270
 from the age of 3, the hut can not be 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 goes up and down and in three four 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:35.610
 minutes chrono demonstration with two 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:37.170
 of the three children of corinne the idea 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.070
 seems to be adept at them 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.869
 first production 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.820
 Corinne and her team have already sold 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.040
 half everything is stored in his 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.049
 garage so here we have shares 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.640
 ordered 400 hut we are left 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.770
 more than two senses since we have 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
 already sold half of the stock and we 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.310
 we still have a lot of sailboats all 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.229
 these are boxes that are in 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.570
 waiting for delivery for hospitals 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.770
 for holiday centers or even 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.299
 for schools 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.710
 the activity takes a lot of space 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.450
 and time but it stays for the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.100
 moment a plus compared to his first 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.409
 profession of lecturer in 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.729
 marketing which does not prevent to have 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.480
 already other ideas of development 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.370
 created cardboard furniture to furnish 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.379
 huts or even create the same product 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.150
 in smaller version to make them 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.370
 corinne doll houses and his team 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.080
 have not finished innovating with the approach of 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.879
 Christmas my hut may do some 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.340
 happy they will be present 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.510
