00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.260
 already came the number 5 of paint on 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.000
 Beautiful delicate sunflowers fabric 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.850
 magnolias the supplement landscapes 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.980
 realistic and much more is number 5 of 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.490
 paint on canvas welcome 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.490
 exhaust 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.619
 and here we are with the mónica teacher 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:26.239
 gonzález very well very happy of 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.340
 lan and to work despite having 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.340
 Thank you, thank you, we were not going to do 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.000
 sublimation for rigid surfaces that 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.550
 they asked for it so much if there are a two the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.250
 such little secrets we will try to give them 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.530
 all and good yes yes yes it is at random from 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.540
 the antivirals how the step is made to 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.519
 step if you're asking a lot 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.379
 anything after they write to you 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.689
 or write us to not only acts 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.420
 we remove all the doubts that remain in the 

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:56.150
 fight better good hello how are you going 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.830
 all and as we spoke with norm we are going 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.210
 to try to explain everything 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.299
 sublimation in this case I'm 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.470
 working with a tile what would be 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.079
 the steps to follow 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.500
 I brought a mirror frame that first 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.570
 I started the tile by marking it with a pencil 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.939
 which is the one used to split that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.280
 I split the tile in 2 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.829
 once I broke the tile they go to 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.790
 have to clean the tile very well 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.910
 with alcohol 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.730
 to degrease the entire surface and 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.560
 then what are we going to do with the base 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.950
 for sublimation which is a polymer 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.860
 we are going to try to apply it in 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.480
 couple on the tile the way in the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.570
 next a brush that does not and does not exercise 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.470
 too much pressure on the tile for 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:52.070
 that for the material to be deposited and 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.640
 do not have too little or you are 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.909
 deposit the material on the tile 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.130
 getting right to the edges 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.490
 so that later this part also 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.289
 sublime this would be the first step 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.879
 after cleaning the tile 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.610
 precautions to take into account the 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.569
 little bottle they close very well when 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.549
 they finish passing the material and another of 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.370
 the things with which I can spend 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.250
 this material is with these rollers 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.110
 high density is a high foam rubber 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.319
 density then if they have to do 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.390
 several tiles can put them one at 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.060
 side of another on a table and with the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.620
 roll it over the tiles 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.780
 then they would make like a wall of 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.019
 tiles and have the work quite 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.310
 advance the material they will put it in 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.560
 a metal or glass container never 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.170
 a container 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.770
 in plastic because it melts 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.800
 material then once you already 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.470
 they have past the lacquer what they are going to do 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.980
 is to wait 24 hours for the material 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.620
 it covers if we're in a hurry if we want 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.650
 work right away let's wait three 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.890
 hours in three hours I heal the material and 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.099
 I'm going to introduce my tile in the 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.290
 150 degree oven if there are ovens that 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.780
 they have the temperature meter 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.989
 I put them 150 degrees for 10 minutes 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.150
 and then it is cured material one 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.910
 Once it dried up there, I can start 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.640
 work and this particular framework 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.830
 I did it with plates the plates of 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.709
 eternal that are these that you see here 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.920
 there are different models there are 80 models 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.160
 new sheets and I used this 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.440
 case the sheets for texture and how I'm going 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.860
 to work now with the hot iron 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.410
 I already have it here warm I will put 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.930
 the tile that is already prepared and 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.510
 cured I will put the wool 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.290
 and this is another sheet that I'm going now 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:05.000
 to show the other that I brought I will support 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.360
 and with the iron I will pass 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.850
 to transfer the image in the 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.700
 tile that is already prepared to the 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.670
 few minutes already begins to happen to 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.130
 transfer what they have to start to 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.130
 do is the iron first not very 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.050
 hot because we can go from 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.140
 I burn the lacquer that I am 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.890
 working and then doing pretty 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:34.910
 pressure to sublime the image I'm going to 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:39.790
 put a little hotter my iron 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:43.540
 and I will pass it by exerting pressure 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.900
 and I'm going to ski look like the colors 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.500
 that had the blade that look pretty 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.170
 opaque in the sheet as they glow 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.290
 how they shine on the tile there I think 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.610
 It looks pretty good I'm almost there 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.800
 ending it takes me a few minutes 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.560
 working if I miss a little bit the 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.490
 edge could also work could 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.830
 generate my own plates with the 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.870
 paintings to sublimate but in this case 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.840
 I'm working with the plates 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.409
 notice now we are and in a few in a 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.949
 I just simply 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:26.860
 I have the finished tile and this burns 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:30.819
 a little bit yes there is look 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.939
 barbarian and now I'm going to put together the framework that 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:38.430
 It is very easy on a wood of 30 x 30 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:42.130
 what I did was accommodate the mirror 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:45.550
 accommodate the tiles this is missing here 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:49.090
 I'm going to stick it with a silicone and 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:53.370
 this marquito and there was perfect what 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.370
 I have to hit but I 'm perfect 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.140
 in this case clear 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.250
 you can do it on a box not on 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.110
 surfaces that I will have to 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.660
 clean for example on Tuesdays a 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.900
 kitchen tile and jano because I do not 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:14.080
 I can put later aggressive materials 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:20.920
 to clean it let's say it's decorative 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:23.110
 to decorate because also notice that 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.350
 the polymer is a layer that I put 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:29.320
 about the tile grams hot things 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.660
 clear clear good towards has elements 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:39.250
 decorative and collective complements 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:42.250
