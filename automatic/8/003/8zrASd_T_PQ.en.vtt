well<00:01:05.450> I<00:01:05.480> think<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:06.140> consideration<00:01:06.980> of

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
well I think the consideration of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.010 
well I think the consideration of
pushing<00:01:07.610> legislation<00:01:07.940> like<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:08.750> into

pushing legislation like that into

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.470 
pushing legislation like that into
Queensland<00:01:09.530> would<00:01:09.740> be<00:01:09.920> catastrophic<00:01:10.480> our

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
Queensland would be catastrophic our

Queensland would be catastrophic our

crocodile numbers currently in

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.430 
crocodile numbers currently in
Queensland<00:01:13.760> wouldn't<00:01:14.210> support<00:01:14.660> it<00:01:14.840> we've

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
Queensland wouldn't support it we've

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.770 
Queensland wouldn't support it we've
seen<00:01:15.860> very<00:01:16.580> little<00:01:16.670> recovery<00:01:17.420> since
