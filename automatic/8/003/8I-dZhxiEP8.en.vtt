there<00:00:36.750> are<00:00:36.840> many<00:00:36.989> ones<00:00:37.230> are<00:00:37.380> mostly<00:00:37.620> German

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100

ones<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> politically<00:00:39.750> interesting

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
ones this is a politically interesting

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.729 
ones this is a politically interesting
one<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:41.719> it's<00:00:42.719> integral<00:00:43.200> all<00:00:43.440> these

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739

pieces<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.370> wood<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> Rings<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.539> been

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
pieces of wood here the Rings have been

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.360 
pieces of wood here the Rings have been
made<00:00:45.840> from<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.260> piece<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.500> wood<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:47.100> by

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
made from one piece of wood just by

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.360 
made from one piece of wood just by
carving<00:00:48.300> inside<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.899> makes<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.890> spinning<00:00:50.340> top

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
carving inside it makes a spinning top

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.790 
carving inside it makes a spinning top
with<00:00:50.700> rings<00:00:51.600> at<00:00:51.840> walls<00:00:52.070> in<00:00:53.070> outwards<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.670> go

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
with rings at walls in outwards you go

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.049 
with rings at walls in outwards you go
they<00:00:55.800> lift<00:00:56.010> upwards<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.520> push<00:00:56.699> outward

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
they lift upwards and push outward

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.139 
they lift upwards and push outward
centrifugal<00:00:57.539> force<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.550> again<00:00:59.550> isn't<00:00:59.789> spin

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
centrifugal force and again isn't spin

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.400 
centrifugal force and again isn't spin
so<00:01:00.270> long<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.719> does<00:01:00.870> look<00:01:01.079> extremely

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
so long but it does look extremely

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
so long but it does look extremely
pretty<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.609> very<00:01:02.820> unusual<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.270> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
pretty and it's very unusual that it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.119 
pretty and it's very unusual that it
should<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.570> made<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:04.019> piece<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.350> wood<00:01:04.500> an

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
should be made one piece of wood an

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.550 
should be made one piece of wood an

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
intrical spinning top this is just a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.679 
intrical spinning top this is just a

learn the top in fact the outside wheels
just<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.820> case<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.150> falls<00:01:21.299> over<00:01:21.600> earlier

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
just in case it falls over earlier

just in case it falls over earlier
that's<00:01:22.860> telling<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.460> cheaper<00:01:23.729> horse<00:01:24.740> these

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that's telling the cheaper horse these

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070 
that's telling the cheaper horse these
three<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.670> all<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.360> same<00:01:27.540> idea<00:01:27.900> really

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
three are all the same idea really

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.039 
three are all the same idea really
they're<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.579> tippy<00:01:29.850> tops<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.390> start<00:01:30.780> like

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
they're all like tippy tops a start like

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.929 
they're all like tippy tops a start like
that<00:01:31.320> was<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> spinning<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.159> rip<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
that was it spinning in that rip in that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.940 
that was it spinning in that rip in that
mode<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.540> when<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:33.990> span<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> short<00:01:34.770> time

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
mode and when it's span for a short time

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.190 
mode and when it's span for a short time
it<00:01:35.130> lifts<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.790> mode<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.270> by<00:01:36.420> magic<00:01:36.630> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it lifts up that mode is if by magic so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.359 
it lifts up that mode is if by magic so
if<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.350> said<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.680> spinning<00:01:38.960> up<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.140> comes<00:01:40.369> now

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
if I said it's spinning up it comes now

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.120 
if I said it's spinning up it comes now
this<00:01:41.579> little<00:01:41.790> ball<00:01:41.939> at<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.210> top<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.829> do<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
this little ball at the top I do it on a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.060 
this little ball at the top I do it on a
flat<00:01:45.119> surface<00:01:45.149> for<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> next<00:01:45.810> -<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.860> one

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
flat surface for the next - this one

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.740 
flat surface for the next - this one
will<00:01:47.280> show<00:01:47.340> different<00:01:47.790> colors<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.390> yet<00:01:48.600> it's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
will show different colors but yet it's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.810 
will show different colors but yet it's
spinning<00:01:51.500> then<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.619> will<00:01:52.740> flip<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.040> was<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
spinning then it will flip up was and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.940 
spinning then it will flip up was and
it's<00:01:53.970> slowing<00:01:54.149> down<00:01:54.240> every<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.799> slowing<00:01:55.799> down

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it's slowing down every are slowing down

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.310

a<00:01:56.070> bit<00:01:56.130> too<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.820> nice<00:01:57.240> idea<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
a bit too much but nice idea and the

a bit too much but nice idea and the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
which spin really by snapping it rather

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.060 
which spin really by snapping it rather

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
out really a bit too tricky for me I'll

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.180 
out really a bit too tricky for me I'll
try<00:02:37.450> one<00:02:37.660> but<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:38.050> quite<00:02:38.710> tricky<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.040> make

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
try one but it's quite tricky to make

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
that go up in the air like that which is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.570 
that go up in the air like that which is
how<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.470> should<00:02:41.620> go<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.010> prefer<00:02:42.160> just<00:02:42.280> to

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
how it should go so I prefer just to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.700 
how it should go so I prefer just to
spin<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:42.970> like<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.480> looks<00:02:43.630> like<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.780> Saturn

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
spin it like that it looks like a Saturn

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.210

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
around it to this one likewise as well I

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.660 
around it to this one likewise as well I
don't<00:02:50.470> think<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.740> can<00:02:50.800> get<00:02:51.010> those<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.370> actually

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
don't think I can get those to actually

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.280 
don't think I can get those to actually
spin<00:02:51.940> upwards<00:02:52.300> but<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.900> smaller<00:02:53.140> one

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
spin upwards but the smaller one

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.840 
spin upwards but the smaller one
definitely<00:02:53.650> starts<00:02:54.100> after<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.520> flicked<00:02:54.730> it

definitely starts after you flicked it

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.040 
definitely starts after you flicked it
at<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.060> angle<00:02:55.240> like<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.780> slowly

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
at that angle like that and slowly

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.920 
at that angle like that and slowly

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
descends as it's coming down making some
