now like fifty percent of the content

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140 
now like fifty percent of the content
hits<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> floor<00:01:10.799> sooner<00:01:11.430> rather<00:01:11.580> than<00:01:11.850> teach

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
hits the floor sooner rather than teach

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.050 
hits the floor sooner rather than teach
you<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.979> concept<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.549> great<00:01:14.880> you

you so like the concept is great you

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.190 
you so like the concept is great you
know<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.390> promotion<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
know for promotion but the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.020 
know for promotion but the
practicalities<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.369> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.729> flawed

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
practicalities of it are kind of flawed

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.080 
practicalities of it are kind of flawed
and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.549> course<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and I have to do it of course the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.749 
and I have to do it of course the
special<00:01:21.750> way<00:01:22.040> of<00:01:23.040> course<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.640> already

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
special way of course you can already

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
special way of course you can already
see<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.180> title<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.930> probably<00:01:25.259> know<00:01:25.439> what<00:01:25.590> I'm

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
see the title and probably know what I'm

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.649 
see the title and probably know what I'm
going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.240> here<00:01:27.650> but<00:01:28.909> yeah<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.270> thought<00:01:30.600> that

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
going to do here but yeah I thought that

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.050 
going to do here but yeah I thought that
if<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.439> from<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.890> bucket<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.280> ice<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.729> top<00:01:32.909> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
if like from the bucket of ice on top of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.420 
if like from the bucket of ice on top of
yourself<00:01:33.450> isn't<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.409> option<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> only

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
yourself isn't the option then the only

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.719 
yourself isn't the option then the only
real<00:01:35.759> option<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.960> throw<00:01:37.259> yourself<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
real option is to throw yourself on to a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.580 
real option is to throw yourself on to a
buck<00:01:39.060> advance<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.720> don't<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.350> bucket

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
buck advance now I don't have a bucket

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.069 
buck advance now I don't have a bucket
that<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.400> sustain<00:01:41.640> my<00:01:42.119> body<00:01:42.450> mass<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:43.020> weight

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
that can sustain my body mass or weight

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.350 
that can sustain my body mass or weight
for<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.619> matter<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.640> would<00:01:44.790> probably<00:01:45.000> share

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
for that matter it would probably share

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.899 
for that matter it would probably share
it<00:01:45.479> through<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.689> thousand<00:01:46.229> pieces<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:47.220> probably

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
it through a thousand pieces I probably

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.270 
it through a thousand pieces I probably
also<00:01:48.119> worth<00:01:48.479> quite<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> bit<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.740> I'm<00:01:49.979> not<00:01:50.100> going

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
also worth quite a bit so I'm not going

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280 
also worth quite a bit so I'm not going
