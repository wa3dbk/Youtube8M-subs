next<00:04:48.770> level<00:04:49.070> however<00:04:49.820> I<00:04:50.270> think<00:04:50.690> I'll<00:04:50.810> that

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
next level however I think I'll that

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.920 
next level however I think I'll that
will<00:04:51.050> focus<00:04:51.229> had<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.740> remain<00:04:52.550> hack<00:04:52.820> we<00:04:53.690> got<00:04:53.840> to

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
will focus had to remain hack we got to

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.920 
will focus had to remain hack we got to
keep<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.169> same<00:04:54.380> focus<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:55.310> know<00:04:55.340> what<00:04:55.580> as<00:04:55.930> we

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
keep the same focus you know what as we

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.560 
keep the same focus you know what as we
do<00:04:57.080> on<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.260> road<00:04:57.440> at<00:04:57.680> home<00:04:57.950> and<00:04:58.789> we<00:04:59.210> had<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.360> few

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
do on the road at home and we had a few

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.480 
do on the road at home and we had a few
struggles<00:04:59.780> at<00:05:00.050> home<00:05:00.169> and<00:05:00.740> our<00:05:01.010> few<00:05:01.280> breakdowns

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
struggles at home and our few breakdowns

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.700 
struggles at home and our few breakdowns
I<00:05:01.880> guess<00:05:02.060> let's<00:05:02.750> just<00:05:02.810> do<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.110> focus<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.620> know

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
I guess let's just do the focus you know

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.110 
I guess let's just do the focus you know
we<00:05:03.830> got<00:05:03.950> to<00:05:04.039> keep<00:05:04.100> our<00:05:04.250> focus<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:04.729> continue<00:05:05.090> to

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
we got to keep our focus and continue to

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.690 
we got to keep our focus and continue to
try<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.300> get<00:05:05.510> better
