00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:08.920
 good we are to upload the videos 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.720
 we're going to look at this is a deck 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.500
 Spanish and I have it all 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.150
 for good order you see all that you see 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.300
 that everyone is 100 up 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.070
 all the letters are up and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.740
 all 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.689
 so it points I'm like the signal that 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.789
 I put the two red ones on top 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.190
 the two green down the king of 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.110
 Cups he released to all and all for 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.030
 up then what happens to have everything 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.070
 stick for one side 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.839
 we take and we give the letter I chose that is the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.210
 who wants no problem and now 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.550
 when you give him the letter to choose you tell him 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.060
 come look at the letter and you who is the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.340
 You swing like that and turn it around 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.320
 you flip once gives the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.230
 back we have already done we have invested 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.760
 the clubs that we had up 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.310
 now they are down, it's the opposite 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.260
 of this then we tell you 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.490
 that put it wherever you want does not matter 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.050
 right here around here we put it there 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.760
 now we cut what they want 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.270
 to do with the deck what they want 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.310
 that the simple product mix and when 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.799
 so what happens now we 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.890
 we have all the clubs so all for 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.140
 up this me whenever I put it what 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.539
 I put looking for me to the right that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.119
 you catch that it 's like that up then 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.180
 all the sticks up all all 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.010
 the sticks up 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.100
 as I see now we have to have 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.370
 the letter that I have chosen then return for 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.370
 down 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.510
 winds up look 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.030
 it's the opposite 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.700
 is looking down and they are all 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.150
 looking up 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.740
 come on 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.510
 then this is with the bars 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.360
 Spanish is done because it can be done 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.360
 almost with the whole deck can be done 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.070
 also with the French bar what 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.650
 it happens that you have to 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.030
 that you have to prepare fewer letters there 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.940
 to prepare less castellÃ³ I have 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.120
 prepared these nothing else not then 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.040
 let's say it's like that 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.110
 the 7 because as it has here this for 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.910
 up the heart is up and this 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.520
 up to see these two for 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.430
 up here up but otherwise paris 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.760
 not everything is that water that the goal here 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.519
 in the middle 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.710
 that I put it more or less in the middle and 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.080
 I give a letter to choose 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.480
 take the letter and tell him to put it in 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.660
 average normally when we put it through 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.660
 medium enters inside the letters that 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.520
 we have not these much up and 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.340
 when we see that one is not one of those 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.950
 we have to order the stick that they have 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.420
 chosen vale have fiction I like and 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.080
 subscribe this cannes but that usually 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.080
 like this trick
