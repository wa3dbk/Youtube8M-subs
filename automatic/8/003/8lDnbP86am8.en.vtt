turning<00:04:35.819> a<00:04:35.849> little<00:04:35.909> greenish<00:04:37.490> but<00:04:38.490> yeah<00:04:40.009> the

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
turning a little greenish but yeah the

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.059 
turning a little greenish but yeah the
batting<00:04:41.460> orders<00:04:41.699> club<00:04:41.940> is<00:04:42.090> super<00:04:42.360> nervous

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
batting orders club is super nervous

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.899

just<00:04:44.069> perfect

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
just perfect

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.279 
just perfect
the<00:04:45.720> laces<00:04:46.259> could<00:04:46.470> really<00:04:46.680> be<00:04:46.889> better<00:04:47.159> but

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
the laces could really be better but

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.149 
the laces could really be better but
yeah<00:04:49.289> I<00:04:49.620> might<00:04:50.430> get<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.669> real<00:04:50.940> ace<00:04:51.710> I'm<00:04:52.710> thinking

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159 
yeah I might get a real ace I'm thinking

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.480 
yeah I might get a real ace I'm thinking
about<00:04:53.310> getting<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.240> related<00:04:54.750> silver<00:04:55.289> or<00:04:56.220> gray

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
about getting it related silver or gray

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.990 
about getting it related silver or gray
something<00:04:57.000> like<00:04:57.120> that<00:04:57.330> just<00:04:57.539> because<00:04:58.849> if<00:04:59.849> I

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
something like that just because if I

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.969 
something like that just because if I
would<00:05:00.150> do<00:05:00.270> red<00:05:00.599> and<00:05:00.900> it<00:05:01.289> doesn't<00:05:01.620> match<00:05:01.770> with

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
would do red and it doesn't match with

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.330 
would do red and it doesn't match with
the<00:05:02.099> party<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:03.000> would<00:05:03.210> look<00:05:03.419> stupid<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.560> Navy

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
the party it would look stupid and Navy

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.920 
the party it would look stupid and Navy
would<00:05:05.580> also<00:05:05.819> not<00:05:06.060> be<00:05:06.120> super<00:05:06.389> smart<00:05:06.840> but

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
would also not be super smart but

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.379 
would also not be super smart but
because<00:05:08.659> the<00:05:09.659> Navy's<00:05:10.110> faded<00:05:10.880> and<00:05:11.880> if<00:05:12.060> you<00:05:12.150> get

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
because the Navy's faded and if you get

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.020 
because the Navy's faded and if you get
like<00:05:12.569> a<00:05:12.630> new<00:05:12.960> base<00:05:13.229> relays<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:14.550> doesn't<00:05:14.909> really

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
like a new base relays it doesn't really

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.600 
like a new base relays it doesn't really
match<00:05:15.330> well<00:05:15.659> so<00:05:16.289> I<00:05:16.319> thought<00:05:16.680> silver<00:05:17.099> was<00:05:17.250> great

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
match well so I thought silver was great

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.540 
match well so I thought silver was great
also<00:05:18.509> two<00:05:18.690> men<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.169> there<00:05:19.409> you<00:05:20.190> got<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.400> bet

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
also two men to it there you got a bet

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.700 
also two men to it there you got a bet
oh<00:05:20.639> great

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
oh great

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.360 
oh great
and<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:22.800> think<00:05:23.069> that's<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:23.430> for<00:05:23.639> the<00:05:23.699> video

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
and I think that's it for the video

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.950 
and I think that's it for the video
