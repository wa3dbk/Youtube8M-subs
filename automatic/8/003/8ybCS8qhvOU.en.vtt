underneath
now<00:00:18.960> there's<00:00:19.230> three<00:00:19.650> different<00:00:20.010> ways<00:00:20.189> to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
now there's three different ways to

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.490 
now there's three different ways to
enter<00:00:20.730> information<00:00:20.880> there's<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.080> freehand

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
enter information there's the freehand

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.820 
enter information there's the freehand
style<00:00:22.859> where<00:00:23.100> I'm<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.400> writing<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:24.680> words<00:00:25.680> in

style where I'm just writing in words in

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:37.380 
style where I'm just writing in words in
my<00:00:25.980> own<00:00:26.130> handwriting

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.779 

like<00:00:37.929> that<00:00:38.170> and<00:00:38.440> then<00:00:38.559> I<00:00:38.589> hit<00:00:38.859> insert<00:00:39.309> and<00:00:39.640> it

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
like that and then I hit insert and it

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.729 
like that and then I hit insert and it
puts<00:00:39.999> it<00:00:40.089> in<00:00:40.239> his<00:00:40.359> text

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:55.009 

the<00:00:45.510> second<00:00:46.510> method<00:00:51.600> his<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.829> just<00:00:54.100> using<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:54.850> a

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
the second method his is just using it a

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.450 
the second method his is just using it a
character<00:00:56.019> method<00:00:56.350> so<00:00:56.649> what<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.039> can<00:00:57.159> do<00:00:57.369> is

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
character method so what I can do is

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.859 
character method so what I can do is
I'll<00:00:57.579> just<00:00:57.760> delete<00:00:57.909> these<00:00:58.180> texts<00:00:58.539> either<00:00:58.659> by

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
I'll just delete these texts either by

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:01.079 
I'll just delete these texts either by
turning<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.350> pen<00:00:59.500> around<00:00:59.739> or<00:01:00.729> I<00:01:00.760> can<00:01:01.059> use

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
turning the pen around or I can use

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.899 
turning the pen around or I can use
gestures<00:01:01.689> and<00:01:01.839> just<00:01:02.429> rub<00:01:03.429> it<00:01:03.460> out<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:06.700> can

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
gestures and just rub it out and I can

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.870 
gestures and just rub it out and I can
write<00:01:07.119> in<00:01:07.270> like<00:01:07.420> this<00:01:07.780> way<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:09.580> is<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
write in like this way this is the

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.430 
write in like this way this is the
second<00:01:10.210> method<00:01:10.299> character<00:01:10.869> methods<00:01:11.170> really

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
second method character methods really

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.199 
second method character methods really
good<00:01:11.619> for<00:01:12.720> writing<00:01:13.720> in<00:01:13.810> particular<00:01:15.000> URLs<00:01:16.000> or

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:16.209 
good for writing in particular URLs or

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:23.399 
good for writing in particular URLs or
web<00:01:16.450> pages<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:22.299> just<00:01:22.509> goes<00:01:22.659> like<00:01:22.690> that<00:01:23.049> so<00:01:23.259> when

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
web pages it just goes like that so when

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.020 
web pages it just goes like that so when
I<00:01:23.440> hit<00:01:23.619> enter<00:01:23.830> it'll<00:01:24.369> it'll<00:01:24.729> go<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:24.940> the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
I hit enter it'll it'll go to the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.449 
I hit enter it'll it'll go to the
website<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.950> then<00:01:27.100> I'll<00:01:27.190> come<00:01:27.399> up<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:30.250> third

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
website and then I'll come up the third

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:36.389 
website and then I'll come up the third
method<00:01:30.700> is<00:01:33.899> using<00:01:34.899> a<00:01:34.959> virtual<00:01:35.110> keyboard<00:01:35.409> so

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
method is using a virtual keyboard so

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.389 
method is using a virtual keyboard so
this<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:36.700> where<00:01:36.850> I<00:01:36.880> just<00:01:37.209> tap<00:01:37.390> on<00:01:37.539> tap<00:01:37.899> on<00:01:38.049> the

this is where I just tap on tap on the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.749 
this is where I just tap on tap on the
the<00:01:39.399> keys<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:41.160> and<00:01:42.160> right<00:01:42.340> in<00:01:42.489> the<00:01:42.580> page

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
the keys and and right in the page

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:51.870 
the keys and and right in the page
that'll<00:01:43.119> want<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.390> go<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.569> loca

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.370 

and<00:01:52.950> that's<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.070> quick<00:01:54.729> overview<00:01:55.180> of<00:01:55.210> how

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and that's a quick overview of how

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.219 
and that's a quick overview of how
different<00:01:56.380> handwriting<00:01:57.600> input<00:01:58.600> methods<00:01:59.140> in
