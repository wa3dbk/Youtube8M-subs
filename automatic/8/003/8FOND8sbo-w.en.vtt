is in pretty good shape the problem

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.190 
is in pretty good shape the problem
isn't<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.680> model<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.180> level<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.780> detail

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
isn't the model it's the level of detail

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.950 
isn't the model it's the level of detail
in<00:02:28.380> disclosure<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.550> we<00:02:29.730> need<00:02:29.970> around<00:02:30.450> that

we're clearly not getting that we can
