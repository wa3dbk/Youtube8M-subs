oops<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.750> now<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.170> will<00:01:25.650> happen

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
oops and now this will happen

oops and now this will happen
what<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:29.000> obviously<00:01:30.000> ps2<00:01:30.659> s<00:01:30.720> are

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
what this is is obviously ps2 s are

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
at 60fps NARS PAL run at 50 so if you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.859 
at 60fps NARS PAL run at 50 so if you
have<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:39.720> own<00:01:39.869> discs<00:01:40.409> choose<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.579> region

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
have your own discs choose your region

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.240 
have your own discs choose your region
however<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.380> downloaded<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.040> from<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
however if you downloaded it from the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.609 
however if you downloaded it from the
internet<00:01:44.340> most<00:01:45.149> likely<00:01:45.659> there<00:01:45.869> will<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.049> USA

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
internet most likely there will be USA

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.060 
internet most likely there will be USA
so<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:47.130> choose<00:01:47.310> USA<00:01:47.939> 2002<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.920> my

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.010 
so just choose USA 2002 but I have my
own<00:01:50.189> discs<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.000> let's<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:51.780> Europe<00:01:53.960> now<00:01:54.960> you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
own discs so let's use Europe now you
