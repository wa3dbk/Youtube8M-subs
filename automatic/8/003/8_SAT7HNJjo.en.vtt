00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
high-volume shot guys and so I had to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.780 
high-volume shot guys and so I had to
find<00:02:58.799> a<00:02:58.889> way<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.010> get<00:02:59.189> on<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> floor<00:02:59.609> to<00:02:59.760> be

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
find a way to get on the floor to be

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.729 
find a way to get on the floor to be
successful<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.599> and<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:01.139> found<00:03:01.439> that<00:03:01.590> with

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
successful and and I found that with

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.920 
successful and and I found that with
with<00:03:02.010> hustle<00:03:02.400> plays<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:02.790> rebounding<00:03:03.299> so<00:03:03.810> I've

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
with hustle plays and rebounding so I've

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.420 
with hustle plays and rebounding so I've
just<00:03:03.959> tried<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.290> expand<00:03:04.680> my<00:03:04.829> game<00:03:05.040> from<00:03:05.219> there

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
just tried to expand my game from there

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.770 
just tried to expand my game from there
but<00:03:05.609> that's<00:03:05.699> something<00:03:06.150> rebounding<00:03:06.689> is

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
but that's something rebounding is

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.939 
but that's something rebounding is
something<00:03:07.049> that<00:03:07.169> every<00:03:07.319> time<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.530> go<00:03:07.620> on<00:03:07.859> the

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:07.949 
something that every time I go on the

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:09.559 
something that every time I go on the
floor<00:03:08.159> I<00:03:08.219> know<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.699> that<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.239> want<00:03:09.480> to

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
floor I know that that I want to

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.000 
floor I know that that I want to
accomplish<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.199> I<00:03:10.230> think<00:03:10.439> that's<00:03:10.620> kind<00:03:10.829> of<00:03:10.889> my

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
accomplish and I think that's kind of my

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.920 
accomplish and I think that's kind of my
calling<00:03:11.400> card<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.699> I<00:03:11.760> think<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
calling card and I think with the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.539 
calling card and I think with the
up-tempo<00:03:13.230> style<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.859> Golden<00:03:14.129> State<00:03:14.310> wants

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
up-tempo style that Golden State wants

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.030 
up-tempo style that Golden State wants
to<00:03:14.639> play<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.909> coach<00:03:15.060> Nelson<00:03:15.419> wants<00:03:15.629> to<00:03:15.719> play

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
to play the coach Nelson wants to play

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.409 
to play the coach Nelson wants to play
you<00:03:17.040> know<00:03:17.099> big<00:03:17.400> part<00:03:17.669> of<00:03:17.699> that<00:03:17.759> is<00:03:17.909> defensive

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
you know big part of that is defensive

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:19.460 
you know big part of that is defensive
rebounding<00:03:18.780> because<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.019> can't<00:03:19.259> get<00:03:19.379> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
rebounding because you can't get the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.289 
rebounding because you can't get the
ball<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.739> goat<00:03:19.889> so<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.129> get<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.400> rebound<00:03:20.790> but

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
ball and goat so you get the rebound but

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.699 
ball and goat so you get the rebound but
I<00:03:21.389> think<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.689> Warriors<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.379> know<00:03:22.470> even

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
I think the Warriors you know even

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.199 
I think the Warriors you know even
without<00:03:23.009> me<00:03:23.159> are<00:03:23.250> gonna<00:03:23.370> be<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> much<00:03:23.790> improved

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
without me are gonna be a much improved

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.969 
without me are gonna be a much improved
rebounding<00:03:24.750> team<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:24.989> mean<00:03:25.139> Andres<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.739> coming

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
back off an injury and there were a lot

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.119 
back off an injury and there were a lot
of<00:03:27.239> injuries<00:03:27.540> last<00:03:27.689> year<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.199> bigs<00:03:28.409> so<00:03:29.099> I

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
of injuries last year to the bigs so I

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.339 
of injuries last year to the bigs so I
think<00:03:29.250> when<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:29.579> add<00:03:29.790> myself<00:03:30.359> mr.<00:03:30.689> Behrens<00:03:31.229> I

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
think when you add myself mr. Behrens I

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.599 
think when you add myself mr. Behrens I
think<00:03:31.530> we're<00:03:31.650> gonna<00:03:31.739> be<00:03:31.949> in<00:03:32.040> good<00:03:32.189> shape<00:03:32.250> on

think we're gonna be in good shape on
the<00:03:32.729> boards<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.209> think<00:03:33.449> that<00:03:33.629> we<00:03:33.689> can<00:03:33.840> out

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
the boards and I think that we can out

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.149 
the boards and I think that we can out
rebound<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.349> lot<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.590> teams<00:03:34.769> that's<00:03:34.979> gonna<00:03:35.069> be

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
something that's gonna be much improved

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
battles in the past and he's a guy that

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.060 
battles in the past and he's a guy that
that<00:04:25.020> doesn't<00:04:25.409> need<00:04:25.529> the<00:04:25.620> ball<00:04:25.800> every

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070

he's a great offensive rebounder a guy
the<00:04:29.370> rebounds<00:04:30.000> on<00:04:30.120> both<00:04:30.300> ends<00:04:30.570> effectively

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
the rebounds on both ends effectively

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.050 
the rebounds on both ends effectively
has<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.650> high<00:04:31.950> field<00:04:32.280> goal<00:04:32.460> percentage<00:04:32.880> can

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
has a high field goal percentage can

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.940 
has a high field goal percentage can
finish<00:04:33.270> great<00:04:33.540> around<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.870> basket<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.470> I

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
finish great around the basket and I

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.650 
finish great around the basket and I
think<00:04:35.190> he's<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.340> high<00:04:35.580> motor<00:04:35.850> high-energy<00:04:36.300> guy

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
think he's a high motor high-energy guy

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.150 
think he's a high motor high-energy guy
and<00:04:36.900> that's<00:04:37.050> important<00:04:37.500> in<00:04:37.590> Coach<00:04:37.770> Nelson

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
and that's important in Coach Nelson

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.920 
and that's important in Coach Nelson
system<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:38.760> I<00:04:39.210> think<00:04:39.480> that<00:04:39.600> that's<00:04:39.780> what

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
system and I think that that's what

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.330 
system and I think that that's what
makes<00:04:39.960> him<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:40.380> effective<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:40.920> system

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
makes him so effective in that system

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.320 
makes him so effective in that system
I'm<00:04:41.460> really<00:04:41.670> looking<00:04:41.940> forward<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.180> playing

around by New York and I think that that

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.710 
around by New York and I think that that
Golden<00:05:50.250> State<00:05:50.460> insists<00:05:50.910> it<00:05:51.030> on<00:05:51.180> unwanted<00:05:51.510> to

Golden State insists it on unwanted to

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.000 
Golden State insists it on unwanted to
keep<00:05:51.840> those<00:05:52.050> guys<00:05:52.260> were<00:05:52.470> able<00:05:52.590> to<00:05:52.710> get<00:05:52.860> the

keep those guys were able to get the
deal<00:05:53.190> done<00:05:53.220> anyways<00:05:53.790> and<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.240> look<00:05:55.050> I've<00:05:55.200> had

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
deal done anyways and and look I've had

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.770 
deal done anyways and and look I've had
28<00:05:56.010> years<00:05:56.220> of<00:05:56.430> you<00:05:56.760> know<00:05:56.820> five<00:05:57.120> years<00:05:57.150> now<00:05:57.600> of

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
28 years of you know five years now of

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.300 
28 years of you know five years now of
getting<00:05:58.229> fewer<00:05:58.560> wins<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.040> I<00:05:59.070> would<00:05:59.220> have

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
getting fewer wins and I would have

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.130 
getting fewer wins and I would have
liked<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.610> in<00:05:59.820> New<00:05:59.940> York<00:06:00.210> and<00:06:00.419> and<00:06:00.600> I<00:06:01.080> think

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
liked to in New York and and I think

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.690 
liked to in New York and and I think
that<00:06:01.560> would<00:06:01.680> this<00:06:01.860> young<00:06:02.130> core<00:06:02.430> we<00:06:02.580> have<00:06:02.669> a

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
that would this young core we have a

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.730 
that would this young core we have a
chance<00:06:03.000> not<00:06:03.180> only<00:06:03.240> to<00:06:03.450> be<00:06:03.600> successful<00:06:03.780> now<00:06:04.380> and

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
chance not only to be successful now and

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.290 
chance not only to be successful now and
and<00:06:04.950> with<00:06:05.130> some<00:06:05.280> teams<00:06:05.520> in<00:06:05.640> the<00:06:05.760> West<00:06:05.940> losing

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
and with some teams in the West losing

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.390 
and with some teams in the West losing
some<00:06:06.479> players<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:06.990> East<00:06:07.200> I<00:06:07.500> think<00:06:08.190> we<00:06:08.280> have

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
some players to the East I think we have

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.650 
some players to the East I think we have
a<00:06:08.430> chance<00:06:08.640> to<00:06:08.790> make<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.090> playoffs<00:06:09.270> this<00:06:09.600> year

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
a chance to make the playoffs this year

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.140 
a chance to make the playoffs this year
and<00:06:10.050> I<00:06:10.560> think<00:06:10.860> more<00:06:11.040> importantly<00:06:11.580> moving

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
and I think more importantly moving

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.880 
and I think more importantly moving
forward<00:06:12.600> for<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:12.990> years<00:06:13.200> to<00:06:13.380> come<00:06:13.410> we<00:06:13.770> have<00:06:13.830> a

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
forward for the years to come we have a

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.710 
forward for the years to come we have a
bright<00:06:14.130> future<00:06:14.160> I<00:06:14.610> think<00:06:14.760> Golden<00:06:15.300> State<00:06:15.479> fans

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
bright future I think Golden State fans

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.409 
bright future I think Golden State fans
would<00:06:15.870> be<00:06:15.900> very<00:06:16.080> excited<00:06:16.500> about<00:06:16.560> that<00:06:16.710> so

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
would be very excited about that so

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.580 
would be very excited about that so
that's<00:06:18.419> like<00:06:18.810> you<00:06:18.930> said<00:06:19.110> that's<00:06:19.169> one<00:06:19.470> of<00:06:19.530> the

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
that's like you said that's one of the

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.659 
that's like you said that's one of the
things<00:06:19.740> about<00:06:19.860> a<00:06:19.979> sign-and-trade<00:06:20.220> you<00:06:20.550> have<00:06:20.640> a

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
things about a sign-and-trade you have a

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.670 
things about a sign-and-trade you have a
little<00:06:20.790> more<00:06:21.000> control<00:06:21.479> and<00:06:21.720> you're<00:06:22.229> not<00:06:22.380> going

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
little more control and you're not going

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.930 
little more control and you're not going
to<00:06:22.830> a<00:06:22.860> team<00:06:23.100> that's<00:06:23.280> starting<00:06:23.580> from<00:06:23.700> square

that and and I think that that's one of
the<00:06:28.950> main<00:06:29.100> reasons<00:06:29.460> that<00:06:29.520> I<00:06:29.610> chose<00:06:29.880> Golden
