00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.830
 hello dear hungry i hope you are 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.400
 happy and healthy in the new year 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.380
 come 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.020
 and the end of the world is not 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.420
 2013 has only one place 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 be great year and i want this 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.529
 year also start very healthy namely 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.029
 with a cabbage soup I have anyway 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.770
 only good experiences with it and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.420
 We also enjoy each other then 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.920
 nothing to do with us over the holidays 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.320
 but one or the other gag be 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 rattled off glass or rattled off 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.290
 morsel was eaten whole and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.309
 can not hurt 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.320
 Now our bodies a bit 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.359
 detoxify and maybe even one 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 lose weight with this one 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.500
 white cabbage vegetable soup you can do that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.149
 excellent and in this form the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.100
 A little bit of the bigger standard 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.230
 For example, recipes will be different 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.359
 no onion soup is used, too 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.800
 a typical low carb recipes if you are 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.079
 sticks to it and to a park 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.359
 in fact, only this soup is one 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.250
 Weight reduction when a shortage 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.870
 kilo is completely realistic there 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.360
 continue the possibility one 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.490
 to carry out a week's kohlsuppendiÃ¤t 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.229
 but then there are different 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.970
 on the other days also others 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.950
 Food allowed then corresponds 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.720
 So not quite low carb but in 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.190
 one week between four and seven 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.290
 kilo decrease is not a problem 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.870
 very important but also that the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.550
 body is detoxified purifies to the 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.500
 Variant of the weeklong cabbage soup diet 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.740
 infobox 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.710
 But now to our soup we need 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.650

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.020

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.940

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.620

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.480
 cutting work we start with that 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.900
 white cabbage subdivide them 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.900
 bite-sized pieces then enter him 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:46.630

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.360
 cut them only long are then transversely 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:56.269

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.890
 also cut into narrow slices 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:12.360
 the goals are a bit bigger 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.840
 and the celery pretty much again 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.840
 small 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.819
 also the parsley still deprived and so 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.709
 then looks our prepared vegetables 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.260
 put a pot on the stove for something 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.980
 put in this and then the spices 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.200
 take care of that 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.410
 two robber leaves 3 team and can 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.050
 a little pepper a spoonful and a spoon 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.160
 little bit of the fans together 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.440
 all set and a bit 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.440
 Stir and only the vegetables added 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.560
 Let's go to the pizza tomatoes 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.150
 can also peeled who take this 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.770
 a little smaller and cuts 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.110
 fill with water with me that is 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.330
 about 1 meter so that the vegetables just 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.190
 just now covered is two more 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.160
 heaped teaspoons of vegetable stock 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.290
 a few chiliflocken a heaping 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.390
 teaspoons of herbs of provence and 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.850
 a little bit of the sweet herb 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.170
 Stir everything neatly 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.540
 top up and bring to a boil 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.840
 and as soon as everything is cooked, reduce heat 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.680
 and simmer for twelve minutes 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.870
 you should not have a pressure cooker 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.630
 Use of time increases to approx 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.340
 40 minutes and the vegetables can be quiet 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.440
 also show some bite 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.840
 because the soup that is eaten later yes 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.970
 looks a second time and looks like that 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.600
 then find our soup out of me 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.060
 appetizing 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.560
 In any case , she is healthy who wants 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.970

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.870
 like her, for example, peter serie 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.120

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.010

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.880
