00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.640
 1 made me farmer hello 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.590
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.269
 cocotte tv today I present to you 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.769
 a product that I've been waiting for since 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.150
 long time 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.730
 so it is with great pleasure that I 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 you present it with a feverishness a 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.340
 undisguised emotion but in any case 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.910
 not visible in the image 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.309
 this is the essence wan proposed by 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.290
 asus what is the essence one he 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.489
 it's just a dac 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 so I just have everything is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.750
 relative of a dac usb which is also ampli 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.660
 helmet 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.989
 so I'm going to take it out quickly from the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.550
 box 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.110
 I remind you that I tested the faith 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.480
 and bus not so long ago and that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.969
 I had been rather satisfied and there we 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.629
 crosses a clear qualitative course 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.060
 so inside the box that 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.220
 do we find a little booklet that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.500
 attests to the purity of the treatment of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.250
 signal by a whole series of graphs 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.549
 etc., etc 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.119
 that does not have much interest we have 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:26.189
 so also a user guide 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:31.860
 pardon definitely whose 23 pts we 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:36.720
 find a usb cable since it is 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.810
 possible usb adapter 3.5 mm to 6 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.170
 5 mm gold plated that I put you in the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.049
 box 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.500
 on the other side we have a cable 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.110
 sector 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.790
 it does not have much interest but it is there 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.159
 it's way too low it's more 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.049
 convenient 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.180
 then the dac itself 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.060
 clearly his weight is playing on it 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.650
 is not quite light I pushed 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.330
 the mailbox to keep in the corner 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.180
 since there are some indications 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.470
 techniques that could I'm going to you 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.510
 give that might interest you 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.090
 thereafter I put it here then the dac 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.400
 in itself is all about metal and like 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.300
 I said what very heavy 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.470
 that I do not know if it's a pledge of 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.060
 quality but in any case it is very 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.220
 heavy facade 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.410
 so we find the ignition button 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.080
 a button that will allow to put in 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.060
 route the sampling a button that 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.080
 will select the source 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.970
 coaxial tos usb a mute uncut 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.490
 the volume the volume I button 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.370
 general with on the side of the diodes that 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.959
 will allow to visualize the sampling 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.340
 this part is rather intended for 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.950
 helmets since we have so a 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:54.500
 headphone specific volume that will handle the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.030
 exit 6 5 mm below 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.180
 feet during a little rubber 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:04.840
 sticker and at the back of the exits 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:08.390
 in RCA outputs xlr coaxial input 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.300
 optical and usb a voltage selection 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.720
 for regions and the arrival of 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.230
 feeding then it's a dac that 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.690
 is sold around them 450 euros me 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.120
 does it seem that will allow me to 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.830
 test the helmets and speakers that 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.160
 I will compete with my mini 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.360
 of nominee matrix is not quite 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.070
 but not quite in the same range 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.230
 since we are around 329 euros 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.820
 proposes a restitution of the sound which is 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.380
 necessarily different certainly 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.640
 much more neutral and much more 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.519
 cold or even analytical 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.130
 I already said in the tests if the 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.420
 is the responsibility or at least the same 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.190
 acabit that faith and bus 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.239
 we should be on something 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.820
 much hotter much more 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.280
 nice that give you like 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.380
 technical information that he proposes so 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.989
 extreme audio clarity like you 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.459
 have understood it so audio clarity 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:03.190
 particular with 120 a signal report 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:06.620
 120db noise they offer amp 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.380
 audiophiles class they cover a 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.570
 spectrum of 40 current by donation of 10 rc 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.040
 up to 48 min hertz and that for the 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.910
 remains technical information that 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.709
 are quite numerous 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.859
 I invite you to come and read the cries test 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.409
 which will appear 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.939
 shortly afterwards on the farm and I 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.150
 I'm going to hasten to plug it in 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:25.379
 to listen who can give on my e 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.629
 500 so my helmet 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.580
 ortho dynamic so here I am you 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:31.409
 wish a good day on the farm in 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.889
 our company and I tell you to very 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.310
 very soon 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.310
 goodbye
