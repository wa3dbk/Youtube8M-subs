place<00:01:19.939> just<00:01:20.360> really<00:01:20.750> grabbed<00:01:21.079> me<00:01:21.320> really

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
place just really grabbed me really

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.859 
place just really grabbed me really
interested<00:01:22.130> me<00:01:22.490> in<00:01:22.549> my<00:01:23.090> first<00:01:23.360> thoughts<00:01:23.600> where

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
interested me in my first thoughts where

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.200 
interested me in my first thoughts where
I<00:01:23.899> had<00:01:24.110> have<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.619> go<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.009> secondly<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.729> really

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
I had have to go and secondly and really

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.060 
I had have to go and secondly and really
like<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.479> try<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:26.780> break<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.110> records

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.470

so this is the rock palace to be my home
for<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.260> sixty<00:01:37.650> days<00:01:37.800> hopefully<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.580> rock

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
for the for sixty days hopefully on rock

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.630 
for the for sixty days hopefully on rock
or<00:01:39.030> having<00:01:39.480> looked<00:01:39.720> at<00:01:40.170> various<00:01:41.010> things<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
or having looked at various things I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.790 
or having looked at various things I
actually<00:01:41.760> saw<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.600> water<00:01:42.930> Bowser<00:01:43.290> at<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.620> side

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
actually saw a water Bowser at the side

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.670 
actually saw a water Bowser at the side
of<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.010> road<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.060> thought<00:01:45.360> that's<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> ideal

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

side of Rockall I've really enjoyed the
process<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:38.450> constructing<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.690> pod<00:02:39.900> of

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
process of constructing the pod of

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.500 
process of constructing the pod of
researching<00:02:40.709> how<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.890> get<00:02:41.190> there<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.640> finding

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
researching how to get there of finding

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.300 
researching how to get there of finding
the<00:02:42.630> best<00:02:42.840> boat<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.830> getting<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
the best boat just just getting to the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.000 
the best boat just just getting to the
start<00:02:44.580> line<00:02:44.640> has<00:02:44.940> been<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.450> very<00:02:46.020> big<00:02:46.470> challenge

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
start line has been a very big challenge

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.699 
start line has been a very big challenge
and<00:02:47.190> one<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.060> really<00:02:48.510> enjoyed<00:02:48.959> just<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
and one of really enjoyed just the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.350 
and one of really enjoyed just the
logistics<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.580> little<00:02:50.730> bit<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.970> handle

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
logistics of it a little bit of a handle

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.110 
logistics of it a little bit of a handle
and<00:02:51.840> then<00:02:52.050> up<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:54.620> that's<00:02:55.620> not<00:02:56.160> too

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
and then up and in that's not too

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.490 
and then up and in that's not too
complicated<00:03:02.450> it's<00:03:03.450> very<00:03:03.510> fairly<00:03:04.110> small<00:03:04.440> in

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
complicated it's very fairly small in

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.229 
complicated it's very fairly small in
here<00:03:04.770> mean<00:03:04.950> obviously<00:03:05.220> at<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.430> end<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.970> can't

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
here mean obviously at this end I can't

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.210 
here mean obviously at this end I can't
sit<00:03:06.510> up<00:03:06.540> straight<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.110> can<00:03:07.320> just<00:03:07.500> about<00:03:07.739> sit<00:03:08.070> up

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
sit up straight I can just about sit up

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.060 
sit up straight I can just about sit up
hunched<00:03:08.670> by<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.420> access<00:03:09.989> hatch<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.620> don't

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
hunched by the access hatch I don't

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.070 
hunched by the access hatch I don't
normally<00:03:11.250> suffer<00:03:11.910> from<00:03:12.060> claustrophobia<00:03:12.239> and

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
normally suffer from claustrophobia and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.050 
normally suffer from claustrophobia and
my<00:03:13.680> hope<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.220> I'm<00:03:14.519> not<00:03:14.700> going<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:14.910> be

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
my hope is that I'm not going to be

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.320 
my hope is that I'm not going to be
stuck<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.530> pod<00:03:16.769> for<00:03:17.100> more<00:03:17.310> than<00:03:17.519> two<00:03:18.209> or

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
stuck in the pod for more than two or

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.690 
stuck in the pod for more than two or
three<00:03:18.360> days<00:03:18.540> at<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.959> time

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
three days at a time

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.570 
three days at a time
if<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.940> weather's<00:03:21.239> at<00:03:21.450> all<00:03:21.980> clear<00:03:22.980> then<00:03:23.370> I'm

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
if the weather's at all clear then I'm

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.759 
if the weather's at all clear then I'm
going<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.850> be<00:03:23.970> out<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.390> pod<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.440> on<00:03:25.620> the

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
going to be out of the pod and on the

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.670 
going to be out of the pod and on the
rock<00:03:26.450> not<00:03:27.450> really<00:03:27.780> stretching<00:03:28.170> my<00:03:28.290> legs<00:03:28.500> but

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
rock not really stretching my legs but

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.410 
rock not really stretching my legs but
certainly<00:03:29.070> be<00:03:29.459> able<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.730> stretch<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.239> body

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
certainly be able to stretch the body

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.170 
certainly be able to stretch the body
out<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.660> bit<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.650> stand<00:03:32.010> up<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.760> move<00:03:32.970> around

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
out a bit and stand up and move around

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.300 
out a bit and stand up and move around
and<00:03:33.600> do<00:03:33.720> some<00:03:33.900> exercise

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
and do some exercise

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.580 
and do some exercise
so<00:03:35.670> really<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.090> pod<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.510> just<00:03:36.900> shelter<00:03:37.440> for

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
so really the pod is just shelter for

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.420 
so really the pod is just shelter for
extreme<00:03:38.040> weather<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.400> sleeping

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.940 

so<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.329> portable<00:03:44.959> petrol<00:03:45.409> winch<00:03:45.590> and

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
so this is a portable petrol winch and

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.550 
so this is a portable petrol winch and
which<00:03:46.250> I'll<00:03:46.430> be<00:03:46.519> using<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:47.060> bring<00:03:47.599> the<00:03:47.989> pod<00:03:48.260> and

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
which I'll be using to bring the pod and

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.850 
which I'll be using to bring the pod and
all<00:03:48.739> my<00:03:48.890> equipment<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:49.430> onto<00:03:49.879> rock<00:03:50.060> or<00:03:50.709> two<00:03:51.709> of

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
all my equipment up onto rock or two of

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.559 
all my equipment up onto rock or two of
those

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:06.360 

that's<00:03:58.200> it

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.100 

there's<00:04:07.370> two<00:04:07.610> things<00:04:07.910> in<00:04:08.239> this<00:04:08.420> Pelle<00:04:08.810> case

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
there's two things in this Pelle case

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.940 
there's two things in this Pelle case
actually<00:04:10.390> there<00:04:11.390> is<00:04:11.629> the<00:04:12.290> road<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.650> tail

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
actually there is the road to the tail

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.550 
actually there is the road to the tail
blade<00:04:13.280> for<00:04:13.700> my<00:04:13.790> wind<00:04:13.970> turbine<00:04:14.390> that<00:04:14.599> packs

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
blade for my wind turbine that packs

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.080 
blade for my wind turbine that packs
nicely<00:04:15.980> in<00:04:16.040> there<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.430> then<00:04:16.549> this<00:04:16.699> is<00:04:16.880> my

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
nicely in there and then this is my

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.849 
nicely in there and then this is my
began<00:04:17.630> satellite<00:04:18.169> unit<00:04:18.760> with<00:04:19.760> phone<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:21.680> that

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
began satellite unit with phone so that

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.400 
began satellite unit with phone so that
will<00:04:22.010> enable<00:04:22.340> me<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.639> keep<00:04:22.970> in<00:04:23.180> contact<00:04:23.750> with
