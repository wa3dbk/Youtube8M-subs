bite<00:00:07.540> diagrams<00:00:08.139> we<00:00:08.889> begin<00:00:09.190> with<00:00:09.400> a

bite diagrams we begin with a

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.150 
bite diagrams we begin with a
middle-aged<00:00:09.969> star<00:00:10.530> hydrogen<00:00:11.530> is<00:00:11.680> burning<00:00:12.070> in

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
middle-aged star hydrogen is burning in

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.430 
middle-aged star hydrogen is burning in
a<00:00:12.250> shell<00:00:12.519> around<00:00:12.730> the<00:00:13.269> core<00:00:13.690> of<00:00:13.720> the<00:00:13.900> star<00:00:14.139> to

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
a shell around the core of the star to

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.040 
a shell around the core of the star to
create<00:00:14.710> the<00:00:14.830> energy<00:00:15.250> we<00:00:15.460> see<00:00:15.700> as<00:00:15.849> light<00:00:16.119> this

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
create the energy we see as light this

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.260 
create the energy we see as light this
burning<00:00:17.349> creates<00:00:17.860> helium<00:00:18.310> as<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.520> by-product

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
burning creates helium as a by-product

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.710 
burning creates helium as a by-product
helium<00:00:20.169> being<00:00:20.739> heavier<00:00:21.070> than<00:00:21.220> hydrogen<00:00:21.720> sinks

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
helium being heavier than hydrogen sinks

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.359 
helium being heavier than hydrogen sinks
to<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:22.869> core<00:00:23.200> of<00:00:23.290> the<00:00:23.380> star<00:00:23.590> and<00:00:23.860> just<00:00:24.160> sits

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
to the core of the star and just sits

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.479 
to the core of the star and just sits
there<00:00:24.899> since<00:00:25.899> helium<00:00:26.320> is<00:00:26.410> not<00:00:26.560> burning<00:00:26.890> it<00:00:27.340> is

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
there since helium is not burning it is

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.069 
there since helium is not burning it is
not<00:00:27.669> producing<00:00:28.090> energy<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.599> hold<00:00:28.779> up<00:00:28.960> the

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
not producing energy to hold up the

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.260 
not producing energy to hold up the
outer<00:00:29.200> layers<00:00:29.500> so<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.309> hydrogen<00:00:30.759> has<00:00:30.939> to<00:00:31.119> burn

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
outer layers so the hydrogen has to burn

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.970 
outer layers so the hydrogen has to burn
hotter<00:00:31.540> to<00:00:31.840> make<00:00:32.020> up<00:00:32.200> for<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.470> hole<00:00:32.680> in<00:00:32.890> the

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
hotter to make up for the hole in the

burning<00:00:35.500> puffs<00:00:35.980> out<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.399> outer<00:00:36.550> layers<00:00:36.910> of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
burning puffs out the outer layers of

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.360 
burning puffs out the outer layers of
the<00:00:37.210> star<00:00:37.329> which<00:00:38.230> cool<00:00:38.500> a<00:00:38.530> bit<00:00:38.769> and<00:00:38.829> turn<00:00:39.070> red

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
the star which cool a bit and turn red

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.779 
the star which cool a bit and turn red
now<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.090> star<00:00:40.480> has<00:00:40.690> become<00:00:40.989> a<00:00:41.050> red<00:00:41.350> giant<00:00:41.789> at

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
now the star has become a red giant at

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.569 
now the star has become a red giant at
this<00:00:43.089> point<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:44.079> star<00:00:44.320> itself<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:45.219> as<00:00:45.370> large

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
this point the star itself is as large

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.360 
this point the star itself is as large
as<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.000> orbit<00:00:46.329> of<00:00:46.420> mercury<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.890> takes<00:00:48.100> about<00:00:48.309> a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
as the orbit of mercury it takes about a

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.160 
as the orbit of mercury it takes about a
hundred<00:00:48.609> million<00:00:49.030> years<00:00:49.239> for<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.839> star<00:00:50.140> to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
hundred million years for a star to

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.470 
hundred million years for a star to
become<00:00:50.589> a<00:00:50.620> red<00:00:50.829> giant<00:00:51.089> after<00:00:52.089> a<00:00:52.120> few<00:00:52.329> hundred

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
become a red giant after a few hundred

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.840 
become a red giant after a few hundred
more<00:00:52.870> years<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.710> core<00:00:53.949> becomes<00:00:54.219> hot<00:00:54.519> enough

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
more years the core becomes hot enough

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.899 
more years the core becomes hot enough
to<00:00:54.879> fuse<00:00:55.300> helium<00:00:55.629> as<00:00:56.019> well<00:00:56.350> as<00:00:56.499> hydrogen<00:00:56.909> so

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
to fuse helium as well as hydrogen so

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.479 
to fuse helium as well as hydrogen so
all<00:00:58.030> this<00:00:58.210> helium<00:00:58.570> ash<00:00:58.960> in<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.199> core<00:00:59.530> suddenly

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
all this helium ash in the core suddenly

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.340 
all this helium ash in the core suddenly
becomes<00:01:00.819> a<00:01:00.969> source<00:01:01.300> of<00:01:01.480> fuel<00:01:01.690> for<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.109> fire

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
becomes a source of fuel for the fire

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.369 
becomes a source of fuel for the fire
and<00:01:02.620> as<00:01:03.429> with<00:01:03.640> any<00:01:03.850> fire<00:01:04.180> burning<00:01:05.140> helium

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
and as with any fire burning helium

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.010 
and as with any fire burning helium
leaves<00:01:05.800> behind<00:01:05.980> its<00:01:06.370> own<00:01:06.550> ash<00:01:06.820> in<00:01:07.090> this<00:01:07.780> case

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
leaves behind its own ash in this case

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.740 
leaves behind its own ash in this case
it<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.229> carbon<00:01:08.799> so<00:01:09.729> we<00:01:09.880> have<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.090> red<00:01:10.390> giant

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
it is carbon so we have a red giant

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.639 
it is carbon so we have a red giant
burning<00:01:11.409> hydrogen<00:01:11.829> and<00:01:12.159> helium<00:01:13.149> and<00:01:13.649> creating

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
burning hydrogen and helium and creating

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.380 
burning hydrogen and helium and creating
carbon<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.430> is<00:01:15.490> settling<00:01:16.000> in<00:01:16.119> its<00:01:16.299> core<00:01:18.390> but

carbon that is settling in its core but

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
if the carbon core called a white dwarf

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.020 
if the carbon core called a white dwarf
is<00:01:22.479> big<00:01:23.140> enough<00:01:23.170> then<00:01:23.710> it<00:01:23.860> can<00:01:24.009> burn<00:01:24.250> carbon<00:01:24.759> to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
is big enough then it can burn carbon to

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.889 
is big enough then it can burn carbon to
this<00:01:25.869> creates<00:01:26.259> oxygen<00:01:26.860> as<00:01:27.399> a<00:01:27.430> by-product<00:01:28.000> the

this creates oxygen as a by-product the

this creates oxygen as a by-product the
oxygen<00:01:29.380> settles<00:01:29.740> into<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.130> core<00:01:30.369> until<00:01:30.640> it
