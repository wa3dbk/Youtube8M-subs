00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:15.380
 The other day I uploaded how to flower sunflowers 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:18.590
 Well this time that the season of cherry blossoms is approaching from now on 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.310
 Flower petals of the cherry tree 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.710
 I think that I want to knit a flower motif 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.800
 I saw it on the net 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.090
 The heart was dark pink and the petals were quite whiteish pink, so I knit it like this 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.600
 Though I saw 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.360
 Your favorite color 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.680
 I think that it should be good to weave 2 colors of center and petal to use 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.660
 Light pink and dark pink 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.560
 With Kate 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.290
 We will knit with 45 crochet this time 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.740
 At first we will knit from the center 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.210
 On the net 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.010
 You see, the petals of the cherry blossoms are thin 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.630
 Because it looks like 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.780
 This time is this 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:10.630
 It is the ally of the center 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:12.650
 5 times in the minor after petal knitting on a nori seaweed 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.040
 I will weave 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.040
 The net 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.640
 Once 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.000
 2nd floor 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.210
 Three times 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.930
 4th floor 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.790
 It is the fifth floor 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.920
 A little hit to the end 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.220
 And you asked 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.880
 If you move by pulling the yarn end 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.880
 To tight 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.760
 Kiyose pulled the thread end and the center was squeezed 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.479
 so 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:13.740
 Here as usual I'm pulling out this first piece of rain, but this changes the color so this 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.390
 I will cut at the stage a little longer 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.110
 The 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.510
 It is a cut and I have not pulled it out yet 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.420
 In from here 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.550
 It's a thread 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.550
 We already use, but first 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.319
 On the head of this first piece 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.640
 Crochet 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.640
 Put in this way 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:48.379

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.510
 I felt like 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.510
 From here 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.069
 is not it 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.930
 It starts this way 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:18.250
 I'm going to weave petals 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.550
 We knit the crochet four times 1 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.550

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.630

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.110
 Because next is long 3 because 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.980
 To Crochet 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.010
 Meat lumps like this 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.629

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.520
 I have a lot of work 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.050

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.310
 This is long 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.720
 The petals are 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.070
 It was possible 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.420
