00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.000
To the world it seems foolish
Why would one forsake it all?

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:36.011
Moving forth to follow Jesus,
to heed a sacred call

00:00:36.012 --> 00:00:46.012
But one purpose lies before me
And I remind myself again

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:53.013
What I do is for the Kingdom,
my Saviour and my friend

00:00:53.014 --> 00:01:02.014
It’s for the Kingdom
For the Saviour of my soul

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:10.015
For the One who died to free me
For the One who made me whole

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:19.026
For the One who could condemn me
Yet instead He took my place

00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:30.027
I will serve Him with my whole life
It’s for Him I run the race

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:42.028
Dear Lord, give me a vision
Of what You would have me do

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:50.029
That is greater far than I could dream of
Or in myself could do

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.030
For whatever is done that matters
is only done through You

00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:05.021
So I will give my life in service
running faithfully for You

00:02:05.022 --> 00:02:14.032
It’s for the Kingdom,
For the Saviour of my soul

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:23.033
For the One who died to free me
For the One who made me whole

00:02:26.034 --> 00:02:34.034
It’s for the Kingdom,
For the Saviour of my soul

00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:44.035
For the One who died to free me
For the One who made me whole

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:53.036
For the One who could condemn me
Yet instead He took my place

00:02:56.037 --> 00:03:18.037
I will serve Him with my whole life
It’s for Him I run the race

00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:26.038
