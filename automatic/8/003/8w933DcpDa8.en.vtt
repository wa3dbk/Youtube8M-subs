00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:09.480
 we made way for the third video that would be 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.060
 the transfer once presented 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.300
 done all the above here we already have what 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.339
 that is going to be the transfer we cut it 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.599
 here we only have transferred then 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:23.699
 we put the piece the fabric the transfer that 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.550
 we made with plastic and then we put it 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.230
 another canvas type paper you heat a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.619
 vinyl that is made here discard the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.870
 part that is discarded as for what 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.800
 expression is also transfer us 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.590
 fairly uniform temperature 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.329
 and then it makes more delicate then I'll 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.660
 I will give in the course more or less 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.079
 of 15 seconds about 190 degrees this is 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.309
 very relative to everyone in their homes with 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.309
 your thermos go see 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.019
 we take out 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.320
 then what are we going to do 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.020
 I do not know not to take it out immediately leave it there 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.540
 as if we cool a bit and here 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.220
 we have some that are already transferred 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.160
 then we take care very carefully 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.780
 a tip and we're taking it out then 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.940
 they are very good 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.900
 would be transfer in plastic made in 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.850
 serigraphy 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.300
 I already told you those plots are 80 frames 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.970
 and the 62 color frames 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.770
 here we have two colors here we have another 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.600
 to take off that we did also the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.600
 option in one color look 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.330
 and we would have the option that is 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.510
 a color is very good has a 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.880
 brightness 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.310
 well this is also used a lot for 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.480
 the numbers of football shirts or 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.620
 of clothing 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.620
 here is another seeing lives 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.760
 so there would be less two for two inks 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.970
 to an ink 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.350
 today they tend more or less to leave 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.350
 newly 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.110
 so the view 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.110
 it's going to be in plastic 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.780
 and spelling 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.780
 in the houses 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.570

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.130

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.200

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.819

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.650
