00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello everyone serve be music tv 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.110
 I have the immense pleasure today of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.019
 introduce you to the last born of the line 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.210
 bodner namely helios lÃ©lio it's a 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.520
 amp manufactured at the old point by 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.660
 point everything by hand using the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.890
 best available components 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.650
 currently on the market 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.109
 it has two types of input of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.800
 different voicing ap the plex is hot 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.349
 two channels a loop undo 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 possibility for milking 100 watts 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.390
 to be put in position 30 watts 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.989
 legitimate ap 30 a bottom that recovers the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.149
 engrave on the final short of all good of the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.980
 very very big coming directly from 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.670
 California I think an overview 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.030
 is needed 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.789
 we go there we are the plex entry that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.329
 bri obviously incorporates the sounds of house 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.309
 yen 45 up to a master volume 75 well 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.420
 drivÃ© we go there we are on the first case 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.420
 so instead has a clear sound 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 1 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.770
 I pass on the second channel where there 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.840
 has a pretty amazing profit margin 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.460
 I'm going to go on the neck pickup for 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.240
 a little crunch and then after we go 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.240
 send more sauce 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.880
 1 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.340
 not sinking you have I lift the link a little 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.790
 and we will immediately realize 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.790
 that it sends 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.450
 yeah 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.040
 that was for the first comeback on 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.989
 goes to the second 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.250
 second channel called hot then 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.140
 obviously as his name indicates it his 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.340
 share a little higher it goes up to 1 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.470
 jcm bushes before it explodes we go there 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.069
 So we start again on the first channel of 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.069
 this back there 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760
 1 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.300
 as we say namik I pass on the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.760
 second channel so obviously there's going 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.570
 to be higher I put myself so 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.570
 opposition sleeve 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.340
 and 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.609
 and now I change the bo issing on 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.519
 No. 2 channel I spend calf here 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.560
 a September that I had there at 80 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.469
 obviously more modern to find 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.859
 the jcm 80 we will have to raise a little 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.859
 volume 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.880
 at 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.680
 Oh 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.610
 or 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.530
 no 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.510
 it's the foundation of the bomb 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.370
 finished tour I hope that it 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.090
 you liked an amp extremely 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.970
 dynamic 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.440
 indisputably always his two 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.769
 magnificent entrances the plate this is the 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.329
 high two channels short at all good under 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.340
 the hand we have something we have a 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.230
 dynamic that is incredible versatility 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.700
 it's just great I think it's 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.230
 really the best marshall that jim 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.120
