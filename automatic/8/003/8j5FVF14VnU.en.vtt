got you can change the input boost

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.479 
got you can change the input boost
depending<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.820> how<00:00:54.120> lightly<00:00:54.870> or<00:00:55.289> how<00:00:56.280> loud

you're<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:56.910> recording<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:58.170> can

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you're going to be recording you can

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.950 
you're going to be recording you can
change<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.649> sample<00:00:59.010> rate<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.870> you<00:01:00.870> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
change a sample rate there and you can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.810 
change a sample rate there and you can
change<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.260> analyzer<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:02.910> scope<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.420> FFT<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
change your analyzer to scope or FFT and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.219 
change your analyzer to scope or FFT and
the<00:01:05.820> resolution<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> settings<00:01:07.110> will

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the resolution and the settings will

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.820 
the resolution and the settings will
take<00:01:07.350> effect<00:01:07.590> immediately<00:01:10.670> okay<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> guess

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
take effect immediately okay so I guess

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.719 
take effect immediately okay so I guess
the<00:01:14.070> first<00:01:14.250> thing<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.549> want<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:16.729> you

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the best thing to do would be to just go

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.669 
the best thing to do would be to just go
to<00:02:04.979> set<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.670> right<00:02:05.850> here

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.250 

and<00:02:10.679> let's<00:02:11.009> start<00:02:11.280> recording

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.830 

you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.370> see<00:02:17.549> you've<00:02:17.700> got<00:02:17.849> your<00:02:17.909> vu<00:02:18.599> meter

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
you can see you've got your vu meter

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.360 
you can see you've got your vu meter
right<00:02:19.170> there

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.710 

and<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.580> goes<00:02:23.700> from<00:02:23.940> green<00:02:24.269> yellow<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.690> red

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
and it goes from green yellow to red

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.229 
and it goes from green yellow to red
that's<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.319> know<00:02:25.530> you're<00:02:25.920> recording<00:02:26.760> too<00:02:27.000> loud

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
that's I know you're recording too loud

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.930 
that's I know you're recording too loud
and<00:02:27.739> let's<00:02:28.739> see<00:02:28.980> right<00:02:29.370> here<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.790> bottom

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and let's see right here on the bottom

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.640 
and let's see right here on the bottom
when<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.299> hit<00:02:30.420> record<00:02:30.750> again<00:02:31.080> while<00:02:31.530> you're

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
when you hit record again while you're

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.890 
when you hit record again while you're
recording<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.310> have<00:02:32.489> some<00:02:32.670> options<00:02:33.000> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
recording you have some options and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:43.720 
recording you have some options and
let's<00:02:34.769> boost<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.159> recording

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.950 

okay<00:02:44.730> let's<00:02:45.120> boost<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.110> again<00:02:47.630> she<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:48.810> tell

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
okay let's boost it again she can tell

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.300 
okay let's boost it again she can tell
it's<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.170> lot<00:02:49.350> more<00:02:49.380> sensitive<00:02:49.980> when<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.190> do

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
it's a lot more sensitive when you do

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.800 
it's a lot more sensitive when you do
that<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:56.150> let's<00:02:57.150> see<00:02:57.300> you've<00:02:57.420> got<00:02:57.600> all<00:02:57.690> you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
that and let's see you've got all you

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.170 
that and let's see you've got all you
also<00:02:58.050> have<00:02:58.140> more<00:02:58.320> features<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:59.030> you<00:03:00.030> can

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
also have more features here you can

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.180 
also have more features here you can
change<00:03:00.360> your<00:03:00.540> visible<00:03:00.840> visualization<00:03:01.680> by

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
change your visible visualization by

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.150 
change your visible visualization by
clicking<00:03:02.490> on<00:03:02.730> analyzer<00:03:03.210> here<00:03:03.480> at<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.630> bottom

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
clicking on analyzer here at the bottom

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.030 
clicking on analyzer here at the bottom
let's<00:03:05.160> go<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.570> change<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:09.740> let's<00:03:10.740> change<00:03:10.920> it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
let's go to change the let's change it

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:28.490 
let's go to change the let's change it
to<00:03:11.100> scope<00:03:11.400> mode<00:03:25.070> okay<00:03:27.110> let's<00:03:28.110> go<00:03:28.290> ahead<00:03:28.380> and

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
to scope mode okay let's go ahead and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.080 
to scope mode okay let's go ahead and
stop<00:03:28.860> recording<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:31.610> I'll<00:03:32.610> be<00:03:32.730> back<00:03:32.910> when

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
stop recording and I'll be back when

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.520 
stop recording and I'll be back when
it's<00:03:33.120> done<00:03:33.390> sometimes<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:33.930> takes<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.200> second

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
it's done sometimes it takes a second

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.350 
it's done sometimes it takes a second
after<00:03:34.650> your<00:03:34.800> recording<00:03:35.250> for<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.580> screen<00:03:36.240> to

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
after your recording for that screen to

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.870 
after your recording for that screen to
disappear<00:03:37.100> okay<00:03:38.100> i'm<00:03:38.220> going<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.400> show<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.610> the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
disappear okay i'm going to show you the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.150 
disappear okay i'm going to show you the
scope<00:03:39.360> function<00:03:39.810> real<00:03:39.990> quick<00:03:40.200> instead<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
scope function real quick instead of the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:54.380 
scope function real quick instead of the
FFT

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.819 

ok<00:03:55.390> I'm<00:03:55.480> going<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.629> take<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.810> long<00:03:56.019> shot<00:03:56.349> but<00:03:56.650> I'm

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
ok I'm going to take a long shot but I'm

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.440 
ok I'm going to take a long shot but I'm
going<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.010> try<00:03:57.159> to<00:03:57.250> play<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:57.819> through<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.239> file

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
going to try to play it through the file

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.470 
going to try to play it through the file
browser<00:03:58.719> and<00:03:59.760> sometimes<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:00.909> work<00:04:01.090> sometimes

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
browser and sometimes I work sometimes

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.759 
browser and sometimes I work sometimes
it<00:04:01.629> doesn't<00:04:04.829> so<00:04:07.079> if<00:04:08.079> you<00:04:08.200> click<00:04:08.319> on<00:04:08.500> file

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
it doesn't so if you click on file

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.250 
it doesn't so if you click on file
browser<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.969> was<00:04:10.150> i'm<00:04:10.930> going<00:04:11.079> to<00:04:11.170> go<00:04:11.230> ahead

and<00:04:11.409> delete<00:04:11.680> that<00:04:12.010> recording<00:04:13.379> and<00:04:14.849> i<00:04:15.849> should

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
and delete that recording and i should

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.819 
and delete that recording and i should
be<00:04:16.359> able<00:04:16.389> to<00:04:16.690> play<00:04:16.870> recording<00:04:17.859> 26<00:04:19.620> let's<00:04:20.620> see

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
be able to play recording 26 let's see

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.980 
be able to play recording 26 let's see
if<00:04:20.949> i<00:04:21.039> can<00:04:21.310> if<00:04:21.789> not<00:04:21.849> we'll<00:04:22.360> play<00:04:22.539> it<00:04:22.570> through

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
if i can if not we'll play it through

mobile finder I'm sorry ok and as I

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.129 
mobile finder I'm sorry ok and as I
originally<00:04:37.000> thought<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.539> wasn't<00:04:37.690> recording

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
originally thought it wasn't recording

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:46.010 
originally thought it wasn't recording
but<00:04:38.259> if<00:04:38.349> you<00:04:38.410> listen

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.779 

it's<00:04:46.590> very<00:04:46.919> faint<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.490> that's<00:04:47.639> probably

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
it's very faint and that's probably

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.279 
it's very faint and that's probably
because<00:04:48.060> i<00:04:48.180> have<00:04:48.449> my<00:04:48.599> volume<00:04:48.870> turned<00:04:49.199> down

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
because i have my volume turned down

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.249 
because i have my volume turned down
slightly<00:04:49.650> there<00:04:50.009> and<00:04:50.599> unfortunately<00:04:51.599> after

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
slightly there and unfortunately after

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.469 
slightly there and unfortunately after
it<00:04:52.500> plays<00:04:52.740> through<00:04:53.310> touch<00:04:53.610> studio<00:04:54.060> if<00:04:54.270> that's

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
it plays through touch studio if that's

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.059 
it plays through touch studio if that's
how<00:04:54.599> you<00:04:54.659> decide<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.080> play<00:04:55.229> it<00:04:55.470> it<00:04:55.620> will<00:04:55.770> crash

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
how you decide to play it it will crash

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.279 
how you decide to play it it will crash
to<00:04:56.099> the<00:04:56.310> springboard<00:04:56.849> and<00:04:57.120> I've<00:04:57.930> had<00:04:58.080> cases

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
to the springboard and I've had cases

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.260 
to the springboard and I've had cases
where<00:04:58.530> it's<00:04:58.770> actually<00:04:58.919> restarted<00:04:59.550> my<00:04:59.930> ipod<00:05:01.129> so

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270

guess<00:05:11.460> if<00:05:11.759> you<00:05:11.940> like<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:14.430> when<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:14.639> do<00:05:14.759> is<00:05:14.940> I<00:05:15.030> go

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
guess if you like and when I do is I go

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.189 
guess if you like and when I do is I go
to<00:05:15.210> file<00:05:15.449> browser<00:05:16.729> and<00:05:17.780> as<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:18.870> can<00:05:18.960> see<00:05:19.020> I've

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
to file browser and as you can see I've

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.800 
to file browser and as you can see I've
already<00:05:19.319> got<00:05:19.560> my<00:05:19.789> media<00:05:20.789> touch<00:05:21.030> studio<00:05:21.449> folder

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
already got my media touch studio folder

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.749 
already got my media touch studio folder
already<00:05:22.020> opened<00:05:22.729> just<00:05:23.729> go<00:05:24.000> down<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.180> 26<00:05:24.840> here

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
already opened just go down to 26 here

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:32.689 
already opened just go down to 26 here
and<00:05:26.759> let's<00:05:27.449> see<00:05:27.659> if<00:05:28.039> it<00:05:29.039> will<00:05:29.159> play<00:05:29.430> you<00:05:31.699> can

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
and let's see if it will play you can

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.490 
and let's see if it will play you can
see<00:05:32.849> you've<00:05:33.030> got<00:05:33.180> your<00:05:33.240> uh<00:05:33.479> vu<00:05:33.900> meter<00:05:34.169> right

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
see you've got your uh vu meter right

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.420 
see you've got your uh vu meter right
there<00:05:36.199> and<00:05:37.199> as<00:05:37.409> you<00:05:37.530> can<00:05:37.680> see<00:05:37.710> it<00:05:37.949> is<00:05:38.099> playing

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
there and as you can see it is playing

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.730 
there and as you can see it is playing
and<00:05:38.699> it<00:05:38.909> goes<00:05:39.060> for<00:05:39.330> green<00:05:39.569> yellow<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:40.020> red<00:05:40.050> and

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
and it goes for green yellow to red and

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.830 
and it goes for green yellow to red and
I<00:05:40.860> do<00:05:40.919> believe<00:05:41.370> that<00:05:41.669> this<00:05:41.789> application<00:05:42.449> has

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
I do believe that this application has

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.930 
I do believe that this application has
the<00:05:43.830> ability<00:05:44.340> to<00:05:45.020> play<00:05:46.020> in<00:05:46.199> mp3<00:05:46.729> while<00:05:47.729> you're

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
the ability to play in mp3 while you're

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.600 
the ability to play in mp3 while you're
recording<00:05:49.490> okay<00:05:50.490> let's<00:05:50.909> and<00:05:51.650> in<00:05:52.650> the<00:05:52.979> future<00:05:53.130> I

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
recording okay let's and in the future I

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.339 
recording okay let's and in the future I
believe<00:05:53.669> they're<00:05:54.270> going<00:05:54.419> to<00:05:54.479> put<00:05:54.840> an<00:05:54.930> overdub

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
believe they're going to put an overdub

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.570 
believe they're going to put an overdub
feature<00:05:55.650> in<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:55.919> which<00:05:56.009> I<00:05:56.130> think<00:05:56.340> would<00:05:56.400> be

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
feature in it which I think would be

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.800 
feature in it which I think would be
very<00:05:56.909> very<00:05:57.690> great<00:05:58.080> but<00:05:58.440> until<00:05:59.340> then<00:05:59.490> enjoy<00:06:00.449> the

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
very very great but until then enjoy the

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.800 
very very great but until then enjoy the
touch<00:06:00.990> studio<00:06:01.349> application<00:06:01.469> that<00:06:01.889> you<00:06:01.979> have

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
touch studio application that you have

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.990 
touch studio application that you have
it's<00:06:03.810> a<00:06:04.020> really<00:06:04.229> cool<00:06:04.500> application<00:06:05.190> see<00:06:05.880> if<00:06:05.940> I

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
it's a really cool application see if I

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.600 
it's a really cool application see if I
missed<00:06:06.029> anything<00:06:09.650> as<00:06:10.650> I<00:06:10.830> said<00:06:11.039> before<00:06:11.069> while

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
missed anything as I said before while

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.240 
missed anything as I said before while
you're<00:06:11.789> recording<00:06:12.380> you<00:06:13.380> can<00:06:13.590> sometimes

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
you're recording you can sometimes

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.149 
you're recording you can sometimes
change<00:06:14.520> it<00:06:14.699> to<00:06:14.759> scope<00:06:15.029> mode<00:06:15.500> there<00:06:16.500> you<00:06:16.680> go<00:06:16.860> it

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
change it to scope mode there you go it

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:23.469 
change it to scope mode there you go it
usually<00:06:17.370> works<00:06:19.520> switch<00:06:20.520> back<00:06:20.729> to<00:06:20.759> FFT<00:06:21.979> and

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
usually works switch back to FFT and

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.879 
usually works switch back to FFT and
then<00:06:24.479> you<00:06:24.539> also<00:06:24.690> get<00:06:24.960> your<00:06:25.409> options<00:06:25.710> back

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
then you also get your options back

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.200 
then you also get your options back
there<00:06:26.159> to<00:06:26.520> change<00:06:26.819> the<00:06:27.090> input<00:06:27.719> boost<00:06:29.090> when<00:06:30.090> you

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
there to change the input boost when you

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.700 
there to change the input boost when you
click<00:06:30.419> on<00:06:30.509> settings<00:06:30.990> during<00:06:31.229> a<00:06:31.440> recording

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
click on settings during a recording

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.600 
click on settings during a recording
same<00:06:32.099> thing<00:06:33.289> when<00:06:34.289> you<00:06:34.409> click<00:06:34.590> on<00:06:34.680> a<00:06:34.740> bow<00:06:35.009> same

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
same thing when you click on a bow same

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.610 
same thing when you click on a bow same
thing<00:06:36.289> and<00:06:37.819> you<00:06:38.819> click<00:06:39.029> on<00:06:39.120> record<00:06:39.569> you<00:06:40.469> can

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
thing and you click on record you can

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.180 
thing and you click on record you can
stop<00:06:40.919> it<00:06:41.159> and<00:06:45.319> as<00:06:46.319> I<00:06:46.440> said<00:06:46.500> before<00:06:46.650> it<00:06:46.949> takes<00:06:47.039> a

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
stop it and as I said before it takes a

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.279 
stop it and as I said before it takes a
second<00:06:48.199> time<00:06:49.199> counter<00:06:49.620> is<00:06:49.680> set<00:06:49.860> to<00:06:50.009> zero<00:06:51.289> let's

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
second time counter is set to zero let's

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:57.950 
second time counter is set to zero let's
see<00:06:54.199> when<00:06:55.199> I<00:06:55.229> start<00:06:55.529> recording<00:06:56.570> the<00:06:57.570> vu<00:06:57.930> meter

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
see when I start recording the vu meter

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.990 
see when I start recording the vu meter
changes<00:06:58.710> and<00:06:59.029> the<00:07:00.029> time<00:07:00.240> counter<00:07:00.630> started<00:07:02.000> so

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
changes and the time counter started so

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.430 
changes and the time counter started so
there<00:07:03.389> you<00:07:03.509> go<00:07:03.539> and<00:07:03.810> it<00:07:03.899> tells<00:07:04.169> you<00:07:04.320> the

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
there you go and it tells you the

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.079 
there you go and it tells you the
decibels<00:07:04.979> right<00:07:05.159> there<00:07:05.399> I<00:07:05.430> guess<00:07:05.729> that's<00:07:05.969> what

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.089 
decibels right there I guess that's what

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:08.779 
decibels right there I guess that's what
that<00:07:06.270> is<00:07:06.479> it's<00:07:07.469> 18<00:07:07.889> decibels<00:07:08.370> let's<00:07:08.550> go<00:07:08.669> ahead

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:08.789 
that is it's 18 decibels let's go ahead

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:14.930 
that is it's 18 decibels let's go ahead
and<00:07:08.909> boost<00:07:09.750> it<00:07:10.050> up<00:07:10.849> six<00:07:11.849> you<00:07:12.029> get<00:07:12.149> 24<00:07:13.669> first<00:07:14.669> it

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
and boost it up six you get 24 first it

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.550 
and boost it up six you get 24 first it
up<00:07:15.060> six<00:07:15.389> you<00:07:15.570> get<00:07:15.690> 30<00:07:17.659> see<00:07:18.659> how<00:07:18.990> far<00:07:19.259> you<00:07:19.440> can<00:07:19.560> go

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 
up six you get 30 see how far you can go

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:30.520 
up six you get 30 see how far you can go
and<00:07:22.560> went<00:07:22.830> down<00:07:25.490> run<00:07:26.490> up

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:30.530 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.850 

looks<00:07:31.530> like<00:07:31.680> 30<00:07:31.920> is<00:07:32.100> a<00:07:32.160> house<00:07:32.310> you<00:07:32.520> can<00:07:32.670> go
