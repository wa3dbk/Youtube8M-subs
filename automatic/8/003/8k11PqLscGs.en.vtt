the public space for football seems

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.499 
the public space for football seems
unlimited<00:05:27.470> I<00:05:28.190> remember<00:05:28.789> what<00:05:28.909> Dan<00:05:29.180> Burke

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
unlimited I remember what Dan Burke

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.950 
unlimited I remember what Dan Burke
wasn't<00:05:29.960> we<00:05:30.409> I<00:05:30.949> was<00:05:31.310> involved<00:05:31.580> with<00:05:31.729> ESPN<00:05:32.419> 25

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
wasn't we I was involved with ESPN 25

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.770 
wasn't we I was involved with ESPN 25
years<00:05:33.259> ago<00:05:33.469> or<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:33.830> we<00:05:34.520> made<00:05:34.729> a<00:05:34.759> bid<00:05:35.570> which

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
years ago or so and we made a bid which

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.260 
years ago or so and we made a bid which
seemed<00:05:36.080> outrageous<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.889> get<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.580> NFL<00:05:37.969> to<00:05:38.090> come

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
seemed outrageous to get the NFL to come

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.810 
seemed outrageous to get the NFL to come
over<00:05:38.419> and<00:05:38.630> play<00:05:38.840> some<00:05:39.050> games<00:05:39.259> on<00:05:39.500> ESPN<00:05:39.699> but<00:05:40.699> it

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
over and play some games on ESPN but it

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.580 
over and play some games on ESPN but it
was<00:05:40.969> the<00:05:41.090> best<00:05:41.270> move<00:05:41.449> that<00:05:41.509> ESPN<00:05:42.080> ever<00:05:42.320> made<00:05:42.560> I

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
was the best move that ESPN ever made I

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.740 
was the best move that ESPN ever made I
mean<00:05:42.830> if<00:05:43.009> people<00:05:43.250> just<00:05:43.940> plain<00:05:44.210> love<00:05:44.479> football

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
mean if people just plain love football

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.689 
mean if people just plain love football
but<00:05:45.500> that<00:05:45.650> was<00:05:45.800> back<00:05:45.979> when<00:05:46.219> I<00:05:46.250> think<00:05:46.490> you<00:05:46.580> only

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
but that was back when I think you only

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.730 
but that was back when I think you only
got<00:05:46.880> half<00:05:46.909> this<00:05:47.389> schedule<00:05:47.870> yeah<00:05:48.289> on<00:05:48.500> ESPN

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
got half this schedule yeah on ESPN

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.580 
got half this schedule yeah on ESPN
right<00:05:49.039> yeah<00:05:49.190> well<00:05:49.880> I<00:05:50.210> suppose<00:05:51.080> there's<00:05:51.380> things

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
right yeah well I suppose there's things

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.310 
right yeah well I suppose there's things
you<00:05:51.710> can<00:05:51.830> get<00:05:51.979> too<00:05:52.130> much<00:05:52.159> of<00:05:52.340> but<00:05:53.050> maybe<00:05:54.050> ice

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
you can get too much of but maybe ice

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.730 
you can get too much of but maybe ice
cream<00:05:54.680> but<00:05:54.889> like<00:05:55.580> but<00:05:56.259> women<00:05:57.259> and<00:05:57.380> football

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
cream but like but women and football

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:07.110 
cream but like but women and football
I'm<00:05:57.889> not<00:05:58.039> sure<00:05:58.219> about<00:06:00.669> what<00:06:01.669> comes<00:06:01.880> first

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.399 

paying<00:06:08.120> college<00:06:08.330> athletes<00:06:08.930> where<00:06:09.289> do<00:06:09.349> you

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409 
paying college athletes where do you

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.379 
paying college athletes where do you
stand<00:06:09.590> on<00:06:09.770> it<00:06:09.830> well<00:06:10.159> that's<00:06:10.849> you<00:06:11.090> know<00:06:11.240> that's

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
stand on it well that's you know that's

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.120 
stand on it well that's you know that's
really<00:06:11.750> a<00:06:11.780> tough<00:06:12.020> one<00:06:12.199> they<00:06:12.319> certainly<00:06:12.650> on<00:06:12.919> it

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
really a tough one they certainly on it

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.320 
really a tough one they certainly on it
seems<00:06:13.370> to<00:06:13.490> me<00:06:13.610> they<00:06:13.729> ought<00:06:13.849> to<00:06:13.880> do<00:06:14.090> something

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
seems to me they ought to do something

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.320 
seems to me they ought to do something
that<00:06:14.719> prevents<00:06:15.530> anybody<00:06:16.009> that<00:06:16.250> you<00:06:16.550> know<00:06:16.669> gets

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
that prevents anybody that you know gets

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.240 
that prevents anybody that you know gets
hurt<00:06:17.569> or<00:06:17.719> anything<00:06:17.900> like<00:06:18.110> that<00:06:18.139> or<00:06:18.740> you<00:06:19.130> know

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250

losing<00:06:20.240> their<00:06:20.360> scholarships<00:06:20.930> and<00:06:21.229> has<00:06:21.440> it

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
losing their scholarships and has it

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.120 
losing their scholarships and has it
it's<00:06:23.479> a<00:06:23.659> it's<00:06:24.080> a<00:06:24.289> very<00:06:24.319> tough<00:06:24.770> one<00:06:24.949> because

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
it's a it's a very tough one because

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.189 
it's a it's a very tough one because
they're<00:06:25.490> producing<00:06:25.940> a<00:06:26.060> lot<00:06:26.389> of<00:06:26.719> money<00:06:26.870> for<00:06:27.080> the

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
they're producing a lot of money for the

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.830 
they're producing a lot of money for the
schools<00:06:27.500> but<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:28.430> game<00:06:28.639> is<00:06:28.880> working<00:06:29.240> awfully

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
schools but the game is working awfully

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.270 
schools but the game is working awfully
well<00:06:29.990> the<00:06:30.169> way<00:06:30.319> it<00:06:30.440> is<00:06:30.560> it<00:06:30.740> seems<00:06:30.949> to<00:06:31.069> me<00:06:31.190> in

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
well the way it is it seems to me in

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.659 
well the way it is it seems to me in
college<00:06:31.610> football<00:06:31.789> so<00:06:32.270> I<00:06:33.219> probably<00:06:34.219> lean<00:06:34.460> not

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
college football so I probably lean not

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.149 
college football so I probably lean not
to<00:06:34.729> tinkering<00:06:35.389> well<00:06:36.110> maybe<00:06:36.289> tinkering<00:06:36.860> just<00:06:37.039> a

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:37.159 
to tinkering well maybe tinkering just a

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:40.270 
to tinkering well maybe tinkering just a
little<00:06:37.460> bit<00:06:37.639> at<00:06:38.240> the<00:06:38.449> edges<00:06:38.570> but<00:06:38.960> not<00:06:39.020> making<00:06:39.409> a

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
little bit at the edges but not making a

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.690 
little bit at the edges but not making a
sort<00:06:40.790> of<00:06:40.850> minor<00:06:41.720> league<00:06:41.960> for<00:06:42.230> the<00:06:42.260> for<00:06:43.190> the<00:06:43.340> NFL

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
sort of minor league for the for the NFL

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.750 
sort of minor league for the for the NFL
so<00:06:44.510> we're<00:06:44.660> gonna<00:06:44.750> do<00:06:44.930> this<00:06:45.080> next<00:06:45.350> year<00:06:45.730> well<00:06:46.730> I

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
so we're gonna do this next year well I

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.700 
so we're gonna do this next year well I
sure<00:06:47.330> hope<00:06:47.540> so<00:06:47.570> I<00:06:47.780> mean<00:06:48.080> that's<00:06:48.230> up<00:06:48.380> to<00:06:48.500> quicken

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
sure hope so I mean that's up to quicken

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.950 
sure hope so I mean that's up to quicken
but<00:06:49.010> but<00:06:49.550> I'm<00:06:49.910> ready<00:06:50.240> if<00:06:50.389> they<00:06:50.540> are<00:06:50.720> I'll<00:06:50.840> put

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.770 
but but I'm ready if they are I'll put
it<00:06:51.050> that<00:06:51.200> way<00:06:51.340> maybe<00:06:52.340> we<00:06:52.639> could<00:06:52.790> do<00:06:52.910> a<00:06:52.940> college

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
it that way maybe we could do a college

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.940 
it that way maybe we could do a college
football<00:06:53.930> final<00:06:54.530> for<00:06:54.740> bracket<00:06:55.250> well<00:06:55.730> if<00:06:56.630> you
