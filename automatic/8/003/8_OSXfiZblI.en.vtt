words in the field this this shaft did
not<00:03:58.060> grow<00:03:58.299> straight<00:03:58.720> like<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:58.959> okay<00:03:59.530> it<00:04:00.160> had

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
not grow straight like that okay it had

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.099 
not grow straight like that okay it had
to<00:04:00.459> be<00:04:00.489> straightened<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.299> was<00:04:01.480> crooked<00:04:01.720> it

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
to be straightened so it was crooked it
