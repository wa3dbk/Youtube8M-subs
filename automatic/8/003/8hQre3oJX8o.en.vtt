won't<00:00:24.000> want<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.359> I'm<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.779> open<00:00:24.900> 10

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
won't want to do I'm going to open 10

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.160 
won't want to do I'm going to open 10
straight<00:00:26.160> away<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.300> open<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.599> 10<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.080> you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
straight away so just open to 10 so you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.720 
straight away so just open to 10 so you
guys<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.590> what<00:00:29.189> happens<00:00:29.220> when<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> just

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
guys can see what happens when I just

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.359 
guys can see what happens when I just
open<00:00:29.970> 10<00:00:30.150> if<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.390> get<00:00:30.539> anything<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:32.189> then

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
open 10 if I get anything good and then

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.030 
open 10 if I get anything good and then
I'll<00:00:32.550> probably<00:00:32.730> spin<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> rest<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.590> then

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
I'll probably spin the rest and then

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
I'll probably spin the rest and then
we'll<00:00:35.160> go<00:00:35.309> from<00:00:35.340> there<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.300> we'll<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.630> what

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
we'll go from there and we'll see what

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.889 
we'll go from there and we'll see what
happens<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.670> like<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:39.180> always<00:00:39.329> say<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> don't

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
happens but like I always say I don't

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
happens but like I always say I don't
really<00:00:39.989> think<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.350> matters<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:41.040> open

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
really think it matters what you do open

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610 
really think it matters what you do open
them<00:00:41.879> spin<00:00:42.270> them<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.930> spin<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.350> because

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
them spin them at a spin them because

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.799 
them spin them at a spin them because

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
was actually probably worse or do we

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.730 
was actually probably worse or do we
