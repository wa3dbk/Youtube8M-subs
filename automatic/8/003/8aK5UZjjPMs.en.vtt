00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.070
 applying a liquid or cream blush 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.320
 before applying the potential that I 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.359
 I'm going to use today is a little note from bm f 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.310
 for the lips as well as for the cheeks 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.410
 to apply it I'm going to use it 55 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.779
 is a tiny fiber brush. 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.640
 sigma and I'll give a brushstroke of 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.430
 product on my cheek 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.719
 okay to see better and I'll spread it well 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.719
 quickly with the brush 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.000
 he left supernatural rosadinho 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.809

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.250
 there is a finish on the mac light color for 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.660
 seat and blush 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.049
 I'll get my brush a little bit 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.720
 of blush that f30 of sigma and I will apply 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.759
 on top of the blush 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.560
 now I'll apply the powder blush on 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.320
 on top of all that blush I'm going to wear 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.280
 It is one of my favorites that is the love of 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.770
 nars is a pink morning snack that stays 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.509
 Beautiful to my redhead, I'll get the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.090
 My brush will take away the excess because 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.100
 This blush is super pigmented and I go 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.289
 tapping my cheeks 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.240
 I always like to start applying 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.390
 This part said that when people 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.610
 smile up, look at this line of ours 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.560
 of the face here and I always like to pull 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.270
 This blue chip the ear because I think 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.800
 who swerves his face and gives a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.490
 very rich face 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.490
 so come on 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.610
 after applying the blush when you 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.290
 I thought the blush got very strong. 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.810
 you can use a teaching to take the 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.940
 always over with 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.800
 arriving and then settling him with 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.560
 A little bit better, I'm going to use my 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:22.340
 mineralize from the nec again on top of that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:25.010
 and there throughout the day as the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.230
 people leaving blue chips still it goes 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.610
 always revealing the bottom layer that is 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.530
 another blush 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.360
 so apply the blush at 8 o'clock 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.100
 and eight o'clock at night when I arrive 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.590
 At home I still have blush without 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.570
 need to apply is very magic 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.730

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.900

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.900
