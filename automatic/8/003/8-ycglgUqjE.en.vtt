00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.980
 today I will show you 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.960
 cleaning the cooling system 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:23.080
 here these engines in case my angel is 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.380
 apparently it looks like it's clean 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.539
 because it is according to the manual they ask 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.870
 for you to change do this cleaning to 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.989
 every 15,000 kilometers or five years 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.390
 Only I expected this to happen and this 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.790
 reservoir he got all uses 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.710
 all full of rust 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.390
 I had to change it that I worked 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 more able to see the level here 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.409
 fluid 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.900
 so after I did this test and did not 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:54.470
 now I go annually I will do this 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.960
 this cleaning for us to start then 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.510
 I'm going to have to connect this hose with 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.330
 this June connector for what I did 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.820
 I'll give you this hose, turn it on here. 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.490
 let this water flowing here in the bucket 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.890
 with the father sheltered and putting water 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.890
 quinan and putting even gradually 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.150
 knowing the time 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.240
 since it has put a 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.480
 did not happen 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.350
 now there is all the dirty water that 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.799
 that system has returned to Mangueirinha 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.799
 I 'm never going to look here 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.330
 in it just do not do that right 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.330
 I'll put 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:31.440
 cover and let him leave the car 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:38.180
 connected until adventure is connected to those 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:41.430
 15 minutes after the start-up 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.500
 the fan has to turn on another try 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.690
 have to change the position inside the air 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.069
 Hot can not forget this I go 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.069
 turning on the car will take 15 minutes 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.800
 a product was saved football 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.630
 good, come back now I put that 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.510
 push radiator 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:21.340
 I waited for the adventurer to start the guard. 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.500
 15 minutes as it was after 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.950
 God, I called the car for a minute. 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.459
 Time it's cool a little and now 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.239
 I'll talk, I'll exhaust the system again. 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.940
 make a rinse to remove this 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.269
 liquid there and then complete with the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.269
 additive 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.750
 the business 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.750
 the system 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.870
 make it happen 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.180
 here the system only with water now I go 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.269
 start putting on the fluid and look 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.370
 As he already wants to be mass cross 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:26.210
 has low dirt this reservoir is 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.210
 brand new to show inside 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.960
 Look inside, there's water forming this. 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.300
 dirt 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.970
 So do not wait too long to do this. 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:45.060
 cleaning is and do not know if the manual he speaks 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:49.590
 something there the practice of another 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.810
 so let's continue cleaning the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.830
 system already done here is with water 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.970
 clean and now I'm going to start putting a 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.330
 additive 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.370
 the tac additive there are several types of 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.170
 market additive and if I bought a 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.410
 additive concentrate then it asks 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.410
 resignation 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.189
 I have already made the dilution in proportion 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.989
 certain 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:16.289
 Now we're going to start putting in the 

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:19.319
 the hose system is still 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.669
 filling until fluid begins to flow 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:25.319
 here the way again after 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:34.649
 I started to go out and close and just 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:39.349
 complete and ready to go out 

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:39.349
 there, that little flag will start coming out 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.079
 I hope to leave 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.470
 I just got out of here 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.720
 tron it 's just that 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.480
 I'm going back now that it's filled up 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.110
 system completed we return mourinho 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.110
 of the official machine 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.290
 In the purse 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:20.790
 complete hero that even unites in a 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:25.460
 maximum level and minimum book complete 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:29.400
 just a little bit close is ready 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.530
 and attached mango tree 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.740
 already completed the level will we close 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.740
 on here 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:44.610
 the system and that's it there clean system 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.350
 the new fluid running another year 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.170
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:54.200
