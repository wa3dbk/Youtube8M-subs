 Translator: Mahmoud Naser Checker: Anwar Dafa-Alla 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
 I would like to ask you 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.260
 What is the common factor between these three people? 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
 You may know the first person 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
 . I am sure you are all good followers of the American Idol program, 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
 You can not recognize Aida Jahni 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
 She is a finalist 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 In the poet of the million contest 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
 Which broadcasts from Abu Dhabi, 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
 And continues throughout the Arab world 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
 In this competition 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 People must compose and cast 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 An original poetry, in the form of Nabataean poetry 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 An original poetry, in the form of Nabataean poetry 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
 And Lima Sohar were competing in the finals 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 In the Afghan Star of Music competition 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
 Now, before I go any further, 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.260
 Yes, I know everything started with "Britain has talent". 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 But my point in discussing this is 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 It is to show you - I hope to be able to show you 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.260
 That these competitions are based on merit 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
 With equal access to all, 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
 With the winner selected by voting via SMS, 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.260
 Changing tribal societies. 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.260
 I will focus on Afghanistan 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
 And the Arab world in the UAE 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260
 How it changed tribal societies, 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
 Not by introducing Western ideas, 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.260
 But by merging with the language in those places 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
 All this starts with pleasure 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 (Video): We're late to watch the Afghan star 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260
 We will go to watch the Afghan star. we're late. 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
 We are late. 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
 We have to go see the Afghan star 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.260
 These programs have stretched incredibly deep into society 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
 Afghanistan People make extraordinary efforts 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
 To be able to watch this program 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
 You do not have to have your own TV 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
 Where people are watching it all over the country 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
 And in public places as well 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
 But it goes beyond follow-up 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
 , Because there is also a part 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.260
 Campaign 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260
 Where people become related 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.260
 So much so that they have volunteers, just like volunteers in politics 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
 Who are distributed in the countryside, 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
 In support of their candidates 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
 The contestants also nominate themselves 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.260
 Now, of course, there is a certain degree of ethnic loyalty, but not quite. 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.260
 Because every year he was the winner of a different tribal group 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
 This may open the domain, 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
 Especially women, 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
 Last season there were two women in the final. 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
 One of them, Lima Charm, a Pashtun from Kandahar, 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
 A very conservative region of the country 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.260
 . Here, she tells the Afghani star in the documentary 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 How her friends insisted on not doing so 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
 And told her how she left them for democracy 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
 . But they also reveal it 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
 Aware that members of the Taliban 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.260
 They were sending SMS messages to vote for her 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
 Aida al-Juhani also risked 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
 And made an effort to compete 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
 In the poet of the million contest 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.260
 It should be mentioned that her husband was supportive of her from the beginning 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
 But her tribe and her family urged her not to participate 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260
 They were strongly opposed 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
 . But what I started to win 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
 So they came back to support it 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.260
 Competition and victory have proved to be a universal human value 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
 And it's there 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.260
 Her hair revolves around the woman 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
 And women's lives in society. 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
 It just made itself 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
 And her presence in a competition with men 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
 This indicates a vote on the program 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
 Hits a very important example for young women - 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
 These young women in the audience of the program - 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.260
 In Abu Dhabi, but also people in attracting audience audiences. 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
 Now you think that "American Idol" 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
 Would offer a measure of America 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
 But in fact, the exact opposite happens. 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
 Using this format for popular participation 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.260
 For traditionalism, local culture, 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
 In fact, in the Gulf, is accelerating recovery 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
 Of interest in Nabataean poetry, 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.260
 Also in traditional dress, dance and music. 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
 And for Afghanistan 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.260
 Where the Taliban banned music for many years, 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260
 Is to re-present their melodies and traditional music. 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.260
 They do not sing pop songs, 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.260
 They sing Afghan music. 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
 They learned how to lose respectfully, 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.260
 Without the revenge of the winner. 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260
 (Laughter) 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.260
 This is not a little thing. 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.260
 The final is a body of formulation 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
 The American Idol Program 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.260
 Which has just emerged in Afghanistan, 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
 Is a new program called "Candidate". 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
 And in this program offers people 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.260
 Policy approaches that are then voted on. 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260
 Many of them are too young to run in a presidential election. 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.260
 But by presenting the issues there, 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
 They influence the presidential race. 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.260
 For me, the essence of things is invisible, 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.260
 Be how reality TV really leads. 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
 thank you. 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.260
 (clap)
