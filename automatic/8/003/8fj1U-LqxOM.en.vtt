eight hours if you take your time which
that's<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> very<00:01:14.850> true<00:01:15.119> thing<00:01:15.510> you<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.810> I'm

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that's a very true thing you know I'm

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
that's a very true thing you know I'm
saying<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.950> false<00:01:17.280> by<00:01:17.520> any

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
saying like that's not like false by any

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.340 
saying like that's not like false by any
means<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.090> mean<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> relatively<00:01:19.200> short

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
means I mean it is a relatively short

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.590 
means I mean it is a relatively short
game<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.280> course<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.970> getting<00:01:21.240> slammed

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
game but of course it's getting slammed

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.060 
game but of course it's getting slammed
for<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> don't<00:01:22.530> feel<00:01:22.770> that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
for that and I don't feel that's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.609

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the reason that it is getting slammed

perception of it people can't make that

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.060 
perception of it people can't make that

distinction a lot of people don't seem

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.039 
distinction a lot of people don't seem

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
to make that distinction I can clearly

a<00:04:29.340> short<00:04:30.240> game<00:04:30.420> isn't<00:04:30.780> necessarily<00:04:31.230> a<00:04:31.380> bad

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
a short game isn't necessarily a bad

a short game isn't necessarily a bad
game<00:04:31.889> especially<00:04:32.190> when<00:04:32.670> it<00:04:32.790> comes<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.030> its

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
one person asked me in the in my review

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.490 
one person asked me in the in my review
for<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.600> order<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.020> know<00:04:40.110> how<00:04:40.260> come<00:04:40.440> you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
for the order you know how come you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.350 
for the order you know how come you
didn't<00:04:40.680> touch<00:04:40.800> too<00:04:41.070> much<00:04:41.250> on<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:42.030> length<00:04:42.150> of

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
didn't touch too much on the length of

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.640 
didn't touch too much on the length of
the<00:04:42.450> game<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:42.810> what<00:04:42.930> not<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.260> found<00:04:43.470> that

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
the game and what not and I found that

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.220 
the game and what not and I found that
the<00:04:43.770> length<00:04:43.889> of<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.130> game<00:04:44.280> wasn't<00:04:44.550> an<00:04:44.700> issue

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
the length of the game wasn't an issue

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.200 
the length of the game wasn't an issue
when<00:04:46.230> it<00:04:46.260> comes<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.919> how<00:04:47.430> well<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.820> game<00:04:48.030> is

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
when it comes to how well the game is

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.260 
when it comes to how well the game is
doing<00:04:48.750> what<00:04:49.139> it's<00:04:49.260> trying<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.680> do<00:04:49.860> for<00:04:50.270> example

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
doing what it's trying to do for example

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.790 
doing what it's trying to do for example
with<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.450> order<00:04:51.720> it<00:04:51.900> was<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.110> very<00:04:52.440> story

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
with the order it was a very story

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.170 
with the order it was a very story
driven<00:04:53.010> game<00:04:53.160> ready<00:04:53.520> at<00:04:53.639> dawn<00:04:53.790> was<00:04:54.000> very

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
driven game ready at dawn was very

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.270 
driven game ready at dawn was very
forward<00:04:54.570> forward<00:04:55.020> about<00:04:55.290> that<00:04:55.530> they<00:04:55.950> want<00:04:56.190> to

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
forward forward about that they want to

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.879 
forward forward about that they want to
make<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.400> story-driven<00:04:56.760> video<00:04:57.210> game<00:04:57.450> I<00:04:57.889> felt

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
make a story-driven video game I felt

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.770 
make a story-driven video game I felt
even<00:04:59.520> though<00:04:59.639> it<00:04:59.730> was<00:04:59.910> like<00:05:00.060> six<00:05:00.360> eight<00:05:00.480> hours

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
even though it was like six eight hours

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.200 
even though it was like six eight hours
long<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.320> told<00:05:01.740> story<00:05:02.100> pretty<00:05:02.370> well<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:03.000> had

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
long it told story pretty well it had

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.620 
long it told story pretty well it had
decent<00:05:03.780> character<00:05:04.110> development<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:05.460> was<00:05:05.910> very

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
decent character development I was very

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.530 
decent character development I was very
much<00:05:06.870> so<00:05:07.370> engulfed<00:05:08.370> in<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:09.150> kind<00:05:09.419> of<00:05:09.480> the

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
much so engulfed in the the kind of the

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.880 
much so engulfed in the the kind of the
world<00:05:09.750> they<00:05:09.930> were<00:05:10.050> creating<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.560> everything

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
world they were creating and everything

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.250 
world they were creating and everything
I<00:05:11.100> felt<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.580> was<00:05:11.790> good<00:05:12.480> even<00:05:12.870> though<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.080> was<00:05:13.230> a

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
I felt it was good even though it was a

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.170 
I felt it was good even though it was a
short<00:05:13.560> game<00:05:13.890> so<00:05:14.160> therefore<00:05:14.520> length<00:05:14.850> didn't

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
short game so therefore length didn't

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.080 
short game so therefore length didn't
feel<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.540> be<00:05:15.660> much<00:05:15.780> of<00:05:15.810> an<00:05:15.990> issue<00:05:16.080> for<00:05:16.260> me

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
feel to be much of an issue for me

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.790 
feel to be much of an issue for me
whereas<00:05:18.090> say<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.390> game<00:05:18.750> like<00:05:18.930> infamous<00:05:19.470> second

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
whereas say a game like infamous second

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.440 
whereas say a game like infamous second
son<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.160> from<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.370> second<00:05:20.700> son<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.330> can

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
son and from the second son you can

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.969 
son and from the second son you can
finish<00:05:21.630> that<00:05:21.720> game<00:05:21.960> at<00:05:22.110> about<00:05:22.260> five<00:05:22.440> six<00:05:22.620> hours

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
finish that game at about five six hours

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.070 
finish that game at about five six hours
and<00:05:23.160> that's<00:05:24.150> where<00:05:24.390> the<00:05:24.540> length<00:05:24.720> of<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:24.930> game

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
and that's where the length of the game

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.540 
and that's where the length of the game
is<00:05:25.229> a<00:05:25.260> problem<00:05:25.740> not<00:05:25.860> because<00:05:26.100> of<00:05:26.130> its<00:05:26.310> price

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
is a problem not because of its price

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.430 
is a problem not because of its price
but<00:05:26.790> rather<00:05:26.970> because<00:05:27.270> there's<00:05:27.930> like<00:05:28.169> no

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
but rather because there's like no

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.690 
but rather because there's like no
character<00:05:28.860> development<00:05:28.889> at<00:05:29.280> all<00:05:29.400> in<00:05:29.610> that

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
character development at all in that

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.400 
character development at all in that
game<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.210> feels<00:05:30.630> like<00:05:30.750> it's<00:05:30.960> moving<00:05:31.139> way<00:05:31.380> too

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
game it feels like it's moving way too

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.110 
game it feels like it's moving way too
quickly<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:32.190> have<00:05:32.430> no<00:05:32.669> time<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:32.940> get

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
quickly you have no time to get

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.250 
quickly you have no time to get
comfortable<00:05:33.240> with<00:05:33.570> the<00:05:33.720> powers<00:05:34.080> you're

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
comfortable with the powers you're

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.710 
comfortable with the powers you're
introduced<00:05:34.680> to<00:05:34.760> it<00:05:35.760> seems<00:05:36.000> like<00:05:36.150> every<00:05:36.510> like

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720

development character development you
know<00:06:18.390> this<00:06:18.570> games<00:06:18.840> can<00:06:19.020> totally<00:06:19.350> go<00:06:19.470> wrong<00:06:19.680> in

know this games can totally go wrong in

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.120 
know this games can totally go wrong in
that<00:06:19.950> way<00:06:20.100> too<00:06:20.160> so<00:06:21.150> length<00:06:21.690> is<00:06:21.900> a<00:06:22.130> non-issue

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
that way too so length is a non-issue

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.300 
that way too so length is a non-issue
when<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.700> game<00:06:23.910> is<00:06:24.530> correctly<00:06:25.530> handling<00:06:26.130> the

when the game is correctly handling the

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.270 
when the game is correctly handling the
amount<00:06:26.550> of<00:06:26.610> length<00:06:26.850> that<00:06:27.030> it<00:06:27.180> is<00:06:27.800> so<00:06:28.800> a<00:06:28.830> game

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
amount of length that it is so a game

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.159 
amount of length that it is so a game
can<00:06:29.460> be<00:06:29.490> short<00:06:29.850> a<00:06:30.030> game<00:06:30.210> can<00:06:30.419> be<00:06:30.450> long<00:06:30.720> a<00:06:30.750> game

can be short a game can be long a game

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.409 
can be short a game can be long a game
can<00:06:31.380> be<00:06:31.410> you<00:06:32.010> know<00:06:32.039> right<00:06:32.550> in<00:06:32.669> between<00:06:32.820> like<00:06:33.390> a
