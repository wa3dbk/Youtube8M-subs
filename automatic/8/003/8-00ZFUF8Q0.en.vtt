body balm not hundreds a lot and so I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.390 
body balm not hundreds a lot and so I
can't<00:01:27.840> none<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.710> under<00:01:29.070> said<00:01:29.250> I'm

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.730 
can't none of this is under said I'm
pretty<00:01:29.790> sure<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> zombie<00:01:30.509> Paris<00:01:31.259> thing<00:01:31.500> is

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
pretty sure the zombie Paris thing is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
pretty sure the zombie Paris thing is
one<00:01:31.979> hundred<00:01:32.040> percent<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.670> France<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
one hundred percent and the France it

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.590 
one hundred percent and the France it
was<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> French<00:01:34.710> catacombs<00:01:35.600> but

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.260 
was going to be the French catacombs but
another<00:01:37.409> proof<00:01:37.740> another<00:01:38.189> thing<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.939> back<00:01:39.090> up

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
another proof another thing to back up

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.539 
another proof another thing to back up
back<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:41.030> kino<00:01:42.030> der<00:01:42.060> toten<00:01:43.070> do<00:01:44.070> was

back it up is kino der toten do was

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.319 
back it up is kino der toten do was
going<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:46.049> was<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:47.070> on

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
going to be I think was going to be on

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.420 
going to be I think was going to be on
world<00:01:48.329> at<00:01:48.540> war<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:49.619> gonna<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> fifth

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
world at war it was gonna be the fifth

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.060 
world at war it was gonna be the fifth
map<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.420> after<00:01:51.869> darice<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:52.979> they

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
map like after darice but then they

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.580 
map like after darice but then they
thought<00:01:53.250> no<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.820> put<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.509> black<00:01:54.750> ops<00:01:54.930> black

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
thought no I put it on black ops black

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.020 
thought no I put it on black ops black
ops<00:01:55.770> yeah<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.310> was<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.579> that's<00:01:56.729> why<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> was

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
ops yeah that was that that's why I was

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.160 
ops yeah that was that that's why I was
the<00:01:57.119> first<00:01:57.299> map<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.659> maybe<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:57.990> gonna

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the first map so that maybe that's gonna

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.020 
the first map so that maybe that's gonna
happen<00:01:58.350> again<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:59.640> well<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:00.990> with<00:02:01.439> a

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
happen again with well you know with a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.429 
happen again with well you know with a
black<00:02:03.030> ops<00:02:03.210> 2<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:04.170> would<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.409> think

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
black ops 2 so what would you think

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.130 
black ops 2 so what would you think
about<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.040> map<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.960> think<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.020> would<00:02:07.110> be

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
about that map like I think it would be

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.710 
about that map like I think it would be
a<00:02:07.229> come<00:02:07.469> up<00:02:07.649> I'll<00:02:08.220> good<00:02:08.789> definitely<00:02:09.450> check<00:02:09.629> out

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
a come up I'll good definitely check out

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 
a come up I'll good definitely check out
the<00:02:09.780> pictures<00:02:10.080> where<00:02:10.229> he<00:02:10.319> looks<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:11.550> having

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the pictures where he looks you having

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
her a bit she disappears comes back

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.110 
her a bit she disappears comes back
disappears<00:04:18.810> come<00:04:18.989> back<00:04:19.169> in<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:20.130> maybe<00:04:20.430> like

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
disappears come back in a maybe like

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.330 
disappears come back in a maybe like
I've<00:04:21.479> also<00:04:22.109> thought<00:04:22.259> this<00:04:22.590> because<00:04:22.830> on<00:04:22.949> custom

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
I've also thought this because on custom

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.250 
I've also thought this because on custom
maps<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.940> can

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
maps you can

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.530 
maps you can
sometimes<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.950> game<00:04:25.100> maybe<00:04:25.450> what<00:04:26.450> I'm

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
sometimes in the game maybe what I'm

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.720 
sometimes in the game maybe what I'm
like<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.780> don't<00:04:26.900> around<00:04:27.350> 50<00:04:27.920> you<00:04:28.130> can<00:04:28.310> kill<00:04:28.580> it

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
like I don't around 50 you can kill it

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.430 
like I don't around 50 you can kill it
and<00:04:28.820> that's<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.240> that's<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.990> end<00:04:30.260> of<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.410> game

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
and that's it that's the end of the game

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.710 
and that's it that's the end of the game
obviously<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:31.070> can<00:04:31.220> just<00:04:31.400> maybe<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.210> certain

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
obviously you can just maybe a certain

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.260 
obviously you can just maybe a certain
way<00:04:32.930> i'm<00:04:33.470> not<00:04:33.950> sure<00:04:34.220> but<00:04:34.520> that<00:04:35.090> would<00:04:35.180> be

way i'm not sure but that would be

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.210

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
video in the whole point of the video

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.820 
video in the whole point of the video
was<00:04:47.420> about<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.870> French<00:04:48.080> catacombs<00:04:48.560> but

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
was about the French catacombs but

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.950 
was about the French catacombs but
honestly<00:04:49.700> its<00:04:49.940> lead<00:04:50.210> not<00:04:50.390> to<00:04:50.450> that<00:04:50.720> as<00:04:50.930> well

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
honestly its lead not to that as well

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.590 
honestly its lead not to that as well
and<00:04:51.290> its<00:04:51.410> leading<00:04:51.650> past<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.280> so<00:04:53.270> I'm<00:04:53.420> pretty

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
and its leading past that so I'm pretty

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.980 
and its leading past that so I'm pretty
I<00:04:53.750> think<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:54.580> Paris<00:04:55.580> catacombs<00:04:56.030> would<00:04:56.630> be

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
I think the Paris catacombs would be

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.380 
I think the Paris catacombs would be
extremely<00:04:57.560> calm<00:04:57.950> up<00:04:58.100> prob<00:04:58.850> about<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.120> mid<00:04:59.270> I

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
extremely calm up prob about the mid I

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.860 
extremely calm up prob about the mid I
did<00:04:59.540> enjoy<00:04:59.900> me<00:05:00.140> but<00:05:00.440> I<00:05:01.300> think<00:05:02.300> they<00:05:02.600> could<00:05:02.750> go

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
did enjoy me but I think they could go

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.230

on much from pressure at will it made

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.130 
on much from pressure at will it made
the<00:05:57.440> storyline<00:05:57.950> interesting<00:05:59.140> really

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140

this I think they pretty much proved
that<00:07:10.319> and<00:07:10.590> then<00:07:10.710> I<00:07:10.800> hind<00:07:11.039> anything<00:07:11.690> so<00:07:12.710> you

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
that and then I hind anything so you

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.209 
that and then I hind anything so you
know<00:07:13.879> watch<00:07:14.879> out<00:07:15.120> for<00:07:15.150> that<00:07:15.560> I'm<00:07:16.560> not<00:07:17.069> gonna

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:17.219 
know watch out for that I'm not gonna

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:18.529 
know watch out for that I'm not gonna
say<00:07:17.430> there's<00:07:17.610> a<00:07:17.699> zombie<00:07:17.819> killin<00:07:18.180> all<00:07:18.330> this
