00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.780 
of the Nexus 5 and the fixon 4.4.3 only
made<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.309> worse

made it worse

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.609 
made it worse
even<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.509> 5.0<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.800> problem<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.490> still<00:00:17.760> present

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619
