00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 sun vecio cordiani today we will talk about brush 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.919
 then the use of brushes is not just music already s 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.830
 though a 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.860
 hey widely used in general acoustic cystitis music 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.640
 also in kpop music 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.810
 today I wanted to make some feet feel like music for a while 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.030
 however the pop-rock music brush obviously strips the wand many 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.210
 times it makes the 100% stick 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.150
 it is very important to learn how to create a double level of sound and have a 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.280
 bomb is here 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.840
 that is with which pokeball return shot 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.180
 video and 4 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.089
 marco la bacchetta here is that today I will show the study of the accent with the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.080
 belly 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.490
 a personality used by the wrist 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.640
 ok the first few times my teacher explained it to me 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.230
 sign this way 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.250
 mprime fool the sweeps 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.130
 large room of notaries perhaps 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.060
 then such 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 a little more closed 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 bang 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.550
 to derive 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.170
 but to get this 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.230
 blow 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.840
 made precisely with the belly 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 that controls me the rollers harmonics 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.050
 the same thing but I will have to 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.050
 with the left hand 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.420
 one time 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.280
 that the body 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.380
 Maximilla 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.380
 this type of movement 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.879
 going to do the rose garden adhesive exercises of the just replatz 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.189
 wait bed bed bed read bed 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.799
 peaches extractions extractions 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:23.659
 accepting 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.089
 i blow with the right hand 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:28.439
 tan tan tan 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.439
 zan zan 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.609
 and then I tried craig leskovac rome class 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.940
 head to head left to right text 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.940
 etc 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.279
 and then as at 2 flowers 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.459
 once mastered this type of accent 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.919
 obviously of studies 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.919
 they can be various but I wanted to use them 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.929
 ok in a context of accompanying fox 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.229
 in the event that the brush deva a. replace the wand I will have to web the 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.849
 type herbal tea 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.049
 the harmonic control to simulate 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.049
 like in the morning 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.679
 a few years ago a mac 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:12.039
 one of the last teachers pointed out to me that 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:15.639
 the study of brushes must begin with the typical sounds of brushes 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:20.349
 I felt that among these teachings 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.960
 1 louis with joining disks between 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.870
 what I knew how to do 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.150
 and the study of the brushes to start was his own 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
 to know how to wear this kind of sound 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.150
 rooms this type of control 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.150
 belgodere replace 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.050
 primarily 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.540
