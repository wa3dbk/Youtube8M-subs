00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.990 

I<00:00:02.679> believe<00:00:03.679> that<00:00:03.860> the<00:00:04.069> quality<00:00:04.220> of<00:00:04.610> any<00:00:04.759> dish

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
I believe that the quality of any dish

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.519 
I believe that the quality of any dish
really<00:00:05.270> depends<00:00:05.750> on<00:00:05.839> the<00:00:05.960> quality<00:00:06.109> of<00:00:06.410> the

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
really depends on the quality of the

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.999 
really depends on the quality of the
ingredients<00:00:07.450> the<00:00:08.450> flour<00:00:08.570> that<00:00:08.809> we<00:00:08.869> use<00:00:09.169> comes

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:10.009 
ingredients the flour that we use comes

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.829 
ingredients the flour that we use comes
from<00:00:10.129> responsibly<00:00:10.789> grown<00:00:11.030> Australian<00:00:11.629> wheat

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:11.839 
from responsibly grown Australian wheat

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.539 
from responsibly grown Australian wheat
so<00:00:12.139> I<00:00:12.169> think<00:00:12.409> that<00:00:12.530> really<00:00:12.739> gives<00:00:12.980> us<00:00:13.159> the<00:00:13.369> best

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
so I think that really gives us the best

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.999 
so I think that really gives us the best
possible<00:00:14.059> products<00:00:17.410> I've<00:00:18.410> been<00:00:18.619> running<00:00:18.890> the

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
possible products I've been running the

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.679 
possible products I've been running the
farm<00:00:19.250> for<00:00:19.400> thirty<00:00:19.669> years<00:00:20.000> but<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:20.359> family

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
farm for thirty years but the family

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.439 
farm for thirty years but the family
history<00:00:20.960> goes<00:00:21.169> back<00:00:21.439> a<00:00:21.470> lot<00:00:21.710> longer<00:00:21.859> than<00:00:22.070> that

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
history goes back a lot longer than that

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.359 
history goes back a lot longer than that
my<00:00:23.449> father-in-law<00:00:24.099> originally<00:00:25.099> owned<00:00:25.249> this

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
my father-in-law originally owned this

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.009 
my father-in-law originally owned this
farm<00:00:25.699> and<00:00:25.970> he<00:00:26.029> had<00:00:26.150> it<00:00:26.269> with<00:00:26.359> his<00:00:26.509> father<00:00:26.749> and

they've had it for 90 years we've been

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.060 
they've had it for 90 years we've been

last few generations and the wheat was

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.330 
last few generations and the wheat was
good<00:00:33.440> then<00:00:33.620> and<00:00:33.649> it's<00:00:34.219> still<00:00:34.489> good<00:00:34.699> now<00:00:36.340> the

we use no pesticides and we minimize our
fertilizer<00:01:15.110> use<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.010> that's<00:01:16.460> great<00:01:16.790> because

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
fertilizer use and that's great because

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.820 
fertilizer use and that's great because
everyone<00:01:17.540> should<00:01:17.570> be<00:01:17.930> responsible<00:01:18.320> for<00:01:18.590> what

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
everyone should be responsible for what

everyone should be responsible for what
they're<00:01:18.980> doing<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.530> in<00:01:21.530> Australia<00:01:22.040> we<00:01:22.220> grow

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
they're doing and in Australia we grow

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.400 
they're doing and in Australia we grow
the<00:01:22.610> best<00:01:22.790> wheat<00:01:23.120> and<00:01:23.390> that's<00:01:23.600> why<00:01:23.780> we<00:01:24.080> end<00:01:24.230> up

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
the best wheat and that's why we end up

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.280 
the best wheat and that's why we end up
with<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.770> best<00:01:24.950> product<00:01:25.990> I've<00:01:26.990> been<00:01:27.170> eating
