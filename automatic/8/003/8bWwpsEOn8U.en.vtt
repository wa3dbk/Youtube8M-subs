bankrupt well I think I'll get the wheel
-<00:02:11.940> yeah<00:02:12.239> that's<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.630> good<00:02:12.780> idea

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
- yeah that's a good idea

not<00:02:14.190> enough<00:02:14.579> of<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:14.880> wheel<00:02:15.150> seconds<00:02:15.660> to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
not enough of this wheel seconds to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.870 
not enough of this wheel seconds to
solve<00:02:16.049> it<00:02:16.290> every<00:02:16.890> consonant<00:02:17.310> will<00:02:17.579> be<00:02:17.700> worth
