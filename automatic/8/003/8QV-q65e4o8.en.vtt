00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 co2 taele it ends with 60 points of 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.849
 penalty to obstacles seven minutes 22 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.599
 for having completed his career this 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:18.300
 which involves 29 June 2 penalty points 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:23.789
 of time a grade of 13 and 2013 and a half 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.039
 the 629 ladies gentlemen will take the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.980
 departure 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.990
 so here is the 629 that we will follow with 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.700
 a lot of interest because his tubes 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.180
 if we have the pleasure of seeing 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.399
 on this track the male grid is anglo 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.840
 Arabic crossing its contours with wood 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.420
 margot who is the father holsteiner and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.230
 the bright mother is in glory from 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.629
 of the Anglo-Arab facts patrick 6 kgs 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.329
 so is the breeder the sarl the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.879
 carli stables complete bunting is 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.850
 so owner thomas carli the double 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.800
 6 and 7 year old world champion are 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.300
 lion-d'angers thus riding the game 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.460
 on this horse that is simply 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.229
 championship leader from 6 years 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.810
 currently he is in the lead 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.380
 epsilon so he's in the lead because 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.100
 well his career and this championship 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.640
 started with 40 63 during the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.549
 dressage 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 a point for the model so starts with 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.909
 41 63 and a stallion besides upsilon 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.220
 which was approved in both tubes 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.470
 book is that of the French saddle or 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.150
 the Arabic Anglo was quite simply 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.810
 best of his generation 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.549
 no, so it's 4 and 5 years 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.009
 today has three outputs either 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.500
 1000 15 euros gain is therefore in the lead 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.500
 of the championship with 41 63 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.870
 this is the passage of the pilot's ford with 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.690
 thomas karl and perfect reception of 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:06.860
 this one ali continues we will enjoy 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:09.830
 precisely the arrival of 628 anderson of 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.840
 tile nhn with captain 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.100
 messy djokovic and applause 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.440
 that's what you do ladies 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:24.170
 gentlemen so greet the arrival of the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:27.670
 628 bravo guillaume 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.670
 so we have to 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.720
 and in the series it's not nice of 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.300
 swing his buddies so we have is 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.470
 well currently the champion or in all 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.110
 cases the one who is in the process of 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.090
 achieve a good performance 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.190
 and I confess me to communicate to you the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.390
 chronometer of stanislas of zuchowicz 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.700
 so is innocent of the nozzle nhn 6,23 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.770
 to complete his journey six minutes 23 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.770
 6 time penalty points 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.540
 epsilon so goes to the obstacle 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.640
 of the rural family house to two 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.670
 fund bei perfectly negotiated this 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.130
 business does not soften an over on his 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.710
 quite the contrary 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.620
 so the 630 now comes from 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.710
 to take off we are in the company of 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.530
 trio of the gelding hauling bay French saddle 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.540
 because due to age we are the father hills 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.520
 of hauling the sea by pair 102 sel 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.760
 french all three the rl yar adua age 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.420
 so the sisters in mayenne jean lou 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.200
 bigot the rider so utrillo of the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.270
 towpath 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.220
 so we're waiting for the release 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.220
 imminent leader of this championship 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:09.070
 utrillo hauling who is happy 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:12.220
 825 euros of earnings were also elite at 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.370
 last year and trio of hauling 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.070
 with this championship 46 88 after the 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.110
 dressage of 25 for the model we 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:25.240
 we are 49.13 in the championship 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:29.560
 crossing the ford donk dupe if the 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.960
 current leader with thomas carali us 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.960
 so you follow the entrance to the ford 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.290
 the central element the hockey concrete and the 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.970
 exit point that does not break posed 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:45.700
 no problem for the pylon that is 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.910
 well continues investigated so his course 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.290
 all this on a tempo that I should not 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.370
 not even know in any case seems to be 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:57.210
 which one therefore discount to finish at 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.820
 the hour a party to know six minutes 8 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.100
 have just seen the crossing of the 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:09.610
 17th funeral home of the winds fautras 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:12.310
 before we go on the 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.860
 perfect combination that is well crossed 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.960
 in the flat a small slip 1 you have 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.460
 may not have had the leisure to see him 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.890
 on the other hand, we can see it very clearly 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.530
 the posterior screen a little tale 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.750
 fled on this turn but my a priori 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.450
 so no problem in all 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.390
 case no incidence for proof if lon 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.430
 with the sheepfold which is well crossed 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.979
 with regard to the 629 we will stay 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.870
 without any favoritism in our in our 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.220
 about but with the leader to follow 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.960
 from end to end so almost his 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.160
 course we still have two obstacles to 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.300
 cross the east so d pad and maybe 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.010
 even your applause for the 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.440
 course he's doing 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.500
 because actually acr a very very 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.240
 nice performance of the one who is for 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.850
 the instant pole position look 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.710
 look at the route he has just 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.060
 congratulations to all the web 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.150

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.670
 this chronometer five minutes 56 on a 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.040
 train of hell he realized this course 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.800
 Congratulations to you both bravo bravo bravo

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:30.490
