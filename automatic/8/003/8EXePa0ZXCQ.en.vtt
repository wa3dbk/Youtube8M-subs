00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.609
 nowadays there is a lot of 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.980
 plastic materials in infinity of 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.810
 applications the extrusion sector 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.880
 is one of the most important in the 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.710
 processed of these materials since 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.810
 practically the whole are 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 processed with this technology in some 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.530
 phase of its transformation 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.850
 for more than 20 years of experience in the 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.580
 extrusion of plastic materials 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.410
 aimplas the technological institute of 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.060
 impart plastic from 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.800
 September a new edition of the course 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.210
 online material extrusion 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.400
 plastics aimed at all those 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.840
 professionals who want to deepen their 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.660
 knowledge in this process of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.270
 transformation recycle or detect 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.160
 opportunities for your business the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.379
 course material has been produced by 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.550
 specialists in extrusion of aimplas and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.550
 It is divided into five modules 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.760
 first we will organize the equipment 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.790
 which is used in the machine process 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.680
 extrusion spindles auxiliary equipment and 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.809
 how can each of them contribute 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 to improve our process while continuing 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.440
 aspects related to the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.720
 Machine safety subsequently 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.610
 We will see how to control the process a 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.560
 fundamental module in which we will know 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.420
 the most suitable parameters to have 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.710
 a quality product minimizing 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.220
 waste and improving efficiency 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.440
 energy 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.570
 The course will also analyze the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.640
 properties and process conditions of 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.530
 the flexible and semi-rigid products 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.520
 as well as the transformation processes 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.520
 auxiliaries 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.130
 we will see both in flexible products 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.509
 as semi-tissues the defects that 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.970
 may arise due to conditions of 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.070
 processed and we will analyze how to avoid them 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.180
 we will also deepen in processes 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.060
 auxiliaries like packaging 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.280
 Thermoforming lamination or techniques 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.960
 printing analyzing the needs of 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.970
 these south industries that in many 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.650
 Sometimes they are potential clients of 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.600
 the students of this course 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.790
 The objective is that the students know 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.010
 the parts of the ex 3 hours and equipment 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.140
 peripherals what are they for? 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.450
 that deepen their knowledge about 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.100
 the phases of the extrusion process and 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 properly apply the different 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.720
 parameters to improve the quality of your 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.370
 product in addition to detecting benefits and 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.540
 drawbacks of other processes 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.340
 related to extrusion the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.260
 online mode allows a broad 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.240
 temporal and spatial flexibility for 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.770
 student being able to make it compatible with 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.750
 other activities 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.310
 eliminating geographical limitations and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.620
 avoiding the time and cost of 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.930
 displacements one of the main 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.680
 advantages of this course is the closeness 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.680
 with the tutor 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.420
 the students can contact me 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.280
 to resolve any doubt and comment 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.490
 aspects of the course both through the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.360
 chat as by email and then by phone 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.370
 We consider the interaction 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.290
 professor brings a fundamental value for 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.480
 that we strive for the students 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.670
 benefit so much from flexibility 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.320
 of online mode but without losing 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.710
 the value that the relation with the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.710
 teacher
