Finding<00:03:15.940> Nemo<00:03:16.090> all<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:17.170> time<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.470> mean<00:03:17.829> since

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
Finding Nemo all this time I mean since

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.130 
Finding Nemo all this time I mean since
that<00:03:18.220> came<00:03:18.400> out<00:03:18.549> Finding<00:03:19.150> Nemo<00:03:19.299> it's<00:03:19.630> one<00:03:20.049> of

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
that came out Finding Nemo it's one of

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.809 
that came out Finding Nemo it's one of
the<00:03:20.200> greatest<00:03:20.410> films<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.859> all<00:03:21.010> time<00:03:21.040> no<00:03:21.670> one

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
the greatest films of all time no one

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.110 
the greatest films of all time no one
can<00:03:22.030> deny<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.260> think<00:03:23.769> I<00:03:24.160> think<00:03:24.910> that

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
can deny that but I think I think that

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.380 
can deny that but I think I think that
up<00:03:25.299> is<00:03:25.680> right<00:03:26.680> here<00:03:27.130> with<00:03:27.310> Finding<00:03:27.760> Nemo<00:03:27.940> and

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
up is right here with Finding Nemo and

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.420 
up is right here with Finding Nemo and
I'm<00:03:28.780> not<00:03:29.019> gonna<00:03:29.230> say<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.859> one's<00:03:30.040> better<00:03:30.340> than

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
I'm not gonna say that one's better than

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.620 
I'm not gonna say that one's better than
the<00:03:30.579> other<00:03:30.700> because<00:03:31.209> they're<00:03:31.390> different

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
the other because they're different

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.599 
the other because they're different
movies<00:03:32.250> but<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.579> will<00:03:34.150> say<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.450> they<00:03:35.130> up<00:03:36.130> it's

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
movies but I will say that they up it's

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.910 
movies but I will say that they up it's
definitely<00:03:36.970> on<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.660> scale<00:03:37.930> of<00:03:37.959> Finding<00:03:38.560> Nemo

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
definitely on the scale of Finding Nemo

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.949 
definitely on the scale of Finding Nemo
as<00:03:39.130> far<00:03:39.459> as<00:03:39.489> Pixar<00:03:39.940> goes<00:03:40.150> there's<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.660> little

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
as far as Pixar goes there's a little

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.900 
as far as Pixar goes there's a little
disappointed<00:03:41.560> because<00:03:41.709> we<00:03:42.370> didn't<00:03:42.639> get<00:03:42.730> to

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
disappointed because we didn't get to

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.350 
disappointed because we didn't get to
