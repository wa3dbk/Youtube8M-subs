00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.690 
if they do last for that five to seven
days<00:03:29.030> really<00:03:29.690> about<00:03:30.560> five<00:03:30.830> you're<00:03:31.070> doing<00:03:31.280> good

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
days really about five you're doing good

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.180 
days really about five you're doing good
they<00:03:32.000> usually<00:03:32.180> get<00:03:32.480> scratches<00:03:32.990> in<00:03:33.140> them<00:03:33.350> but<00:03:33.920> I

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
they usually get scratches in them but I

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.820 
they usually get scratches in them but I
put<00:03:35.000> this<00:03:35.209> over<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.660> top<00:03:35.690> as<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.200> faster<00:03:36.800> I

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
put this over the top as a faster I

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.160 
put this over the top as a faster I
topcoat<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:37.520> it<00:03:37.580> doesn't<00:03:37.970> defeat<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.750> purpose

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
topcoat so it doesn't defeat the purpose

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.110 
topcoat so it doesn't defeat the purpose
of<00:03:39.380> using<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.130> salon<00:03:40.370> effects<00:03:40.730> because<00:03:41.030> you

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
of using the salon effects because you

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.600 
of using the salon effects because you
know<00:03:41.239> that<00:03:41.420> has<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:41.600> non<00:03:42.110> drying<00:03:42.470> process<00:03:42.980> but

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
know that has a non drying process but

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.190 
know that has a non drying process but
this<00:03:43.790> dries<00:03:44.150> within<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.570> minute

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
this dries within a minute

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.370 
this dries within a minute
so<00:03:45.560> you're<00:03:46.100> really<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.880> protecting<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.080> salon

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
so you're really a protecting the salon

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.770 
so you're really a protecting the salon
effects<00:03:48.739> so<00:03:48.920> last<00:03:49.220> longer<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:50.060> actually<00:03:50.390> had<00:03:50.690> to

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
effects so last longer I actually had to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.930 
effects so last longer I actually had to
take<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.140> off<00:03:51.320> myself<00:03:51.560> with<00:03:52.520> no<00:03:52.700> polish

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
take it off myself with no polish

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.170 
take it off myself with no polish
remover<00:03:53.660> after<00:03:54.110> like<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.320> week<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:54.830> half<00:03:55.180> and

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
remover after like a week and a half and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.370

protecting it and it takes a minute to
dry<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:07.580> it<00:04:07.760> makes<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:08.060> shinier<00:04:08.570> so<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:08.930> looks
