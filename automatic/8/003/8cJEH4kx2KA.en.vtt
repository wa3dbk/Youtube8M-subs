00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.540 
still do believe that if I was gonna be
winner<00:02:14.170> here<00:02:16.739> because<00:02:17.739> I<00:02:17.920> mean<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.190> go<00:02:18.310> play

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
winner here because I mean you go play

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.270 
winner here because I mean you go play
this<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.879> then<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.150> sold<00:02:19.360> on<00:02:19.480> ice<00:02:19.599> for<00:02:19.629> I<00:02:19.959> mean

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
this and then you sold on ice for I mean

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.160 
this and then you sold on ice for I mean
you're<00:02:21.280> not<00:02:21.459> probably<00:02:21.970> super<00:02:22.510> optimized<00:02:22.900> for

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
you're not probably super optimized for

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.430 
you're not probably super optimized for
the<00:02:23.260> hardware<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.129> all<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.430> even<00:02:25.440> though

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
the hardware and all that even though

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.759 
the hardware and all that even though
it's<00:02:26.650> kind<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:26.920> smooth<00:02:29.430> there<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.670> go

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
it's kind of smooth there you go

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.300 
it's kind of smooth there you go
so<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:33.010> one<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:34.450> quicker<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:36.040> year

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
so this one is a quicker and the year

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.460 
so this one is a quicker and the year
for<00:02:36.700> bid<00:02:36.819> for<00:02:36.970> KitKat<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.660> not<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:38.260> far

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
for bid for KitKat is not that far

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.699 
for bid for KitKat is not that far
behind<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:39.280> hey<00:02:40.000> still<00:02:40.420> stay<00:02:40.959> behind<00:02:41.140> so

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
behind but hey still stay behind so

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.440 
behind but hey still stay behind so
there<00:02:42.489> could<00:02:43.180> be<00:02:43.209> good<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.840> know<00:02:44.079> here<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.970> that

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
there could be good to know here in that

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.569 
there could be good to know here in that
little<00:02:46.780> test<00:02:47.019> but<00:02:47.349> overall<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:48.040> mean<00:02:48.280> it's<00:02:48.430> so

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
little test but overall I mean it's so

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.620 
little test but overall I mean it's so
much<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.730> say<00:02:49.000> about<00:02:49.090> who<00:02:49.360> could<00:02:49.480> forget

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
much to say about who could forget

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.900 
much to say about who could forget
