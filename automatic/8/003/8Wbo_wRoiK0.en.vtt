dollars<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:14.540> if<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.630> did<00:04:15.780> my<00:04:15.870> math<00:04:16.019> correctly

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.710 
dollars and if I did my math correctly
again<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:17.190> around<00:04:17.850> six<00:04:18.150> dollars<00:04:18.419> for<00:04:18.450> this

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720
