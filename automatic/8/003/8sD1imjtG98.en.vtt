00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 here is jannik from android videos de 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.870
 and I want to show you today like you 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.550
 your android smartphone very simple 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.550
 nintendo ds games can play 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.390
 yes the whole works then with the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.580
 I rest emulators have you ever 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.990
 that looks like it can start 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.660
 be that with you still another message 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.009
 be comes the bios data requires the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.470
 then you have to just on your smartphone 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.630
 play and it is on the one hand the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.809
 balance nds seven points and the base 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.149
 nds nine points 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.649
 then he goes to new game and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.239
 you have to choose somehow rum 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.100
 how do you find somewhere on the internet 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.530
 Googling through I have here now 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.510
 For example , Pokémon will choose it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.129
 I already have one now 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.019
 That's why I'm playing 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.789
 Now here on now that I mean 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.739
 old score can continue 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.140
 yes, I'm right here in the middle of a fight 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.300
 stored here via the emulator 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.670
 You can fight in yourself, too 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.150
 we save that maybe we can 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.350
 One only about the game itself outside 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.720
 save from fighting 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.450
 but this is really about everyone 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.860
 time yes we maybe now 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 Viewed got the game is really totally 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.689
 as liquid as it does not notice that me 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.759
 now only with the emulator game but 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.049
 it could really be done now 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.700
 nintendo ds be and yes on so 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.049
 bad things will work 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.450
 was my cell phone it is already one 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.939
 a bit older and even here it is 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.049
 really totally liquid actually so me 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.810
 I already have a bit 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.509
 but I did not notice anything 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.060
 that it would somehow be tight that you like that 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.409
 a lot but it also did not play though 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.920
 that actually really looks up 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.740
 now totally beautiful yes so here left 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.490
 Of course you can as usual his 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.109
 Person tax has one 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.770
 well-known buttons above I still l 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.689
 and r 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 if here on luck I get 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.030
 still start and select but need that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.600
 I'm less for that now 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.649
 but also a bit hidden here 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.929
 you always feel the keys 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.880
 needs one has since left it 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.850
 you just pay the upper screen of 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.550
 nintendo ds right you can see here 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.470
 the touch area so I can now 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.900
 fight on it next to it 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.670
 I could do that too over here 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.170
 But that's not what they are doing 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.510
 yes yes here is a follow-up tip yes 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.920
 so I need the game itself 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.900
 There is nothing else to tell 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.730
 here at the emulator itself there are also 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.400
 still a lot of settings there goes 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.980
 Just click on the arrow and 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.410
 then on menu here you can do it first 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.830
 choose the layout what I wear 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.170
 this star in landscape format if I have 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.090
 then I can up here 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.780
 gaps then it just changes the looks 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.000
 then look like this 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.069
 yes I want it back but that 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.569
 I do not like it that way and then 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.019
 I'll go back here yes 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.580
 of course, there are still attitude 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.250
 especially important for me is the 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.989
 Settings that the game just times 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.500
 running faster, I get it up 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.600
 400 percent maximum because the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.269
 eternal geologist that always lasts 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.739
 totally long and it works so well 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.560
 here it is employed that it 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.880
 A maximum of 100 was going to be 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.220
 probably have noticed there you have 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.049
 nothing planned to activate it 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.820
 what's up on the arrows up here 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.680
 prosper 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.790
 and now it's all gonna happen 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.620
 run a little faster 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.170
 it is no longer quite so 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:50.190
 liquid but just faster than 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:54.299
 Before that is a geological yes that's it 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.100
 what it goes wrong here and there goes 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.079
 He had just again in the menu 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.130
 then from 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.799
 and these are just that 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.420
 in front of the deep coach and that are 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.769
 actually quite a lot as it 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.030
 I can not believe it myself 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.920
 add more more 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.109
 But the database is really totally 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.120
 Great and I think that should be synonymous for 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:17.640
 each one is actually enough more or 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.829
 less yes and the most important option is 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.680
 of course, the save so as I said 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.210
 you can just about the game itself 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.419
 save as normal as you can 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.690
 knows is here about left and then 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.599
 to secure and then I can completely 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.870
 normally save via the menu or me 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.090
 can just stop too 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.760
 Save when I want socially possible 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.640
 time again here about the menu and 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.860
 then you just go to emergency and safe and 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.380
 I have my five memory slots here 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.510
 Can I choose one here ? 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.760
 ever saved and can it 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.850
 install override or stop 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.010
 also new memory will save and 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.100
 then happy to save on here i can 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.870
 the whole thing as well as my game got up 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.520
 I'm the google drive upload 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.070
 Picture I think now more likely 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.770
 That's why I'm leaving it that way 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.840
 First, but remain important 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.330
 I have all the emulator function 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.440
 the only thing he does not have is one 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.850
 multiplayer function is also used by 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.590
 the developers probably in 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.380
 Next time only times not offered 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.660
 because they do not see any simple stuff 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.930
 and well , usually just too soon 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.030
 times when the players are offline so 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.910
 here with a camera is just nintendo ds 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.100
 play games 3ds games give's 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.600
 not yet for android but you can 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.370
 actually not even on the 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.060
 play pc as far as I know 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.890
 So pokémon iks or y will be here 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.060
 can not play and it will 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.670
 probably also a time 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.700
 take it until it even works yes 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.680
 but otherwise the emulator is for me 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.070
 really good so the games are running 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.930
 liquid as you can see that was it 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.240
 actually already so far then fell 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.240
 for to see and see you for the next video 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.100
 most skilfully if you first the 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.750
 black area here also makes good 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.060
 I now have the inside completely good 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.210
 and should then be indoors 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.050
 phone the idea on info and afterwards 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.050
 still on software in
