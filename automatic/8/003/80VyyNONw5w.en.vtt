00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:07.536
 Welcome Mario 

00:00:07.892 --> 00:00:08.580
 Thanks piba 

00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:11.113
 How did you become a TyP fan? 

00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:16.394
 Everything started as a fool, my old man was from Chacarita, my old woman from Peñarol 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.440
 Then I decided to become a fan of a Club posta posta 

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:25.414
 I talked to Carlitos and he invited me to the gym .. They say there are good gyms in Buenos Aires 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.200
 There he told me about his soccer team, which was just starting, they were very pichis 

00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:32.274
 And what did you do? 

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.462
 I thought: "The fucking mother" 

00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:37.791
 And you went to hell? 

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.976
 No, I went to see them but Carlitos put it on me 

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:46.743
 And the truth that surprised me, are some beasts 

00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:55.181
 I wish I had the hands of the Marton to lift 300 kilos every day, it is a beast that boy, must have high gaver for when the manuela is done 

00:00:56.545 --> 00:01:00.714
 I am a half manicurist and I realized when I entered the TyP wardrobe 

00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:06.091
 Lother made me the helicopter and I was frozen ... it looked like I was going to take it back seriously 

00:01:07.862 --> 00:01:10.949
 Another one that I really liked is Riky ... 

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:18.207
 The scream the other day made me frown the eye ... the truth an example of goal celebration 

00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:19.714
 It was a difficult game, very hard ... 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.882
 there was anger and he felt in the environment ... 

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:25.707
 Yes, so hot I would have liked to be beaten ... 

00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:28.508
 But back to the subject ... at one point it seemed that the party was out of control 

00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:30.584
 What would you have done if you armed yourself with quilombo? 

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:35.660
 I used to go out and start turning puppets like a champion, nobody touches my players 

00:01:35.988 --> 00:01:40.865
 With a key, he broke his neck ... and with a pineapple he pierced his belly like Goku 

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:46.033
 I'm also a Dragon Ball fan, I always looked at him like a fool. 

00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:51.786
 I could merge with Carlitos and make the Super Herrerousky, but just missed the idiot. 

00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:56.679
 The Henkidama does not turn out very well, but if it came out it would all end quickly 

00:01:57.697 --> 00:02:01.667
 Well, I do not want to look like a 5-year-old kid. Let's keep talking about the players ... 

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:05.156
 "El Gato" Pagnani, is a different player ... 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.212
 He is the top scorer of the team, and although he always fights, he knows that the bank 

00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:15.058
 Many times I go out with him to dance .. and then we play to do the magicians ... then if you want I teach you ... 

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:17.621
 How is it? tell me 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.330
 I made you two powders and you disappeared ... it's nice 

00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:30.102
 You are not very pretty but no woman is ugly if you look at her where you piss, you saw ... I can make the effort 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.257
 Ah, look how good 

00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:36.197
 Yes, he also taught me a phrase to lift minitas in the discos ... 

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:41.854
 When I face, the first thing I say is "come out petiso?" and I win for sure 

00:02:43.437 --> 00:02:47.292
 And what do you think about the next game? Is it going to be screwed or is it going to be easy? 

00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:52.805
 And look ... if I talk to you as a soccer player ... I have to tell you that it's going to be a difficult game 

00:02:53.712 --> 00:03:00.983
 They are fags ... they always say the same, I want to shit pineapples and be split by a ray of pikachu 

00:03:01.402 --> 00:03:04.997
 I love Pikachu, it looks like a little yellow egg with electricity 

00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:09.112
 Do not know if they sell it? I want to buy one and put it in the sink to see what it does 

00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:12.563
 And maybe I'll put it in your ass 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.550
 Fuck you, stop Pikachu, answer the question 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.927
 Well, sorry, I like Pikachu 

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:20.419
 The same Charizard is better 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:21.805
 Nothing to do 

00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:23.866
 Yes, it's much more ... much stronger 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.192
 Well, if you want later I'll give you a heads-up to see who wins 

00:03:29.628 --> 00:03:33.755
 Returning to the subject I think the game will be easy 

00:03:33.374 --> 00:03:36.263
 Captain Machi knows what he is doing ... he is a very piola type 

00:03:36.858 --> 00:03:38.889
 You're a piola? 

00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:39.763
 Yes... 

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:42.054
 Well, tie me this package then 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:48.084
 I also think that they will end up fighting for the promotion ... I have a lot of faith ... they have the pasta of champions 

00:03:48.907 --> 00:03:53.526
 And what is your opinion about that player in yellow pants ... Lucas? 

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:55.985
 Yes, it also has a yellow tractor 

00:03:56.901 --> 00:03:57.683
 Is big? 

00:03:57.986 --> 00:04:01.753
 Yes, it's great, but I raise it with an equal hand 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:07.254
 I can also raise the whole team together, I kick them in the ortho and send them on tour 

00:04:07.558 --> 00:04:11.910
 For now it's the only way for them to go on tour, but hopefully they become famous 

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:15.766
 But Lucas I like ... especially in the interim, is a guy who talks a lot 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.195
 Guillermo Aguirre, what does that name tell you? 

00:04:18.556 --> 00:04:21.513
 The skinny one is a big one, I learned many things with him 

00:04:21.774 --> 00:04:27.775
 One thing that I love is when he thinks he's going to hit the arch and nobody eats it ... it's terrible 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.484
 And I say "do not do it anymore" but he loves it and it's fine, it's his way of playing 

00:04:35.088 --> 00:04:40.092
 Everyone has their way and you have to respect it, Beki is the morph but it is what there is 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.989
 The team complements itself very well and things are going to improve 

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:46.114
 And if they do not improve, they'll see them with me 

00:04:46.543 --> 00:04:47.660
 Do you want to leave a message? 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.459
 To Tocá and Picá? 

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:49.493
 Yes 

00:04:49.493 --> 00:04:52.928
 Well, guys, I hope you succeed with this and do not forget: 

00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:57.336
 The important thing is not to win. What matters is to compete, without losing or drawing
