00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.510 

there<00:00:10.410> are<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.530> couple<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.799> tricks<00:00:11.039> to<00:00:11.250> cutting

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
there are a couple of tricks to cutting

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.029 
there are a couple of tricks to cutting
this<00:00:11.580> out<00:00:11.990> for<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.080> mask<00:00:13.260> you<00:00:13.650> want<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.889> cut

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
this out for the mask you want to cut

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.240 
this out for the mask you want to cut
out<00:00:14.129> the<00:00:14.279> solid<00:00:14.639> red

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
out the solid red

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.160 
out the solid red
so<00:00:16.850> your<00:00:16.970> child<00:00:17.120> can<00:00:17.270> see<00:00:17.540> him<00:00:17.780> can<00:00:17.930> breathe

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
so your child can see him can breathe

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.630 
so your child can see him can breathe
and<00:00:18.470> you<00:00:18.500> want<00:00:18.710> to<00:00:18.770> use<00:00:18.860> a<00:00:18.890> pair<00:00:19.130> or<00:00:19.340> need

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
and you want to use a pair or need

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.150 
and you want to use a pair or need
scissors<00:00:19.850> for<00:00:20.210> that<00:00:20.390> I<00:00:20.830> recommend<00:00:21.830> cutting

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
scissors for that I recommend cutting

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.790 
scissors for that I recommend cutting
out<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:22.520> eyes<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:23.270> mouth<00:00:23.779> first<00:00:24.349> before

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
out the eyes and the mouth first before

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.310 
out the eyes and the mouth first before
you<00:00:24.860> cut<00:00:25.040> out<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:25.310> edge<00:00:25.490> of<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.000> costume<00:00:26.450> but

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
you cut out the edge of the costume but

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.109 
you cut out the edge of the costume but
the<00:00:27.410> edge<00:00:27.500> of<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.740> mask<00:00:27.950> because<00:00:28.580> that<00:00:28.880> leaves

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
the edge of the mask because that leaves

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.359 
the edge of the mask because that leaves
more<00:00:29.450> space<00:00:29.779> between<00:00:30.020> what<00:00:30.920> you're<00:00:31.070> cutting

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
more space between what you're cutting

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.740 
more space between what you're cutting
in<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:31.610> edge<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.849> the<00:00:31.939> paper<00:00:32.150> and<00:00:32.360> it's<00:00:32.599> less

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
in the edge of the paper and it's less

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.369 
in the edge of the paper and it's less
likely<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:33.260> tear<00:00:34.449> do<00:00:35.449> this<00:00:35.629> you<00:00:36.020> poke<00:00:36.260> a<00:00:36.290> hole

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
likely to tear do this you poke a hole

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.820 
likely to tear do this you poke a hole
in<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.710> center<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.820> turn<00:00:41.090> around<00:00:41.769> until<00:00:42.769> you

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
in the center and turn around until you

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.189 
in the center and turn around until you
get<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.129> edge<00:00:43.570> the<00:00:44.570> other<00:00:44.720> trick<00:00:45.019> to

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
get to the edge the other trick to

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.710 
get to the edge the other trick to
cutting<00:00:45.350> out<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.980> rest<00:00:46.160> of<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.340> costume<00:00:46.720> is

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
cutting out the rest of the costume is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.750 
cutting out the rest of the costume is
to<00:00:48.140> do<00:00:48.649> two<00:00:48.829> pieces<00:00:49.190> of<00:00:49.219> paper<00:00:49.460> at<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.670> same

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
to do two pieces of paper at the same

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.400 
to do two pieces of paper at the same
time<00:00:51.190> there's<00:00:52.190> mail<00:00:52.340> enforcement<00:00:53.320> so<00:00:54.320> you

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
time there's mail enforcement so you

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.540 
time there's mail enforcement so you
take<00:00:54.620> both<00:00:54.829> torsos<00:00:56.559> pull<00:00:57.559> them<00:00:57.710> up<00:00:57.829> tight<00:00:58.070> on

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
take both torsos pull them up tight on

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.260 
take both torsos pull them up tight on
their<00:00:58.730> edges<00:00:59.230> and<00:01:00.230> a<00:01:00.320> stapler<00:01:01.120> let's<00:01:02.120> tape

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
their edges and a stapler let's tape

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.580 
their edges and a stapler let's tape
along<00:01:02.510> your<00:01:02.719> sides<00:01:02.989> I<00:01:07.660> do<00:01:08.660> that<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.170> then<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.440> can

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
along your sides I do that so then I can

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.420 
along your sides I do that so then I can
start<00:01:09.710> cutting<00:01:11.350> start<00:01:12.350> over<00:01:12.500> here<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:12.979> like<00:01:13.399> to

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
start cutting start over here I like to

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.520 
start cutting start over here I like to
start<00:01:13.700> over<00:01:13.850> here<00:01:14.210> where<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.869> last<00:01:15.080> staple

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
start over here where the last staple

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.219 
start over here where the last staple
starts<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:17.210> way<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.450> staples<00:01:17.840> hold<00:01:18.080> it

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
starts that way the staples hold it

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.950 
starts that way the staples hold it
together<00:01:18.380> for<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:19.220> longer<00:01:19.460> time<00:01:19.840> where<00:01:20.840> your

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
pieces of paper on the same time what

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.270 
pieces of paper on the same time what
you'll<00:01:29.600> do<00:01:29.750> is<00:01:29.869> cut<00:01:30.140> both<00:01:30.320> halves<00:01:30.650> at<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.070> same

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
you'll do is cut both halves at the same

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.390 
you'll do is cut both halves at the same
time<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.750> do<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:33.020> by<00:01:33.080> cutting<00:01:33.439> like

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
time and you do that by cutting like

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.300 
time and you do that by cutting like
this<00:01:34.610> folding<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.049> half<00:01:36.290> vertically<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:37.130> this

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
this folding and half vertically in this

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.840 
this folding and half vertically in this
case<00:01:37.900> that<00:01:38.900> folded<00:01:39.259> will<00:01:39.350> hold<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:39.619> together

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
case that folded will hold it together

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.070 
case that folded will hold it together
we<00:01:40.850> want<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.060> put<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.299> page<00:01:41.479> number<00:01:41.509> on<00:01:41.990> the

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
we want to put the page number on the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.859 
we want to put the page number on the
top<00:01:42.820> then<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.909> cut<00:01:44.060> from<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.270> fold<00:01:44.570> all<00:01:44.810> the

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
top then you cut from the fold all the

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.030 
top then you cut from the fold all the
way<00:01:45.020> around<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.470> design<00:01:47.619> we<00:01:48.619> have<00:01:48.650> a<00:01:48.829> shoulder

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
way around the design we have a shoulder

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.469 
way around the design we have a shoulder
piece<00:01:49.509> just<00:01:50.509> like<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.780> torso<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:53.270> peace

peace stay home and cut back the
forearms<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.470> little<00:02:03.710> bit<00:02:03.799> different<00:02:04.240> they're
