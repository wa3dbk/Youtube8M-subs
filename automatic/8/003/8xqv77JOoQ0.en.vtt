00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.020
 hey people today in the video we want us 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 a comparison between two 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.900
 football boots on head once 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.929
 the adidas predator willel songs and 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.120
 once the new adidas f50 adizero 4 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.070
 both shoes do not differ 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.140
 only from the design but also from the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.230
 used technology 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.869
 First, it is so that the pre data 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.939
 a very clear control boat is that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.410
 it is said in football boots to the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.720
 Control of the ball are thought 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.210
 which were specially developed for 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.640
 to have a better ball control and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.649
 the front oneself with the own songs 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.170
 Zones have thought that are the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.879
 soon to control that even better 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 means we have the first touch on the front 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.739
 the front of that ensures that already 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.350
 at the first ball contact another 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.510
 contact between the ball arises and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 the schools and the soon to be easy 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.969
 we also have a better grip on the foot 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.620
 the side the drive a protection zone the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.859
 this ensures that you more precisely the ball 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.619
 You can play on the inside 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.630
 the sweet sweet spot for that 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.240
 Among other things is thought about the ball 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.270
 to lend more effet to the shot or 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.100
 on the other side the dribble song 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.500
 all the features of the adidas pro 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.350
 data fully characterized and shoes 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.299
 too special 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.420
 in contrast to that you can see that at 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.299
 adidas f50 adizero these zones in front 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.220
 missing the adidas f50 adizero has for it 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.090
 on the front page 1 rule 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.670
 text material 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.009
 that's done up front it's acting 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.439
 It's similar to a small boost 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.450
 as with the prix data ensures that the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.729
 It is improved when contact is 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.240
 but much finer essential 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.790
 made lighter and much ebner 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.920
 and falls much less on the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.740
 adidas f50 come from the same 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.960
 material as well as the ceiling 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.229
 that is, the base material is both 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.399
 a hybrid material that is a synthetic 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.049
 plaintiff material that the advantages of a 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.960
 teacher takes over and that on 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.490
 synthetic level returns everything 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.670
 the biggest differences 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.380
 Also on the bottom of the shoe 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.350
 the adidas products on the top 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.020
 is a shoe with a normal 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.650
 traction system comes with a triangel 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.990
 Curls 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.240
 that is the form and the noc is in 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.370
 triangel form attached by this 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.610
 Form one should seem extremely good 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.990
 have a maneuver and a really 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.380
 good grip on a natural 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.270
 Underground while cheering the adidas f50 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.240
 adizero you can see it in the back area 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.220
 the system is the same in the front 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.300
 system, however, comes a speed traction 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.790
 system for use 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.800
 speed action from the train system was 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.780
 a completely new curly arrangement has 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.300
 what ensures the most 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.070
 fast players the ideal grip 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.250
 especially for a whole 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.530
 rapid commencement of employment have also 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.150
 allows the operating system in one 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.810
 maximum speed still one 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.490
 especially good action both shoes 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.940
 can be for very different 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.250
 player types are used one says 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.990
 while it is the 50 he is for 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.850
 Offensive player thought the prix data 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.590
 Anyone can actually wear mine 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.110
 opinion, it is more different 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.390
 So what do you want for shoes 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.310
 If you want light shoes you are at 50 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.930
 you really want a lot 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.440
 Ball control is private 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.730
 right in the end tapie the optional 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.840
 maybe we would be interesting 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.730
 can and make a vote 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.500
 which film of the two shoes you will find 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.260
 better or what approach not the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.570
 color of the 50 especially light shoes 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.350
 or the project as much as possible 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.500
 ball control
