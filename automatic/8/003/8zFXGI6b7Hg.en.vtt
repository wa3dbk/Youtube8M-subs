ejected from the solar system go

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.530 
ejected from the solar system go
wandering<00:02:49.190> around<00:02:49.280> through<00:02:50.120> interstellar

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
wandering around through interstellar

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.860 
wandering around through interstellar
space<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.500> comet<00:02:52.370> Ison<00:02:52.730> came<00:02:53.239> from<00:02:53.450> very<00:02:53.750> far

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
space so comet Ison came from very far

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.770 
space so comet Ison came from very far
out<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.769> outer<00:02:55.370> outermost<00:02:55.910> regions<00:02:56.510> of

out in the outer outermost regions of

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
the solar system it's come in this is

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.259 
the solar system it's come in this is
it's<00:02:59.000> 15<00:02:59.950> seconds<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:01.069> fame<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.549> then<00:03:02.150> it's

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
it's 15 seconds of fame and then it's

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.259 
it's 15 seconds of fame and then it's
gonna<00:03:02.360> be<00:03:02.450> gone<00:03:02.660> forever<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:04.060> it's<00:03:05.060> very

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
gonna be gone forever so it's very

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.580 
gonna be gone forever so it's very
interesting<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.780> study<00:03:05.840> these<00:03:06.170> objects

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
interesting to study these objects

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.390 
interesting to study these objects
because<00:03:06.769> we<00:03:06.860> don't<00:03:07.010> get<00:03:07.099> very<00:03:07.130> many

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
because we don't get very many

because we don't get very many

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
to actually not only go into orbit

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.230 
to actually not only go into orbit
around<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.380> comet<00:04:43.530> nucleus<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.730> observe<00:04:45.090> it

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
around the comet nucleus and observe it

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.660

very<00:04:45.420> closely<00:04:45.720> but<00:04:46.050> also<00:04:46.200> to<00:04:46.380> land<00:04:46.710> on<00:04:47.370> the

biggest challenges actually has been the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.670 
biggest challenges actually has been the
duration<00:05:01.620> of<00:05:01.830> this<00:05:02.520> mission<00:05:02.970> because<00:05:03.680> we're

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
duration of this mission because we're

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.200 
duration of this mission because we're
trying<00:05:04.890> to<00:05:04.950> catch<00:05:05.100> up<00:05:05.280> with<00:05:05.310> a<00:05:05.460> comet<00:05:05.850> it's<00:05:06.060> not

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
trying to catch up with a comet it's not

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.430 
trying to catch up with a comet it's not
just<00:05:06.600> straightforward<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:07.140> can't<00:05:07.320> just

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
just straightforward you can't just

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.360 
just straightforward you can't just
drive<00:05:07.620> to<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:07.950> comet

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
drive to the comet

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.610 
drive to the comet
you've<00:05:08.490> got<00:05:08.700> to<00:05:08.880> sync<00:05:09.810> up<00:05:09.930> your<00:05:09.990> orbit<00:05:10.470> with

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
you've got to sync up your orbit with

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.410 
you've got to sync up your orbit with
the<00:05:10.650> comet<00:05:11.070> so<00:05:11.280> as<00:05:11.550> it's<00:05:11.850> going<00:05:12.030> around<00:05:12.210> the

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
the comet so as it's going around the

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.260 
the comet so as it's going around the
Sun<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.890> join<00:05:13.890> up<00:05:14.100> with<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.430> smoothly<00:05:14.820> because

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
Sun you join up with it smoothly because

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.760 
Sun you join up with it smoothly because
we<00:05:15.390> don't<00:05:15.570> want<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.780> fly<00:05:15.930> past<00:05:16.230> it<00:05:16.410> real<00:05:16.560> fast

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
we don't want to fly past it real fast
