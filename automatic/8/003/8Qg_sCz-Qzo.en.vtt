00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.900
 I will explain how the motorcycle works 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.210
 buy us here 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.540
 good is a wave 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.370
 what's 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.740
 I do not know what will reflect by good motor 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.139
 single cylinder air cooled 70 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.859
 cubic meters how long 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.310
 and automatic clutch but box 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:29.180
 manual changes 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:31.850
 then this manual also and you go out 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.490
 this neutrals I could throw p'alante to the 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.160
 lever and it goes up the gear is 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.660
 inverted from the backwards and lowers in 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.180
 March the first second third quarter 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.750
 fourth third second first point in 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 deadlock 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:57.030
 indicates that it indicates that it is an aid 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.730
 because many times you do not know if you 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.000
 they enter neutral in the trance that you can 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.850
 watch 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.400
 here also another affected 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.340
 and now this is a motorcycle a sling 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.340
 standard but now my motorcycle is 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:17.219
 the difference physically among others 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.229
 which should be appreciated because the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.860
 mine carries tam action ahead and not 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.850
 brake anything 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.600
 I have 2,500 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.600
 on the drum 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920
 and performance 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.679
 on the left and the left forward 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.399
 then also do the vote the world 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:47.610
 a brake forward and now the subject of 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.750
 change for the victory under March had 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.990
 plus 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.900
 When the bike idles the clutch 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.960
 it is collected 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.340
 and when he goes out, he releases them and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.450
 then when it's going to change between gear 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.950
 the beginning of the journey 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.950
 makes the motorcycle 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.560
 in fact if you want because you grab with 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.560
 the shovel 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.650
 good is to say thank you dynamite 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.069
 who have done the actions that I had 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.459
 big message budget 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.870
 I brought an accelerator from Spain 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.230
 that there is no problem because the problem 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.790
 of changing the site accelerator to 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.129
 that you do not think is that now instead 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.109
 makes the country accelerate already for 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.579
 forward in the footage a piece that the 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.900
 that he uses there to be able to invest the 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.180
 fist cinema and what to do is for 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.370
 back like everyone else I also 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.769
 I brought a front brake pump that 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.069
 has used us because this motorcycle 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.069
 cable 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.330
 and then when the Vietnamese 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.210
 when I brought the note to the workshop 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.860
 changed the site gas and collect the 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:08.020
 motorbike and Belgians with the site but here not 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.020
 There was nothing they knew and handles we are 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.460
 four thousand kilometers giving with the hand 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.620
 and on top of that it sounds a little bit then 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.240
 force because I had to force 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.770
 enough for me to change and I 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.130
 they put here 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.170
 and she of her good faith was that every 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.390
 come time I did not expect that when 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.060
 it's done as soon as they had mccoy him 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.090
 let's change 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.430
 the site start button is more 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.410
 usually here they put me here and the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.770
 lights that normally go here like the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.230
 fusion here also in such a way that 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.209
 man one starts once when he goes to 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.920
 out and then the rest of the time what 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.920
 is doing is to remove all of them 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.569
 started and then I can not remove more 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.560
 things that is good when you advance 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.660
 change fire I remember him 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.620
 of the luck that I had of the Lord 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.849
 that changed my place whistle 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.319
 the lights the button that lights once 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.819
 and then what it does is that it changes 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.260
 I found short and long I can not 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.130
 do it I understand it with long and 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.490
 nobody is here the appointment 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.490
 I also have 20 forts 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:24.660
 the chain of the lid so that it does not enter 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:27.380
 dirt dust mud 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.380
 really the sand 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.030
 and we have already signed this click 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.030
 once and that of the pricked 4 13 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.830
 and we're not going to take it off because it's coming 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.490
 explaining 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.490
 regards
