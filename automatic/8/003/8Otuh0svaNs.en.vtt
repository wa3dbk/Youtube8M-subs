00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi girls with you channel beauty kyu 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.720
 I suggest you make a whitening mask 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.030
 parsley-based face 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.820
 for this we only need 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.960
 with parsley we buy fresh parsley 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.070
 finely and cut it hot 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.779
 water and boil we bring and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.269
 cover with a lid for 10-15 minutes then 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.510
 the resulting mixture we can add lemon 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.340
 but we add lemon only for fatty 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.649
 either normal skin if you have skin 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.989
 dry then we don't add lemon because 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.450
 that he dries the skin a few drops 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.090
 fresh lemon straight infusion 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.899
 parsley then we take gauze 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.120
 dressings wet them in parsley solution and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.890
 put on face for five to ten minutes 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.989
 remind bleaching masks we do 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.440
 either in the evening or when we don’t 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.539
 going to go out to not 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.650
 there was direct sunlight 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.290
 on the skin of the priests moistened 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.330
 [music] 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.270
 I prepared these special ones 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.160
 pieces that can be put on each 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.080
 part of the face was 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.850
 because under the eyes we guys are not 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:26.050
 we lay down here. 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.510
 forehead chin and after all this is part all 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.130
 five ten minutes he if suddenly start 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.510
 dry gauze dressings we 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.910
 wet the tinsel and again very comfortable 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.970
 have a stick like that 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:44.140
 which collect our hair does not give them 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.840
 wipe and do not interfere with the application of masks 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.000
 any, I bought this striped in square 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.140
 it cost literally 8 hryvnia there 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.020
 different colors different shades with hearts 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.900
 with circles that is, you can buy yourself 7 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.760
 different pieces each of which a lot of people 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.900
 rolls everything went 10 minutes we again 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.500
 remove our 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.500
 tried to wipe glasses with tonic 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.040
 whatever you have 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.380
 so what can I say about the effect 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.540
 the effect of course is not immediately visible parsley 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.550
 well whitens but such masks need 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.040
 do at least once a week and then 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.230
 maybe a couple of months will be visible 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.810
 result because after the first time 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.810
 it does not whiten your skin may be 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.910
 a little bit on my face but I don’t 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.040
 I see the differences, but here I had 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.560
 the bandage was not here that is skin in 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.140
 principle what was there such I will 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.959
 do this mask every three days, that is, and 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.140
 then I will tell you about the result 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.850
 because until spring I want to maximize 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.670
 try to whiten your skin 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.320
