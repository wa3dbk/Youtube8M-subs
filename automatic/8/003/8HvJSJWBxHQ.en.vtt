00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.140
 but from local 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.650
 if not 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.750
 well we can make a recipe for oreo 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.820
 for you are going to use 450 grams of 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.090
 oreo cookies or what is the same 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.720
 three packages of these 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.250
 and 100 grams of butter and for the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.460
 stuffing the cake 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.180
 we are going to use 250 grams of chocolate 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.370
 white 600 milliliters of liquid cream 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.600
 to ride 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.780
 an envelope of curd and cream 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.110
 we will remove the cookie and then for the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.480
 decoration we will use the oreo mini what 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.949
 first thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.949
 separate cream from oreo cookies 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.710
 this cream will be the one that we will later 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:05.730
 to the filling of the cake and the cookie will be 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.730
 with which we will make the base 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.280
 once we have finished removing 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.710
 the cream to the cookies the next thing 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.810
 you are going to be the owner of this part 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.360
 which will be with which we will form the base 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.510
 together with the butter we are going to 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.250
 crush the cookies distributing the 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.220
 we are going to introduce them in this 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.670
 device if you do not have this device 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:37.450
 you can crush it in a mortar or the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.450
 you put on a rag and give it blows 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.340
 that the butter is melted in the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.030
 microwave and crushed the cookie let's go 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.030
 to mix it 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.230
 after mixing the cookie with 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.850
 the butter the next thing we're going to 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.850
 do is going to be introduce it into the mold 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.420
 we are going to use this mold is 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:09.399
 about 22 23 cm in diameter is the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.230
 removable good but let's make it go 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.060
 to be introduce the cookie mix and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.060
 butter and form the base 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.130
 with a spoon we are going to press 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.130
 the edges so that they are all the same 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.430
 and once we have finished doing 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.230
 the base we are going to reserve the fridge 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.450
 while we do the filling of the high 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.450
 we're going to throw the cream 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.959
 let's wait for it to warm up and 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.580
 before it came to boil 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.590
 we will incorporate white chocolate 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.480
 curd and the cream of the cookies that 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.950
 we have removed a sale to be hot 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.790
 but before it gets to boil 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.790
 to throw the chocolate 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.980
 to the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.230
 we are also going to take the cream that the 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.230
 more removed oreo cookies 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.230
 and once everything is integrated and 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.230
 melted we will throw the envelope of curd 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.560
 everything is already integrated so the 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.560
 next step would be to throw the curd 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.800
 we are going to remove the filling of the cake 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.130
 it would already be done so we turned off the 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.130
 ceramic hob 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.420
 and the next step is to throw it where 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.800
 had in the mold or we would not have the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.940
 base with the cookie and the mary by 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.440
 Last thing we have to do is 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.440
 Pour the mixture into the mold 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.360
 and the last step would be to introduce 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.730
 chiquititas cookies 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.870
 to decorate 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.120
 and help us with a fork and 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.880
 to put them in the bottom like that when 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.560
 cut the pie are also spread out 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.090
 for all the cream and not only in the 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.750
 surface 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.310
 finally let's let the cake 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.570
 lose a little temperature and once 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.810
 I wasted the temperature 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.810
 we will put in the fridge where it cools 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.130
 to 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.460
 it takes me 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.550
 yes 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.540
 but 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.540
 the day 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.649
 yes 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.380
 then the most
