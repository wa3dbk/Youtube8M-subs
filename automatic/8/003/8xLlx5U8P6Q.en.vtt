the<00:00:32.969> backcountry<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.710> Sweetwater<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:35.489> of

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the backcountry the Sweetwater is one of

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.569 
the backcountry the Sweetwater is one of
our<00:00:35.670> easiest<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> use<00:00:36.270> filters<00:00:37.100> it<00:00:38.100> comes<00:00:38.370> with

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
our easiest to use filters it comes with

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.430 
our easiest to use filters it comes with
two<00:00:38.850> different<00:00:38.879> color<00:00:39.329> hoses<00:00:39.809> one<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.320> an

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
two different color hoses one that is an

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.170 
two different color hoses one that is an
input<00:00:40.590> hose<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.579> an<00:00:41.700> output<00:00:42.000> hose

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
input hose one that is an output hose

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.490 
input hose one that is an output hose
the<00:00:42.780> input<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.440> labeled<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.780> output<00:00:46.289> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the input is labeled in the output is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.740 
the input is labeled in the output is
labeled<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.550> again<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.180> are<00:00:48.360> different

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
labeled out and again they are different

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.900 
labeled out and again they are different
colors<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.530> less<00:00:49.739> likely<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.730> will

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
colors so it's less likely that you will

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
colors so it's less likely that you will
confuse<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> two<00:00:51.809> which<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> number-one

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
confuse the two which is a number-one

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.920 
confuse the two which is a number-one

source of contamination in a water
filter<00:00:55.860> environment<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> lever<00:00:57.660> action

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
