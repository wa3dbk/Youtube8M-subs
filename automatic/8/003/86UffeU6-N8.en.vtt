it<00:02:26.610> was<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.629> really<00:02:27.840> great<00:02:28.200> I

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it was just it's just really great I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.869 
it was just it's just really great I
don't<00:02:28.590> really<00:02:28.800> use<00:02:29.099> these<00:02:29.340> colors<00:02:29.580> together

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
don't really use these colors together

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.880 
don't really use these colors together
but<00:02:30.300> separately<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.840> use<00:02:31.140> them<00:02:31.319> all<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.620> time

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
but separately I use them all the time

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.430 
but separately I use them all the time
but<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.760> said<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.269> formula<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.900> very

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
but like I said the formula is very

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.800 
but like I said the formula is very
powdery<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.190> not<00:02:35.400> hugely<00:02:35.970> pigmented<00:02:36.599> so<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
powdery and not hugely pigmented so you

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.630 
powdery and not hugely pigmented so you
do<00:02:36.989> have<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.260> use<00:02:37.379> quite<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> bit<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.890> product<00:02:38.160> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
do have to use quite a bit of product to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.360 
do have to use quite a bit of product to
get<00:02:38.790> your<00:02:38.910> desired<00:02:39.300> color<00:02:39.959> effect<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:41.010> have

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
get your desired color effect I have

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.220 
get your desired color effect I have
also<00:02:41.550> had<00:02:41.790> experience<00:02:42.360> with<00:02:42.540> these<00:02:42.780> colors

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
also had experience with these colors

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.350 
also had experience with these colors
creasing<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.040> my<00:02:44.220> eyes<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.120> to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
creasing on my eyes so you do have to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.910 
creasing on my eyes so you do have to
wear<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.599> primer<00:02:45.900> underneath<00:02:46.260> with<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> which

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
wear a primer underneath with it which

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.530 
wear a primer underneath with it which
isn't<00:02:47.069> usually<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.550> problem<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.120> yeah<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.390> just

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
isn't usually a problem but yeah I just

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.479 
isn't usually a problem but yeah I just
thought<00:02:48.870> I'd<00:02:48.930> let<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.290> know<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.890> anyway

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
thought I'd let you know that anyway

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.699 
thought I'd let you know that anyway
overall<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.239> would<00:02:51.480> say<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.260> decent

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
overall I would say that it is a decent

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.240

colors<00:02:56.819> in<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.239> palette<00:02:57.450> but<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> don't

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
colors in this palette but I don't

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.690 
colors in this palette but I don't
really<00:02:58.349> like<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.709> formula<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.310> true

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
really like the formula it is true

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.430 
really like the formula it is true
powdery<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.599> not<00:03:00.750> pigmented<00:03:01.290> enough

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
powdery and not pigmented enough

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.649 
powdery and not pigmented enough
somewhere<00:03:02.250> liking<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.849> also<00:03:03.090> did<00:03:03.360> forget<00:03:03.599> to

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
somewhere liking I also did forget to

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.509 
somewhere liking I also did forget to
mention<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:04.349> it<00:03:04.500> does<00:03:04.739> come<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.159> five

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
mention but it does come in five

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.259 
mention but it does come in five
different<00:03:06.440> quad<00:03:07.489> combinations<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.700> there<00:03:09.150> are

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
different quad combinations so there are

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.600 
different quad combinations so there are
five<00:03:09.510> things<00:03:10.379> in<00:03:10.650> total<00:03:10.980> obviously<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.340> chose

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
five things in total obviously I chose

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.710 
five things in total obviously I chose
this<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.090> probably<00:03:12.450> one<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:12.599> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
there's some other neutral ones and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.979 
there's some other neutral ones and
would<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.769> recommend<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.760> would<00:03:21.000> say<00:03:21.209> yes<00:03:21.750> for

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
would I recommend it I would say yes for

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.680 
would I recommend it I would say yes for
the<00:03:22.110> colors<00:03:22.470> but<00:03:23.099> no<00:03:23.459> for<00:03:23.879> the<00:03:24.030> formula<00:03:24.450> just

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
the colors but no for the formula just

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.210 
the colors but no for the formula just
because<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.019> not<00:03:25.230> my<00:03:25.349> favourite<00:03:25.799> formula

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
because it's not my favourite formula

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.149 
because it's not my favourite formula
and<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.849> would<00:03:27.090> probably<00:03:27.900> give<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.379> a<00:03:28.590> round<00:03:28.860> of

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
and I would probably give it a round of

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.610 
and I would probably give it a round of
five<00:03:29.580> out<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:29.970> ten<00:03:30.420> because<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:31.140> is<00:03:31.349> average

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
five out of ten because it is average

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.940 
five out of ten because it is average
