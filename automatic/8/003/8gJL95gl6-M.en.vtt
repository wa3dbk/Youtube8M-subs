hysteria<00:00:59.660> around<00:00:59.839> the<00:01:00.170> etre<00:01:00.440> even<00:01:00.739> more<00:01:00.949> would

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
hysteria around the etre even more would

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.060 
hysteria around the etre even more would
be<00:01:01.609> if<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:01.850> went<00:01:02.000> on<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.420> won<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.379> World<00:01:03.649> Car

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
be if it went on and won the World Car

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:14.779 
be if it went on and won the World Car
of<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.340> Year<00:01:04.490> award<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.360> guess<00:01:06.320> what<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:07.790> did

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.700 

in<00:01:15.789> my<00:01:16.479> opinion<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:16.990> tree<00:01:17.289> saloon<00:01:17.560> is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
in my opinion the a tree saloon is

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.590 
in my opinion the a tree saloon is
prettier<00:01:18.070> than<00:01:18.159> its<00:01:18.340> rivals<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.909> CLA<00:01:19.299> comes<00:01:19.509> a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
prettier than its rivals the CLA comes a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.120 
prettier than its rivals the CLA comes a
very<00:01:19.810> close<00:01:20.140> second<00:01:20.500> but<00:01:20.590> only<00:01:20.799> when<00:01:21.009> it's

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
very close second but only when it's

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.859 
very close second but only when it's
wearing<00:01:21.399> its<00:01:21.520> Sunday<00:01:21.789> best<00:01:22.000> as<00:01:22.240> for<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.750> rest

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
wearing its Sunday best as for the rest

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.480 
wearing its Sunday best as for the rest
they<00:01:23.469> look<00:01:23.619> a<00:01:23.710> little<00:01:23.920> bit<00:01:24.009> dumpy<00:01:24.369> by

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
they look a little bit dumpy by

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.399 
they look a little bit dumpy by
comparison<00:01:24.969> my<00:01:25.509> favorite<00:01:25.929> bit<00:01:26.020> though<00:01:26.170> is

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
engine from an aeroplane well I think

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.339 
engine from an aeroplane well I think
the<00:02:00.939> a3<00:02:01.270> saloon<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:01.659> better<00:02:01.959> than<00:02:02.200> its

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
the a3 saloon is better than its

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:03.869 
the a3 saloon is better than its
competitors<00:02:02.679> I<00:02:02.860> don't<00:02:03.039> actually<00:02:03.310> think<00:02:03.579> it's

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:03.879 
competitors I don't actually think it's

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:05.639 
competitors I don't actually think it's
that<00:02:04.030> much<00:02:04.179> better<00:02:04.390> if<00:02:04.629> at<00:02:04.840> all<00:02:04.989> then<00:02:05.469> it's

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
that much better if at all then it's

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.469 
that much better if at all then it's
siblings<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.670> rear<00:02:06.819> legroom<00:02:07.030> isn't<00:02:07.420> as
