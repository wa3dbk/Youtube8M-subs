00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.930
 so good day today reviews 1 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.460
 phones taxi models start start 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.830
 the phone is so small compact 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.740
 budget series 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:18.449
 objectively standard charging out 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:27.810
 go three guys 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:29.400
 black matt it now stands so well 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.770
 Now a little about the appearance of us 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.809
 now on the screen 4 inches front camera 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.460
 Used except for the throne, we have a button 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.410
 on off screen buttons 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.790
 volume below we connect 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.640
 charging and 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.200
 yusbi mikrofonchik also seen from above 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.100
 under the lace and then the headphones move here at 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.110
 Our questionnaire outbreaks are not bright and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.160
 main camera 3 pixel numbers without 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.989
 autofocus 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:07.110
 but this speaker phone we have screen 4 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.689
 inches that is a small screen here 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.100
 notes modest results now we 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.130
 let's see the antutu test 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.790
 here he is gaining 12,000 237 points 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.930
 before we see the phone itself 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.990
 model x and x but vct qstar means 422 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.390
 we have android camera 32 back 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.610
 so we look at the speed 470 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.710
 megabyte availability 85 this of course 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.350
 very little internal chronical for 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.360
 this is quite enough for 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.260
 The storage of the application is something that the phone does not 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.070
 powerful 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.400
 do not pull too much vigorous flies and nerves 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.030
 processes same srt7 and working again 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.300
 up to 1300 megahertz 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.020
 here is making a 480 by 800 screen like this 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.360
 here are such big figures and somebody 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:04.380
 up to camera 32 front 00 3 megapixels 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.230
 android again he writes all the rest 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.660
 sensors right now im one thing 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.300
 show so here you can see that the viewing angles 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.820
 on the phone, finally, no 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.240
 the color rendition is low and then i hardly plays 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:27.170
 There will be a matrix, that is, the screen is very strong 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.910
 the screen fades weak it's understandable here 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.320
 the battery here is also not very strong 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.740
 based on the instructions here for a thousand 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:44.870
 three hundred forty milliampere hours 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:47.370
 that of course we donâ€™t have enough for a long time 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.610
 let's see what the camera looks like 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.610
 night 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:05.590
 pelvis camera as seen image floats 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:06.340
 and that we have no autofocus and the husband does not 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.260
 only fox 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.510
 that is, the cameras here are very very 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.490
 budget that's about calls I do not know 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.070
 the owner of the phone is nothing bad 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.720
 spoke from below as seen tide that is 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.820
 phone lying on the table will be heard 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.400
 the speaker won't overlap so what 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.420
 still though let's try 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:37.090
 speed let's say by example 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:40.090
 browser we all enter the table 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:46.270
 derivatives of human function believed 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.800
 used look here this is regular 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.710
 the browser works well in principle 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.630
 the processor is pretty good here 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.850
 but for this phone and for this 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.270
 crane solutions and therefore quickly made 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.500
 well , of course sufficiency is here 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.110
 no expect with such 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.270
 operative then there are eight well with this all 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.560
 understandably 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.590
 Overall, this is a fairly small 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.840
 the same sympathy pictures telefonchik ie 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.870
 perfectly understand the suitable for children 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.360
 he is budgetary interesting bright can 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.990
 change the panels that is almost 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.760
 every day u come with new style 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.830
 Well, on this all the link will be in
