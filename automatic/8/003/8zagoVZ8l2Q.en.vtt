around<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.400> shank<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.970> hook<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:22.400> this

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
around the shank of a hook and this

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.740 
around the shank of a hook and this
particular<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:23.939> here<00:00:24.269> again<00:00:24.359> very

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
particular one here again very

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.679 
particular one here again very
inexpensive<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.400> couple<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.820> dollars<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
inexpensive just a couple of dollars and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
inexpensive just a couple of dollars and
very<00:00:27.990> simple<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.619> don't<00:00:29.279> particularly<00:00:29.640> care

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
very simple I don't particularly care

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
very simple I don't particularly care
for<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:31.050> because<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.500> very<00:00:31.560> hard

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
for this one here because it's very hard

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.520 
for this one here because it's very hard
to<00:00:32.099> squeeze<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.780> sort<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.230> hard<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
to squeeze and it's sort of hard to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.700 
to squeeze and it's sort of hard to
manipulate<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:36.360> next<00:00:36.690> step<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.140> from<00:00:37.200> this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
manipulate the next step up from this

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.440 
manipulate the next step up from this
end<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.980> which<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.910> spend<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.210> lot<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
end of which you can spend a lot of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.660 
end of which you can spend a lot of
money<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.960> these<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> use

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
money on these but this is the one I use

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.450 
money on these but this is the one I use
fairly<00:00:42.329> often<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.469> particular<00:00:43.950> one<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
fairly often and this particular one the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.850 
fairly often and this particular one the
only<00:00:44.670> real<00:00:44.879> difference<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.379> there<00:00:46.680> are

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
only real difference is that there are

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.369 
only real difference is that there are
welded<00:00:47.460> nice<00:00:48.059> little<00:00:48.360> tabs<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.260> it's

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
welded nice little tabs on here and it's

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.610 
welded nice little tabs on here and it's
much<00:00:49.590> easier<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:51.059> open<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.989> close<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
much easier to to open and close and

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100 
much easier to to open and close and
grab<00:00:52.829> onto<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.280> hackle<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.629> other<00:00:54.809> one

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
grab onto the hackle and the other one

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.709 
grab onto the hackle and the other one
that<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.320> use<00:00:55.530> quite<00:00:55.920> often<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.550> something<00:00:57.449> like

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
that I use quite often is something like

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.020 
that I use quite often is something like
this<00:00:57.930> here<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.710> particular<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.640> from<00:00:59.910> I

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
this here this particular one is from I

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.490 
this here this particular one is from I
think<00:01:00.210> dr.<00:01:00.600> slick<00:01:00.899> which<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.350> get

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
think dr. slick which you can get

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.039 
think dr. slick which you can get
different<00:01:01.760> brands<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> something

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
different brands and that is something

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.070 
different brands and that is something
that<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> rotating<00:01:05.729> shaft<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.960> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that is on a rotating shaft and it is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.920 
that is on a rotating shaft and it is
also<00:01:07.290> articulated<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
also articulated in and out and that

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.620 
also articulated in and out and that
allows<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.119> were<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> take<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> look

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
allows you to if you were to take a look

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.340 
allows you to if you were to take a look
here<00:01:13.640> grapple<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.450> hackle<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.140> that's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
here grapple on to the hackle and that's

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.980 
here grapple on to the hackle and that's
what<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.650> feather<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.659> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
what this feather is here and then you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.620 
what this feather is here and then you
can<00:01:19.790> Palmer<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.030> called<00:01:21.360> which<00:01:21.600> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
can Palmer it's called which is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.160 
can Palmer it's called which is
basically<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.560> wrap<00:01:23.240> forward<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.540> backwards

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
basically to wrap forward and backwards

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.789 
basically to wrap forward and backwards
the<00:01:26.100> hackle<00:01:26.970> around<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> shank<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> hook

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the hackle around the shank of the hook

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.670 
the hackle around the shank of the hook
and<00:01:29.009> I'm<00:01:29.790> generally<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> way<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and I'm generally out of the way of the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350 
and I'm generally out of the way of the
bobbin<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> gives<00:01:32.520> me<00:01:32.700> quite<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> lot<00:01:33.210> of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
bobbin here it gives me quite a lot of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.260 
bobbin here it gives me quite a lot of
working<00:01:33.869> room<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.979> you've<00:01:35.100> looked<00:01:36.000> this

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
working room and if you've looked this

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.450 
working room and if you've looked this
particular<00:01:36.840> hand<00:01:37.079> here<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.560> haven't<00:01:38.250> changed

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
particular hand here I haven't changed

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.840 
particular hand here I haven't changed
that<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.689> orientation<00:01:40.409> etc<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
that the orientation etc and you get a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.210 
that the orientation etc and you get a
nice<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.210> hackle<00:01:42.689> pattern<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
nice little hackle pattern there the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.719 
nice little hackle pattern there the
other<00:01:44.460> way<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.090> which<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.439> wrap<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.280> hackle

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
other way in which you can wrap a hackle

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.240 
other way in which you can wrap a hackle
feather<00:01:47.759> around<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.780> shank<00:01:49.049> again<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.829> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
feather around a shank again is if you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.300 
feather around a shank again is if you
have<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> nice<00:01:51.110> rotating<00:01:52.110> vise<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.950> mentioned

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
have a nice rotating vise as I mentioned

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.100 
have a nice rotating vise as I mentioned
in<00:01:53.399> some<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> other<00:01:53.909> videos<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.990> they

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
in some of the other videos then they

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.999 
in some of the other videos then they
think<00:01:55.350> about<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.640> use<00:01:58.009> hackle

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
think about this is you can use hackle

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.230 
think about this is you can use hackle
pliers<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:01.159> simply<00:02:02.210> rotate<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
pliers like this and simply rotate the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.050 
pliers like this and simply rotate the
hook<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.170> keep<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> hackle<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.579> position

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
hook and keep the hackle in position
