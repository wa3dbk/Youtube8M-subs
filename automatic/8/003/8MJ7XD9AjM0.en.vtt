three<00:01:55.110> symbols<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.820> define<00:01:57.240> basically

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
three symbols of that define basically

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.179 
three symbols of that define basically
the<00:01:57.899> activities<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.890> channel

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the activities that this channel

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.899 
the activities that this channel
revolves<00:01:59.640> around<00:01:59.759> which<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.020> pencil<00:02:01.909> guitar

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
revolves around which is a pencil guitar

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.530 
revolves around which is a pencil guitar
neck<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:04.799> controller<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.909> very<00:02:06.360> much

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
neck and a controller that very much

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.059 
neck and a controller that very much
resembles<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.170> classic<00:02:07.560> nintendo

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
resembles the classic nintendo

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.330 
resembles the classic nintendo
controller<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.729> everyone<00:02:09.090> knows<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:10.340> yeah

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
controller that everyone knows so yeah

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.520 
controller that everyone knows so yeah
just<00:02:11.970> go<00:02:12.510> explicit

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
just go explicit

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.830 
just go explicit
when<00:02:13.709> in<00:02:13.860> doubt<00:02:13.890> go<00:02:14.100> simple<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.660> was

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
when in doubt go simple and this was

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.490 
when in doubt go simple and this was
indeed<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.170> very<00:02:16.260> simple<00:02:16.860> idea<00:02:17.069> in<00:02:17.700> terms<00:02:17.910> of

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
indeed a very simple idea in terms of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.650 
indeed a very simple idea in terms of
conceptual<00:02:19.500> t<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.730> turned<00:02:20.940> out<00:02:21.060> okay<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
conceptual t but it turned out okay and

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.510 
conceptual t but it turned out okay and
and<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.110> client<00:02:22.830> loves<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.220> that's

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
and the the client loves it so that's

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.860 
and the the client loves it so that's
all<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> matters<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.569> think<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.840> looks

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
all it matters and I think it looks

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.350 
all it matters and I think it looks
pretty<00:02:25.020> cool<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.440> well<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.270> to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
pretty cool as well so this is going to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.150 
pretty cool as well so this is going to
be<00:02:27.450> placed<00:02:27.720> next<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.140> simple<00:02:28.560> text<00:02:28.800> of

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
be placed next to a simple text of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.630 
be placed next to a simple text of
course<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.700> still<00:02:30.209> have<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:31.370> develop<00:02:32.370> and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
course that I still have to develop and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.610 
course that I still have to develop and
come<00:02:32.790> up<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.600> for<00:02:33.840> now<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.020> thought<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
come up with but for now I thought the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.350 
come up with but for now I thought the
the<00:02:35.010> symbol<00:02:35.430> would<00:02:35.610> would<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.060> been<00:02:36.239> like

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
the symbol would would have been like

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.500 
the symbol would would have been like
the<00:02:36.540> most<00:02:37.250> interesting<00:02:38.250> part<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.090> why

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
the most interesting part of it so why

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.320 
the most interesting part of it so why
not<00:02:39.660> show<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.140> guys<00:02:40.290> what<00:02:40.500> that's<00:02:40.680> about<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:42.300> I

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
not show you guys what that's about so I

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.059 
not show you guys what that's about so I
started<00:02:42.660> off<00:02:42.810> with<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.319> sketch<00:02:43.590> obviously

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
started off with a sketch obviously

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.860 
started off with a sketch obviously
which<00:02:44.190> asked<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.520> an<00:02:44.670> illustrator<00:02:45.120> traits

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
which asked and an illustrator traits

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.509 
which asked and an illustrator traits
the<00:02:45.989> basic<00:02:46.350> shapes<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.769> Illustrator<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.280> then

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
the basic shapes in Illustrator and then

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.640 
the basic shapes in Illustrator and then
moved<00:02:47.760> everything<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.450> put<00:02:49.110> everything<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.590> a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
moved everything I put everything on a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.800 
moved everything I put everything on a
separate<00:02:49.950> layer<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.400> then<00:02:50.970> exported<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.630> as<00:02:51.780> a

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
separate layer and then exported it as a

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.199 
separate layer and then exported it as a
PSD<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.650> photoshop<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.580> can<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.940> whole

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
PSD and photoshop so I can do the whole

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.960 
PSD and photoshop so I can do the whole
shading<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.840> detailing<00:02:55.170> part<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.970> in

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
shading and detailing part of it and in

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.100 
shading and detailing part of it and in
the<00:02:57.030> end<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.300> guy<00:02:57.450> was<00:02:57.600> hyped<00:02:57.810> about<00:02:57.930> it

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
the end the guy was hyped about it

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.750 
the end the guy was hyped about it
because<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> looks<00:02:58.560> like<00:02:58.680> an<00:02:58.830> iOS<00:02:59.190> icon<00:02:59.580> which

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
because it looks like an iOS icon which

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.550 
because it looks like an iOS icon which
I<00:02:59.880> wasn't<00:03:00.060> really<00:03:00.330> going<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.110> begin<00:03:01.260> with

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
I wasn't really going for to begin with

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.220 
I wasn't really going for to begin with
but<00:03:02.100> yeah<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:03.300> true<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.660> does<00:03:03.930> kind<00:03:04.170> of

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
but yeah it's it's true it does kind of

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.100 
but yeah it's it's true it does kind of
look<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.590> bit<00:03:04.769> like<00:03:04.800> an<00:03:05.100> iOS<00:03:05.430> icon<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.209> if<00:03:06.900> he's

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
look a bit like an iOS icon so if he's

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.520 
look a bit like an iOS icon so if he's
happy<00:03:07.350> with<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.709> I'm<00:03:07.920> happy<00:03:07.950> with<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
happy with it I'm happy with it and the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.800 
happy with it I'm happy with it and the
whole<00:03:10.709> thing<00:03:10.920> took<00:03:11.069> about<00:03:11.310> half<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:12.180> day<00:03:12.330> more

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
whole thing took about half a day more

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.440 
whole thing took about half a day more
or<00:03:12.840> less<00:03:13.110> including<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:14.030> conceptual<00:03:15.030> stages

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
or less including the conceptual stages

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.120 
or less including the conceptual stages
I'd<00:03:15.870> only<00:03:16.050> know<00:03:16.290> what<00:03:16.440> else<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.739> could<00:03:16.800> come<00:03:17.100> up

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
I'd only know what else I could come up

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.920 
I'd only know what else I could come up
with<00:03:17.340> work<00:03:17.549> for<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.150> name<00:03:18.299> like<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.870> think

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
with work for a name like this I think

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.990 
with work for a name like this I think
probably<00:03:19.290> three<00:03:19.709> initials<00:03:20.160> with<00:03:20.400> some<00:03:20.640> barely

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
probably three initials with some barely

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.080 
probably three initials with some barely
minimal<00:03:21.390> symbolism<00:03:22.110> for<00:03:22.700> for<00:03:23.700> those<00:03:23.850> three

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
minimal symbolism for for those three

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.449 
minimal symbolism for for those three
areas<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.570> interest<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.650> prefer<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.190> do

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
areas of interest but I prefer to do

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.920 
areas of interest but I prefer to do
something<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.850> little<00:03:26.880> bit<00:03:27.090> more<00:03:27.299> complex<00:03:27.750> and

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
something a little bit more complex and

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.370 
something a little bit more complex and
detailed<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.590> plus<00:03:28.769> you<00:03:28.920> can<00:03:29.070> use<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.459> as<00:03:29.730> a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
detailed and plus you can use this as a

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.229 
detailed and plus you can use this as a
basically<00:03:31.380> icon<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.220> any<00:03:32.340> sort<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.790> online

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
basically icon in any sort of online

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.080 
basically icon in any sort of online
application<00:03:34.230> or<00:03:34.470> even<00:03:35.160> over<00:03:35.549> videos<00:03:35.880> and

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
application or even over videos and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.130 
application or even over videos and
whatever<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:37.170> works<00:03:37.380> it's<00:03:37.739> alright<00:03:39.140> other

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
whatever so it works it's alright other

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.949 
whatever so it works it's alright other
than<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.440> not<00:03:41.250> really<00:03:41.280> been<00:03:41.549> doing<00:03:41.610> much<00:03:41.959> TBH

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
than that not really been doing much TBH

so<00:05:10.370> hopefully<00:05:10.759> Czech<00:05:11.030> cuisine<00:05:11.270> doesn't<00:05:11.990> turn

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
so hopefully Czech cuisine doesn't turn

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
out to be one of those but here's hoping

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.790 
out to be one of those but here's hoping
and<00:05:15.940> other<00:05:16.940> than<00:05:17.000> that<00:05:17.150> not<00:05:17.780> much<00:05:17.810> I'm<00:05:18.620> afraid

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800
