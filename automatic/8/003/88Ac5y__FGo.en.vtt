00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
around for a while also early pool going

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.880 
around for a while also early pool going
up<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.369> 815<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.689> 815<00:01:36.990> i<00:01:37.380> think<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.770> was

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
up for 815 here so 815 i think that was

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980 
up for 815 here so 815 i think that was
an<00:01:38.009> over<00:01:38.310> pool<00:01:38.520> from<00:01:38.640> 0<00:01:38.790> 8<00:01:38.909> 15<00:01:39.240> he<00:01:39.720> could<00:01:39.900> be

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
an over pool from 0 8 15 he could be

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.480 
an over pool from 0 8 15 he could be
going<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.470> serving<00:01:40.890> rush<00:01:41.100> here<00:01:41.340> or

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
going for a little serving rush here or

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.920 
going for a little serving rush here or
perhaps<00:01:42.000> he's<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> get<00:01:42.869> some

also going for a second expansion now so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.920 
also going for a second expansion now so

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
playing a little bit close here he's

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.640 
playing a little bit close here he's
going<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.629> need<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.780> get<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.049> Canada<00:02:38.439> looks

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
going to need to get that Canada looks

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.530 
going to need to get that Canada looks
like<00:02:38.739> he<00:02:38.829> does<00:02:38.980> get<00:02:39.129> that<00:02:39.310> candidate<00:02:39.700> it's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
like he does get that candidate it's

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.940 
like he does get that candidate it's
warping<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:40.989> right<00:02:41.109> now<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.379> I<00:02:41.439> think<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.799> will

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
warping in right now so I think it will

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.399 
warping in right now so I think it will
get<00:02:42.129> there<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.430> time<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:43.180> stop<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.900> over<00:02:44.200> pool

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
get there in time to stop this over pool

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.619 
get there in time to stop this over pool
rush<00:02:44.560> here<00:02:44.879> and<00:02:45.879> look<00:02:45.970> at<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.180> it's<00:02:46.329> not<00:02:46.420> even

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
rush here and look at that it's not even

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.430 
rush here and look at that it's not even
a<00:02:46.659> real<00:02:46.720> rush<00:02:47.129> it<00:02:48.129> seems<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.810> 815<00:02:49.810> decided<00:02:50.290> to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
a real rush it seems that 815 decided to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.800 
a real rush it seems that 815 decided to
to<00:02:50.950> get<00:02:51.129> drones<00:02:51.489> instead<00:02:51.879> of<00:02:51.970> all<00:02:52.299> zergling<00:02:52.690> so

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
to get drones instead of all zergling so

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.509 
to get drones instead of all zergling so
just<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.139> zerglings<00:02:53.560> out<00:02:53.650> for<00:02:53.859> him<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.220> think

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
just to zerglings out for him I think

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.890 
just to zerglings out for him I think
he's<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:54.940> gonna<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.450> don't<00:02:55.540> know<00:02:55.690> what<00:02:55.780> he's

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
he's just gonna I don't know what he's

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.000 
he's just gonna I don't know what he's
doing<00:02:55.930> with<00:02:56.139> him<00:02:56.290> he<00:02:56.409> should<00:02:56.560> be<00:02:56.680> killing<00:02:56.859> it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010

cannon I don't think this is a wise idea
though<00:03:51.819> oh<00:03:52.000> wow<00:03:52.359> those<00:03:52.569> probes<00:03:52.870> are<00:03:53.019> getting

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
though oh wow those probes are getting

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.619 
though oh wow those probes are getting
the<00:03:53.409> weight<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.889> zerglings<00:03:54.159> and<00:03:54.549> yeah<00:03:55.419> 8

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
the weight of the zerglings and yeah 8

15<00:03:55.959> s<00:03:56.049> attack<00:03:56.260> totally<00:03:56.709> fails<00:03:56.919> there<00:03:57.159> so

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
15 s attack totally fails there so

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.399 
15 s attack totally fails there so
losing<00:03:57.819> his<00:03:58.030> first<00:03:58.239> couple<00:03:58.419> Ling's<00:03:58.930> there<00:03:59.169> it

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
losing his first couple Ling's there it

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.680 
losing his first couple Ling's there it
basically<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.340> waste<00:04:00.549> i<00:04:00.849> wonder<00:04:01.030> what<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.209> 15<00:04:01.569> was

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
basically a waste i wonder what a 15 was

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.750 
basically a waste i wonder what a 15 was
thinking<00:04:01.989> they're<00:04:02.139> usually<00:04:03.010> six<00:04:03.430> links

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
thinking they're usually six links

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.939 
thinking they're usually six links
against<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.780> well-placed<00:04:05.229> cannon<00:04:05.709> well

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
against the well-placed cannon well

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.740 
against the well-placed cannon well
basically<00:04:06.129> all<00:04:06.459> die<00:04:06.790> or<00:04:07.030> maybe<00:04:07.209> one<00:04:07.479> will<00:04:07.599> be

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
basically all die or maybe one will be

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.689 
basically all die or maybe one will be
left<00:04:07.780> after<00:04:08.169> killing<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.799> cannon<00:04:09.129> but

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
left after killing the cannon but

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:10.979 
left after killing the cannon but
especially<00:04:09.879> in<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.239> case<00:04:10.449> with<00:04:10.659> all<00:04:10.870> those

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
especially in that case with all those

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.990 
especially in that case with all those
probes<00:04:11.440> around<00:04:11.769> those<00:04:12.459> links<00:04:12.729> just<00:04:12.879> weren't

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
probes around those links just weren't

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.899 
probes around those links just weren't
able<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.269> get<00:04:13.419> anywhere<00:04:13.919> but<00:04:14.919> at<00:04:15.190> least<00:04:15.340> 8<00:04:15.609> 15

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
able to get anywhere but at least 8 15

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.960 
able to get anywhere but at least 8 15
has<00:04:16.150> gotten<00:04:16.510> his<00:04:16.659> two<00:04:17.229> expansions<00:04:17.799> up<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.250> he

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
has gotten his two expansions up and he

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.490 
has gotten his two expansions up and he
will<00:04:19.180> be<00:04:19.299> able<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.570> gain<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.840> little<00:04:20.169> bit<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.409> an

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
will be able to gain a little bit of an

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.129 
will be able to gain a little bit of an
advantage<00:04:20.650> from

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
advantage from

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.429 
advantage from
that<00:04:21.849> it's<00:04:22.849> not<00:04:22.909> a<00:04:22.999> bad<00:04:23.210> build<00:04:23.509> overall<00:04:24.080> but<00:04:24.409> I

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:24.439 
that it's not a bad build overall but I

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.140 
that it's not a bad build overall but I
think<00:04:24.889> one<00:04:25.069> problem<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.460> he<00:04:25.610> has<00:04:25.729> had<00:04:25.939> is

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
think one problem that he has had is

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.610 
think one problem that he has had is
that<00:04:26.330> he<00:04:26.539> hasn't<00:04:26.900> killed<00:04:27.199> that<00:04:27.379> scouting

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
that he hasn't killed that scouting

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.529 
that he hasn't killed that scouting
probe<00:04:27.919> inside<00:04:28.189> his<00:04:28.340> base<00:04:28.520> yet<00:04:28.759> and<00:04:28.939> if<00:04:29.449> he

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
probe inside his base yet and if he

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.269 
probe inside his base yet and if he
wants<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.840> go<00:04:30.020> for<00:04:30.229> further<00:04:30.800> attack<00:04:31.129> you

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:31.279 
wants to go for further attack you

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.010 
wants to go for further attack you
really<00:04:31.550> needs<00:04:31.729> to<00:04:31.789> do<00:04:31.909> that<00:04:32.090> or<00:04:32.300> or<00:04:32.659> trying<00:04:32.930> to

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
really needs to do that or or trying to

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.409 
really needs to do that or or trying to
do<00:04:33.139> something<00:04:33.289> sneaky<00:04:33.560> at<00:04:33.800> least<00:04:34.180> like<00:04:35.180> going

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
do something sneaky at least like going

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.059 
do something sneaky at least like going
for<00:04:35.569> a<00:04:35.599> sore<00:04:35.810> on<00:04:35.930> Zurich<00:04:36.169> build<00:04:36.349> also<00:04:36.650> requires

for a sore on Zurich build also requires

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.459 
for a sore on Zurich build also requires
in<00:04:37.520> some<00:04:37.729> ways<00:04:37.909> to<00:04:38.240> hide<00:04:38.659> that<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.289> seems

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:39.469 
in some ways to hide that and it seems

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:40.659 
in some ways to hide that and it seems

that he is going to go in for a fourth
pantry<00:04:41.180> very<00:04:41.449> early<00:04:41.749> on<00:04:41.779> so<00:04:42.349> it<00:04:42.469> looks<00:04:42.499> like<00:04:42.680> he

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
pantry very early on so it looks like he

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.959 
pantry very early on so it looks like he
isn't<00:04:42.979> going<00:04:43.249> for<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.460> store<00:04:43.669> and<00:04:43.759> build

probably<00:04:46.189> will<00:04:46.340> be<00:04:46.460> able<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.669> pick<00:04:46.759> off<00:04:46.909> his

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
probably will be able to pick off his

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.939 
probably will be able to pick off his
pronoun<00:04:47.449> and<00:04:47.659> I<00:04:47.990> don't<00:04:48.169> think<00:04:48.349> this<00:04:48.469> the

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
pronoun and I don't think this the

there although although he probably

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.990 
there although although he probably

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
and the spear retreating for some reason

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.689 
and the spear retreating for some reason
actually<00:05:03.710> thought<00:05:04.039> that<00:05:04.189> was<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.370> very<00:05:04.520> good

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
actually thought that was a very good

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.339 
actually thought that was a very good
push<00:05:04.909> there<00:05:04.939> but<00:05:05.629> seems<00:05:05.840> like<00:05:05.900> he's<00:05:06.110> going<00:05:06.289> to

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
push there but seems like he's going to

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.679 
push there but seems like he's going to
actually<00:05:06.529> retreat<00:05:06.979> back<00:05:07.069> to<00:05:07.159> his<00:05:07.370> base<00:05:07.689> and

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
actually retreat back to his base and

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.499 
actually retreat back to his base and
there<00:05:08.930> is<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.080> OG<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:09.919> Sparky's<00:05:10.279> team<00:05:10.509> taking

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.629 
wouldn't be going for the layer this
quickly<00:05:24.589> but<00:05:25.069> he<00:05:25.159> might<00:05:25.279> also<00:05:25.460> be

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
quickly but he might also be

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.219 
quickly but he might also be

and DTS I'll expect spear to go for a

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.790 
and DTS I'll expect spear to go for a
fairly<00:05:35.629> standard<00:05:35.900> build<00:05:36.259> here<00:05:36.409> going<00:05:36.620> for<00:05:36.770> a

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
fairly standard build here going for a

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.100 
fairly standard build here going for a
Stargate<00:05:37.189> probably<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:37.759> then<00:05:37.879> I<00:05:38.270> might<00:05:39.020> be

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
Stargate probably and then I might be

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.450 
Stargate probably and then I might be
switching<00:05:39.319> over<00:05:39.469> to<00:05:39.649> Templar<00:05:40.099> and<00:05:40.189> seems<00:05:40.370> that

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
switching over to Templar and seems that

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.010 
switching over to Templar and seems that
he<00:05:40.610> has<00:05:40.729> gotten<00:05:41.029> this<00:05:41.089> coarse<00:05:41.300> hair<00:05:41.479> out<00:05:41.629> and<00:05:41.810> I

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
he has gotten this coarse hair out and I

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.629 
he has gotten this coarse hair out and I
think<00:05:42.229> he<00:05:42.319> had<00:05:42.469> a<00:05:42.500> civil<00:05:42.919> going<00:05:43.129> up<00:05:43.219> inside<00:05:43.490> his

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
think he had a civil going up inside his

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.249 
think he had a civil going up inside his
base<00:05:43.789> so<00:05:44.330> he's<00:05:44.479> been<00:05:44.689> going<00:05:44.870> for<00:05:44.990> a<00:05:45.020> standard
