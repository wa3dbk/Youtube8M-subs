there are from a bit tricky to perform
real<00:01:02.520> life<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.030> give<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
real life but can I give a go with the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
real life but can I give a go with the
camera<00:01:03.840> unlock<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.430> kind<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.670> uses

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
camera unlock now so this kind of uses

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.460 
camera unlock now so this kind of uses
the<00:01:06.000> accelerometer<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.020> launch<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the accelerometer to kind of launch you

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350 
the accelerometer to kind of launch you
immediately<00:01:07.890> into<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> camera<00:01:08.640> hopefully

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
immediately into the camera hopefully

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.580 
immediately into the camera hopefully
speeding<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:09.720> when<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.020> really<00:01:10.320> want<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> take
