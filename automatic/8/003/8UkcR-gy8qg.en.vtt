00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
now let's see if the electric starter

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.030 
now let's see if the electric starter
work

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
work

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.530 
work
here's<00:03:31.030> your<00:03:31.210> Start<00:03:31.570> button<00:03:31.890> it's<00:03:32.890> on<00:03:33.540> how

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
here's your Start button it's on how

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.360 
here's your Start button it's on how
this<00:03:34.870> works

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.720 

okay<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.709> electric<00:03:43.010> start<00:03:43.250> works

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
okay in the electric start works

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.430 
okay in the electric start works
that's<00:03:44.300> what's<00:03:44.540> why<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.840> wanted<00:03:45.050> to<00:03:45.110> get<00:03:45.260> a<00:03:45.290> new
