00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
yeah Crixus control versus grixis twin I

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.740 
yeah Crixus control versus grixis twin I
imagine<00:00:14.610> post<00:00:14.820> board<00:00:15.120> they're<00:00:15.299> both<00:00:15.480> just

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
imagine post board they're both just

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.380 
imagine post board they're both just
grixis<00:00:16.139> control<00:00:16.590> for<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> most<00:00:17.250> part<00:00:17.490> um<00:00:17.820> yeah

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
grixis control for the most part um yeah

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
grixis control for the most part um yeah
I<00:00:18.449> think<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> little<00:00:18.840> bit<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.230> better

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
I think is a little bit of a better

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.689 
I think is a little bit of a better
matchup<00:00:19.590> than<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.039> Dylan<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.460> he's<00:00:20.580> just

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
matchup than for Dylan because he's just

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.120 
matchup than for Dylan because he's just
not<00:00:20.850> playing<00:00:21.270> as<00:00:21.449> many<00:00:21.630> ex<00:00:21.900> arcs<00:00:22.199> yeah<00:00:22.800> she<00:00:22.949> has
