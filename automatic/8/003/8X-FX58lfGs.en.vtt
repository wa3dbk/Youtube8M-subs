00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
can do that as well and also very

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.770 
can do that as well and also very
cleverly<00:01:21.330> they've<00:01:21.570> included<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.080> media<00:01:22.409> player

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
application is free although you know

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.520 
application is free although you know
it'd<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.210> an<00:01:36.299> interesting<00:01:36.509> way<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.930> raise

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
it'd be an interesting way to raise

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.530 
it'd be an interesting way to raise
funds<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.070> suppose<00:01:38.400> if<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> wasn't<00:01:39.060> free<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
funds I suppose if it wasn't free and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.630 
funds I suppose if it wasn't free and
then<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.020> also<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.290> an<00:01:40.500> issues<00:01:40.860> point<00:01:41.280> here

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
then you also have an issues point here

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.999 
then you also have an issues point here
we<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.210> go<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.689> look<00:01:43.140> at<00:01:43.320> stances<00:01:43.890> on

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
we can go in and look at stances on

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.830 
we can go in and look at stances on
various<00:01:44.369> issues<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.090> suppose<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.630> would

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
various issues and I suppose this would

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.749 
various issues and I suppose this would
