00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
my career wrestle so far we're in the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.360 
my career wrestle so far we're in the
wrestlebacks<00:01:08.270> in<00:01:08.690> further<00:01:09.140> than<00:01:09.350> third<00:01:10.220> and

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
wrestlebacks in further than third and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.100 
wrestlebacks in further than third and
fourth<00:01:10.550> then<00:01:10.850> see<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.120> final<00:01:11.660> descent<00:01:11.870> if<00:01:11.990> I

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
fourth then see a final descent if I

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.840 
fourth then see a final descent if I
could<00:01:12.320> arrest<00:01:12.530> like<00:01:12.830> that<00:01:13.010> in<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.160> semis<00:01:13.550> I

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
could arrest like that in the semis I

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.160 
could arrest like that in the semis I
feel<00:01:15.190> like<00:01:16.190> my<00:01:16.340> match<00:01:16.520> with<00:01:16.760> Stephen<00:01:17.210> would

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
feel like my match with Stephen would

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.750 
feel like my match with Stephen would
have<00:01:18.290> been<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.500> different<00:01:18.650> outcome<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.550> I<00:01:19.580> just

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
have been a different outcome so I just

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.890 
have been a different outcome so I just
need<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.910> go<00:01:20.030> out<00:01:20.120> with<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.300> same<00:01:20.480> attitude

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
need to go out with the same attitude

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.260 
need to go out with the same attitude
that<00:01:21.080> I<00:01:21.110> did<00:01:21.290> in<00:01:21.320> those<00:01:21.470> two<00:01:21.710> matches<00:01:25.270> probably

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
that I did in those two matches probably
