00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.880
 and 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.679
 it falls from the sky quite bad all the 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.710
 people around the world see a rematch 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.349
 he compensated well all the country queues for 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.879
 global day the troops of his 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.640
 majesty not those of the rich italy are not 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.920
 for the whole year ends with the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.920
 answer for me 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.530
 i 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.719
 rhinoscopy 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.979
 well we are with luciano leiva veedor 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.200
 non of the category a2 of the lid below 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.259
 german good face better a very match 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.630
 good 3 to 0 to goleada tell me how it was 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.340
 how did you see the game 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.720
 as as formative and good the party 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.189
 it's how we usually play them 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.289
 we who bet on speed 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.869
 I hope we have up as usual 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.939
 the rivals and good today we were given three 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.380
 times in the best sports of 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.259
 much level those above if indeed 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.720
 they break the last game you saw it was a 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.520
 golazo graphic but generally the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.039
 team bets these 40 against and is what 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.869
 what better comes out to us thought that I was going to 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.479
 be much easier besides to weigh 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.830
 from 3 to 0 with a goal at the first minute 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.509
 They thought that it will be much easier 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.429
 but it gets a little complicated so 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.860
 less in the first time if he is capable 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.090
 that when dressing a goal so fast one does not 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.890
 he knows if he will continue to attack and follow 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.659
 putting goals or expect it we enter 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.119
 the doubt and that's why they started to handle us 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.399
 the game but from the second goal 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.539
 the team was already more calm is 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.550
 something that has been happening throughout the tournament 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.020
 this me so 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.210
 It is a checking account and services 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.730
 well, very little you do 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.580
 they promoted what it is like to start playing in 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.650
 the a-2 this should the rise thought that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.230
 It would be more complicated as such was 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.390
 start playing on the 2 yes good when 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.130
 we attended we said good we are going to 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.320
 enter a hard category of truth 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.730
 where teams play football and do not 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.450
 we were wrong because all the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.790
 matches cost us 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.010
 but the mind our time out 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.209
 champions do not maintain the category and 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.800
 nothing of that is to leave champions because 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.660
 This is the easiest way to get 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.310
 points if I have the mentality of being me 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.660
 winning and I will be winning I think that is 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.950
 the correct way we are having and 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.590
 good luckily it 's full very well 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.380
 well we are now with Augustin been 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.420
 dortmund goleador good second goal 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.700
 exists in the game the second one wins 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.280
 tell me how you saw this game this 3 a 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.959
 0 to goal already and not the time we had 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.549
 lucky we started in the first 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.890
 minute with the goal of Diego Tuscan one 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.299
 of the stages but players and nothing and 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.739
 he opened the game for them and we 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.780
 They came to look and good as us 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.549
 as smaller otherwise 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.230
 we are lucky and in the second time 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.670
 seize and go against and so 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.500
 we can kill the second and the third goal 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.209
 at some point they thought that they were going 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.980
 to complicate a bit especially in the 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.310
 first time I was pretty stuck in 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.540
 the medium and I could not honestly have 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.799
 entered the ball but we 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.780
 we trust our defenders a lot 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.700
 We knew that they will be able to take it out and good 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.500
 they will play the ball for half of 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.730
 court and as I said came out against 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.310
 by loose of his followers 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.680
 The third goal was a good goal all 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.170
 they stay there expectantly watching and not 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.520
 they could believe it 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.810
 the technical director had told us that 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.700
 the archer of them was ahead and 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.150
 well you put half of the court 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.519
 lautaro raised his head forward 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.319
 and now they are going to celebrate what they do 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.569
 now and now good is left during the 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.709
 week of triumph and think for the end 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.670
 next week that follows 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.340

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.739

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.739
