00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
those extra ends now how can we make

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.010 
those extra ends now how can we make
this<00:02:31.860> more<00:02:32.250> stable<00:02:32.760> first<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.690> all<00:02:33.810> we're

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
this more stable first of all we're

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.870 
this more stable first of all we're
going<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.230> cut<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.770> half<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.700> little

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
going to cut it in half so it's a little

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.720 
going to cut it in half so it's a little
bit<00:02:36.000> easier<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.750> manage<00:02:37.020> again<00:02:37.920> fingers<00:02:38.370> hands

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
bit easier to manage again fingers hands

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.390 
bit easier to manage again fingers hands

grip right up close slice it in half how

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.360 
grip right up close slice it in half how
can<00:02:45.840> we<00:02:45.960> break<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.290> down<00:02:46.410> further<00:02:46.770> so<00:02:47.340> that

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
can we break it down further so that

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.640 
can we break it down further so that
it's<00:02:47.610> easier<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.210> deal<00:02:48.420> with<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:49.200> want<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.470> nice
