00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 but people my name is khan and yes 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.319
 still nice weather outside and 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.200
 no plan so that's now 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.200
 I have only some gameplay on it 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.759
 alarm but that is a gameplay clip 90 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.379
 reach his step from Luke 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.779
 Actually I'm only ever doing gameplay 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.750
 I'll unfortunately fail that 90.6 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.789
 i even believe a recording yes 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.699
 the last ubs so europas played 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.720
 Yes, but that's not the point 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.630
 that too because of yeah recently 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.600
 I describe today events 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.719
 Something that excites me to players yes 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.700
 acquire various game strategies 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.789
 and piss me off so much is there 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.260
 Yes , I just wanted to do that now 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.329
 bring I'm sure many of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.469
 you look the same 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.300
 and yes I just wanted it 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.520
 describe to quasi to illustrate 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.750
 what I like what I do not like what I like 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.250
 guess what I can not do at all 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.870
 and yes, it really does relate 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.430
 the player so I'm talking even 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.390
 not about community people but 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.610
 i'm talking about players in general and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.380
 yes so I do not do it all now 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.700
 I draw directly from 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.960
 Do you have any more at the end ? 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.909
 Classes, I'll also one 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.409
 but say something for the first time to mine 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.119
 so worried 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.159
 I was there no lobby in there and yes 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.259
 why does the game away and no 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.829
 Somehow, everything is fine, too 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.960
 I still think to accept 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.490
 and yes, that was pretty cool 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.250
 I was just like that at a tenth 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.140
 killstreak and yes I was just killed 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.729
 that's not the problem me 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.990
 my strengths belongs to the ego-shooter 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.030
 to or not yes the problem was 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.729
 just like my opponent played 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.000
 that was this whole game system 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.590
 consisted of the grenade launcher of the chart 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.649
 Track and 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.329
 yes the 300 friend grenade fire and so 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.770
 i really wonder why gamer peace 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.259
 to make the chart technique I mean 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.659
 people you see that the weapon totally 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.269
 it is used by almost every little one 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.310
 already practiced meanwhile that is 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.830
 totally many people only use it or that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.879
 is kind of like a joker 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.120
 or how so wet and ska that is easy 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.680
 yes just a bit handicapped so 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.450
 it's just like somebody 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.040
 somehow in the nutshell comes in 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.569
 any situation attac has the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.010
 City does not cover out to go forward 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.430
 and tbc is playing there 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.530
 I believe Chinese complaints and yes 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.780
 So he had a sixth kg in the beginning 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.160
 then I come in then he has 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.250
 to be complied with yes okay me 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.569
 had a threesome happy though 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.720
 let's let that happen but suddenly 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.010
 boy also has to play 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.299
 and yes, otherwise I would just be rough 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.430
 Put people if you are one 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.810
 weapon plays then why stay there 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.310
 then you have to open this always directly 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.980
 choice rausholen if I do not play 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.019
 update 3 playstation from now on 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.790
 managed that again more than last 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.680
 Used weapons is what I have 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.450
 somehow not done but me 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.310
 still say that it is the first one 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.569
 just something to play all the time 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.329
 and then grenade launcher and before 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.069
 a grenade is so important and may 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.389
 beautiful opponents get upset 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.889
 yes and that's just one of them 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.650
 Game strategy that people with dolls 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.060
 weapons game that was the same with emc 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.470
 I recently had to celebrate a really 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.880
 with six die and apps get standard 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.650
 many people still combine 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.260
 play because you're just on the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.440
 piste dirt is where I meanwhile 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.440
 have to say that the z in six too 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.519
 somehow I became extremely good 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.109
 I do not want to know if he wants to say it 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.319
 because I already had enough in the 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.579
 community harvested but 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.950
 I personally carry this weapon 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.409
 already a bit too 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.129
 just for the reason that I'm using it 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.019
 my 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.609
 tz four partly no longer tear 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.049
 Just because people are with you 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.310
 Two shots were fired and somehow 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:06.730
 shit is what you want to do what you like 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.010
 gameloft and yahoo four packets 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.049
 of course I have two 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.950
 So today I was busy 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.570
 on the whole time only dirt play 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.799
 that's just not like the game 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.900
 actually thought that I am 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.579
 somehow my challenge if you 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.190
 the whole statik plays is not this 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.720
 usually given 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.680
 I think that's how it is 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.789
 actually pretty standard crm 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.930
 but well, there are still several 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.770
 other strategy pretty much me 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.900
 hang up then ok tracks had weapons 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.669
 I already do 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.190
 then we come to fight now so 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.979
 I also have some in this game play 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.380
 I have to say camper 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.550
 And yes, that's just what I have personally 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.229
 it is not that excited 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.849
 extremely like in a gameplay what me 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.310
 I think I must have taken up 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.870
 was clearly the same merck and 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.810
 go again on the side where I 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.800
 here just rest and yes that was 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.039
 everything is a bit funny 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.650
 Provide my opponent was not there and 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.610
 then yes, I'll just shoot the six 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.530
 into the war for now 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.270
 and yes at the beginning so at the beginning I had 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.259
 I think a combination where you can not 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.970
 so much 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.620
 anna and in there has times at the end 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.870
 I just played 16 then just 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.250
 just because it's never been so went the other 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.830
 people were all sitting there behind 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.530
 have not got behind the car either 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.479
 really done a lot except stop it 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.080
 to shoot goals as one came over 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:38.889
 and that's what it was 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.550
 I did not do any more and he is 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.680
 I pretty much 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.820
 yes that irritated me so me 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:49.790
 do something like that people I mean for 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.980
 Two seconds sitting somewhere is ok 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.530
 but I see more and more people now 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.000
 just sitting so I do not know 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.010
 maybe it works on the run 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.510
 Do not have button over here in 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.250
 scream shredded and can only 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.020
 use the touch on one side 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.780
 no plan but they move up 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.550
 In any case, no longer so the look 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.020
 but then at least sit around 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.640
 always do it in the same place and 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.140
 that's kind of a point of me 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.460
 crass upset oh so vibrate in 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.250
 background of the robert holzer 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.490
 join in that's only incidentally but that 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.810
 you can see that too unsafe 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.280
 yes something like the game first time to end 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.840
 I do not know how she misses that but 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.070
 that 's just a couple of little bags 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.110
 to muster the strength I have a few more 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.750
 more but first to my classes 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.010
 So you see now I am level 90 34 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.900
 been to two 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:48.770
 Oh yes, now that's the game blabla 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:50.450
 boring the connected 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.380
 yes I saw fast internet 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:57.830
 So yes that's my statistic me 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:02.210
 have the first week is just always four 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:04.700
 automatic skate 44 internet and kr 600 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:08.780
 Send that to my class today or yes 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.590
 I had a b-eleven of 8.8 38's 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.620
 actually quite nice 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.630
 kg of 422 already said that's it now 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:18.610
 and I hope I liked it until the 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.610
 next time taboo nice day yet
