00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
some grease can get over here in the

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.570 
some grease can get over here in the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
back however pretty easy to take it out

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.450 
back however pretty easy to take it out
this<00:01:16.030> case<00:01:16.330> that's<00:01:16.540> barely<00:01:17.200> num<00:01:17.620> bulk<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.340> it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
this case that's barely num bulk to it

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.730 
this case that's barely num bulk to it
and<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:19.390> cutouts<00:01:19.720> do<00:01:20.110> great<00:01:20.350> they're<00:01:20.560> not

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
and the cutouts do great they're not

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.410 
and the cutouts do great they're not
using<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.159> plastic<00:01:21.610> on<00:01:21.729> top<00:01:21.760> of<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.180> so<00:01:22.210> i

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
using the plastic on top of it so i

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.960 
using the plastic on top of it so i
really<00:01:23.110> like<00:01:23.440> that<00:01:23.680> because<00:01:24.190> you<00:01:24.430> have<00:01:24.550> direct

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
really like that because you have direct

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.060 
really like that because you have direct
access<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.540> phone<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.440> surface<00:01:26.830> case

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
access to a phone so the surface case

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.610 
access to a phone so the surface case
over<00:01:27.370> here<00:01:27.610> it's<00:01:28.090> compatible<00:01:28.570> with<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.080> convert

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
over here it's compatible with a convert

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.100 
over here it's compatible with a convert
combo<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:30.820> if<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.150> already<00:01:31.270> have<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:31.780> case

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
combo so if you already have this case

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.560 
combo so if you already have this case
and<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.770> want<00:01:32.979> extra<00:01:33.280> safety<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:34.180> can<00:01:34.420> go

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
and you want extra safety you can go

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.600 
and you want extra safety you can go
ahead<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:34.930> order<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.620> combo<00:01:36.070> which<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.430> an

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
ahead and order the combo which is an

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.030 
ahead and order the combo which is an
additional<00:01:37.299> two<00:01:37.540> additional<00:01:38.020> layers<00:01:38.470> for<00:01:38.950> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
additional two additional layers for the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.980 
additional two additional layers for the
case<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.670> back<00:01:39.909> part<00:01:40.180> as<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.390> can<00:01:40.600> see<00:01:40.810> the

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
case the back part as you can see the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.800 
case the back part as you can see the
camera<00:01:41.260> is<00:01:41.440> really<00:01:41.710> flush<00:01:41.979> into<00:01:42.460> it<00:01:42.580> and<00:01:42.760> if<00:01:43.150> it

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
camera is really flush into it and if it

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.630 
camera is really flush into it and if it
looks<00:01:44.080> really<00:01:44.320> in<00:01:44.590> as<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.890> can<00:01:45.040> see<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.369> bump

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
looks really in as you can see the bump

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.340 
looks really in as you can see the bump

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
times with my credit card it's pretty

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.520 
times with my credit card it's pretty
fair<00:01:54.940> it's<00:01:55.119> pretty<00:01:55.390> simple<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:56.049> that<00:01:56.080> is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
fair it's pretty simple and that is

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.200 
fair it's pretty simple and that is
something<00:01:56.890> good<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.310> taps<00:01:57.549> are<00:01:57.700> stronger

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
something good the taps are stronger

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.080 
something good the taps are stronger
