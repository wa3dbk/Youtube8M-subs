there's<00:01:45.170> our<00:01:45.410> assembly<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.400> then<00:01:46.580> we<00:01:46.700> open

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
there's our assembly and then we open

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.780 
there's our assembly and then we open
our<00:01:47.530> new<00:01:50.050> ink<00:01:51.050> roller<00:01:54.460> sometimes<00:01:55.460> it's<00:01:55.640> good

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
our new ink roller sometimes it's good
