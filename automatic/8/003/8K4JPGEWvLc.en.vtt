I'm on Jennifer corn bleeds mailing list

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.069 
I'm on Jennifer corn bleeds mailing list
and<00:00:34.079> she<00:00:34.680> sends<00:00:35.129> an<00:00:35.940> email<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.450> every<00:00:36.840> week

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
so this week she had a recipe for pasta

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.259 
so this week she had a recipe for pasta
avocado<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.020> I'm<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.409> to<00:00:43.499> try<00:00:43.679> it<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> you

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
avocado and I'm going to try it so you

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:51.259 
avocado and I'm going to try it so you
need<00:00:45.629> 2<00:00:46.339> medium<00:00:48.199> zucchinis<00:00:49.199> and<00:00:50.059> you<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.179> to

need 2 medium zucchinis and you have to
peel<00:00:51.480> them<00:00:51.690> first<00:00:51.719> before<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.469> use<00:00:52.679> them<00:00:52.859> so

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.029 

it's<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.519> take<00:00:56.609> my<00:00:56.760> dealer<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
it's going to take my dealer here and

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.719 
it's going to take my dealer here and
he'll<00:00:59.039> zucchini

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.940 

so<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.360> zucchini<00:01:05.719> is<00:01:05.899> peeled<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.649> for<00:01:06.829> this

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
so the zucchini is peeled and for this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.730 
so the zucchini is peeled and for this
recipe<00:01:07.399> you<00:01:07.820> need<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:07.969> spiralizer<00:01:08.509> I<00:01:08.899> use<00:01:09.530> this

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
recipe you need a spiralizer I use this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.580 
recipe you need a spiralizer I use this
style<00:01:09.979> spiralizer<00:01:10.640> where<00:01:11.479> you<00:01:11.659> put<00:01:12.289> the<00:01:12.409> food

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
style spiralizer where you put the food

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.520 
style spiralizer where you put the food
right<00:01:12.860> here<00:01:13.189> you<00:01:13.610> twist<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.149> this<00:01:14.299> way<00:01:14.530> there's

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
right here you twist it this way there's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.319 
right here you twist it this way there's
another<00:01:15.590> spiralizer<00:01:16.310> where<00:01:16.789> it's<00:01:16.909> vertical

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
another spiralizer where it's vertical

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.200 
another spiralizer where it's vertical
and<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:17.539> twist<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:17.929> down<00:01:18.610> both<00:01:19.610> work<00:01:19.880> pretty

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
and you twist it down both work pretty

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.669 
and you twist it down both work pretty
well<00:01:21.009> so<00:01:22.009> what<00:01:22.220> I'm<00:01:22.280> going<00:01:22.369> to<00:01:22.429> do<00:01:22.579> is<00:01:23.560> cut<00:01:24.560> the

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
well so what I'm going to do is cut the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.510 
well so what I'm going to do is cut the
ends<00:01:24.979> off<00:01:25.069> of<00:01:26.170> limited<00:01:27.170> zucchinis<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:28.250> make<00:01:28.399> it

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
ends off of limited zucchinis to make it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.429 
ends off of limited zucchinis to make it
flat<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:31.210> whip<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:32.329> in<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.539> spiralizer<00:01:32.990> and

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
flat and whip it in a spiralizer and

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.789 
flat and whip it in a spiralizer and
spiralize<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.689> this<00:01:35.689> spiralizer<00:01:36.170> has<00:01:36.500> suction

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
spiralize it this spiralizer has suction

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.529 
spiralize it this spiralizer has suction
cups<00:01:37.130> on<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.310> bottom<00:01:37.459> so<00:01:37.819> you<00:01:37.909> can<00:01:37.939> section<00:01:38.390> to

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
cups on the bottom so you can section to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.179 
cups on the bottom so you can section to
the<00:01:38.630> table<00:01:38.959> so<00:01:39.110> it<00:01:39.170> doesn't<00:01:39.439> move<00:01:39.560> as<00:01:40.159> much<00:01:40.399> and

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
the table so it doesn't move as much and

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.109 
the table so it doesn't move as much and
you<00:01:43.189> take<00:01:43.399> physicaiiy

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
you take physicaiiy

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.870 
you take physicaiiy
and<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:46.299> put<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:48.380> right<00:01:48.619> here<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:49.489> stick<00:01:49.700> them

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
and you put it right here and stick them

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.839 
and you put it right here and stick them
on<00:01:49.970> there<00:01:50.179> and<00:01:50.390> then<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.599> press<00:01:50.810> this<00:01:51.049> into<00:01:51.409> it

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:51.849 
on there and then you press this into it

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.229 
on there and then you press this into it
and<00:01:52.849> then<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.899> magic<00:01:54.289> happens

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:55.239 
and then the magic happens

00:01:55.239 --> 00:02:02.289 
and then the magic happens
just<00:01:56.239> spiralize<00:01:56.810> it<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.149> wrong

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
just spiralize it and that is the wrong

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.539 
just spiralize it and that is the wrong
blade<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.439> I'm<00:02:03.770> going<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.039> change<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.369> blade

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
blade so I'm going to change the blade

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.210 
blade so I'm going to change the blade
real<00:02:04.759> quick<00:02:05.829> it<00:02:06.829> comes<00:02:07.009> with<00:02:07.189> different

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
real quick it comes with different

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.550 
real quick it comes with different
blades<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:08.269> blade<00:02:08.599> made<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:08.989> look<00:02:09.139> like<00:02:09.289> this

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
blades that blade made it look like this

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.129 
blades that blade made it look like this
that's<00:02:09.859> not<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.130> one<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.280> want<00:02:10.579> so<00:02:11.049> I'm<00:02:12.049> going

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:12.139 
that's not the one I want so I'm going

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:18.129 
that's not the one I want so I'm going
to<00:02:12.500> change<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.100> blades<00:02:13.280> real<00:02:13.459> quick<00:02:17.139> okay

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.139 
to change the blades real quick okay

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.479 
to change the blades real quick okay
let's<00:02:18.380> see<00:02:18.500> if<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.859> the<00:02:18.950> right<00:02:19.069> one<00:02:19.310> it's

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
let's see if this is the right one it's

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.390 
alrighty then so that one is done I'm
gonna<00:03:12.280> put<00:03:12.550> that<00:03:12.700> in<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.880> bowl<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:18.190> that's

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
gonna put that in the bowl and that's

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.150 
gonna put that in the bowl and that's
what<00:03:18.580> we<00:03:18.700> have<00:03:18.850> so<00:03:18.880> far<00:03:19.680> if<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.830> don't<00:03:20.980> have<00:03:21.130> a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
what we have so far if you don't have a

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.760 
what we have so far if you don't have a
spiralizer<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:22.030> can<00:03:22.210> use<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.780> peeler<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.560> just

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
spiralizer you can use a peeler to just

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.330 
spiralizer you can use a peeler to just
peel<00:03:24.220> long<00:03:24.520> strips<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.300> it's<00:03:25.450> like<00:03:25.570> fettuccine

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
peel long strips so it's like fettuccine

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.740 
peel long strips so it's like fettuccine
but<00:03:27.340> ideally<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.970> want<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.150> use<00:03:28.210> a<00:03:28.300> spiralizer

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
but ideally you want to use a spiralizer

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.170 
but ideally you want to use a spiralizer
with<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.230> recipe<00:03:29.760> anyway<00:03:30.760> I'm<00:03:31.000> going<00:03:31.090> to
