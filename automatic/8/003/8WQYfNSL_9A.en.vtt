00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
sitting on top of it but we have hazama

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.110 
sitting on top of it but we have hazama
that<00:00:31.380> basically<00:00:31.920> he<00:00:32.219> know<00:00:32.399> gives<00:00:32.759> us<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
history of the series pretty much

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.670 
history of the series pretty much
because<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.880> learned<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.510> he<00:00:36.780> actually<00:00:37.079> is

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
because we learned that he actually is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.590 
because we learned that he actually is
the<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.399> had<00:00:38.610> made<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.090> black<00:00:39.270> beast

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the one that had made the black beast

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.100

or<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> first<00:00:48.809> prime<00:00:49.170> field<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.670> was<00:00:50.879> able

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
or the first prime field and it was able

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.770 
or the first prime field and it was able
to<00:00:51.510> obtain<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.260> power<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.100> eye<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.780> made

it the first observer of the world and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.200 
it the first observer of the world and
so<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> humans<00:00:59.070> decided<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.879> they

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
so when the humans decided that they

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.910 
so when the humans decided that they
would<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.480> want<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.750> use<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.230> power<00:01:01.559> for

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
would they want to use the power for

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.700 
would they want to use the power for

know<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.590> pretty<00:01:55.770> interesting<00:01:56.310> how<00:01:56.850> he's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
know but pretty interesting how he's

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.080 
know but pretty interesting how he's
definitely<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.600> wasting<00:01:58.229> time<00:01:58.700> but<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.880> have

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
definitely not wasting time but we have

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.020 
definitely not wasting time but we have
hazama<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> Robin<00:02:01.290> bogna<00:02:01.740> they're<00:02:02.490> fighting

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
hazama and Robin bogna they're fighting

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
hazama and Robin bogna they're fighting
and<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.780> definitely<00:02:04.020> seemed<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.009> know

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
and it definitely seemed to go you know

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.520 
and it definitely seemed to go you know
a<00:02:05.189> lot<00:02:05.579> quicker<00:02:05.880> they<00:02:06.719> never<00:02:06.899> call<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.259> mean

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
a lot quicker they never call I mean

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.380 
a lot quicker they never call I mean
yeah<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.429> different<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.179> game

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
yeah I know it's different in the game

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.500 
yeah I know it's different in the game
obviously<00:02:09.950> but<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.160> me<00:02:11.340> ho-8<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.000> felt<00:02:12.239> like

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
obviously but to me ho-8 it felt like

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.340 
obviously but to me ho-8 it felt like
there

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
there

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.020 
there
you<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.950> went<00:02:14.130> by<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> little<00:02:14.700> too<00:02:14.790> quickly

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
you know it went by a little too quickly

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.150 
you know it went by a little too quickly
I<00:02:15.390> would<00:02:15.840> definitely<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:17.130> were

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
I would definitely like if they were

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.040 
I would definitely like if they were
spread<00:02:17.610> out<00:02:17.790> more<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.300> may<00:02:18.420> look<00:02:18.630> at<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
spread out more and may look at you and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.770 
spread out more and may look at you and
did<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.800> know<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> lot<00:02:20.250> more<00:02:20.280> because

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
did it you know a lot more because

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.990 
did it you know a lot more because
Ragnar<00:02:21.780> has<00:02:21.900> all<00:02:22.080> these<00:02:22.260> moves<00:02:22.820> disposal<00:02:23.820> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
Ragnar has all these moves disposal and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.480 
Ragnar has all these moves disposal and
soulless<00:02:24.390> hazama<00:02:24.870> was<00:02:25.740> we<00:02:25.860> actually<00:02:26.010> seeking

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
soulless hazama was we actually seeking

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.580 
soulless hazama was we actually seeking
a<00:02:26.730> few<00:02:27.000> interesting<00:02:27.510> ones<00:02:27.540> because<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.350> see

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
a few interesting ones because we see

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.800 
a few interesting ones because we see
that<00:02:28.890> not<00:02:29.250> only<00:02:29.490> does<00:02:29.850> his<00:02:30.030> or<00:02:30.180> broil<00:02:30.450> change

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
that not only does his or broil change

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.050 
that not only does his or broil change
for<00:02:31.560> being<00:02:31.740> like<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.950> regular<00:02:32.280> snake<00:02:32.730> Hill<00:02:32.940> on

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
for being like a regular snake Hill on

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.840 
for being like a regular snake Hill on
the<00:02:33.090> chain<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:34.260> actually<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.830> know<00:02:35.010> he<00:02:35.640> took

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
the chain but actually you know he took

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.280 
the chain but actually you know he took
the<00:02:36.000> form<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.300> an<00:02:36.450> actual<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.930> know<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> real

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
the form of an actual you know a real

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.200 
the form of an actual you know a real
lucky<00:02:37.560> snake<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.850> right<00:02:39.000> there<00:02:39.060> that's

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
lucky snake and that right there that's

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.480 
lucky snake and that right there that's
pretty<00:02:39.570> cool<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.050> then<00:02:40.770> we<00:02:40.890> have<00:02:41.040> kokonoe

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
pretty cool and then we have kokonoe

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.700 
pretty cool and then we have kokonoe
working<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.240> shadows<00:02:42.690> where<00:02:43.380> she<00:02:43.620> has

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
working in the shadows where she has

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.240 
working in the shadows where she has
some<00:02:43.740> atlanta<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:45.090> attack<00:02:45.570> hazama<00:02:46.230> when<00:02:47.100> she

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
some atlanta to attack hazama when she

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.190 
some atlanta to attack hazama when she
had<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> chance<00:02:47.670> because<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.150> only<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.720> one

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
had a chance because you only have one

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.620 
had a chance because you only have one
time<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:49.890> but<00:02:50.700> when<00:02:51.300> she<00:02:51.450> probably

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
time to do this but when she probably

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.020 
time to do this but when she probably
moves<00:02:51.930> into<00:02:52.110> action<00:02:52.560> she<00:02:53.220> actually<00:02:53.400> takes<00:02:53.880> a

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
moves into action she actually takes a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.020 
moves into action she actually takes a
hit<00:02:54.240> for<00:02:54.570> Ragna<00:02:55.460> mahasamund<00:02:56.460> doesn't<00:02:56.880> hold

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
hit for Ragna mahasamund doesn't hold

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.880 
hit for Ragna mahasamund doesn't hold
back<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.510> he<00:02:57.630> actually<00:02:57.870> ends<00:02:58.230> up<00:02:58.290> killing<00:02:58.620> her

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
back and he actually ends up killing her

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.090 
back and he actually ends up killing her
because<00:02:59.730> we<00:02:59.970> like<00:03:00.270> even<00:03:00.780> though<00:03:00.990> they<00:03:01.770> they

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
because we like even though they they

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.190 
because we like even though they they
kind<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.400> sent<00:03:02.640> her<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> somewhat<00:03:03.360> by<00:03:03.600> making<00:03:04.110> it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
kind of sent her a somewhat by making it

all red and black you can see that the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.330 
all red and black you can see that the
huggable<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.290> know<00:03:07.410> definitely<00:03:07.770> went<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.220> for

huggable you know definitely went in for
the<00:03:08.400> kill<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.320> know<00:03:10.560> while<00:03:11.130> she<00:03:11.340> would
