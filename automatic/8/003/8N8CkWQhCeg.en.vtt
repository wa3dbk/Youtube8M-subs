00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.880
 convert to evening makeup with 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.900
 just a few small vasic to be 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.030

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.340
 own far country we put a touch 1 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.210
 discern on the eyelid and a mobile 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.250
 the area of dark circles leaves falls 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.590
 gently with a sponge to succeed 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.660
 a natural rendering that in the meantime I 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.920
 advise you in textures for it 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.329
 is easier and faster to 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.800
 retouching is a fluid 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.989
 I like the profile of young michael 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.760
 forever because it's enough cover everything 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.839
 by staying natural we apply to 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.219
 using a small brush 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.049
 once the time after in 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.850
 applying bright enough light on 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:50.559
 the eyelid bad if we choose a 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.329
 neutral color like this one the 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.489
 makeup to be transformed more 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.019
 easily to melt the color with 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.559
 the skin is faded edges slightly 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.559
 one finger 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.699
 then henri gourgeon the eyelashes is 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.440
 very important and well work them 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.340
 as he sleeps rebel lines in the morning 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.340
 until late evening 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.010
 but mascara by insisting on their 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.010
 roots 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.020
 and also the lafam the lay to succeed in 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.880
 fan effect we do not forget the touch 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.479
 on the lower lashes to open well 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.740
 in their respect we choose a pretty blush 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.960
 pigmented for a long time 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.670
 like that will not have to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.039
 touch up later we apply as 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.450
 usually no more intensity we do not want 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:42.100
 especially not to look too much made up 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:48.159
 on the lips a rose or a 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.780
 mint are perfect for the day and 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.780
 here we are ready to go to 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.770
 high school in college or at work 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.149
 now we will transform the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.560
 makeup to go in the evening 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.909
 you will see that we did not need 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.190
 great things the first things 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.200
 is golden touched the bottom of time I 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.179

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.950

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.899
 the cabinet of the month of October it is 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.670
 really perfect for the bag it has a 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.390
 little sponge that can be used to 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.390
 do their touch 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.370
 then we apply in gold form on the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.230
 bottom of the eye from half towards 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.700
 the outside of the eyelid by doing 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.209
 be careful not to touch too much 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.530
 styles not that they deteriorate but 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.000
 also on the end of the eyelid 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.310
 lower so that the whole end of 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.170
 the aij is charbonneau to blur the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.580
 edges one removes the excess of iron with a 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.700
 handkerchief so you can use 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:43.739
 still not even care so she has 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.450
 look more evening we fill everything 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.020
 the inside with a very black pencil 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.820
 intense 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.680
 this one i do not like so much that he is 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.870
 already very small it really needs that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.400
 I'm going to buy a new one 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.689
 to illuminate the makeup we put 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.599
 some points of light in 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:04.480
 applying it and under eyebrows on the 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:09.390
 nose without getting to the slope on the 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.390
 center of the lips on the cheekbone 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.269
 and on the lips 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.690
 to finish a touch of gloss I use 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.850
 the one that comes with the eyeshadow 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.290
 to see her with me like that 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:31.270
 saves space and now we're done 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.130
