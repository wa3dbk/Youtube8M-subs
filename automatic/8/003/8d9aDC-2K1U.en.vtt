during bloom and you get the nice you
know<00:01:27.659> mild<00:01:27.960> summers<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.250> from<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.640> growing

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
know mild summers so from a growing

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.490 
know mild summers so from a growing
perspective<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.409> know

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
perspective and this is you know

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.870 
perspective and this is you know
essentially<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> breadbasket<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> world

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
essentially the breadbasket of the world

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.999 
essentially the breadbasket of the world
and<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> reason<00:01:33.780> prunes<00:01:34.320> grow<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.710> well<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and the reason prunes grow so well is

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
and the reason prunes grow so well is
mainly<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.720> constant<00:01:36.720> sunlight

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
mainly because of constant sunlight

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
mainly because of constant sunlight
during<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> growing<00:01:37.860> season<00:01:37.950> which<00:01:38.610> allows

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
during the growing season which allows

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.020 
during the growing season which allows
you<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.530> turn<00:01:40.530> sunlight<00:01:40.890> into<00:01:41.040> photosynthesis

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you to turn sunlight into photosynthesis

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.030 
you to turn sunlight into photosynthesis
which<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.509> turn<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.110> turned<00:01:43.320> into<00:01:43.470> nutrition

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
which in turn is turned into nutrition

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.130 
which in turn is turned into nutrition
