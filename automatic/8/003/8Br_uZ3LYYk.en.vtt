interesting thing to me and that's why I
decided<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.000> make<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.300> video<00:00:24.480> about<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
decided to make this video about it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.420 
decided to make this video about it
because<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.350> not<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.769> many<00:00:25.920> people<00:00:26.070> have

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
because it's not that many people have

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.670 
because it's not that many people have
yet<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.660> video<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> will<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.410> over

were doing so be sure to check those out
now<00:00:49.980> getting<00:00:50.280> into<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.579> similarities

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
now getting into the similarities

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.200 
now getting into the similarities
between<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.600> 360<00:00:52.170> slim<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> 360<00:00:53.280> II<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
between the 360 slim and the 360 II the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.209 
between the 360 slim and the 360 II the
first<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> hard<00:00:55.379> drive<00:00:55.649> can

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
first one is that the hard drive can

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.520 
first one is that the hard drive can
carry<00:00:56.520> either<00:00:56.760> 4<00:00:57.120> gigabytes<00:00:57.600> or<00:00:57.840> 250

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
carry either 4 gigabytes or 250

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
carry either 4 gigabytes or 250
gigabytes<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.219> we've<00:00:59.820> already<00:01:00.000> seen<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.449> in

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
gigabytes and we've already seen this in

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
gigabytes and we've already seen this in
the<00:01:00.629> past<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:01.140> pretty<00:01:01.350> much<00:01:01.469> every<00:01:01.770> 360<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the past was pretty much every 360 is

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.660 
the past was pretty much every 360 is
that<00:01:03.420> these<00:01:03.750> are<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> two<00:01:04.229> general<00:01:04.799> storage

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that these are the two general storage

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.510 
that these are the two general storage
amounts<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.360> Xbox<00:01:07.080> 360<00:01:07.290> hard<00:01:07.770> drives<00:01:08.040> so

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
amounts for Xbox 360 hard drives so

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
amounts for Xbox 360 hard drives so
nothing<00:01:08.820> has<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:08.939> changed<00:01:09.119> there<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
nothing has really changed there the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
nothing has really changed there the
second<00:01:10.890> thing<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> similarity<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
second thing that is a similarity is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
second thing that is a similarity is
that<00:01:12.420> there's<00:01:13.350> internal<00:01:13.799> Wi-Fi<00:01:14.220> capability

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that there's internal Wi-Fi capability

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.670 
that there's internal Wi-Fi capability
and<00:01:15.090> what<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.630> means<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.500> don't

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and what that means is that you don't

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
and what that means is that you don't
have<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.009> buy<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.460> network<00:01:17.820> adapter<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.540> connect

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
have to buy a network adapter to connect

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.469 
have to buy a network adapter to connect
to<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> internet<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.310> E<00:01:20.340> or<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> slim<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
to the internet on the E or the slim and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.719 
to the internet on the E or the slim and
that's<00:01:22.049> not<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> new<00:01:22.710> thing<00:01:22.740> either<00:01:23.220> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that's not really a new thing either so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
that's not really a new thing either so
nothing's<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.240> changed<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
nothing's really changed there the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.679 
nothing's really changed there the
design<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> optical<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:26.880> disk<00:01:27.150> drive<00:01:27.420> is

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
design of the optical or disk drive is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.690 
design of the optical or disk drive is
exactly<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> same<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> E<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.549> on

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
exactly the same on the E as it is on

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.609 
exactly the same on the E as it is on
the<00:01:29.790> s<00:01:29.939> nothing<00:01:30.810> has<00:01:31.079> changed<00:01:31.409> there

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
the s nothing has changed there

that's<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.920> pretty<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.250> thing<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.670> gamers

where it starts to get a little bit more
technical<00:02:28.359> so<00:02:28.510> for<00:02:28.689> those<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.049> who<00:02:29.260> are

lot of technical terms just hang in

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.069 
lot of technical terms just hang in
there<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.609> will<00:02:34.150> be<00:02:34.180> sure<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.569> summarize

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
there I will be sure to summarize

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.229 
there I will be sure to summarize
everything<00:02:35.530> directly<00:02:35.920> after<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.549> now

everything directly after this now

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.030 
everything directly after this now
getting<00:02:37.510> into<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.780> differences<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.859> back

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
getting into the differences the back

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.069 
getting into the differences the back
side<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.579> e<00:02:39.609> model<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.420> lot<00:02:40.750> cleaner

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
side of the e model is a lot cleaner

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.800 
side of the e model is a lot cleaner
it's<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.889> lot<00:02:42.040> more<00:02:42.220> simple<00:02:42.670> they<00:02:43.239> remove<00:02:43.569> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
it's a lot more simple they remove the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.759 
it's a lot more simple they remove the
AV<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.889> s/pdif<00:02:45.579> ports<00:02:46.359> and<00:02:46.599> replaced<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.739> with

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
AV and s/pdif ports and replaced it with

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.129 
AV and s/pdif ports and replaced it with
one<00:02:48.040> single<00:02:48.430> composite<00:02:48.760> out<00:02:49.090> Jack<00:02:49.450> which

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
one single composite out Jack which

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.720 
one single composite out Jack which
makes<00:02:50.409> it<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:50.799> that<00:02:50.920> way<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.189> a<00:02:51.220> lot<00:02:51.370> easier

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
makes it so that way it's a lot easier

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.759 
makes it so that way it's a lot easier
to<00:02:51.819> understand<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.510> lot<00:02:52.689> less<00:02:52.870> complicated<00:02:53.260> and

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
to understand a lot less complicated and

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.399 
to understand a lot less complicated and
overall<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.430> lot<00:02:54.730> easier<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.269> use<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:55.989> maintain

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
overall a lot easier to use and maintain

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.740 
overall a lot easier to use and maintain
now<00:02:57.310> another<00:02:57.939> thing<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.269> they've<00:02:58.510> changed

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
now another thing that they've changed

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.379 
now another thing that they've changed
with<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.439> E<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.829> that<00:02:59.889> the<00:03:00.159> front<00:03:00.430> buttons<00:03:00.819> aka

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
eject button were to break you could

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.890 
eject button were to break you could
easily<00:03:15.819> go<00:03:16.120> buy<00:03:16.269> another<00:03:16.299> one<00:03:16.629> of<00:03:16.780> those

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
easily go buy another one of those

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.379 
easily go buy another one of those
panels<00:03:17.139> and<00:03:17.500> simply<00:03:18.280> replace<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.879> rather<00:03:19.120> than

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
panels and simply replace it rather than

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.240 
panels and simply replace it rather than
going<00:03:20.260> through<00:03:20.379> the<00:03:20.560> process<00:03:20.979> of<00:03:21.099> fixing

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
going through the process of fixing

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.129 
going through the process of fixing
everything<00:03:21.729> else<00:03:21.909> with<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:23.049> that's

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
everything else with it so that's

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.740 
everything else with it so that's
another<00:03:23.409> cool<00:03:23.680> feature<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.459> they've<00:03:24.579> added

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
another cool feature that they've added

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.439 
another cool feature that they've added
now<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:26.620> two<00:03:26.799> last<00:03:27.129> differences<00:03:28.000> are<00:03:28.239> ones

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.449 
now the two last differences are ones

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.180 
now the two last differences are ones
that<00:03:28.569> really<00:03:28.840> change<00:03:29.199> it<00:03:29.349> around<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.709> lot<00:03:29.919> make

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
that really change it around a lot make

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.180 
that really change it around a lot make
it<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.370> lot<00:03:30.519> better<00:03:30.879> for<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:32.290> reputation<00:03:32.590> on

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
it a lot better for the reputation on

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.699 
it a lot better for the reputation on
the<00:03:33.459> e<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:34.690> change<00:03:34.989> is<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.379> they're<00:03:35.560> using

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
the e one change is that they're using

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.800 
the e one change is that they're using
cards<00:03:36.129> and<00:03:36.280> connectors<00:03:36.729> instead<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.389> cables

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
cards and connectors instead of cables

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.319 
cards and connectors instead of cables
on<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.079> inside<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.620> e<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:39.729> way<00:03:39.940> it's

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
on the inside of the e so that way it's

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.569 
on the inside of the e so that way it's
a<00:03:40.510> lot<00:03:40.629> easier<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.319> fix<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:42.010> if<00:03:42.159> something<00:03:42.370> on

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
a lot easier to fix it if something on

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.670 
a lot easier to fix it if something on
the<00:03:42.669> inside<00:03:42.819> happens<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.810> that's<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.530> pretty

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
the inside happens and that's a pretty

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.289 
the inside happens and that's a pretty
nice<00:03:44.889> thing<00:03:45.129> for<00:03:45.159> average<00:03:45.639> users<00:03:45.970> because

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
nice thing for average users because

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.640 
nice thing for average users because
they<00:03:46.419> don't<00:03:46.569> want<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.810> higher<00:03:46.989> professional

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
they don't want a higher professional

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.640 
they don't want a higher professional
and<00:03:47.859> that's<00:03:48.639> where<00:03:48.819> this<00:03:48.879> next<00:03:49.150> part<00:03:49.359> comes<00:03:49.540> in

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
and that's where this next part comes in

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.140 
and that's where this next part comes in
the<00:03:50.650> different<00:03:50.979> design<00:03:51.280> on<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.639> e<00:03:51.669> model

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
the different design on the e model

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.879 
the different design on the e model
makes<00:03:52.659> it<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.810> lot<00:03:52.959> easier<00:03:53.409> to<00:03:53.440> replace

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
makes it a lot easier to replace

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.059 
makes it a lot easier to replace
individual<00:03:54.549> parts<00:03:54.909> like<00:03:55.569> fans<00:03:56.019> drives<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
individual parts like fans drives the

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.849 
individual parts like fans drives the
button<00:03:57.370> board<00:03:57.549> heatsink<00:03:58.389> Wi-Fi<00:03:59.139> card<00:03:59.439> all<00:03:59.739> of

button board heatsink Wi-Fi card all of

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.259 
button board heatsink Wi-Fi card all of
that<00:04:00.010> stuff<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.519> can<00:04:00.549> easily<00:04:00.909> replace

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
that stuff you can easily replace

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.780 
that stuff you can easily replace
individually<00:04:02.079> instead<00:04:02.889> of<00:04:02.979> having<00:04:03.129> to<00:04:03.340> buy<00:04:03.489> a

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.710 
two changes make it an all-new console
almost<00:05:22.810> even<00:05:23.620> though<00:05:23.650> it<00:05:23.830> really<00:05:23.979> isn't<00:05:24.250> so

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
almost even though it really isn't so

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.540 
almost even though it really isn't so
that's<00:05:25.720> pretty<00:05:25.900> much<00:05:26.020> all<00:05:26.229> there<00:05:26.410> is<00:05:26.550> whenever

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
that's pretty much all there is whenever

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.890 
that's pretty much all there is whenever
it<00:05:27.699> comes<00:05:27.849> to<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.150> similarities<00:05:28.690> differences

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
it comes to the similarities differences

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.180 
it comes to the similarities differences
and<00:05:29.940> all<00:05:30.940> of<00:05:31.270> that<00:05:31.300> my<00:05:32.229> personal<00:05:32.620> thoughts<00:05:32.919> is

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
and all of that my personal thoughts is

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.920 
and all of that my personal thoughts is
I<00:05:33.639> think<00:05:33.820> it's<00:05:33.940> a<00:05:34.000> really<00:05:34.210> great<00:05:34.330> improvement

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
I think it's a really great improvement

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.960 
I think it's a really great improvement
I<00:05:35.080> don't<00:05:35.500> think<00:05:35.680> it's<00:05:35.800> a<00:05:35.860> game<00:05:36.099> changer<00:05:36.130> per<00:05:36.760> se

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
I don't think it's a game changer per se

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.180 
I don't think it's a game changer per se
but<00:05:37.479> I<00:05:37.539> do<00:05:37.599> think<00:05:37.960> that<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.410> helps<00:05:38.710> a<00:05:38.800> lot<00:05:38.949> and

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
but I do think that it helps a lot and

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.150 
but I do think that it helps a lot and
