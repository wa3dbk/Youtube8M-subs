hundred percent factory unlocked so from

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.420 
hundred percent factory unlocked so from
first<00:05:25.910> impressions<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:27.190> would<00:05:28.190> say<00:05:28.310> the

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
first impressions I would say the

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.490 
first impressions I would say the
lightest<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:29.600> most<00:05:29.810> comfortable<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:32.500> can't

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
lightest the most comfortable and can't

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.110 
lightest the most comfortable and can't
really<00:05:33.620> say<00:05:33.860> how<00:05:33.890> well<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.370> user<00:05:34.580> screen<00:05:34.910> says

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
really say how well the user screen says

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.090 
really say how well the user screen says
but<00:05:35.330> given<00:05:35.600> its<00:05:35.660> an<00:05:35.840> iPad<00:05:36.170> it<00:05:36.410> will<00:05:36.950> be

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
but given its an iPad it will be

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.670 
but given its an iPad it will be
definitely<00:05:37.310> one<00:05:38.180> of<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.360> best<00:05:38.680> tablet

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
definitely one of the best tablet

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.970 
definitely one of the best tablet
experiences<00:05:40.190> so<00:05:41.140> it's<00:05:42.140> got<00:05:42.320> everything<00:05:42.560> here

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
experiences so it's got everything here

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.040 
experiences so it's got everything here
it's<00:05:43.130> got<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.370> iOS<00:05:43.760> 7<00:05:44.240> I<00:05:46.840> don't<00:05:47.840> know<00:05:47.900> what

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
it's got the iOS 7 I don't know what

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.650 
it's got the iOS 7 I don't know what
else<00:05:48.290> Apple<00:05:48.890> updated<00:05:49.040> but<00:05:49.550> besides<00:05:50.300> like<00:05:50.480> I

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
else Apple updated but besides like I

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.780 
else Apple updated but besides like I
think<00:05:50.870> that<00:05:50.990> maybe<00:05:51.320> had<00:05:51.670> added<00:05:52.670> another

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
think that maybe had added another

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.910 
think that maybe had added another
optics<00:05:53.300> probably<00:05:54.110> like<00:05:54.200> a<00:05:54.290> better<00:05:54.470> lens<00:05:54.740> or

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
optics probably like a better lens or

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.430 
optics probably like a better lens or
something<00:05:55.220> but<00:05:56.210> overall<00:05:56.450> they<00:05:56.720> did<00:05:56.900> add<00:05:57.140> a<00:05:57.170> lot

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
something but overall they did add a lot

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.830 
something but overall they did add a lot
of<00:05:57.560> improvements<00:05:58.040> the<00:05:58.100> a7<00:05:58.580> chip<00:05:58.610> as<00:05:59.150> you<00:05:59.660> can

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
because the plastic is still on so I

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.550

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
it's got the radio built in and then you

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:34.980 
it's got the radio built in and then you
do<00:06:27.280> have<00:06:27.310> the<00:06:27.580> maps<00:06:28.440> and<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:34.240> clock<00:06:34.540> is<00:06:34.750> live

Fields<00:06:35.800> looks<00:06:36.340> pretty<00:06:36.580> good<00:06:36.760> on<00:06:36.820> the<00:06:37.270> iPad<00:06:37.630> and

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
Fields looks pretty good on the iPad and

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.740 
Fields looks pretty good on the iPad and
overall<00:06:39.100> just<00:06:39.850> as<00:06:40.000> you<00:06:40.150> expect<00:06:40.600> the

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
overall just as you expect the

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.300 
overall just as you expect the
experience<00:06:41.230> and<00:06:41.380> overall<00:06:41.620> it's<00:06:41.980> gonna<00:06:42.130> be

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
experience and overall it's gonna be

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.340 
experience and overall it's gonna be
great<00:06:42.520> and<00:06:42.790> another<00:06:43.720> thing<00:06:43.870> I<00:06:43.930> wanted<00:06:44.140> to<00:06:44.230> add

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
great and another thing I wanted to add

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.600 
great and another thing I wanted to add
is<00:06:44.500> that<00:06:44.530> Apple<00:06:44.920> did<00:06:45.040> have<00:06:45.160> stereo<00:06:45.580> speakers

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
is that Apple did have stereo speakers

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.320 
is that Apple did have stereo speakers
to<00:06:46.180> this<00:06:46.330> so<00:06:46.960> compared<00:06:47.410> to<00:06:47.470> the<00:06:47.590> iPad<00:06:48.040> for<00:06:48.340> iPad

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
to this so compared to the iPad for iPad

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.260 
to this so compared to the iPad for iPad
3<00:06:49.600> 2<00:06:49.990> in<00:06:50.200> the<00:06:50.290> first<00:06:50.560> they<00:06:51.490> did<00:06:51.670> not<00:06:51.760> have<00:06:52.030> the

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
3 2 in the first they did not have the

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.670 
3 2 in the first they did not have the
stereo<00:06:52.750> speakers<00:06:53.170> so<00:06:53.350> this<00:06:53.500> one<00:06:53.650> should

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
stereo speakers so this one should

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.470 
stereo speakers so this one should
definitely<00:06:54.340> sound<00:06:54.550> a<00:06:54.640> lot<00:06:54.790> better<00:06:54.850> than<00:06:55.360> the

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.480 
definitely sound a lot better than the

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.390 
definitely sound a lot better than the
old<00:06:55.510> ones

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
old ones

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.370 
old ones
and<00:06:57.400> I<00:06:57.700> think<00:06:57.760> that's<00:06:58.090> really<00:06:58.300> about<00:06:58.630> it<00:06:58.690> as

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
and I think that's really about it as

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.320 
and I think that's really about it as
for<00:06:59.710> the<00:06:59.800> box<00:07:00.040> comes<00:07:00.730> with<00:07:00.820> the<00:07:01.000> minimal

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
for the box comes with the minimal

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.070 
for the box comes with the minimal
things<00:07:01.360> you<00:07:01.720> have<00:07:01.900> your<00:07:02.550> lightning<00:07:03.550> cable

things you have your lightning cable

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.660 
things you have your lightning cable
