color which is a really light pale
yellow<00:04:56.729> color<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.389> I<00:04:57.960> just<00:04:58.139> blended<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:58.560> into

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
yellow color and I just blended it into

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.340 
yellow color and I just blended it into
my<00:04:58.860> crease<00:04:59.160> for<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.430> transition<00:04:59.850> color<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.660> does

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
my crease for a transition color it does

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.040 
my crease for a transition color it does
apply<00:05:01.650> very<00:05:02.370> creamy<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.330> it<00:05:03.540> blends<00:05:03.810> really

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
apply very creamy and it blends really

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.900 
apply very creamy and it blends really
well<00:05:04.199> obviously<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:05.040> can't<00:05:05.280> see<00:05:05.460> this<00:05:05.610> color

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
well obviously you can't see this color

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.510 
well obviously you can't see this color
as<00:05:06.270> prominently<00:05:07.139> because<00:05:07.530> it<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:07.800> very<00:05:08.070> close

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
as prominently because it is very close

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.430 
as prominently because it is very close
to<00:05:08.550> my<00:05:08.760> skin<00:05:08.790> color<00:05:09.180> but<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:09.930> just<00:05:10.110> wanted<00:05:10.350> to

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
to my skin color but I just wanted to

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.310 
to my skin color but I just wanted to
have<00:05:10.590> something<00:05:10.860> there<00:05:11.160> for<00:05:11.550> transition<00:05:12.360> so<00:05:13.260> I

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
have something there for transition so I

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.159 
have something there for transition so I
applied<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:13.770> with<00:05:13.949> just<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.250> fluffy<00:05:14.639> brush

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
applied that with just a fluffy brush

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.360 
applied that with just a fluffy brush
you<00:05:16.169> could<00:05:16.320> use<00:05:16.440> any<00:05:16.620> brush<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.100> apply<00:05:17.130> this

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
you could use any brush to apply this

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.370 
you could use any brush to apply this
because<00:05:17.940> I'm<00:05:18.090> applying<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.690> product<00:05:18.930> dry<00:05:19.350> I

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
because I'm applying the product dry I

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.040 
because I'm applying the product dry I
didn't<00:05:19.919> use<00:05:20.220> any<00:05:20.910> fixed<00:05:21.240> bus<00:05:21.419> or<00:05:21.630> anything<00:05:21.930> to

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
make this more pigmented and then to

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.580 
make this more pigmented and then to
apply<00:05:26.070> all<00:05:26.370> over<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.760> lid<00:05:27.000> I<00:05:27.300> use<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.350> color

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
you would definitely be able to

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.480 
you would definitely be able to
intensify<00:05:51.389> this<00:05:51.539> color<00:05:51.930> so<00:05:52.349> much<00:05:52.530> more<00:05:52.830> by

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490

just wanted to do a very soft natural I
today<00:05:59.520> so<00:06:00.210> I<00:06:00.660> thought<00:06:00.720> it<00:06:01.080> blended<00:06:01.500> excellent

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
today so I thought it blended excellent

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.850 
today so I thought it blended excellent
into<00:06:02.849> the<00:06:03.060> crease<00:06:03.300> color<00:06:03.630> and<00:06:03.990> I<00:06:04.470> was<00:06:04.620> really

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
into the crease color and I was really

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.810 
into the crease color and I was really
happy<00:06:05.010> with<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.430> way<00:06:05.550> that<00:06:05.760> it<00:06:05.910> applied<00:06:10.820> and

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
happy with the way that it applied and

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.529 
happy with the way that it applied and
then<00:06:12.690> to<00:06:13.139> put<00:06:13.620> in<00:06:13.770> my<00:06:13.919> outer<00:06:14.130> V<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.820> increase

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
then to put in my outer V to increase

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.320 
then to put in my outer V to increase
the<00:06:15.690> dimension<00:06:16.289> I<00:06:16.500> use<00:06:17.099> a<00:06:17.130> color<00:06:17.520> fierce<00:06:17.940> and<00:06:18.270> I

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
the dimension I use a color fierce and I

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.450 
the dimension I use a color fierce and I
didn't<00:06:18.570> realize<00:06:19.080> at<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.380> time<00:06:19.470> that<00:06:19.710> this<00:06:20.190> was

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
didn't realize at the time that this was

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.719 
didn't realize at the time that this was
a<00:06:20.490> concealer<00:06:21.180> color<00:06:21.560> um<00:06:22.560> but<00:06:23.010> to<00:06:23.190> me<00:06:23.340> I<00:06:23.370> mean

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
a concealer color um but to me I mean

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.820 
a concealer color um but to me I mean
all<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:24.060> powders<00:06:24.419> just<00:06:24.630> look<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:24.930> same<00:06:25.139> it<00:06:25.530> is

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
all the powders just look the same it is

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.129 
all the powders just look the same it is
a<00:06:25.860> it's<00:06:26.610> a<00:06:26.729> very<00:06:26.880> Dirk<00:06:27.120> concealer<00:06:27.599> obviously

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
a it's a very Dirk concealer obviously

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.710 
a it's a very Dirk concealer obviously
not<00:06:28.320> for<00:06:28.530> my<00:06:28.620> skin<00:06:28.889> tone<00:06:29.070> anyway<00:06:29.550> but<00:06:30.150> it

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
not for my skin tone anyway but it

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.060 
not for my skin tone anyway but it
definitely<00:06:30.960> doubled<00:06:31.440> over<00:06:31.620> as<00:06:31.800> an<00:06:31.919> eyeshadow

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
definitely doubled over as an eyeshadow

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.939 
definitely doubled over as an eyeshadow
so<00:06:33.060> it's<00:06:33.270> like<00:06:33.449> a<00:06:33.479> like<00:06:34.289> a<00:06:34.320> chocolate<00:06:34.740> brown

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
so it's like a like a chocolate brown

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:37.129 
so it's like a like a chocolate brown
color<00:06:35.250> so<00:06:36.000> I<00:06:36.030> applied<00:06:36.300> that<00:06:36.510> in<00:06:36.630> the<00:06:36.720> outer<00:06:36.900> V

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
color so I applied that in the outer V

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:45.250 
color so I applied that in the outer V
and<00:06:37.410> that<00:06:37.530> blended<00:06:37.949> beautifully<00:06:38.070> as<00:06:38.610> well<00:06:44.120> so

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
and that blended beautifully as well so

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.050 
and that blended beautifully as well so
here's<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:45.590> final<00:06:45.740> look<00:06:46.010> again<00:06:46.220> very<00:06:46.490> natural

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060
