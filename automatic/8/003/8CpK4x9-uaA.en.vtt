 God bless you bye bye as always 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.670
 we are going to apply a pre base of shadows 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.340
 and then we're going to take a shadow of 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.020
 light color with its yellow tone for 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.270
 illuminate the brow bone with a 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.580
 small brush and we will distribute the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.820
 color until you click after 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.250
 let's take a shade matte orange 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.750
 average as our transition color and 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.240
 we are going to apply it from the basin 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.020
 of the eye and we will amplify it 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.380
 or blur 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.030
 to the outside of the mobile eyelid 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.000
 perfectly then let's take a 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.460
 reddish shade also matte and we're going to 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.530
 put but this time closer to the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.659
 Eyeball fold justly 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.890
 where the fold our little eye 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.350
 double there we will apply 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.149
 intensely and we will blur it with 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.969
 the orange zone after here I am 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.090
 taking a healing bandit so that 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.189
 keep me straight and clean 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.189
 you can use a tape tape 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.840
 anyone will serve them and then I'll go 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.700
 to take an eyeliner pencil color 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.280
 creamy black enough to outline the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.899
 Upper lashes do not have to be 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.929
 perfect this line because we're going to 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.399
 Blur with a pretty loose brush 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.489
 up so that it stays 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.760
 perfectly and distribute the color that 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.989
 It looks very diffuse 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.860
 and then there 's this tonality we're going to 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.720
 seal remarcar and intensify both 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.540
 as we want with a shade of color 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.010
 black we will blur it as much as 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.810
 we want but this will serve us the 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.599
 Bandit so that we will not go to 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.709
 another side removing the bandit you 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.230
 you can see that they have a line 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.739
 perfectly straight towards the tip of the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.569
 eyebrow and then we return to mix two 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.260
 shades both the reddish one and a change 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.930
 dark in the small conical bevel for 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.810
 be able to mark and give more depth to the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.389
 to the vertex of the eye where the color black 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.220
 and our folds and board and we're going to 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.530
 blur more this nothing else is to give 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.200
 more depth later I'm coming back 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.840
 to take the dark brown area with 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.030
 a small brush to mark the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.730
 bottom lashes nothing else is so that 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.340
 do not get lost in the look and but I'm going to 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.549
 chop enough layers of mask 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.950
 tabs down and a few little ones up and 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.769
 Well, this is the result for the eyes 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.550
 they are very striking this look is left 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.910
 as well 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.580
 Their eyelids are drooping because this 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.900
 outlined is achieved perfectly see 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.000
 from any angle with the eyes 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.710
 open and closed so what can 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.590
 take advantage of you girls who have 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.360
 requested both a delineated for this 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.570
 type of eyes 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.220

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.110

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.980
 lighting and control of the face and in 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.030

 colour 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.830
 previous to the labial so that I neutralize 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.260
