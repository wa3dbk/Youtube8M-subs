00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.250
 good afternoon today we will consider 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.920
 syndrome acoustics of gnostic aphasia 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.000
 This form of aphasia was first discovered. 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.410
 and described 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.019
 German psychoneurologist Carl Wernicke 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.689
 further study its engaged in such 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.450
 Russian scientists as an academic 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.510
 Alexander Romanovich Sea Professor 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.129
 Esfir Solomonovna Bay 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.910
 Professor Tatyana Grigorievna Visa and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.399
 other specialists 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.649
 acoustics of gnostic aphasia 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.020
 occurs when the back third is affected 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.170
 superior temporal gyrus and left 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.110
 hemisphere corresponding twenty 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.570
 the second field of poprad mana so-called 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.390
 Wernicke zone 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.010
 secondary divisions and succulent bark also 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.129
 there is an opinion 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.390
 Professor Evgeny Davydov and boorish that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.350
 human defeat is localized in the zone 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:18.270
 covering both 22 field and adjacent 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.110
 42 and 41 the field of voice data well pragma 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.150
 violation 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.360
 lies in the decay of a complex 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.810
 fanatical language system which 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.850
 the norm 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.810
 provides clear entertainment 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.869
 individual sounds 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.740
 and in pathological conditions it creates 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.250
 the difficulties of the process of sound entertainment 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.540
 the sound of the word 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.600
 terrace its constancy stability 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.250
 therefore difficulties arise 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.790
 differentiated perception of individual 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.939
 sounds 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.240
 it carries a central defect acoustics 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.770
 gnostic aphasia impaired understanding 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.100
 speech today most 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.320
 researchers 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.009
 considering the flow structure 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.750
 speech perception having 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.340
 multi-level construction in common 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.560
 psychologically 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.209
 as analysis through synthesis as a result 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.030
 there are two levels of recognition 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.209
 verbal material 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.250
 sensorimotor or linguistic and 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.349
 semantic level 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.160
 impaired speech understanding with phonics 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.360
 gnostic aphasia due to 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.760
 damage to the most simple 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.010
 Organization of linguistic level 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.410
 clinical manifestations of the syndrome 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.239
 conclude first violation 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.120
 subject related words 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.630
 due to decay the sound structure in 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.239
 second in violation of the word in 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.470
 third in reducing the level of verbal 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.190
 generalizations consider in more detail 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.980
 clinical picture 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.040
 of this speech syndrome at different 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.920
 degrees of gravity with a rough degree 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.380
 severity is observed rude judgment 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.239
 the meaning of the word 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.650
 spontaneous speech changed by type 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.830
 verbal salad 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.390
 what is manifested verbal elite oral 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.620
 a couple of them phase and bark harry and chris middle 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.920
 severity 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.600
 understanding of the situational 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.579
 speeches 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.970
 however when naming reps 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.190
 word comprehension errors are observed 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.870
 replacing sounds based on their 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.989
 acoustic proximity 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.329
 with mild severity in patients 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.280
 there are difficulties perceiving the furious 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.930
 so texts 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.620
 found elements of alienation meaning 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.750
 sensitized words 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.230
 there is some florid eat like 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.299
 delicious so in writing for 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.690
 restore speech thinking in 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.769
 Boris let him in the gnostic phase and 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.970
 need to work following 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.739
 directions with gross severity 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.650
 start recovery work with 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.709
 understanding of phrasal speech gave move 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.690
 to work on individual words 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.480
 make up the phrase 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.489
 with moderate severity work on 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.220
 word differentiation with opposition 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.419
 phoneme differentiation mafon of a 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.700
 Wet of decided semantics of the word and its 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:27.240
 associative links with mild 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.099
 gravity to offer assignment prep 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.789
 new crosswords fix attention 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:34.349
 patient on the mistakes made 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.650
 differentiate synonyms and antonyms 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.440
 homonyms formulate answers to questions 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.740
 according to the text 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.990
 generalize the task of recovery work 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.069
 First to slow down the abundant 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.069
 productive speech secondly to overcome 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:56.430
 violation of phonemic perception 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:05:01.020
 in the third to restore the meaning 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:05.039
 the structure of the word in the fourth to overcome 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.860
 and his verbal speech that is so 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.409
 way we looked at acoustics syndrome 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.009
 you nasic aphasia and identified 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:18.259
 line of work where is it 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:18.259
 recovery thank you for your attention
