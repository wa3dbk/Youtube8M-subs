00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 and going back to the main theme 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.550
 that has reigned during the beginning since 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.160
 2015 which is to start the routine with good 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.519
 to make good decisions for this 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.130
 new year start having a life more 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.470
 healthy I have decided to teach you two 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.320
 salads that you can make for 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.080
 take to work or to the university that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.510
 they are very good that are healthy they are 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.880
 light that fill you will fill you with 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.399
 nutrients because they have a lot of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.380
 vegetables and ingredients that are 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.260
 good for here and also that you make them 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.700
 very very fast at home helps the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.300
 ingredients that definitely 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.680
 surely you do not have at home but that 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.469
 You can go to the store and buy the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.629
 ingredients and you reach for 50 stands 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.309
 individual so once they have 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.039
 the ingredients will be very easy to 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 repeat the salad and harvested 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.800
 they are great one is originally 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.170
 invented by moi and the second is that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.080
 I learned a long time ago 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.880

 the feeling that they are salads more 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.009
 worked because they have incredible 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.319
