00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.390
 and has an accent to taste 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.269
 and we are going to talk about a very 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 important this is a compilation 5 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.270
 translators that you can not miss to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.039
 have the languages 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.359
 exact comes the summer many of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.680
 you travel and you will have to 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.210
 interact with other people who 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.619
 they speak another language so with these 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.619
 applications you have solved 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.369
 let's go with the first eye application 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.460
 careful because this seems more like 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.170
 magic word is an application in which 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.360
 only pointing with the smartphone 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920
 although it seems to you a lie but it translates 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.630
 a car to capture the application the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.309
 true that not more than 1,000,000 to be 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.280
 since a Google Play has been purchased 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.290
 by google 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.960
 as they see that it aims well will charge 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.280
 heel checkbook solved basically 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.379
 is an application through which 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.180
 we point our smartphone to a text 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.820
 at a sign the letter of a restaurant 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 in whatever and in real time, I do not know 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.760
 translate our screen the truth is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.080
 that is a real cool 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.050
 details that you should take into account 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.130
 a perfect perfect man part 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.270
 little bit of everything but it is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.640
 very interesting that it worked between 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.690
 we are already with the second application a 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.670
 application that has a fact 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.280
 very characteristic differential carlos is 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.750
 called in app translator and basically a 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.880
 pop-up through which we can 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.140
 translate what we want to be able to 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.820
 our smartphone is not someone who 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.640
 it puts me on nerves is consulting 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.050
 the financial times on and pour readers 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.460
 very action 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.650
 the browser see a phrase that does not 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 you understand the copies that we created from 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.800
 Applications 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.360
 open the other pegalon application give the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.880
 button and then you red information 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.040
 with eta it has automatically ended 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.390
 we place the pop up where we want to 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.860
 we give to copy the sentence and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.200
 automatically generates the translation 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.390
 both works very well fast comfortable and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.500
 Also, we have verified that it is very 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.440
 efficient 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.210
 come on with the application number 3 we do 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.950
 in a little bit it is not a translator but 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.510
 practically because it is learn to speak 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.430
 exact languages ​​will serve us for 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.470
 communicate with those of the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.000
 country where we are we select the country 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.240
 where we are and where we are 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.160
 we have information of the country the alphabet 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.840
 we have typical phrases to me this 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.580
 like phrases that can get us out of a 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.250
 trouble on any gnostic side of a 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.250
 airport in a restaurant that wants 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.020
 the next day 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.990
 let's go to the application 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.390
 and it 's so much in doctor god you know that 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.000
 in passing we are already with the fourth duration 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.250
 there is a simple relationship but translate 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.720
 that does what it says and that comes 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.730
 obviously you will see it imagine with the 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.200
 name comes from ios already disembarked 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.490
 before for a while they put him 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.260
 ahead and this only goes to the grain 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.730
 we also have voice dictation 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.070
 we have a lot of languages ​​available 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.500
 a translator that complies with what 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.210
 promises very simple but very effective and 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.560
 the fifth and last obligation I what 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.870
 you have imagined you are thinking today to 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.580
 leaving they forget the translator of 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.920
 google is possibly the best 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.870
 application for translation as such the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.900
 truth is that it works very well we have 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.610
 Many languages ​​dictated by you recognizes 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.620
 images the truth is that it is surely 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.600
 the most complete application is without a doubt 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.860
 a dispensable also has a detail 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.450
 that personally seems to me very 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.550
 practical and this as we are navigating 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.410
 in a web we give the menu button 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.570
 We give to share and we have the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.860
 possibility of translating very very 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.080
 quick to the content that we are reading 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.250
 you have to have the series good and this 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.170
 the five applications have been 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.020
 free punctual 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.700
 how I try to communicate in another 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.920
 language so Carlos this summer I do not know 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.840
 worry when you go to kazakhstan and 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.250
 You have to ask in Kazakh where 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.330
 is the bathroom you will not have problems and have 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.800
 just two images that you get from 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.569
 vacation to the coast then a girl 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.739
 a summer love and after this one 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.600
 have the opportunity to be the mother of 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.340
 my children do not worry because now 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.500
 with this phrase and these translations do not 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.360
 so the fixed shot outside coña are 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.280
 very useful applications now as 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.780
 you always just have to look for the one 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.040
 tighter to mention so not 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.870
 I hope you liked the video as 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.760
 always if you liked it, you can give 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.800
 like and we have very soon with more 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.330
 recover more applications and good 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.989
 what's always removed what what 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.989
 we do is you
