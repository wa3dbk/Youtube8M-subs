00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to everyone I'm Elijah 368 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.839
 I bring this did not live this time we are 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.870
 with more people to 5 on the bike I think that 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.870
 I'm with Dr. Sanchez Hi 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.759
 I'm going to catch 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.710
 I do not know if I take the environment 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.140
 the environment because it is the one that has 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.029
 which one is chosen at the end 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 we go with the environment we are in the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.170
 race because you are what reminds me 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.750
 It reminds me of what the theory 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.910
 of 89 in the form of rectilinear that is in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.950
 the curves of the gas environment have 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.120
 totally in the form of another and danone if 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.250
 you realize if we are all 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 vortices inflection points and others 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 I'm just looking at what's 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.770
 above and effectively effectively or 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:54.899
 be this is a good theory 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.370
 rectilinear does not take care of my father shit are 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.610
 a little piggy these subscribers have 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610
 watch out 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.370
 and that's real what everything 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.640
 my mother there are dead and destruction 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.810
 now you say my mother 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.810
 a looping menu 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.400
 good jump I'm a kind of lupine 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.400
 Yes now 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.130
 good angel tell us the 89 good the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.720
 pop number that good people always 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.880
 confused with the subject of the number pi and 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:57.899
 others but it 's the number we have the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:02:00.390
 number and the number 89 from which 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.530
 it was possible to arrive at the equation of the number 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.630
 that's why it's very useful is very very very 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.929
 important and widely used especially 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.590
 always in the car world of 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.590
 motoring 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.850
 seriously for aerodynamics and so on 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.130
 Well, it's true, I usually do everything to do 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.920
 what is a skylight 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.270
 then remove the key and put a skylight 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.670
 exactly for that is very very clear 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.380
 very special very sharp but they break little 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.330
 mother has healed me 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.230
 that I do not understand that the cooks 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.050
 when mouthfeel clear that 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:49.610
 in the mouth son of a bitch is not going to be in the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.610
 dwarf and value in the mouth we are crazy 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.569
 how do I put the car straight so it does not 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.650
 explode uncle with the left joystick the 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.560
 right is that I never remember because 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.080
 not if I want my new whore ramp 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.780
 more misshapen uncle uncle is the ramp of 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.040
 son put ism but start from the beginning 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.040
 or are laps are laps are laps 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.040
 very much 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.780
 well there's one behind you angel wii 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.810
 It is important 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.420
 put my good god because it is the same in 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.120
 the aerodynamics in a few words 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.280
 based on the pop number of agreement and the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.720
 number then it is an equation that I liked 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.730
 what's happening here they 're pulling all 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.600
 explosives I do not know I have one 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.750
 back that I think is pulling 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:39.520
 explosives like because it's what I do to you is 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.230
 throw things jazz and bastard bastard and it's going to 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.860
 catch the trap and uncle because I do collides 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.290
 one has stayed there 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:52.250
 tranca way 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.250
 prima the people come to me I stick it 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.030
 I will not die I will die of the dead 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:14.280
 with a little more dignity man god 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:16.049
 god god has spoken a lot of boy has 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.940
 reappeared just the car angel isa is 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.099
 that sometimes when you crash head-on 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.440
 with a sector does not fly by the way that 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:26.870
 is in the air then you know it 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.449
 the poor man has reappeared and has flown 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.669
 automatically to see that I do not know if 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.130
 leave a c4 because it is very bad 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:39.270
 person but you can see us exploit it 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.539
 an angel could fall well you I will 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.110
 the eighth and I'll go back a guy 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.680
 33 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.830
 god not exploited are five laps 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.440
 central in the air if you look 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.770
 the 89 also has a great similarity 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:02.920
 because there are usually never more than 89 to 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.920
 wikileaks bitch in which in the motherfucker 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.850
 41 in the world there are no more than 89 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.610
 that are neither airplanes nor anything simply 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.630
 They are like zippers 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:27.230
 there come out what would be the 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.330
 central not the persimmons 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.890
 there are ripe persimmons that there are and soft and 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.430
 chapters because that's where the 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.110
 chapters of those kisses of openings that 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.460
 I have done it is strange not because the persimmons 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.030
 mature are usually the soft ones too 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.570
 they already have relation not between them 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.570
 do not 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.980
 impressive impressive theory 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.240
 of the 89 of the rectilinear and above all 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.240
 because the similarities that they have 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:03.160
 holes especially since that the relationship 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.090
 what the fuck mother my angel explain me 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.160
 the theory of why it has hit me 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.190
 against the ramp for no apparent reason 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:13.320
 favor 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:19.920
 by the good popping then when they do 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:23.090
 pop there is no photo I have been busted 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.090
 hungry sitting very hard 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.639
 my mother 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:38.329
 this race is long with balls 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:42.379
 shit do not explode from bran 

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:45.969
 everything that I became Chinese kiko son 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:48.240
 they are some subscribers as if you do not 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.780
 ching 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.770
 Well, that 's very important 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.169
 especially in our lives because to 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.050
 see may may seem at first 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.490
 that the theory gives rectilinear of 89 only 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.410
 can affect cars to the 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.389
 aerodynamics is very important yes that is 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.669
 true is true but it also influences 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:08.990
 our day to day so good doctor 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.990
 Sanchez, thank you very much 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.380
 thank you very much for having been in 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:18.569
 this new video is of this world 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:21.330
 colorless and give you can fire you if 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:23.430
 You want to dismiss your and good 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:27.199
 I hope you liked it and nothing else in 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.199
 the next mega video 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.409
 ah 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:42.860
 and I
