Talde arathi and I would put Joanna at

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.749 
Talde arathi and I would put Joanna at
that<00:01:46.799> level<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.549> these<00:01:47.700> great<00:01:48.090> maestro<00:01:48.689> the

freedom of exploring those artistic

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.219 
freedom of exploring those artistic
boundaries<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.720> makes

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
boundaries I think is what really makes

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.130 
boundaries I think is what really makes
this<00:01:55.619> ensemble<00:01:56.280> under<00:01:56.430> her<00:01:56.790> leadership<00:01:57.540> and

this ensemble under her leadership and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.350 
this ensemble under her leadership and
vision<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:59.040> special<00:01:59.490> there's<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.210> this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
vision really special there's just this

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.389 
vision really special there's just this
chemistry<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.259> think<00:02:01.590> between<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.920> musicians

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
chemistry I think between the musicians

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.910 
chemistry I think between the musicians
in<00:02:02.579> myself<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.600> myself<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> musician

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
in myself and myself and the musician

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.210 
in myself and myself and the musician
that<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:06.150> can<00:02:07.020> only<00:02:07.170> explain<00:02:07.590> by<00:02:07.770> saying<00:02:08.069> that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
that I can only explain by saying that

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.160 
that I can only explain by saying that
