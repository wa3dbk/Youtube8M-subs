00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:16.190 
trim the skin and extra fat off of this
one<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.099> one's<00:01:14.310> spiral<00:01:14.759> cut<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.959> I'm<00:01:16.050> going

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
one this one's spiral cut so I'm going

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.639 
one this one's spiral cut so I'm going
to<00:01:16.259> leave<00:01:16.349> that<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.800> is<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.649> maybe

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
to leave that one as is this one maybe

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.889 
to leave that one as is this one maybe
take<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.099> bit<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.429> fat<00:01:20.610> off<00:01:20.819> but<00:01:21.149> as

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
take a little bit of this fat off but as

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.419 
take a little bit of this fat off but as
they<00:01:22.050> say<00:01:22.259> fat<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.590> flavor<00:01:22.709> so<00:01:23.039> anyway<00:01:23.369> I'm

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
they say fat is flavor so anyway I'm

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:24.740 
they say fat is flavor so anyway I'm
just<00:01:23.459> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.700> take<00:01:23.819> this<00:01:23.940> outer<00:01:24.149> rind<00:01:24.509> off

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
just going to take this outer rind off

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.850 
just going to take this outer rind off
so<00:01:24.959> that<00:01:24.989> the<00:01:25.830> blaze<00:01:26.099> can<00:01:26.459> get<00:01:27.030> glaze<00:01:27.739> this<00:01:28.739> is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
so that the blaze can get glaze this is

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.710 
so that the blaze can get glaze this is
how<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.009> make<00:01:29.160> brown<00:01:29.940> sugar<00:01:30.209> for<00:01:30.420> those<00:01:30.509> who

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
how you make brown sugar for those who

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.589 
how you make brown sugar for those who
don't<00:01:30.899> know<00:01:31.039> it's<00:01:32.039> about<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.670> tablespoon<00:01:33.119> or

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599 
don't know it's about one tablespoon or

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:36.440 
don't know it's about one tablespoon or
two<00:01:33.720> tablespoons<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:34.259> molasses<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:35.459> a<00:01:35.489> cup<00:01:36.239> of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
two tablespoons of molasses to a cup of

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.229 
two tablespoons of molasses to a cup of
white<00:01:36.690> sugar<00:01:37.789> it<00:01:38.789> makes<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:39.030> pretty<00:01:39.179> good

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:39.239 
white sugar it makes a pretty good

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.330 
white sugar it makes a pretty good
substitute<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.649> we're<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.099> to<00:01:41.160> try<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
substitute and we're going to try that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.639 
substitute and we're going to try that
that's<00:01:41.670> about<00:01:41.880> 1<00:01:42.300> and<00:01:42.450> 3/4<00:01:42.959> cups<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.319> sugar<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that's about 1 and 3/4 cups of sugar and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.469 
that's about 1 and 3/4 cups of sugar and
a<00:01:43.830> couple<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.369> 3<00:01:44.550> tablespoons<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.119> thread<00:01:45.300> of

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
a couple of 3 tablespoons of thread of

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.639 
a couple of 3 tablespoons of thread of
molasses<00:01:45.929> let's<00:01:46.140> try<00:01:46.259> that

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
molasses let's try that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.499 
molasses let's try that
so<00:01:47.039> that<00:01:47.250> looks<00:01:47.489> sort<00:01:47.789> of<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:47.940> brown<00:01:48.179> sugar

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
so that looks sort of like brown sugar

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.240 
so that looks sort of like brown sugar
to<00:01:48.599> me<00:01:48.750> kind<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.530> packs<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.950> weight<00:01:50.069> brown

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to me kind of packs the weight brown

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.990 
to me kind of packs the weight brown
sugar<00:01:50.550> does<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:52.310> it's<00:01:53.310> maybe<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.640> little<00:01:53.670> dark

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
sugar does and it's maybe a little dark

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.900 
sugar does and it's maybe a little dark
but<00:01:54.149> that's<00:01:54.300> okay<00:01:54.569> I<00:01:54.599> like<00:01:54.810> molasses<00:01:55.319> I<00:01:56.160> don't

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
but that's okay I like molasses I don't

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.160 
but that's okay I like molasses I don't
know<00:01:57.000> how<00:01:57.060> that's<00:01:57.270> gonna<00:01:57.420> stick<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.989> this

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
know how that's gonna stick on this

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.690 
know how that's gonna stick on this
whether<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.099> to<00:01:59.160> stick<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.429> the<00:01:59.520> hand

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
whether it's going to stick on the hand

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.630 
whether it's going to stick on the hand
very<00:01:59.879> well<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.289> we're<00:02:01.289> going<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:01.470> try<00:02:01.590> that

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
very well but we're going to try that

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.219 
very well but we're going to try that
looks<00:02:02.640> pretty<00:02:02.759> good

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
looks pretty good

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.119

let's try to get it what's on sugar on
this<00:02:47.290> side<00:02:48.659> looks<00:02:49.659> pretty<00:02:49.840> good<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.079> sweep<00:02:51.900> and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
this side looks pretty good to sweep and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.229 
this side looks pretty good to sweep and
then<00:02:52.989> we're<00:02:53.139> gonna<00:02:53.849> think<00:02:54.849> I'm<00:02:54.909> going<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.090> put

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
then we're gonna think I'm going to put

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.180 
then we're gonna think I'm going to put

while letting this glaze kind of set a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.520 
while letting this glaze kind of set a
little<00:03:08.480> bit<00:03:10.000> start<00:03:11.000> pouring<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.750> started

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
little bit start pouring the started

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.400 
little bit start pouring the started
glazing<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:13.450> every<00:03:14.450> half<00:03:14.630> an<00:03:14.750> hour<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.200> with

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
glazing it every half an hour so with

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.860 
glazing it every half an hour so with
