i'll<00:01:50.310> post<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.700> link<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> black<00:01:51.360> unboxing

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
i'll post a link to the black unboxing

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.569 
i'll post a link to the black unboxing
down<00:01:52.140> below<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> startup

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
down below so you can see the startup

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.120 
down below so you can see the startup
which<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.939> exactly<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.570> same<00:01:54.829> so<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.009> is
