will<00:00:06.750> be<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.350> data<00:00:08.040> transferring<00:00:08.519> three-point

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
will be a data transferring three-point

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.570 
will be a data transferring three-point

after<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> data<00:00:25.410> transfer

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
after that just go to data transfer

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.880 
after that just go to data transfer
utility<00:00:26.310> now<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.300> ps3<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:28.109> um<00:00:28.349> I'm

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
then hit the first one transfer data

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.979 
then hit the first one transfer data
from<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.309> ps3<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> other<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.570> then

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
from this ps3 to the other one and then

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.160 
from this ps3 to the other one and then
you<00:00:40.110> could<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.410> hit<00:00:40.530> OK<00:00:41.180> again<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.600> both<00:00:42.960> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
you could just hit OK again you both of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.020 
you could just hit OK again you both of
the<00:00:43.260> ps3's<00:00:43.530> will<00:00:43.950> need<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.610> ethernet

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the ps3's will need to be on an ethernet

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.660 
the ps3's will need to be on an ethernet
cable<00:00:45.440> so<00:00:46.440> after<00:00:46.680> year<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.250> screen<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
cable so after year at that screen you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.340 
cable so after year at that screen you
could<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:47.969> switch<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.480> other<00:00:48.570> ps3<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
could just switch to the other ps3 and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.700 
could just switch to the other ps3 and
this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.260> ps3<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
this is going to be the ps3 that the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.950 
this is going to be the ps3 that the
data<00:00:53.100> gets<00:00:53.399> transferred<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.690> one's

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
data gets transferred on so this one's

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.799 
data gets transferred on so this one's
on<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.320> point<00:00:55.500> 11<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.879> I'll<00:00:57.660> just

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
on for point 11 as you see and I'll just

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.590 
on for point 11 as you see and I'll just
go<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> data<00:00:58.230> transfer<00:00:58.649> utility<00:00:59.120> hit<00:01:00.120> OK<00:01:00.449> again

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
go to data transfer utility hit OK again

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.930 
go to data transfer utility hit OK again
this<00:01:01.469> time<00:01:01.680> hit<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> bottom<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.399> transfer

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
this time hit the bottom one transfer

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.329 
this time hit the bottom one transfer
data<00:01:03.449> from<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.960> other<00:01:04.110> ps3<00:01:04.500> system<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.159> this

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
data from the other ps3 system to this

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.210 
data from the other ps3 system to this
system<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.350> then<00:01:07.350> you'll<00:01:07.500> say<00:01:07.650> please<00:01:07.890> wait

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
system and then you'll say please wait

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
system and then you'll say please wait
it's<00:01:08.400> checking<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.689> finding<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> other<00:01:10.260> ps3

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it's checking it's finding the other ps3

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.880 
it's checking it's finding the other ps3
since<00:01:11.189> they<00:01:11.340> both<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.140> Ethernet<00:01:13.140> cables

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.560 

and<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.250> hit<00:01:17.400> yes<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.820> basically<00:01:18.150> telling

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and just hit yes it's basically telling

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.929 
and just hit yes it's basically telling
you<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.990> everything<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> ps3<00:01:19.979> will<00:01:20.759> be

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
you that everything on this ps3 will be

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.539 
you that everything on this ps3 will be
gone<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.630> it'll<00:01:22.470> look<00:01:22.619> exactly<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
gone and it'll look exactly like the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
gone and it'll look exactly like the
other<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> everything<00:01:25.500> will<00:01:25.590> transfer

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
other one so everything will transfer

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.420 
other one so everything will transfer
over<00:01:26.130> your<00:01:26.720> downloads<00:01:27.720> accounts<00:01:28.530> basically

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
over your downloads accounts basically

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.719 
over your downloads accounts basically
everything<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:31.470> might<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.890> download

everything so you might have to download

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.219 
everything so you might have to download
again<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.079> not<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:34.680> other<00:01:34.829> ps3<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.249 
depending on how much data you have on
the<00:01:53.460> other<00:01:53.579> ps3<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.360> how<00:01:54.720> much<00:01:54.869> data<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.200> have

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the other ps3 and how much data you have

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.370 
the other ps3 and how much data you have
on<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.799> I'll<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.189> depend<00:01:57.049> that's<00:01:58.049> what

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
on this one I'll just depend that's what

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.530 
on this one I'll just depend that's what
the<00:01:58.530> time<00:01:58.740> will<00:01:58.920> depend<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.430> just<00:01:59.820> how<00:02:00.270> much

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
the time will depend on just how much

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.920 
the time will depend on just how much
it's<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:01.200> transferring<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.009> deleting

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
it's actually transferring and deleting

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.539 
it's actually transferring and deleting
the<00:02:03.930> mine<00:02:04.079> doesn't<00:02:04.350> take<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.649> long<00:02:04.710> your

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the mine doesn't take that long your

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.310 
the mine doesn't take that long your
shouldn't<00:02:05.969> either<00:02:06.090> unless<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
shouldn't either unless you have like a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.770 
shouldn't either unless you have like a
crap<00:02:08.129> load<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.429> data<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> might<00:02:09.569> take<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
crap load of data then it might take a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.470 
crap load of data then it might take a
while

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.600 

so<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.290> wait<00:02:13.470> for<00:02:13.709> this<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:14.040> finished<00:02:14.250> and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
so just wait for this to be finished and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.990 
so just wait for this to be finished and
as<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.510> says<00:02:15.780> do<00:02:16.319> not<00:02:16.349> turn<00:02:16.830> off<00:02:16.950> your<00:02:17.190> system

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
as it says do not turn off your system

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.640 
as it says do not turn off your system
or<00:02:18.180> disconnect<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.900> ethernet<00:02:18.989> cables<00:02:19.530> this

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
or disconnect the ethernet cables this

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.890 
or disconnect the ethernet cables this
will<00:02:19.769> most<00:02:19.950> likely<00:02:20.420> corrupt<00:02:21.420> your<00:02:21.569> data<00:02:21.810> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
will most likely corrupt your data and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.309 
will most likely corrupt your data and
your<00:02:22.019> ps3's<00:02:22.349> will<00:02:22.830> be<00:02:23.310> messed<00:02:23.580> up<00:02:24.019> so<00:02:25.019> now<00:02:25.140> just

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
your ps3's will be messed up so now just

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.309 
your ps3's will be messed up so now just
wait<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.890> load<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:30.480> ps3<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.170> you

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
wait for it to load and the ps3 that you

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.740 
wait for it to load and the ps3 that you
data<00:02:31.680> transfer<00:02:32.160> down<00:02:32.280> will<00:02:32.580> look<00:02:32.819> exactly

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
data transfer down will look exactly

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.940 
data transfer down will look exactly
like<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.620> other<00:02:34.769> one<00:02:35.010> um<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:37.410> yeah<00:02:37.530> this<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.830> my

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
like the other one um so yeah this is my

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.539 
like the other one um so yeah this is my
four<00:02:38.250> point<00:02:38.430> 11<00:02:38.790> I'll<00:02:38.940> show<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.510> again<00:02:43.549> system

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
four point 11 I'll show you again system

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.089 
four point 11 I'll show you again system
settings<00:02:44.910> system<00:02:45.209> information<00:02:45.599> for<00:02:46.530> point<00:02:46.769> 11

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
settings system information for point 11

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.520 
settings system information for point 11
and<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.239> will<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.569> package<00:02:48.959> files<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.440> you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
and I you will have package files if you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.869 
and I you will have package files if you
have<00:02:49.620> package<00:02:49.950> files<00:02:50.160> on<00:02:50.310> your<00:02:50.430> other<00:02:50.519> one<00:02:50.730> do

that's<00:02:57.870> basically<00:02:58.079> how<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.590> data<00:02:58.859> transfer

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
that's basically how to data transfer

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.830 
that's basically how to data transfer
