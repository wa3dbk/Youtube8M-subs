section in this down tube that is the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
section in this down tube that is the
same<00:01:22.729> what<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> mean<00:01:24.090> by<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.869> were<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
same what I mean by that if we were to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
same what I mean by that if we were to
cut<00:01:25.259> through<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> at<00:01:25.920> any<00:01:26.220> point<00:01:26.520> it's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
cut through it at any point it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.210 
cut through it at any point it's
constantly<00:01:27.840> changing<00:01:27.930> constantly<00:01:28.799> morphing

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and if you look from behind you'll see

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.080
