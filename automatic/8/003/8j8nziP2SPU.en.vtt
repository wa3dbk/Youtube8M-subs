Hey there!

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.300
It’s Matt from Kenhub!

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.340
And in this tutorial, we will discuss the
function and anatomy of the extensor digitorum

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.110
longus.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.159
The extensor digitorum longus or Musculus
extensor digitorum longus is one of the anterior

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.689
muscles of the lower leg.

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.359
These anterior muscles are a group of extensors.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.179
They lie within the anterior compartment located
at the ventrolateral region of the lower leg

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.399
where they form its surface structure.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.940
Their tendons are particularly prominent on
the dorsum of the foot.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.890
They include the tibialis anterior, the extensor
hallucis longus, and the extensor digitorum

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.660
longus.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.130
The extensor digitorum longus muscle has three
points of origin.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.399
It originates at the lateral tibial condyle,
the ventral side of the fibula, and the interosseous

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:12.680
membrane, and merges into a tendon above the
superior extensor retinaculum.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.830
Below the inferior extensor retinaculum, it
divides into four tendons inserting at the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.250
dorsal aponeurosis and the bases of the distal
and middle phalanges of the second through

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.030
fifth toes.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.290
About 90% of people have an additional fifth
tendon running towards the lateral foot edge

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:41.150
and inserting at the fifth metatarsal bone.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.440
All anterior muscles are innervated by the
deep fibular nerve.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.120
The main task of the anterior muscles of the
lower leg is the dorsal extension of the upper

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.160
ankle joint.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.900
In addition, both the extensor digitorum longus
and extensor hallucis longus muscles are responsible

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.950
for the lifting of the toes, the extension
of the first, middle, and end joints.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.770
Due to the course of the tendons, the anterior
muscles also contribute to the movement of

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.540
the lower ankle joint.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.000
And in this function, the extensor digitorum
longus muscle provides a powerful eversion

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.660
known as pronation.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.440
This video is more fun than reading a textbook,
right?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.740
