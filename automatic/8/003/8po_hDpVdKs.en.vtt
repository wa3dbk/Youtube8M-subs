a q-tip a pretty good amount like that
i'll<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.349> take<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.890> rub<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.550> inside<00:00:30.240> the

i'll just take it and rub it inside the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.260 
i'll just take it and rub it inside the
beads<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.520> inside<00:00:32.520> these<00:00:32.730> beads<00:00:33.030> are

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
beads and the inside these beads are

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.780 
beads and the inside these beads are
relatively<00:00:33.690> smooth<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:35.160> buy<00:00:35.370> them<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
relatively smooth if you buy them and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
they're not smooth like you put a q-tip

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830 
they're not smooth like you put a q-tip
in<00:00:38.040> there<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:39.030> bring<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.390> out<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.719> the

in there and you bring it out and the
q-tip<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.559> frayed<00:00:41.059> then<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> know<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.450> not

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
q-tip is frayed then you know it's not

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.979 
q-tip is frayed then you know it's not
very<00:00:42.780> smooth<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.950> two<00:00:44.190> options<00:00:44.219> one

very smooth and you have two options one

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.459 
very smooth and you have two options one
not<00:00:45.989> buy<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.289> or<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.910> get<00:00:48.120> some<00:00:48.469> some

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
not buy it or to just get some some

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.160 
not buy it or to just get some some
sandpaper<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.940> ball<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
sandpaper and just ball it up and it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.380 
sandpaper and just ball it up and it
doesn't<00:00:52.440> take<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.559> lot<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.829> sandpaper<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:54.210> know

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
doesn't take a lot of sandpaper you know

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
doesn't take a lot of sandpaper you know
just<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.379> take<00:00:55.530> your<00:00:55.559> set<00:00:55.860> paper<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
just and just take your set paper and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.560 
just and just take your set paper and
just<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.399> back<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.760> forth<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> smooth

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
just go back and forth just to smooth

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.450 
just go back and forth just to smooth
out<00:00:57.750> because<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:58.739> there's<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.129> snags

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
out because if there's a little snags

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.400 
out because if there's a little snags
and<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.879> beads<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.930> go<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> put<00:01:01.320> them

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and your beads when you go to put them

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
and your beads when you go to put them
on<00:01:01.500> your<00:01:01.620> hair<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:03.059> course<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.480> going

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
on your hair then of course it's going

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.969 
on your hair then of course it's going
to<00:01:03.690> snag<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.080> your<00:01:04.170> hair<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.769> cause

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
to snag in your hair and can cause

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.109 
to snag in your hair and can cause
damage<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.060> I'm<00:01:06.360> putting<00:01:06.630> oil<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
damage so I'm putting oil in here and

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.730 
damage so I'm putting oil in here and
each<00:01:09.119> one<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> beads<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.990> usually<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
each one of the beads I usually do it

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.660 
each one of the beads I usually do it
maybe<00:01:11.220> once<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.790> week<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.299> put<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> some<00:01:14.159> oil<00:01:14.430> in

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
maybe once a week I put the some oil in

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.630 
maybe once a week I put the some oil in
there<00:01:14.909> or<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.170> greasy<00:01:16.740> concoction

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
there or this little greasy concoction

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.910 
there or this little greasy concoction
that<00:01:17.670> I've<00:01:17.939> made<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.479> I'll<00:01:19.380> put<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.590> inside

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that I've made and I'll put that inside

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
that I've made and I'll put that inside
the<00:01:20.250> beads<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.820> moisture<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.570> help<00:01:21.840> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the beads for moisture and the help of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.039 
the beads for moisture and the help of
sliding<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.180> there's<00:01:24.180> two<00:01:24.360> ways<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.750> put

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
sliding and there's two ways you can put

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.440 
sliding and there's two ways you can put
them<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.799> guess<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.060> kind<00:01:27.299> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
them on there I guess you can kind of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.569 
them on there I guess you can kind of
shove<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.400> that's

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
shove it in there like that but that's

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.030 
shove it in there like that but that's
not<00:01:29.729> very<00:01:29.880> effective<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.290> use<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.710> tool

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
not very effective you can use this tool

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.090 
not very effective you can use this tool
here<00:01:33.020> there's<00:01:34.020> some<00:01:34.259> kind<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.560> beating<00:01:34.890> tool

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
here there's some kind of a beating tool

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.190 
here there's some kind of a beating tool
and<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:37.710> put<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> beat<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.340> there

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
and you can you put the beat on there

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.969 
and you can you put the beat on there
take<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> piece<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.560> hair<00:01:41.270> put<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:42.979> in

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
take a piece of hair put it in there in

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.969 
take a piece of hair put it in there in
between<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.659> just<00:01:45.659> take<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.229> you'll<00:01:46.829> just

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
between and just take it and you'll just

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.060 
between and just take it and you'll just
pull<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.399> down<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:49.409> puts<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> beat<00:01:49.920> on

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
pull it down and it puts the beat on

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.719 
pull it down and it puts the beat on
there<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:51.200> or<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.310> don't<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.549> one

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
there for you or if you don't have one

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.499 
there for you or if you don't have one
of<00:01:53.939> these<00:01:54.119> little<00:01:54.720> beady<00:01:55.049> things<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.420> you

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
of these little beady things and you

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.020
