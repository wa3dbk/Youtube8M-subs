don't<00:03:44.470> really<00:03:44.740> need<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.190> change<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.700> whole<00:03:45.820> lot

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
don't really need to change a whole lot

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.800 
don't really need to change a whole lot
I<00:03:46.360> think<00:03:46.630> most<00:03:46.900> people<00:03:47.290> run<00:03:48.010> their<00:03:48.280> cars

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
I think most people run their cars

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.460 
I think most people run their cars
fairly<00:03:49.810> similar<00:03:50.200> indoor<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:50.980> outdoor

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
fairly similar indoor and outdoor

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.810 
fairly similar indoor and outdoor
depends<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:53.650> mean<00:03:53.800> if<00:03:54.040> it's<00:03:54.190> really<00:03:54.490> high<00:03:54.610> by

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
depends I mean if it's really high by

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.000 
depends I mean if it's really high by
outdoor<00:03:55.800> when<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.890> is<00:03:57.070> low<00:03:57.670> bite<00:03:57.910> indoor<00:03:58.390> and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
outdoor when it is low bite indoor and

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.060 
outdoor when it is low bite indoor and
obviously<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.190> need<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.490> make<00:04:00.640> changes<00:04:01.000> but

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
obviously you need to make changes but

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.220

in<00:05:03.069> Europe<00:05:03.789> do<00:05:04.090> you<00:05:04.569> guys<00:05:04.690> still<00:05:04.900> go<00:05:05.050> through

like<00:05:05.440> severe<00:05:05.889> tech<00:05:06.220> where<00:05:06.430> they<00:05:06.550> check<00:05:06.819> like

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
like severe tech where they check like

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.939 
like severe tech where they check like
every<00:05:07.449> single<00:05:07.780> nook<00:05:07.900> and<00:05:08.110> cranny<00:05:08.349> or<00:05:08.680> is<00:05:08.800> it

pretty much loose I think it depends on

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.680 
pretty much loose I think it depends on
the<00:05:14.650> country<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.580> race<00:05:15.789> like<00:05:16.300> the
