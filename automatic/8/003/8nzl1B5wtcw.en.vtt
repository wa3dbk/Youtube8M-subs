00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.609
 Let's understand how it works. 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.090
 command for drawing of bows drawing of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.990
 he is very simple it is only that he 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.849
 have a number of options here 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.830
 following the information that you 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.850
 will notice that there are several 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.180
 here to be 120 in the beyond 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.960
 So, what do they mean? 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.820
 these start options is the beginning is the point 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.280
 of beginning center is the center of air 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 in you it's the end of the bow then start here 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.940
 the center of it here the end here by 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.219
 example and radios is the rim of the rim 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.670
 then this distance from the center of touch 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.100
 in the air on or I walk even 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.410
 this is an opening that enters the beginning 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.260
 to the end in the center of the air 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.190
 we have an angle here, this is the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.309
 in goal he refers to direction is the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.640
 direction of the tangent to the direction of 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.580
 vector that is tangent to commuting 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.689
 shown here so it's certain it's playing 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.939
 only in this sector here 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.729
 cast is this length here between 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.740
 a starting point an end point between 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.030
 the start point point set this 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.560
 what we call long 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.490
 from the air rope 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.860
 the arc is always drawn in the direction 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.810
 counter clockwise then whenever you can 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.780
 there you first inform a point 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.970
 here after a point here if you went 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.040
 my first here and then here I 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.320
 draw for this outside here 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.079
 so always look for the design of this 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.299
 way so those options here you have 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.520
 have to keep in mind what each one means 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.210
 now I've done some examples here of the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.939
 side 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.729
 We can study the command of the 1st 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.979
 command is the simplest way to 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.520
 draw there that you can access through 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.970
 own keyboards edit not understand and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.120
 brand where it starts 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.360
 a point where you will pass 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.810
 and then the end is really not even beginning 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.970
 from the end but are three air points three 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.490
 points where the air has to pass 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.110
 there in this particular case there is no 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.060
 it would make a difference in educating us 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.950
 counter clockwise 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.680
 he will pass for 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.850
 these three points and one end goes 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.530
 being at the first point is another 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.840
 end is at the last point then 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.610
 a very simple way you type the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.070
 do it this way 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.610
 only that way it does not contemplate 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.520
 all the possibilities of drawing 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.310
 then there is a list that has several 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.240
 several other sequence options 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.250
 December air 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.350
 the first is the one I showed three 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.720
 points you see a good time another point 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.940
 another point where the grass that separates 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.190
 the cursor on top of the command it gives you 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.840
 an illustration to wait a while for them 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.270
 administration of that command for you 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.880
 understand another way of understanding 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.270
 so here it is center and in 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.550
 to dignify the center and the end 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.440
 so when you click on this option it 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.290
 ask where the start is 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.030
 he asks what is the center of this arc 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.209
 so I'll mark the center as being 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.880
 for example that the circus center 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.940
 I'm going to call the center noc then the 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.580
 center-west here and then the end he asks the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.640
 end music order here for me made it already 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.370
 the center here and the end here started here 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.769
 following the questions he asked 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.920
 proposes here with this sequence was 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:40.310
 done and I indicated the points there if I 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.060
 have an option start every year too 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.730
 It's very peaceful to do when you 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.040
 speaks at an angle is referring to the 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.170
 even then look I'll say that the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.670
 beginning of the first option that he picks right 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.820
 start here 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.160
 The center here is the student, so if I 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.850
 say that the angle of 90 degrees per 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.140
 example 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.540
 to 90 he made a bow 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.640
 if you take the start to the end of it the 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.800
 angle that kept being 90 let's do 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.860
 a line whose price becomes more evident 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.990
 making a line from here to 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.510
 perpendicular here looks at the angle it 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.190
 done here between the beginning and the end this 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.370
 90 degree year 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.580
 then this idea is you work with 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.650
 Angola also included compliance 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.400
 another very quiet way of working 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.250
 Are you going to tell me where to start next? 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.230
 asks for the center and now the 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.180
 I note that the length is 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.480
 always the size of this line connecting the 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.970
 beginning of the arc with an end of it then 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.560
 You can move this measure will be 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.970
 the measurement of this line 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.780
 You never managed to make a bow. 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.970
 the greatest possible distance here is 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.970
 always try to detect in that range 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.700
 with these options 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:05.210
 they repeat I have beginning end and 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.630
 year beginning and end and direction here changed 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.250
 if the direction is simpler I will 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.410
 use to draw a door for you 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.080
 better understand the air through a 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.450
 start direction end then for example 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.900
 here below a drawing occurs 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.340
 I say the act will start here. 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.880
 always counterclockwise goes 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.130
 finish here and the direction of the tangent 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.320
 does not respond to the action of NATO, people are 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.900
 will define how essential it is to stay 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.370
 perfect I call f8 is the direction stays 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.320
 exactly horizontal 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.470
 the file is perfect here that the 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.520
 his tangent to come out here is a 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.350
 Quiet way to draw direction 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.750
 I start at the same time right 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.200
 only changes the sequence nÃ© instead of being 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.910
 beginning and center beginning at the end and 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.040
 can also reverse with learning to 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.650
 tell center after start center 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.160
 and start instead of start center 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.070
 this order of questions is an option that is 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.930
 different from those I showed the option 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.820
 continue the option to continue the 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.140
 work like for example you do 1 to 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.969
 1 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.339
 so you draw an arch begins here 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.179
 the car come here professoa head 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:17.369
 he 

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:21.449
 then I'll enter this option 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:23.329
 continue what he is going to do he goes 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.110
 continue the air you were doing 

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:27.269
 Your click here 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.519
 he continued to create if I entered 

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:31.679
 in this option to continue and 

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:36.299
 continue the last boat I did 

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:38.549
 so I can move here I go to 

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:40.589
 off was to become more liberal and 

00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:44.159
 able to draw arcs that 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:46.699
 you're so kind a 10 always so 1 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:49.679
 continuing the other in the same tangency 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:52.289
 Can you make some more shapes? 

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:54.779
 organic neon looks very interesting 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:57.689
 for you to use for example the 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:59.849
 design an organic pool 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:02.549
 instead of a whole square pool, right? 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:05.549
 this is an interesting resource and the 

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:06.929
 geometric shape looks quite elegant 

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:08.819
 also ne 

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:11.759
 so basically this is important 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:14.669
 keep in mind these options here the command 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:18.709
 of arc lc summarizes this set of 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.709
 options I indicated for you here
