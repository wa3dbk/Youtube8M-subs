00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.660
 a plus 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 in the afternoon it was plus 18 now degrees 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.199
 probably 13 14 but the breeze is really blowing 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.269
 so that's why blue will be polished here 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.269
 so as not to pick up the dust 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.629
 so now we still need to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.770
 polishing 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:46.850
 this is an ordinary bar i polish 2000 kai 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.850

 lure clean changes 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.729
 waterjacks with an asterisk on top of my 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.509

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:13.460
 black circle polisher 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:16.400
 now we started the whole thing we forget with 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.520
 sandpaper for this we also 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.000
 I would leave if I usually do this 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:28.340
 janitor in order to watch rubbed or not 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.600
 well and cleaning and rags to wipe 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.000

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.289
 what will i do 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.720
 forgetting half of some and then 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.979
 half- polished the other half and 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.979
 the middle I later 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.750
 cross glance recalls 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:50.420
 that forgot how am i well thousand kai and 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.240
 it's hard of course to spoil it 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.360
 but when you have 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.829
 small ones are speckled quietly and peacefully 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.259
 see Tanya and I am left them specifically 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:05.460
 Do not because I will wipe there 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:09.090
 but about here and so 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.240
 looks after processing two 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.650
 I use polishes 2 recommend 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.520
 of course manufacturers 3 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.280
 rough mean and smooth most she 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.640
 strokes here close microcracks 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.940
 cobweb so on but i'm using 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.500
 normal 2 here they are on the surface already 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.470
 becomes so glossy 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.100
 very good after that when we have it 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.650
 vodichkoy all we wash will be generally perfect 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.450
 Now I am further for my this part because 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.440
 what wears should be fed where here it is 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.530
 already dried up, I see where I still do not give and 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.769
 I will return more shagrenka and then it will be 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.950
 the surface of us is perfectly smooth 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.950
 be patient 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.010
 tea-coffee lemonade and so on that is 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.790
 not to run you hard work 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.930
 well then the result will be obvious 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.989
 so everything will be well subscribe 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.560
 a channel set husky ask komentiruem 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.160
 questions and then I started something like this should 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.160
 to look like 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.920
 polished you hood therefore 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.750
 Itâ€™s easy to call the hood 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.610
 you minor scratches if you don't 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.069
 painted and just want to refresh you 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.810
 just need well from strength 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.370
 at 30 40 probably therefore still difficult 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.459
 no 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:39.469
 good luck to everyone so everything will be fine i 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.420
 I will begin to polish the side of a 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:47.030
