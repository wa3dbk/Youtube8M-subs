 says eagle knight waiting for the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.660
 other parties who can climb and 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.069
 I was stung good is to remember 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.750
 the previous program went up in three 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.849
 parts this for what I see is going to go up 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.650
 in two by two because we have almost 15 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.299
 minutes says frame pimentel is true 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.170
 that the Cuban government will allow the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.570
 seekers become 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.580
 professionals this would be very good for 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.010
 boxing because there's a lot of talent in the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.580
 Cuban users blessings good there 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.199
 a tendency of the aiba I almost did not 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.269
 I would say that not even a tendency I 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.450
 I think that she is like a decision of the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.230
 he was about to make reforms to his regulation 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.790
 to give a professional look to the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.250
 activity the amateur himself is well 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 complex well complex that's going to involve 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.020
 that they will not use and careers 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.390
 the assaults are going to be four rounds 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.750
 is going to qualify as professional boxing 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.149
 this shows once again in that 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.969
 aiba's interest in amateur boxing 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.399
 to go as close as possible to boxing 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.150
 Professional contrary to what the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.220
 Panamanian leaders 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.130
 maintained as a lie during 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.830
 you add and I've been one of the few who 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.050
 those who are faced and only that 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.430
 is all there is is a lie that 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.050
 amateur boxing can not be with 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.810
 the professional there are countless cases 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.880
 colombia argentina doctor where a single 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.650
 estate manages both boxing 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.120
 amateur as a professional but here in 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.740
 panama our leaders sold that 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.190
 lie for many years that's flour 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.710
 another sack like that is 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.930
 good and that also if that happens in Cuba 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.850
 would be great for boxing for Cuba 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.620
 because he will have many players 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.740
 well-known professionals worldwide 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.060
 but it's going to lower its domain and then 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.580
 cleaning 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.200
 things will expand to others from 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.850
 services dreams I dream of that day 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.950
 Juan I dream of that shot without 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.810
 get into political issues I respect a lot 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.580
 to my Cuban friends to my brothers 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.520
 I'm not going to talk about politics 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.890
 that my dream is to see professional boxing in 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.060
 cuba and also imagine if you do it 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.060
 boxing that they do in baseball 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.970
 This is how the day will come, as it says 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.350
 song says please come up in the fight 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.120
 portrayed for you tomorrow 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.880
 I need an angle dollar, I 'm going to raise it 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.410
 spend look this is the first one in the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.790
 previous program in the first part 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.130
 are the two links to me what I do not 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.800
 liked it was that Juan got the one from the leave 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.510
 go crazy but good with with 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.160
 means or that it be for not served ha is 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.560
 because Daniel because to appreciate what 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.150
 Well, you have to know what's wrong like that 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.640
 that if you see the fight to throw him out 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.260
 against hopkins he realizes a 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.580
 very bad fight you will see if this does not 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.739
 serves and then imagine throwing the 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.430
 explosive but you can jump 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.370
 you can jump 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.290
 the highs I went straight to the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.939
 Dog fight if you have a mask 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.829
 sacks welder welders 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.079
 have sparks on hand 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.329
 the effects and care screen that 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.329
 reheats the computer I wish I did not have 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.420
 a fire extinguisher out there by ok 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.790
 here says stress or criticism the champions 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.950
 they do not want to face him they fear him 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.650
 now he has been that change in ownership 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.389
 that is, emeritus gamboa has not only 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.790
 interim cattle he was regular champion 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.829
 official in two relations in feder wait 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.569
 the champions of fear see jokes 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.139
 when he saw him go up he ran 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.139
 the session at 130 and 136 that tasty that 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.329
 how beautiful the freedom of being able to say what 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:19.510
 that one comes up with respect to 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.669
 I do not know why I got a 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.290
 message from a cybernaut where I 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:26.239
 corrected because I said what 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.409
 Yuriorkis became champion of 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.930
 three categories although this will do 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.569
 interim all have been interim all 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.849
 what happens is that when he wins the 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.829
 championship to cheo red interim that 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.409
 turns incarnation into property and 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.450
 becomes super champion when he wins the 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.849
 title but does not give any but he does not 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.930
 No exact change was gained 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.599
 Clear 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.489
 neither in the 26 nor in the 30 of the 35 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.260
 because with giving it and did not change it with 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.569
 michael farr in honor of champion with cheo 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.549
 Red champion was not so e 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.530
 interns that later became 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.599
 champion he won the interim champion 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.579
 once he won the cordoba of these 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.680
 soloists block that he was the champion and 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.599
 with loreto would come interim champion not 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.299
 he did it to conquer the title 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:13.359
 but so the champion is fine but 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.400
 also interim 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.870
 1823 gentlemen tapiaron now but juan 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.380
 but let me clarify something this I do not 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.300
 I did to defer to giorgio al 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.949
 contrary, I, what I said was that 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.229
 he is the first player in exchange between 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.490
 Chair that I do recognize internships 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.620
 all that forests recognize 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.110
 organisms recognize them 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.210
 simply point out the fact is not of 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.370
 meditate it for nothing I look a lot there 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.500
 one that says health of morelia 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.720
 michoacán mexico from your very personal 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.310
 point of view that would continue for the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.080
 camelo in case but of versus floyd 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.419
 would be on his way to go to brand 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.760
 Carlos Molina or James Kirkland or some 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.110
 another ranked in his division because 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.699
 outside of jobs he has not faced 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.979
 none of the top list of the current of 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.720
 box rec and what would be his way in the 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.580
 almost impossible mission to beat floyd 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.889
 because I think the roads if I win 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.660
 you lose would be different 6 clear but 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.340
 the way to the end the same follow 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.900
 fighting because he is a very young man 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.240
 a man who is just going to turn 23 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.979
 years and if he loses with floyd he's going to be 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.320
 rest a few months and return the struggle and 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.330
 keep fighting and also win or 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.120
 lose a closed controversial fight 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.229
 a rematch would have to wait for 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.460
 pass 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:24.430
 look they say me golden boy showtime 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.800
 the same flower and the same camel after 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.229
 of the fight 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.879
 they will try to see what is possible 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.800
 to find some excuse to do 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.860
 a rebate and that will depend on what 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.020
 happens in that gala but you have to have a 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:42.539
 good excuse because if the fight flies 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:47.240
 win 120 to 108 and follow me the good 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.240
 clear because I imagine 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.730
 dong kim and tron ​​says I greet my people 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.040
 I just wanted to tell you that after seeing 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.930
 the hook fight against folab and the 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.520
 media and German commentators talked 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.550
 of guillermo young as next rival 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.900
 for hook I hope this fight will happen and 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.510
 I can beat this change a 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.880
 street and cheat tell them lion that 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.860
 be prepared to arrive fierce 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.420
 to this fight that we would not want 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.570
 that Guillermo's fight was made 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.790
 with a frame like this is already 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.210
 well in 20 minutes I had time 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.710
 we did not do a fast wic program but 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.280
 tasty was we talked about a whole 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.650
 little juanma fight with where the 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:31.900
 can see the can see in golden 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:34.180
 channel in Latin America in xxvi or in 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.040
 the us that for more we can see it 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.110
 in it you can see they pass the 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.400
 fights of top rank good perfect there 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.980
 We will be watching to see how he is doing 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.780
 then juanma with mike and garcia will be 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.419
 that will lose the name and form of 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.450
 walk or give wings now the value foresee 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:51.310
 or the severe with juanma and good 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:54.250
 I hope that if something happens 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.560
 opposite or be broad also recognizes 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.570
 well but no but I'm not going to go god 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.550

 the racecourse güela like ones 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.270
 if juanma won before asking me if 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.730
 Juan will win Puerto Rico flag 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.380
