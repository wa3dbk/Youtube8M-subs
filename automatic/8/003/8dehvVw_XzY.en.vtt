ok a red bought a new model with the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.930 
ok a red bought a new model with the
to<00:02:10.229> use<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.920> Raider<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.670> make<00:02:11.909> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to use on this Raider and you make a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.600 
to use on this Raider and you make a
video<00:02:12.299> to<00:02:13.019> explain<00:02:13.260> how<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.769> remove<00:02:14.370> this

video to explain how to remove this

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.050 
video to explain how to remove this
model<00:02:15.090> from<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.530> transmitter<00:02:17.040> how<00:02:18.000> to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
model from the the transmitter how to

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.899 
model from the the transmitter how to
remove<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.569> antenna<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.739> out<00:02:20.069> where<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.730> new

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
remove the antenna and out where the new

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.910 
remove the antenna and out where the new
model<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.170> okay<00:02:22.769> a<00:02:22.980> red<00:02:23.519> pot<00:02:24.680> baytree<00:02:25.680> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
model and it okay a red pot baytree to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.539 
model and it okay a red pot baytree to
use<00:02:26.129> on<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.579> so<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.510> do<00:02:27.659> not<00:02:27.870> use<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.590> okay

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
use on it so I do not use this okay

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.149 
use on it so I do not use this okay
because<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.090> don't<00:02:30.299> like<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.900> expend<00:02:31.890> money

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
because I don't like to expend money

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.589 
because I don't like to expend money
with<00:02:33.650> sales<00:02:34.650> power<00:02:35.190> cells<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:35.909> I<00:02:36.209> will<00:02:36.450> use<00:02:36.480> a

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
with sales power cells so I will use a

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.949 
with sales power cells so I will use a
battery<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:39.530> that's<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:41.299> let's<00:02:42.299> turn<00:02:42.599> it<00:02:42.750> on

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
battery and that's it let's turn it on

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.160 
battery and that's it let's turn it on
just<00:02:43.200> do<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.620> see<00:02:43.859> what's<00:02:44.160> coming<00:02:44.700> how<00:02:45.599> is<00:02:45.810> it

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.380 

okay<00:02:49.170> i<00:02:49.620> bought<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.400> bettering<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.120> hot

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
okay i bought this bettering the hot

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.830 
okay i bought this bettering the hot
king<00:02:51.720> okay<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.129> can<00:02:53.370> see<00:02:53.609> that<00:02:53.840> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
king okay and you can see that the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.930 
king okay and you can see that the
connector<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.739> quite<00:02:55.980> different<00:02:56.220> from<00:02:56.519> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
connector is quite different from the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.050 
connector is quite different from the
original<00:02:57.709> one<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.370> can<00:02:59.579> use<00:02:59.790> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
original one but you can use the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.229 
original one but you can use the
connector<00:03:00.569> you<00:03:01.049> just<00:03:01.319> need<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.709> be<00:03:02.239> careful

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
connector you just need to be careful

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.119 
connector you just need to be careful
because<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:04.379> black<00:03:05.040> wire<00:03:05.370> goes<00:03:05.879> to<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:07.129> left

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
because the black wire goes to the left
