00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.280 
else basically this is all a complicated
way<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:38.970> saying<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.720> when<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
way of saying that when you have the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.590 
way of saying that when you have the
content<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> suit<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> 5k<00:01:41.610> display<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.299> iMac

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
content to suit a 5k display the iMac

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.179 
content to suit a 5k display the iMac
shows<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> accurately<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.680> usually<00:01:44.070> with

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
shows it accurately and usually with

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.219 
shows it accurately and usually with
space<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.549> spare<00:01:44.790> otherwise<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.899> tries<00:01:46.079> to

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
space to spare otherwise it tries to

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.210 
space to spare otherwise it tries to
find<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> middle<00:01:46.710> ground<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.040> make

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
find the middle ground to make

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.190 
find the middle ground to make
everything<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.820> more<00:01:47.970> usable<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
everything a little more usable that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.929 
everything a little more usable that
content<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.189> sticky<00:01:50.520> point<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
content thing is the sticky point of the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.630 
content thing is the sticky point of the
retina<00:01:51.210> iMac<00:01:51.329> yeah<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.439> has<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> 5k<00:01:53.070> display<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
retina iMac yeah it has a 5k display and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.399 
retina iMac yeah it has a 5k display and
yeah<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.149> makes<00:01:54.329> most<00:01:54.509> things<00:01:54.720> look<00:01:54.869> amazing

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
yeah that makes most things look amazing

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.410 
yeah that makes most things look amazing

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
more impressive than the last one it'll

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.770

the other thing that usually happens
when<00:02:44.820> Apple<00:02:45.120> bumps<00:02:45.360> up<00:02:45.480> its<00:02:45.630> resolution<00:02:46.170> is

that the first model is slow it takes a
