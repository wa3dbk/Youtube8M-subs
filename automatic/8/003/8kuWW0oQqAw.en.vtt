as<00:05:54.819> my<00:05:55.029> prepared<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:55.419> have<00:05:55.449> more<00:05:55.689> time<00:05:55.870> no<00:05:56.080> I

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
as my prepared you have more time no I

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.210 
as my prepared you have more time no I
think<00:05:56.409> so

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.960 

but<00:06:01.820> maybe<00:06:02.000> that's<00:06:02.210> because<00:06:02.300> I<00:06:02.480> got<00:06:02.600> 17<00:06:03.970> 18

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
but maybe that's because I got 17 18

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.640 
but maybe that's because I got 17 18
thousand<00:06:05.390> kilometers<00:06:05.750> on<00:06:05.870> a<00:06:05.900> hyper<00:06:06.110> motor<00:06:06.350> now

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
thousand kilometers on a hyper motor now

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.400

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.379 
and
so<00:06:12.669> far<00:06:12.939> I've<00:06:13.119> got<00:06:13.150> maybe<00:06:13.629> 500<00:06:14.559> on<00:06:14.680> this<00:06:14.770> one

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
so far I've got maybe 500 on this one

00:06:15.389 --> 00:07:00.110 
so far I've got maybe 500 on this one
let's<00:06:16.389> see<00:06:16.599> how<00:06:16.689> fast<00:06:16.930> this<00:06:17.110> thing<00:06:17.349> can<00:06:17.499> go
