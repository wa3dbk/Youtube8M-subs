00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.539
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.810
 flash virtus.pro and today I would like to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.779
 talk to you about duels and prompt 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.320
 you two subtleties such duels in the world of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.019
 tanks 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.789
 first subtlety when you try 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.830
 someone sharing or someone trying with 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.260
 Dueling you is always very important position 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.390
 here's an example now 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.010
 t-62 rode me I was not ready for 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 this despite the fact that I managed 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.300
 give him a shot he did give me away 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.250
 came to life and the rate of fire of this tank 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.860
 higher accordingly we need it 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.280
 take you need to find such a plot 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.920
 to pause for you to drive off 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.649
 slightly forward formed right 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.899
 caterpillars here with this edge straight line 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.350
 that is, if I hit the gas a little bit and 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.120
 about food ahead with a caterpillar I will have 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.150
 straight line and respectively t-62 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.979
 most likely gets into it and starts with 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.590
 her shoot now pressing on the gas 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.360
 do you shot yourself t-62 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.950
 gives a bag of caterpillar into them and not 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.229
 fits charged we remember yes what u 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.150
 t-62 recharge faster accordingly 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.909
 he gives at a certain point a shot 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.220
 faster than you shoots punches me 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.320
 all the same and now see repair kit 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.060
 still not used at that very 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.110
 the moment he is about to shoot 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.990
 used repair kit and drive forward and 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.670
 here we fly from art and in fact 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.320
 In fact, this is the second small subtlety 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.290
 because that is sixty second floor 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 flew from pt-shki 2 subtlety world of 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.259
 tanks 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.990
 team game on horseradish duel guys 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.490
 play from a team of friends sorry what 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.310
 video so short I have very little 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.040
 time, unfortunately, it is now 4 am 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.350
 me in 2 hours the train Moscow so I 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.990
 I'm doing this short sketch 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.990
 which in my opinion is enough 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.390
 revealing and defines those moments 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.799
 which you must remember and never 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.869
 forget the world of tanks really 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.010
 team play and play it and 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.019
 group is much easier than singly 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.480
 than to drag somehow one by one so 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.909
 cover allies expect them to 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.650
 ask to chat and you 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.569
 get with you was flash virtus.pro 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.980

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.510

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.140
