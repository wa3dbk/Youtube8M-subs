you can see again it has a couple of
shots<00:01:03.780> at<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.350> pme<00:01:04.890> 1s<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.580> then<00:01:06.570> thinks<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
shots at the pme 1s and then thinks to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.070 
shots at the pme 1s and then thinks to
himself<00:01:07.530> well<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
himself well I'm just going to have a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.890 
himself well I'm just going to have a
look<00:01:10.229> reverse<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.070> myself<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
look reverse here and get myself out of

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
look reverse here and get myself out of
history<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.710> has<00:01:14.070> these<00:01:14.400> couple<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
history so we see has these couple of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.820 
history so we see has these couple of
shots<00:01:15.240> at<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> kv-1s<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.229> probably<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
shots at the kv-1s is probably going to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.140 
shots at the kv-1s is probably going to
be<00:01:16.920> dodging<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:17.700> he<00:01:17.759> thinks<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
be dodging the what he thinks is the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.929 
be dodging the what he thinks is the
kv-1s<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.960> shot<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.830> instead<00:01:20.220> manages<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
kv-1s a shot but instead manages to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.990 
kv-1s a shot but instead manages to
completely<00:01:21.659> avoid<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.140> ERL<00:01:22.710> 44<00:01:23.310> there<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
completely avoid the ERL 44 there so a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.039 
completely avoid the ERL 44 there so a
nice<00:01:24.330> piece<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.750> look<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:26.090> ESP<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.360> sixth<00:01:27.840> sense

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
nice piece of look or ESP or sixth sense

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.630 
nice piece of look or ESP or sixth sense
whatever<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> call<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:28.979> from<00:01:29.460> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
whatever you want to call it from that

whatever you want to call it from that
one<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.380> next<00:01:31.619> clip<00:01:31.860> comes<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.340> us<00:01:32.460> from

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
one so this next clip comes to us from

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.840 
one so this next clip comes to us from
spoink<00:01:33.409> 1337<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.770> spoink<00:01:35.130> leak<00:01:35.369> depending<00:01:35.850> on

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
spoink 1337 or spoink leak depending on

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.910 
spoink 1337 or spoink leak depending on
your<00:01:36.090> preference<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.770> see

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
your preference and if you just see

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.980 
your preference and if you just see
spots<00:01:38.250> district<00:01:38.640> plans<00:01:38.820> are<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.509> well

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
spots district plans are to there well

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
spots district plans are to there well
he<00:01:40.320> only<00:01:40.500> gets<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.009> very<00:01:41.310> very<00:01:41.610> top<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.000> his<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
he only gets the very very top of his a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.660 
he only gets the very very top of his a
cab<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.899> still<00:01:43.560> manages<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.009> put<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> shot<00:01:44.640> in

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
cab and still manages to put a shot in

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.820 
cab and still manages to put a shot in
here

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
here

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.800 
here
so<00:01:46.400> it's<00:01:46.580> going<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.730> be<00:01:46.850> one<00:01:47.030> Tim<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.600> quick

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
so it's going to be one Tim the quick

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.800 
so it's going to be one Tim the quick
look<00:01:47.990> at<00:01:48.140> that<00:01:48.260> one<00:01:48.440> probably<00:01:48.680> in<00:01:48.980> slow<00:01:49.220> motion

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
look at that one probably in slow motion

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.240 
look at that one probably in slow motion
so<00:01:50.810> again<00:01:51.230> this<00:01:51.380> comes<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.740> us<00:01:51.770> from<00:01:51.860> users

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
so again this comes to us from users

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.320 
so again this comes to us from users
spoink<00:01:52.640> 1337<00:01:53.630> or<00:01:53.870> slightly<00:01:54.170> depending<00:01:54.800> on

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
spoink 1337 or slightly depending on
