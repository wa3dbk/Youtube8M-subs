our<00:03:05.600> punch<00:03:05.870> stats<00:03:06.170> more<00:03:06.410> punches<00:03:06.890> on<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.760> show

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
our punch stats more punches on the show

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.090 
our punch stats more punches on the show
time<00:03:08.120> stats<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.600> we<00:03:08.720> can<00:03:08.900> calculate<00:03:09.049> I<00:03:09.530> think

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
time stats that we can calculate I think

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.380 
time stats that we can calculate I think
more<00:03:10.280> than<00:03:10.310> any<00:03:10.549> other<00:03:10.700> fighter<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.360> the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
more than any other fighter of the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.940 
more than any other fighter of the
current<00:03:11.780> hair<00:03:11.930> since<00:03:12.170> we<00:03:12.290> started<00:03:12.500> doing<00:03:12.709> how

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
current hair since we started doing how

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.170 
current hair since we started doing how
many<00:03:13.010> rocks<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.450> volume<00:03:14.989> punching<00:03:15.590> and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
many rocks this is volume punching and

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.880 
many rocks this is volume punching and
moving<00:03:17.180> here<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:18.230> think<00:03:18.350> that<00:03:18.560> is

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
moving here and so I think that is

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.140 
moving here and so I think that is
opponents<00:03:19.310> probably<00:03:19.549> start<00:03:19.880> thinking<00:03:20.090> about

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
opponents probably start thinking about

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.500 
opponents probably start thinking about
what's<00:03:20.359> coming<00:03:20.420> at<00:03:20.720> them<00:03:20.870> that's<00:03:21.109> interesting
