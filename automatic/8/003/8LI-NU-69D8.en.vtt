00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
like it and make it small enough so you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.749 
like it and make it small enough so you
can<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.920> short<00:01:56.130> amount<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.340> time<00:01:56.430> that

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
can do it in a short amount of time that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.399

you<00:01:57.270> could<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.570> through<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> completion<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
you could see through to completion and

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.289 
you could see through to completion and
that<00:01:58.500> will<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> much<00:01:59.670> better<00:01:59.820> way<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> learn

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
that will be a much better way to learn
