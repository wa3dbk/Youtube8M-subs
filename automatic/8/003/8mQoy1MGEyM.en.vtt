from I record on this basically these

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.230 
from I record on this basically these
chords<00:04:51.310> in<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.460> back<00:04:51.610> here<00:04:51.819> they've<00:04:51.940> run<00:04:52.150> to

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
chords in the back here they've run to

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.869 
chords in the back here they've run to
my<00:04:52.330> TV<00:04:52.569> and<00:04:52.930> then<00:04:53.409> my<00:04:53.710> AV<00:04:54.340> cable<00:04:54.729> that<00:04:54.849> runs

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
my TV and then my AV cable that runs

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.600 
my TV and then my AV cable that runs
usually<00:04:55.360> for<00:04:55.509> my<00:04:55.599> xbox<00:04:55.840> or<00:04:56.229> my<00:04:56.349> ps3<00:04:56.590> goes<00:04:57.310> into

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
usually for my xbox or my ps3 goes into

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.950 
usually for my xbox or my ps3 goes into
the<00:04:57.759> bottom<00:04:58.180> part<00:04:58.210> right<00:04:58.419> here<00:04:58.599> you<00:04:58.690> can<00:04:58.810> see

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
the bottom part right here you can see

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.499 
the bottom part right here you can see
right<00:04:59.110> there<00:04:59.169> and<00:04:59.610> it<00:05:00.610> kind<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.120> creates<00:05:01.389> a

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
right there and it kind of creates a

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.870 
right there and it kind of creates a
circuit<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.590> USB<00:05:02.860> runs<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.400> my<00:05:03.490> computer

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
circuit and the USB runs to my computer

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.059 
circuit and the USB runs to my computer
and<00:05:04.030> this<00:05:04.090> is<00:05:04.300> my<00:05:04.449> computer<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:05.440> back<00:05:05.680> up<00:05:05.860> for

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
and this is my computer so back up for

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.059 
and this is my computer so back up for
you<00:05:06.479> I<00:05:07.479> don't<00:05:08.020> know<00:05:08.139> eight<00:05:08.349> gigabytes<00:05:08.710> of<00:05:08.800> RAM

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
you I don't know eight gigabytes of RAM

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.409 
you I don't know eight gigabytes of RAM
I<00:05:09.430> don't<00:05:09.550> really<00:05:09.669> know<00:05:09.819> all<00:05:09.849> the<00:05:09.970> statistics

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
on it 750 gigabytes of memory and it

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.279 
on it 750 gigabytes of memory and it
kind<00:05:13.330> of<00:05:13.360> need<00:05:13.509> a<00:05:13.539> lot<00:05:13.690> of<00:05:13.720> space<00:05:13.990> I<00:05:14.169> was

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
kind of need a lot of space I was

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.320 
kind of need a lot of space I was

actually gonna buy an external terabyte
of<00:05:16.360> memory<00:05:16.630> because<00:05:17.409> I<00:05:17.860> just<00:05:18.669> don't<00:05:18.789> have

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940

I'm<00:05:20.530> recording<00:05:20.770> with<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.909> PVR<00:05:22.210> it<00:05:22.479> takes

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
I'm recording with the the PVR it takes

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.540 
I'm recording with the the PVR it takes
up<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.900> lot<00:05:23.050> of<00:05:23.080> space<00:05:23.319> so<00:05:23.949> yeah<00:05:24.069> this<00:05:24.219> is<00:05:24.340> my

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
up a lot of space so yeah this is my

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.490 
up a lot of space so yeah this is my
computer<00:05:25.090> will<00:05:25.930> go<00:05:26.020> through<00:05:26.199> all<00:05:26.229> this<00:05:26.319> stuff

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
computer will go through all this stuff

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.899 
computer will go through all this stuff
on<00:05:26.650> here<00:05:26.889> and<00:05:27.190> that's<00:05:27.430> actually<00:05:27.580> a<00:05:27.789> my

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
on here and that's actually a my

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.189 
on here and that's actually a my
microphone<00:05:28.389> that<00:05:28.539> I<00:05:28.569> use<00:05:28.719> actually<00:05:29.020> maybe<00:05:29.169> I

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
microphone that I use actually maybe I

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.270 
microphone that I use actually maybe I
should<00:05:29.319> show<00:05:29.349> you<00:05:29.500> my<00:05:29.560> chair<00:05:29.860> don't<00:05:30.130> only

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
should show you my chair don't only

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.399 
should show you my chair don't only
think<00:05:30.520> it<00:05:30.610> matters<00:05:30.909> but<00:05:31.090> it's<00:05:31.539> cracking<00:05:32.050> it's

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
think it matters but it's cracking it's

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:33.659 
think it matters but it's cracking it's
wearing<00:05:32.800> out<00:05:32.889> but<00:05:33.250> it's<00:05:33.370> really<00:05:33.460> comfortable

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
wearing out but it's really comfortable

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
but let's go through here we are on my a

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.209 
but let's go through here we are on my a
channel<00:05:40.000> and<00:05:40.620> we'll<00:05:41.620> start<00:05:41.830> this<00:05:41.949> is<00:05:42.099> how<00:05:42.190> I

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
channel and we'll start this is how I

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.129 
channel and we'll start this is how I
record<00:05:42.460> so<00:05:43.150> this<00:05:43.300> is<00:05:43.449> the<00:05:43.539> software<00:05:43.930> you<00:05:44.110> use

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
record so this is the software you use

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.800 
record so this is the software you use
arcsoft<00:05:44.680> total<00:05:45.099> media<00:05:45.250> extreme<00:05:45.880> so<00:05:46.539> you<00:05:46.599> know

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
arcsoft total media extreme so you know

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.689 
arcsoft total media extreme so you know
just<00:05:47.020> click<00:05:47.319> capture<00:05:47.740> in<00:05:47.889> this<00:05:48.009> program<00:05:48.550> and

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
just click capture in this program and

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.519 
just click capture in this program and
our<00:05:48.789> record<00:05:49.120> whatever<00:05:49.360> I<00:05:49.509> want<00:05:49.719> then<00:05:50.319> I<00:05:50.349> will
