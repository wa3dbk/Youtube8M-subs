cyborg does have a later model but I

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.779 
cyborg does have a later model but I
felt<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.110> would<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> job<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.670> you're

it's<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.610> you've<00:00:48.000> ever<00:00:48.180> heard<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.570> cyborg

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it's not if you've ever heard of cyborg

it's not if you've ever heard of cyborg
peripherals<00:00:49.590> then<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.190> they're<00:00:50.370> all

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
peripherals then you know they're all

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.100 
peripherals then you know they're all
about<00:00:50.789> letting<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> modify<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> shape<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
about letting you modify the shape of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
about letting you modify the shape of
your<00:00:52.170> device<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.829> liking<00:00:53.250> now<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.059> course

to function the stick must be screwed on

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.310 
to function the stick must be screwed on
but<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.270> great<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.750> storing<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.199> odd

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320

locked<00:01:06.150> onto<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> device<00:01:06.720> what<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:07.530> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
locked onto the device what now it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.230 
locked onto the device what now it
doesn't<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.369> look<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.700> what's<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
doesn't really look like what's on the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.660 
doesn't really look like what's on the
box<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.750> these<00:01:09.840> thrusters<00:01:10.409> look<00:01:10.619> silly<00:01:10.920> well

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
box and these thrusters look silly well

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700 
box and these thrusters look silly well
after<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.180> 5<00:01:12.540> seconds<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.140> figured<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> out

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
after about 5 seconds I figured it out

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.950 
after about 5 seconds I figured it out
and<00:01:13.920> felt<00:01:14.130> really<00:01:14.280> stupid<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.630> pull<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and felt really stupid you just pull it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
and felt really stupid you just pull it
apart<00:01:16.020> pretty<00:01:16.799> cool<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:17.299> this<00:01:18.299> is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
apart pretty cool actually this is

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.300 
apart pretty cool actually this is
definitely<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.200> most<00:01:19.470> portable<00:01:19.920> flight

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
definitely the most portable flight

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
definitely the most portable flight
stick<00:01:20.610> I've<00:01:20.790> ever<00:01:21.060> owned<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.720> good

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
stick I've ever owned and that's good

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.539 
stick I've ever owned and that's good
because<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.320> won't<00:01:22.560> take<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.890> much<00:01:22.920> room<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.430> my

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
because it won't take up much room in my

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.370 
because it won't take up much room in my
closet<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> next<00:01:24.479> decade<00:01:24.900> while<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> wait

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
out the device has a few points of

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
out the device has a few points of
interest<00:01:29.700> where<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.360> adjust<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.900> I'll

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
interest where you can adjust it I'll

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.840 
interest where you can adjust it I'll

a<00:01:35.100> simple<00:01:35.400> up-and-down<00:01:35.850> adjustment<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> fit

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
a simple up-and-down adjustment to fit

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.960 
a simple up-and-down adjustment to fit
your<00:01:36.810> hand<00:01:36.960> size<00:01:37.250> just<00:01:38.250> under<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.820> these

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
your hand size just under that of these

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.460 
your hand size just under that of these
four<00:01:39.210> holes<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.600> allow<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.049> adjust<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
four holes that allow you to adjust the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.010 
four holes that allow you to adjust the
rake<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.670> only<00:01:41.939> way<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> adjust<00:01:42.299> them<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.899> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
rake the only way to adjust them is to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.840 
rake the only way to adjust them is to
use<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> small<00:01:43.439> object<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:44.009> push<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> pin<00:01:44.579> in

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
use a small object to push the pin in

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.420 
use a small object to push the pin in
and<00:01:45.030> swivel<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> stick<00:01:46.110> back<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.530> forth<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
and swivel the stick back and forth it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.160 
and swivel the stick back and forth it
seems<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> strange<00:01:48.299> concept<00:01:48.600> that's<00:01:49.049> such

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
seems like a strange concept that's such

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.749 
seems like a strange concept that's such
an<00:01:49.290> important<00:01:49.740> adjustment<00:01:50.340> will<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.579> so

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
an important adjustment will be so

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.510 
an important adjustment will be so
hidden<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.960> also<00:01:52.170> difficult<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.860> adjust<00:01:53.310> in

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
hidden it's also difficult to adjust in

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.950 
hidden it's also difficult to adjust in

how<00:02:38.440> does<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.709> perform<00:02:38.910> well<00:02:39.910> for<00:02:39.940> starters<00:02:40.510> it

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
how does it perform well for starters it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.050 
how does it perform well for starters it
has<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.930> yaw<00:02:41.230> function<00:02:41.769> which<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.160> great<00:02:42.430> yeah<00:02:43.030> I

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
has a yaw function which is great yeah I

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.240 
has a yaw function which is great yeah I
find<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.540> silly<00:02:43.780> -<00:02:44.080> who<00:02:44.560> makes<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.830> joystick

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
find it silly - who makes a joystick

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.370 
find it silly - who makes a joystick
without<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> yaw<00:02:45.760> function<00:02:46.269> but<00:02:46.569> they<00:02:46.660> do<00:02:46.720> exist

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
without a yaw function but they do exist

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
but for games like Battlefield 3 it had

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.140 
but for games like Battlefield 3 it had
a<00:03:16.540> number<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.930> issues<00:03:17.380> if<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:18.250> simply<00:03:18.700> plug<00:03:19.000> it

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
a number of issues if you simply plug it

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.240 
a number of issues if you simply plug it
in<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.390> go<00:03:19.510> play<00:03:19.810> you'll<00:03:20.350> find<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.769> lose<00:03:21.010> the

in and go play you'll find you lose the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.099

ability<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.730> sprint<00:03:22.120> as<00:03:22.359> a<00:03:22.390> soldier<00:03:22.780> and

whenever you switch your weapons they

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.910 
whenever you switch your weapons they
fire<00:03:25.359> it's<00:03:25.989> very<00:03:26.260> strange

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
fire it's very strange

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.310 
fire it's very strange
so<00:03:27.549> even<00:03:27.880> after<00:03:28.120> setting<00:03:28.359> the<00:03:28.570> binds<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:29.140> was

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
so even after setting the binds I was

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.800 
so even after setting the binds I was
still<00:03:29.560> having<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.950> few<00:03:30.160> issues<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:31.480> device

I<00:03:42.430> also<00:03:43.209> found<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.660> lot<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.840> answers<00:03:44.320> but<00:03:44.560> they

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
I also found a lot of answers but they

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.490 
I also found a lot of answers but they
were<00:03:44.769> all<00:03:44.980> really<00:03:45.310> crazy<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.380> realized<00:03:47.380> that

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
were all really crazy I realized that

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.140 
were all really crazy I realized that
the<00:03:47.620> real<00:03:47.829> issue<00:03:48.040> was<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.579> couldn't<00:03:48.940> clear

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
the real issue was that I couldn't clear

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.449 
the real issue was that I couldn't clear
binds<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:49.750> battlefield<00:03:50.260> 3<00:03:50.320> so<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.010> found<00:03:51.340> a

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
binds in battlefield 3 so I found a

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.490 
binds in battlefield 3 so I found a
really<00:03:51.730> nice<00:03:52.000> free<00:03:52.480> third-party<00:03:53.049> program

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
really nice free third-party program

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.530 
really nice free third-party program
that<00:03:53.980> allows<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.459> set<00:03:54.730> binds<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.329> clear

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
that allows you to set binds and clear

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.880 
that allows you to set binds and clear
them<00:03:55.720> without<00:03:56.049> having<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.440> boot<00:03:56.590> up<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.739> game

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
them without having to boot up the game

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.819 
them without having to boot up the game
very<00:03:57.700> handy<00:03:58.090> I'll<00:03:58.540> make<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:58.959> how-to<00:03:59.200> video<00:03:59.769> on

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
very handy I'll make a how-to video on

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:00.449 
very handy I'll make a how-to video on
this<00:04:00.069> later

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
this later

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.979 
this later
but<00:04:00.910> it's<00:04:01.030> important<00:04:01.390> to<00:04:01.480> remember<00:04:01.720> that

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
but it's important to remember that

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.210 
but it's important to remember that
you're<00:04:02.109> going<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.440> spend<00:04:02.650> at<00:04:02.769> least<00:04:02.799> 10

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
you're going to spend at least 10

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.069 
you're going to spend at least 10
minutes<00:04:03.430> installing<00:04:04.090> software<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.810> tweaking

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
minutes installing software and tweaking

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.620 
minutes installing software and tweaking
the<00:04:05.290> binds<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.890> also<00:04:06.790> keep<00:04:06.970> in<00:04:07.090> mind<00:04:07.150> this

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
the binds and also keep in mind this

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.030 
the binds and also keep in mind this
isn't<00:04:07.930> going<00:04:08.049> to<00:04:08.109> be<00:04:08.230> an<00:04:08.350> issue<00:04:08.470> for<00:04:08.829> every

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
isn't going to be an issue for every

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.789 
isn't going to be an issue for every
game<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.579> being<00:04:10.389> said<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.930> device<00:04:11.139> has<00:04:11.410> one

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
last problem the buttons do not

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.809 
last problem the buttons do not
correspond<00:04:14.769> with<00:04:14.980> what<00:04:15.160> they<00:04:15.310> claimed<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.609> be

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
correspond with what they claimed to be

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.270 
correspond with what they claimed to be
at<00:04:16.209> least<00:04:16.570> in<00:04:16.780> most<00:04:16.930> games<00:04:17.289> for<00:04:18.190> example

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
at least in most games for example

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.089 
at least in most games for example
button<00:04:18.880> 6<00:04:19.329> shows<00:04:19.780> up<00:04:19.989> as<00:04:20.139> button<00:04:20.470> 1<00:04:20.769> on<00:04:20.979> the

button 6 shows up as button 1 on the

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.070 
button 6 shows up as button 1 on the
software<00:04:21.459> so<00:04:22.150> you<00:04:22.210> think<00:04:22.539> that<00:04:22.599> button<00:04:22.960> number

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
software so you think that button number

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.740 
software so you think that button number
7<00:04:23.590> will<00:04:23.770> be<00:04:23.800> button<00:04:24.190> number<00:04:24.310> 2<00:04:24.669> it<00:04:25.300> actually

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
7 will be button number 2 it actually

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.570 
7 will be button number 2 it actually
shows<00:04:26.020> up<00:04:26.260> as

three it gets even sillier the trigger
shows<00:04:29.729> up<00:04:29.940> as<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.090> pad<00:04:30.509> up<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.319> others<00:04:31.590> are

also on the only thing that really shows

also on the only thing that really shows
up<00:04:34.500> spot-on<00:04:34.889> is<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.370> eight<00:04:35.520> way<00:04:35.729> hats<00:04:36.000> which

all this is only an oddity and it's not

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
really a big negative overall the device

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.159 
really a big negative overall the device
seems<00:04:41.940> like<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.120> flight<00:04:42.389> stick<00:04:42.659> worth<00:04:42.870> way<00:04:43.139> more

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
seems like a flight stick worth way more

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.260 
seems like a flight stick worth way more
