00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi girls so I find for 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.180
 a video that were requested at the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.529
 very safe sauce no information about 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.900
 permanence in four years 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.780
 I will show you I made a drawing 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.099
 in the tale to be made obvious with a 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.470
 what does it mean when 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.210
 can one year alkalde then result is going 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.590
 to be more natural if you lose a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.310
 time a gnawed horns the area 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.689
 so we put on May 1st you say high 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.400
 level so the middle of the eyes are done 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.269
 well the separation as usual of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.640
 the thickness and the gold mine 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.440
 curlers and then we 'll ask those to 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.540
 side and then alternated that wants it 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.450
 say have imposed the first start of the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.739
 curler in the middle of the first of the boutis 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.870
 and so on we evolve mostly from 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.670
 the head 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.930
 so I think that's good because 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.870
 the effect is much more natural 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.020
 will say that a nine- zone permanent 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.640
 but their most difficult to achieve 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.620
 good so here I show you well 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.629
 their is so just to show everything in 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.320
 cause the first curlers after that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.519
 actually depends how the the person does 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 wants the games made heaven there back 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.780
 we wanted the harsh winters ariel if 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.130
 she and wants to turn to her face on 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.119
 now goes like that with more or less 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.619
 tilt so then it's fine 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.540
 moisten the hair so you can 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.920
 this would allow better smoothing of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:27.090
 snows then then it has to be the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.130
 brush comb and brush the pen ya 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.649
 that in this country 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.179
 so here I imagine how we will have the 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.090
 hair France here for example 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.170
 robbie gould forward and so I 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.140
 take all the other hair in 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.289
 back I'm going to take my first 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:52.990
 league says I'll take the middle of 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:52.990
 eyes as benchmarks the thickness for 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.390
 the thickness of the curler young team 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.390
 before putting it down 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.649
 we say 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:20.170
 then for me but I'm not getting 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.060
 get wet I take my paper tip and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.940
 we position ourselves well 90 degrees so that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.650
 compared to the skull for him to do 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.430
 10 come to the level of the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:43.060
 recession neither in front nor behind so a 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:45.400
 time well here it is 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.020
 then two of their actions of which I will 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.290
 explained there I put curlers 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:03:03.400
 similar in the same axis as the first 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:05.530
 noon we wind it in the direction a 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.000
 just showed the separation that most 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.950
 important in my opinion this is the second 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.970
 so I take I 'm going from the middle 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.900
 curler actually doing that too 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.610
 will allow them to have no break 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.440
 because if I am to Noon 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.210
 curlers curlers the queen of the middle 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.850
 and down there will be no hair in 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.380
 that sense we finally take his fine 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.940
 break in the curlers so the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.770
 but it's really to alternate for 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:36.930
 avoid that 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:39.830
 so we always react from the light 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.830
 I will pass 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.430
 fuction 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.140
 the successes that are said well up 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.140
 90 Â° in paper tip 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:06.810
 I see the tastes and kind if there are any 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.150
 little hair going on wanted one 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.280
 pull them with your hands or you 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.520
 serve as a welcome comb for 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:20.120
 maintain the time we are here I have 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:25.200
 imposed my second the shops of 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.870
 games by jimmy better and we will evolve 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.780
 so look for the head 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.230
 in my opinion it's more delicate when he 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.070
 there are small hair on the side at this 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.140
 moment there I think it's important 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.820
 to have long hair rollers and 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.460
 curlers for my brother I have classes 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.930
 and on the a9 zone is frankly 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.090
 not necessary one can iron with the 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.050
 big leagues or says but I find that 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:53.070
 on the lake a directional consulate I 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.330
 think it's helpful and having to have 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.830
 size of because there are times 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.280
 where we will arrive on small areas 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:04.290
 at the ears or hello 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.210
 the employee on late that's so I'm going 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.620
 just show you how wheels 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.930
 because that would like patricia me 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.250
 spoke then a form will have to leave 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.760
 rule we mean the permanent and 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.169
 reims and for disassembly beautiful admits 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.150
 start on the job in the arena in 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.240
 general we start with the back there 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.440
 must roll out the curler next to the leather 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.180
 hair and ball pulled up 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.570
 otherwise we will break the voice in recovers 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.720
 the paper points and we forget them in 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.890
 the ferry and at that moment in fact we're going 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.600
 recover like that all the papers 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.270
 painted in a hand and curlers years 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.120
 to write it 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.740
 the rest and the important thing is really 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.810
 to not pull big jim and the 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:47.110
 unwind at the level of the scalp for 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:48.190
 just avoid the effect of ba2 because 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.390
 in fact we will enforce 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.210
 once we have dismantled the permanent 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.340
 we look at the neutralizing product so 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.050
 it will reform and we can do some 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.090
 hair and that will allow them to 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.640
 loop so that's important to dance 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.910
 why in the very near presses 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.910
 skull 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:11.290
 then what is there to translate 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.000
 also yes I wanted to talk to you about them 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.320
 what was interesting to know about 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.900
 time we do not think about it is that if we 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.700
 wants to do English and that can 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.040
 to be not bad for if you are a hairdresser 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.930
 and you have sisters again they 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.700
 wanted to do English at Christmas and 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.650
 that it's really good we have 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.570
 filled hair curlers like these it's 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.540
 to say really vertical compared to the 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.430
 ground on all the head and at that moment 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.580
 when you see that the wheels will make 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.410
 down and that I think it's going to be 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.330
 good to know that it will come more than if 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:44.680
 so do you do the same in maths 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
 for styling in you 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:51.100
 do with mid january sopra aims 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:55.080
 also and so here in the sequel for 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.270
 hope words your papers tip 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.250
 and so that's the result so this one 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.409
 I had it done a week start she 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.669
 had time to dry properly 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:05.039
 to show you a little the result his 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.689
 late she has her hair really run and 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:13.800
 I had curlers sercel so that 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:14.939
 change a little bit and her sheep and so if 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.500
 you have two questions about 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:18.000
 permanent or change styling 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.689
 Feel free to leave comments 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.439
 below for a re more videos 

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:24.090
 on your request 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:26.639
 here I thank you for watching 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.500
 this video I 'll see you soon for 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:31.319
 a series of videos for the saint 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:37.919
 valentine car tutorials I planned 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:39.599
 of an art of prisoners of the day and 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.370
 I would like to make a video but that 

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:43.800
 seems to me a little complicated of the ideas of 

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.259
 gifts just for those who know 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.169
 not to build their going valentine 

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:50.370
 here I wish you a good 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.979
 weekend because I was trying to post 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:56.090
 this video pretty quickly and I say to 

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:56.090
 very soon ciao 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.240
 this
