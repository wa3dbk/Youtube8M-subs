00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.870
 Reaction time are slightly slower driving Lett 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.910
 Thus, they must be hard as a value indicated aesthetics image resolution year 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.989
 Play breaks 80 lines 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:14.850
 sda 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.590
 Asking for passport what does it mean what does it mean it seems it is very 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.590
 difficult to explain 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.890
 since the moving picture resolution Blackburn Rovers and based on a Fr 4 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.259
 Ounces of laboratory 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.430
 on arrangement down also presses dead due to put and dr that 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 Word that I have a barrel of beer 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.720
 in a certain speed jur the monitor so to speak as the 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.289
 so-called Aufstocker smoke formed run and that of 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.100
 been reported left to right 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.660
 and if then percent that at the beginning of the person group left side 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.220
 as picture content can be seen in a certain time and in which the procedure 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.350
 of which we now speak that five seconds 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.570
 the bzö the right side penetrates 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.720
 then I have now defined the first speeds 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.710
 with this the picture then, so to speak 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.070
 left to right 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.030
 and now it depends 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.549
 at this speed now goes with this applies applies so to speak 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.479
 wait are individual lines 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.630
 «Before this court 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.200
 Sven Liesegang Jackpot percent each run around 15 million not more than 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.940
 to recognize lonely demarcated lines but from then disappear 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.000
 anyone can understand that because noticed 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.670
 Speeds Mirko Casper on the street 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.880
 seven cars can be slow from the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.380
 every detail of this ordo deal for example the demarcation to the discs 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.720
 to see exactly this place has a very high speed percent then 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.400
 spared it from the Benninger field who ultimately to one 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.980
 a jarring image leads to the annoyance of football in Schweich sent itself 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.409
 that is allowed 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.360
 the typical motion blur 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.580
 and we just said we want to have a one percent measurement method that 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.250
 you can somehow summarize in numbers 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.980
 there one said yes if I this black man on a white background the 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.980
 Break in 5 seconds once again across both screens 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:13.799
 Polytec now like Big 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.679
 the line or we still win the line 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.459
 before she starts to disappear 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.980
 and then you have to be determined the lines 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.159
 so designed 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.229
 Breaks 80 on the broad the device is now, so to speak, there are or one 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.829
 Lines thousand 80 STA the width of the talked 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.109
 that the last line is not yet sharp can detect in this movement 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:39.829
 if I take breaks instead of 80 now 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.579
 vertical lines 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.929
 on the screen was a normal thousand 200 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:45.929
 then it would 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:50.269
 since so little show this ornamental factory and I would the demarcation 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.109
 between 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.639
 not really seeing the percent anymore 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.940
 and that's just the way it is 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.070
 This also looks as if we are already well acquainted with talent 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.239
 occurrence 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.250
 because you have problems with it or more with full hd devices 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:06.969
 thousand 80 lines speaks 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:07.999
 so that means 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.490
 Seen statically correct 10 falls he that 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.380
 then yes, and so on over a thousand 80 lines to the 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.660
 physically this device has and in the 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.749
 wide thousand and nine thousand 920 line 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:22.139
 So each line has a thousand 920 pixels that is the 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.449
 full-hd resolution 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.699
 but I mean static resolution 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.949
 and that the number break after the number of lines 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.799
 in the moving picture resolution, the number thousand is 80 the number of the line 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:39.149
 Dirk Popp Latakaite on the screen are still individually visible while Paul 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:40.239
 and 100 were 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.569
 no longer clean so to speak this abbreviation show that one 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:44.890
 Establishment dissolution 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.880
 which has only in common with the static resolution 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.179
 that you tried here with 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:53.269
 with points percent or with the definition percent of a geometric one 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.319
 Size, so to speak, the percent too 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.180
 Justify the watch 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.420
 as a priest in his own case Tauss 80 teams come out just what such 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.430
 Resolutions gone 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.209
 is equivalent to both 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.169
 Exactly because he is so that has not been less than half a share case a bland 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.109
 to do the process in front of the TV 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.040
 This is perhaps the best way to explain this to the war 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.130
 that you also still like the other device classes we are talking about 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.489
 over a thousand 80's 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.259
 around moving image resolution Baumgartner 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.939
 and these are the mayo-klinik League the measure we have 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.159
 if we do that now measures that do not have this movement improvement 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:30.300
 feature 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.580
 for example, our base device on the highway Venice Milan 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.469
 These then reach 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:39.229
 because the extra technology was not on board 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.279
 then he presses at his moving resolution of 9 900 lie 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.430
 with around one percent 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.310
 LCD TV with the latest energetic lobby 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.270
 maybe it will make 800 lie 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.460
 and a lcd-tv from the assortment of goods as well as at 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.780
 Panasonic but so very cheap ready 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.320
 that would also compare 600 lines and you will notice these numbers 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.710
 you do not necessarily have more with you 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.509
 to do in HDTV resolution 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.059
 the traffic will have become possible for the willing to change 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.029
 nevertheless physically as Full HD television 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:13.749
 a thousand 29 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.389
 Waldhausen 80 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.599
 wonders 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.740
 Michel Pont but I am on my notebook and its technology 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.180
 Nature to plasma these breaks 80 line we reach through the application 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.930
 the 600 hertz technology over it so hides in technology 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.610
 device 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.960
 just for that 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.289
 that due to a 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:35.169
 especially 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.020
 intensive data management 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.800
 where could imagine how 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.830
 yes, just have a look what the injured abilities have in his 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.689
 graphic card 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.020
 so there was a term from the computer world now just margins yes 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.310
 that was just pissed off how can you percent this term 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:52.960
 the data rate 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.380
 Percent will finally be implemented in the year he realized a lot 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.440
 Spending on information and can be very very good through its partners 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.469
 Implement technology 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.829
 and the result is that a very very high and also measurable moving picture above 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.479
 IZ Systems US 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:13.789
 the promo but the logical limit so a thousand 80 are very good values ​​from 80 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.180
 lines 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.020
 somewhere is a limit so no end arbitrarily hochuli the pushups 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.699
 to increase 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.289
 the height would be the highest one would depend on the integrity 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.320
 Number of points changed within a species 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.779
 Breaks 29 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:31.360
 Cans or 20 Willy Theobald by desert percent 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.910
 Moving image resolution of the average can make Waltenberger the Schaeffler 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:35.820
 AG represent 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.020
 even if it is me now 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.300
 Steve Waite probably already on a device if I now instead of five 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.180
 seconds 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.159
 so need from left to right 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:48.969
 when I was at it now normal continues to follow the path 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:51.909
 then yes, by unanimous clairvoyant abilities was added 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:53.949
 the same device with the same technology 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.330
 not 80 percent 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.050
 line-cheap- image resolution or rifles Müller 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.960
 that might soon be four seconds 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.319
 Percent more wheels static resolution is 320 then would have 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.100
 you can calculate 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.309
 that one must speak with a best of wander also percent 

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:10.389
 court 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:12.080
 Dollars went out to see this 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.139
 this value 5 seconds speed now it is very important that would have 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.360
 you always go to the 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.400
 many citizens see declared Barroso wants to go public which was almost like a 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.919
 very specific nature of this Graz water as twelve percent below 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:28.879
 to develop for it is used 

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:33.419
 and to us exactly the nature of the speed camera with the 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:36.190
 Walking group almost still doing so was around Wulfen 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.979
 offer objective approach 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:40.629
 these things too 

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:41.669
 Percent 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.229
 and me just on the northeast and now I find myself without me good night 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:48.979
 The new album sincerely for many, the people know 

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.990
 and so Mertes the 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.129
 Percent the entire experimental setup needs to be described 

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:58.240
 and then you can spend a work and just do it together around 80 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.900
 Lines moving pictures resolution that is now my work if i have this 

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.490
 Procedure does not know I can also rate it percent because I do not know 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.509
 and I can not do it either 

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:08.960
 in any way, so to speak
