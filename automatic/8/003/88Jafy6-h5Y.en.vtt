 combined with a radar detector let's 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.990
 let's go through the configuration it includes 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.740
 instruction in Russian 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.470

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.460
 memory card leader 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.290
 I want to note that memory cards in 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.909
 the kit does not have to buy it from 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.909
 money and the device itself 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.140
 now let's look at the device 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.960
 closer standard case for this 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.080
 device class front lens 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.120
 camcorders 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.670
 DVR here reception 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.960

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.080

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.070
 here is a connector for memory cards and from 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.030
 well and blood in the management of the body 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.090
 top shiny bottom matte what can 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.050
 say about the quality of shooting 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.050
 look now 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.560
 read 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.020
 to kid 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.470
 The shooting quality is quite good. 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.350
 can say polo subjective 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.090
 my opinion on how a combo that is i 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.800
 does not claim to 100 percent 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:55.640
 reliably purely my opinion is good 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.280
 device worthy well for myself I would personally 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.360
 looked away 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.790
 analogs are karkam combo 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.430
 here there is this show combo on bomann 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.760
 here u cark combo me more 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.430
 I liked the display of cameras that is 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.530
 as he writes on the screen about how much 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.480
 distance at a distance which one 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.010
 the reception that's not gone 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.700
 me on more informative that is there 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.530
 more inscription made me more 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.290
 like so basically in range 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.850
 reception is not and almost identical there 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.900
 plus minus depending on man 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:40.050
 with a batch of tones a model is included there 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.340
 corners of anybody again we are from special 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.340
 views of cards full 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.690
 Although I repeat the principle of the model for my 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.060
 money is quite good 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.240
