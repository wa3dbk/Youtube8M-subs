00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:05.140
 ok this video server to show the new features introduced with col 

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:08.259
 boysss in Italian a few days ago 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.299
 let's start by doing a search on gugol 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.299
 we are looking for photos of michelle obama 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.859
 photo of michelle obama 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.279
 picture of michelle obama 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.179
 try 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.179
 Rome quirinale 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.390
 Rome quirinale 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.450
 I would say that it works perfectly 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.700
 as a research 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.970
 we see the navigation part that the same 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.559
 suppose we have no address 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.200
 I'm only in one place now 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.300
 for example I am in Genoa 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.860
 and only then there are drugs and cristiano ronaldo ne 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.850
 one address only 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 pronounces it 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.430
 ribaldone genova pharmacy 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.940
 for other text to speech absolutely 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.180
 so nothing while I move will tell me where to go 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.880
 textual indications and even you can go with street view but to this 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.719
 point is mandatory to have 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.719
 clearly a connection in 3g 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.710
 show me 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.410
 every curve 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.460
 what should I do is let me see the app image for an intersection 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.710
 I would say that it is truly exceptional 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.010
 rep clearly I can also enter the addresses 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.600
 for example 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 insert 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.610
 genova piazza palermo 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.760
 and he quietly 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.159
 elaborates to go to piazza palermo genova 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.839
 the same thing 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:17.019
 and perhaps even more comfortable you can do with a text message 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.009
 here I am 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.689
 tonight we go to the cinema at 8pm 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.379
 or 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
 see you directly at the station 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.709
 and so on this can be used clearly 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.199
 a bit in all applications even in cold cure 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.419
 suppose that 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.569
 I want to go see 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.569
 red king 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.199
 it's not a monument any coliseum we say 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.689
 just gives us the chance to search 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.299
 search 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:24.619
 if 8 rome 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.139
 he clearly understood Rome's Colosseum and is taking us 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.739
 sheep 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.269
 photo 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.000
 this can be done clearly for any type of location I don't know e 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.850
 maybe even 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.890
 I've never tried but without specifying the location wheel 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.949
 and it goes well then 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:01.339
 eyes 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.339
 donkey tower 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:06.979
 indeed 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.029
 you specify places 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.139
 brings me the tower of resia sinelli 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.139
 directly 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.359
 can also be clearly used with the volume 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.689
 any 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.930
 need 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.219
 with any e-mail 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:28.629
 however if you suffer 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:33.860
 I think it puts any quicksync is a voice recognition 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.219
 if I want to write something on gugol half 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.960
 just wait a moment 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.300
 write message and it works exactly like they were for text messages 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.729
 today i can't come to the office i'm sick see you tomorrow 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.439
 actually this bike spoke a little distant 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.439
 however direct understood without problems 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.969
 I'm fine, this is how a very big compliment to a good reason 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.120
 for I think it is 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.120
 truly truly an innovation 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:13.769
 which is not all about nexus world but all 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.370
 android terminals that mount lol 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.749
 cleaner version we can two. 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:25.490
 let's wait with froyo that the thing should be further improved 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.129
 Hi everyone
