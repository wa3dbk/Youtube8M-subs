wearable<00:00:29.519> technology<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.539> know<00:00:30.630> obviously

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
wearable technology you know obviously

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
wearable technology you know obviously
technology<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.619> very<00:00:31.769> important<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> us<00:00:32.489> here

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
technology is very important to us here

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.520 
technology is very important to us here
at<00:00:32.790> Bev<00:00:32.969> fair<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.600> were<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> first<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> develop

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
at Bev fair we were the first to develop

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.069 
at Bev fair we were the first to develop
an<00:00:34.620> iPhone<00:00:35.070> app<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> sports<00:00:36.630> book<00:00:36.870> and
