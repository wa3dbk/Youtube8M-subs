00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.580 

will<00:02:21.870> choose<00:02:22.110> flyways<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.870> then<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.020> have<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
will choose flyways and then you have a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.560 
will choose flyways and then you have a
series<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.010> video<00:02:26.340> clips<00:02:26.400> about<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.120> flyaway

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
series of video clips about the flyaway

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.480 
series of video clips about the flyaway
we'll<00:02:28.080> choose<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.620> first<00:02:28.860> one<00:02:29.070> again<00:02:29.160> let's

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
we'll choose the first one again let's

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.580 
we'll choose the first one again let's
the<00:02:29.640> gymnast<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.150> master<00:02:30.600> swing<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.080> flyways

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the gymnast to master swing the flyways

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.790 
the gymnast to master swing the flyways
with<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> spot<00:02:32.670> into<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.210> pit<00:02:33.510> then<00:02:34.320> they<00:02:34.500> begin

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
with a spot into a pit then they begin

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.020 
with a spot into a pit then they begin
to<00:02:34.950> perform<00:02:35.100> swing<00:02:35.610> flyways<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.450> soft<00:02:36.720> minutes

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
to perform swing flyways to soft minutes

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.370 
to perform swing flyways to soft minutes
athletes<00:02:39.030> should<00:02:39.240> know<00:02:39.390> swings<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.930> fly<00:02:40.170> way

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
athletes should know swings to fly way

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.440 
athletes should know swings to fly way
before<00:02:40.710> attempting<00:02:41.160> cast<00:02:41.430> insurance<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.210> fly

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
before attempting cast insurance to fly

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.840 
before attempting cast insurance to fly
way<00:02:42.720> which<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.650> more<00:02:43.920> difficult<00:02:44.070> skill<00:02:44.670> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
way which is a more difficult skill and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.840 
way which is a more difficult skill and
produced<00:02:45.120> as<00:02:45.270> larger<00:02:45.690> amounts<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.140> momentum

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
produced as larger amounts of momentum

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.990 
produced as larger amounts of momentum
okay

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
okay

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.790 
okay
so<00:02:48.180> there's<00:02:48.510> an<00:02:48.630> example<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:49.110> fly<00:02:49.320> way<00:02:49.530> you

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
so there's an example the fly way you

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800 
so there's an example the fly way you
can<00:02:49.950> hit<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.220> next<00:02:50.490> clip<00:02:50.730> link<00:02:51.120> down<00:02:51.330> here<00:02:51.660> or

pull him away from getting the rail and
also<00:03:19.590> assists<00:03:19.950> trying<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.400> slow<00:03:20.580> him<00:03:20.730> down<00:03:20.760> in

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
also assists trying to slow him down in

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.680 
also assists trying to slow him down in
case<00:03:21.240> of<00:03:21.420> an<00:03:21.540> over<00:03:21.780> rotating<00:03:22.170> disc<00:03:22.530> now<00:03:23.690> notice

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
case of an over rotating disc now notice

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.110 
case of an over rotating disc now notice
again<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.110> coaches<00:03:25.470> spotting<00:03:25.890> technique

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.330 

okay<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.360> if<00:03:30.870> you're<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.110> gym<00:03:31.350> owner<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:32.220> can

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
okay so if you're a gym owner you can

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.130 
okay so if you're a gym owner you can
obviously<00:03:32.700> see<00:03:32.970> how<00:03:33.150> valuable<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:33.810> would<00:03:33.990> be

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
obviously see how valuable this would be

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.530 
obviously see how valuable this would be
to<00:03:34.410> have<00:03:34.830> maybe<00:03:35.430> some<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.760> your<00:03:35.880> newer<00:03:36.060> coaches

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
to have maybe some of your newer coaches

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.510 
to have maybe some of your newer coaches
learn<00:03:37.110> how<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.350> spot<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:37.950> fly<00:03:38.160> way<00:03:38.310> not<00:03:38.490> only

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
learn how to spot a fly way not only

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.880 
learn how to spot a fly way not only
learn<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.330> technique<00:03:40.050> how<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.470> teach<00:03:40.710> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
learn the technique how to teach the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.590 
learn the technique how to teach the
technique<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.550> fly<00:03:41.760> way<00:03:41.940> but<00:03:42.180> also<00:03:42.300> learn

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
technique of the fly way but also learn

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.410 
technique of the fly way but also learn
how<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.720> spot<00:03:43.020> it<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:44.400> videos<00:03:44.730> included<00:03:45.360> in

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
how to spot it the videos included in

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.690 
how to spot it the videos included in
the<00:03:45.480> gymnastics<00:03:45.959> on-demand<00:03:46.260> system
