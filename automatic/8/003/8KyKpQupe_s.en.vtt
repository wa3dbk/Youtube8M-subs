- and on the bottom it features a nice
little<00:00:52.530> lanyard<00:00:52.770> hold<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.520> really<00:00:54.210> like

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
little lanyard hold but I really like

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.299 
little lanyard hold but I really like
the<00:00:54.510> shape<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.260> axe<00:00:55.440> itself<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the shape of the axe itself of the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.270 
the shape of the axe itself of the
handle<00:00:56.699> because<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.690> naturally<00:00:57.870> kind<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.949> fits

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
handle because it naturally kind of fits

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.840 
handle because it naturally kind of fits
and<00:00:59.579> locks<00:00:59.789> your<00:01:00.000> hand<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> bottom<00:01:01.850> so

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and locks your hand in at the bottom so

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.570 
and locks your hand in at the bottom so
it<00:01:03.480> actually<00:01:03.719> creates<00:01:04.650> kind<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.040> buffer<00:01:05.400> or

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it actually creates kind of a buffer or

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.660 
it actually creates kind of a buffer or
stopper<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> end<00:01:06.450> -<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.710> your<00:01:07.920> you're

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
stopper at the end - to do your you're

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 
stopper at the end - to do your you're
cutting<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.990> great<00:01:10.200> little

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
