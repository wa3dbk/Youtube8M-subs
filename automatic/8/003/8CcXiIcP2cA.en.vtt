good tools for anything like even for an

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.870

artist with his paints or with his pens
for<00:01:42.090> drawing<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.380> important<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
for drawing I think it's so important to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.760 
for drawing I think it's so important to
have<00:01:44.360> tools<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.540> use<00:01:45.689> that's<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.619> my<00:01:46.740> opinion

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
have tools to use that's just my opinion

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.560 
have tools to use that's just my opinion
some<00:01:47.490> people<00:01:47.759> use<00:01:47.880> their<00:01:48.090> hands<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
some people use their hands for the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.719 
some people use their hands for the
foundation<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.380> think<00:01:49.619> that's<00:01:49.799> great<00:01:49.979> but

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
foundation and I think that's great but

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.319 
foundation and I think that's great but
I<00:01:50.909> specifically<00:01:51.810> love<00:01:52.229> using<00:01:52.820> tools<00:01:53.820> plus
