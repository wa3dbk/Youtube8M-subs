quarter million in loot sitting in this

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.300 
quarter million in loot sitting in this

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
of the biggest raids you guys have seen

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.180 
of the biggest raids you guys have seen
now<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.630> realized<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.410> loot<00:02:53.650> rules<00:02:53.950> have

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
now I realized that the loot rules have

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.640 
now I realized that the loot rules have
changed<00:02:54.390> from<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.570> old<00:02:55.600> days<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:56.500> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
changed from the old days and so the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.710 
changed from the old days and so the
bonus<00:02:56.920> isn't<00:02:57.280> quite<00:02:57.670> as<00:02:57.820> large<00:02:58.060> as<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.480> used<00:02:58.630> to

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
bonus isn't quite as large as it used to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.170 
bonus isn't quite as large as it used to
be<00:02:58.930> for<00:02:59.410> say<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> town<00:02:59.980> hall<00:03:00.160> 8<00:03:00.310> attacking<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:00.910> 9

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
be for say a town hall 8 attacking a 9

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.690 
be for say a town hall 8 attacking a 9
or<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.360> 10<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:02.380> obviously<00:03:03.040> just<00:03:03.310> based<00:03:03.520> upon

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
or a 10 but obviously just based upon

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.580 
or a 10 but obviously just based upon
what<00:03:04.060> we've<00:03:04.180> seen<00:03:04.450> here<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.810> Town<00:03:05.170> Hall<00:03:05.380> 10

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
what we've seen here a Town Hall 10

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.800 
what we've seen here a Town Hall 10
attacking<00:03:06.190> another<00:03:06.430> Town<00:03:06.820> Hall<00:03:07.030> 10<00:03:07.239> being

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
attacking another Town Hall 10 being

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.740 
attacking another Town Hall 10 being
offered<00:03:08.290> well<00:03:08.680> over<00:03:09.250> 2<00:03:09.580> million<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.270> resources

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
offered well over 2 million in resources

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.600 
offered well over 2 million in resources
I<00:03:11.020> think<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.530> potential<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:12.100> out<00:03:12.280> there<00:03:12.489> to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
I think the potential is out there to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.180 
I think the potential is out there to
see<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.850> two<00:03:13.120> million<00:03:13.360> resource<00:03:13.870> raid<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.860> let

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190
