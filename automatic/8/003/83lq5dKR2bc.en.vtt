00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.429
 good day my name is uwe fricke vom 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.560
 pc de 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.710
 I want to in this short video once 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.529
 show how to change the cord height 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.029
 that is called knot offset this must 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.590
 always run parallel 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.199
 So you can not on one side 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.210
 4 cm and on the other side 7 centimeters 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.660
 So it always has to be parallel and otherwise 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.430
 run no longer Palais the parallel 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.020
 if they get a bit of us 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.030
 and they have it for example in the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.280
 height of a meter ordered and you 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.260
 let hang freely then have them 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.960
 the feeling that it is 56 cm 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.079
 it depends on the fabric and the width 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.090
 So four to six centimeters approximately 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.670
 is shorter than that is ordered 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.969
 perfectly alright too so right in 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.699
 the pcs in the errors and the must 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.710
 you do not stretch that so far from 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.510
 Down alone, that means she is slipping 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.220
 hang it on top of in the last 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.430
 both lace down to the right and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.689
 on the left, they could span the whole thing now 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.860
 But it will be you for example 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.080
 one has measured in the assembly 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.490
 have chosen in the glass bottle and 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.650
 just like that, they have their measurements so that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.170
 the assembly in the glass strip in 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.250
 order process later in the process 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.229
 but maybe decided 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.630
 to use the pc point fix 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.229
 and then there was no more height 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.299
 fit 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.460
 I'll show you how to do that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.460
 calculated to displace the knot 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.530
 For example, we have an order amount of 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.820
 36 cm 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.740
 that means glass made the right 36 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.650
 order higher would have been 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.580
 at the bluechips upper edge to 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:03.960
 lower edge of window sash six 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.030
 centimeters that in the case now 46 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.340
 cm 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.229
 of these 46 centimeters they have to 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.550
 height of the glass bar but their 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.480
 deduct order 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:21.830
 So it still makes 9 cm and this 9 cm would be 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.180
 now practically the knot too high 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.190
 please leave the old knots like this 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.670
 first of all, how could they be? 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.870
 Do not put on a new knot 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:38.760
 nine inches lower this must 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.010
 be right and left even if 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.320
 they knotted the two sides 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:49.310
 then please hang the pc again 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.519
 and check the function 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.620
 that means the perfect run if 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.650
 that everything is fine can become 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.810
 leave if it is too loose they can 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.720
 also again a centimeter right and 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 left more notes so eight centimeters 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.099
 or maybe ten centimeters if the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.560
 tension in well then is okay 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.530
 Please again solve short and the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:23.639
 Preferential kloten the original knot 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:25.799
 notes on the right and left if you want to 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.549
 still have questions then call us 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.180
 like to 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.629
 we will certainly help you with it 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.139
 They do not just tie you up and report 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.030
 Then please call us first 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.280
 we will help if the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.209
 Reference point is there 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.220
 actually only one way 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.109
 that they will send this back to us 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.700
 and how it is new to the right length 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.700
 thanks a lot
