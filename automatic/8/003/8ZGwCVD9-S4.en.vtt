00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.910
 wooden house protection is 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.519
 necessary element in the construction 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.380
 Specifically, three factors affect 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.769
 wood first is fungi 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.409
 the second is sunlight and the third is 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.380
 precipitation is therefore necessary 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:35.350
 to have a system for finishing 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.260
 wooden houses in this system include 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.960
 three materials 1 from antiseptic 2 this 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.590
 mastic for the ends and the third is the finish 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.760
 water based material layer 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.100
 antiseptic itself is 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.350
 fairly fluid and basic function 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.430
 is to penetrate deep into the wood 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:59.020
 and reliably protect the wood from 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.990
 destruction of white rot fungi blue 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.629
 bugs and so on 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.659
 which is the second component 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.760
 reliably protects the ends of wood 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.690
 either it is glued laminated timber or it 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.390
 cylindering from water to all 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.300
 it is known that the butt absorbs moisture 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.820
 much more than timber 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.770
 somewhere two to three times so the process 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.770
 shrinkage and moisture return back to iran 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.740
 and moisture happens much faster 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.780
 it is at the butt and the butt crack and 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.060
 blue is much faster than wood by 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.870
 seam mastic for the ends is designed 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.700
 precisely in order to reduce this 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.380
 impact 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.979
 antiseptic by itself it can 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.940
 leach out for precipitation 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.930
 to remove this process and 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.479
 the finishing layer is used 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.950
 material this layer material is applied in 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:03.549
 three layers and prevents washing out 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.290
 antiseptic protects against solar 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.290
 Rays and precipitation
