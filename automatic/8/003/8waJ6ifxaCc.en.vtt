everything<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.579> why<00:00:35.790> don't<00:00:35.850> they

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
everything going on and why don't they

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.850 
everything going on and why don't they
have<00:00:36.270> more<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.500> don't<00:00:37.680> want

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
have more and I was like you don't want

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.979 
have more and I was like you don't want
to<00:00:37.980> come<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> same

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
to come up you have it I at the same

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.510 
to come up you have it I at the same
time<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.530> want<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.040> approach<00:00:41.280> us

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
time like we want to go and approach us

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.860 
time like we want to go and approach us
a<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.790> slower<00:00:42.090> than<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> next<00:00:42.629> thing<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
a little slower than the next thing you

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.350 
a little slower than the next thing you
know<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.550> seven<00:00:44.550> or<00:00:44.640> eight<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.149> week

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
know we get seven or eight in one week

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.660 
know we get seven or eight in one week
and<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.350> think<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.129> helped<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and so I think it's that's helped I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.270 
and so I think it's that's helped I
board<00:00:48.120> anything<00:00:48.390> else<00:00:48.920> they<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
board anything else they see the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.490 
board anything else they see the
commitment<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> program<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> silly

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
commitment to the program from the silly

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.910 
commitment to the program from the silly
standpoint<00:00:53.600> from<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.690> competitive<00:00:55.469> standpoint

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
standpoint from a competitive standpoint

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.750 
standpoint from a competitive standpoint
and<00:00:56.989> they<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.350> they<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:59.489> want

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
that if nothing else in recruiting

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
that if nothing else in recruiting
that's<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> only<00:01:02.640> part<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.780> get

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that's the only part is that you get

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.080 
that's the only part is that you get
