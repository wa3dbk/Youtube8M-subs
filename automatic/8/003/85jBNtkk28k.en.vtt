00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
pretty uncomfortable at first but then I

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.470 
pretty uncomfortable at first but then I

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.760 
just got used to it I knew that look
cute<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.840> everything<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.410> wasn't<00:02:07.680> really

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
cute and everything so I wasn't really

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.469 
cute and everything so I wasn't really
worried<00:02:08.100> about<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.850> I<00:02:08.880> definitely<00:02:09.090> like

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
worried about it but I definitely like

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.090 
worried about it but I definitely like
the<00:02:09.509> look<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.929> these<00:02:10.140> with<00:02:10.350> boobs<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.890> lot

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
the look of these with boobs a lot

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.370 
the look of these with boobs a lot
better<00:02:11.280> than<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.970> them<00:02:12.540> with<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:13.020> flats

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
better than I like them with like flats

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.020 
better than I like them with like flats
and<00:02:13.680> stuff<00:02:13.740> because<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.430> feel<00:02:14.610> like<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.760> kind<00:02:14.940> of

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and stuff because I feel like it kind of

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.730 
and stuff because I feel like it kind of
breaks<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.450> up<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.660> little<00:02:15.780> bit<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.020> think<00:02:16.110> flats

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
breaks it up a little bit I think flats

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.920 
breaks it up a little bit I think flats
it's<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.220> too<00:02:17.459> much<00:02:17.490> lace<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.209> leg<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.720> I

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
it's just too much lace on the leg so I

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.330 
it's just too much lace on the leg so I
think<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.380> definitely<00:02:19.500> looks<00:02:19.890> good<00:02:20.130> with

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
think it definitely looks good with

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.070 
think it definitely looks good with
leather<00:02:20.520> boots<00:02:20.880> or<00:02:21.120> suede<00:02:21.660> boots<00:02:21.930> or

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
leather boots or suede boots or

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.050 
leather boots or suede boots or
something<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.610> for<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.880> boots

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
something like that and so for the boots
