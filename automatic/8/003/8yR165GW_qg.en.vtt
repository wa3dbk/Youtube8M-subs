said you know we'd like to do a

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.250 
said you know we'd like to do a
father-and-son<00:00:43.120> project<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.360> told<00:00:44.960> him<00:00:45.079> yes

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
father-and-son project I told him yes

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.200 
father-and-son project I told him yes
and<00:00:45.739> they<00:00:46.100> asked<00:00:46.340> me<00:00:46.399> if<00:00:46.460> they<00:00:46.610> had<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:46.760> budget

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
and the one thing I found out later is

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.240 
and the one thing I found out later is
you<00:00:49.699> don't<00:00:49.969> tell<00:00:50.180> a<00:00:50.210> teenage<00:00:50.600> boy<00:00:51.129> just<00:00:52.129> be

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
you don't tell a teenage boy just be

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.610 
you don't tell a teenage boy just be
reasonable<00:00:52.430> you<00:00:53.000> know<00:00:53.660> they<00:00:53.870> basically

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
reasonable you know they basically

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.139 
reasonable you know they basically
signed<00:00:55.160> up<00:00:55.309> for<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.489> whole<00:00:55.609> packages<00:00:56.090> and

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
signed up for the whole packages and

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.140 
signed up for the whole packages and
let's<00:00:56.300> do<00:00:56.449> it<00:00:56.539> all

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.970 

but<00:01:02.150> in<00:01:02.240> real<00:01:02.390> life<00:01:02.630> I'm<00:01:02.840> dr.<00:01:03.170> Robert<00:01:03.440> Bray<00:01:03.650> and

but in real life I'm dr. Robert Bray and

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.860 
but in real life I'm dr. Robert Bray and
designed<00:01:04.730> a<00:01:04.910> lot<00:01:05.030> of<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.239> instruments<00:01:05.690> or

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
designed a lot of the instruments or

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.110 
designed a lot of the instruments or
microsurgery<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.800> design<00:01:07.130> translated<00:01:07.910> into

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
microsurgery the design translated into

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.420 
microsurgery the design translated into

helping to design this car with us

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.280 
helping to design this car with us
we<00:01:10.640> built<00:01:10.880> this<00:01:11.000> cooler<00:01:11.270> with<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.780> internal

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
we built this cooler with the internal

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.310 
we built this cooler with the internal
