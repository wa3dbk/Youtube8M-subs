for his for his blitzes so I figured you

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.440 
for his for his blitzes so I figured you
know<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.520> I'm<00:01:44.640> gonna<00:01:44.759> come<00:01:44.969> out<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.210> run<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
know what I'm gonna come out and run the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.179 
know what I'm gonna come out and run the
ball<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.719> him<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.049> he<00:01:46.560> can't<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:46.950> any

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
ball on him so that he can't get any

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.130 
ball on him so that he can't get any
like<00:01:47.340> cheap<00:01:47.579> pics<00:01:47.820> or<00:01:48.000> whatever<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.960> that's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
like cheap pics or whatever so that's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.630 
like cheap pics or whatever so that's
exactly<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.130> then<00:01:50.249> I<00:01:50.280> start

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
exactly what I do and then I start

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
exactly what I do and then I start
coming<00:01:50.969> out<00:01:51.030> my<00:01:51.210> run<00:01:51.390> information<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.170> then

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
coming out my run information and then

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.739 
coming out my run information and then
passing<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.429> of<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.179> keep<00:01:54.390> him<00:01:54.539> off

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
passing out of it just to keep him off

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.560 
passing out of it just to keep him off
balance<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.590> think<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> started<00:01:56.909> kind<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.359> got

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
balance I think it started kind of got

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.639 
balance I think it started kind of got
to<00:01:57.719> him<00:01:57.810> cuz<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.049> really<00:01:58.289> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.499> see<00:01:58.619> right

can't<00:03:01.739> get<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> catch<00:03:02.190> animation<00:03:02.820> so<00:03:02.970> forth<00:03:03.239> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
can't get a catch animation so forth and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.360 
can't get a catch animation so forth and
16<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.989> don't<00:03:04.290> really<00:03:04.440> care<00:03:04.739> we<00:03:04.950> hit<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.220> out

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
16 I don't really care we hit the out

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.449 
16 I don't really care we hit the out
route<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.970> luckily<00:03:06.750> we<00:03:07.050> get<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.800> know

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
route and luckily we get that I know

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.920 
route and luckily we get that I know
that<00:03:08.700> had<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.940> frustrate<00:03:09.420> him<00:03:09.540> right<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:09.810> and

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
that had to frustrate him right here and

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.000 
that had to frustrate him right here and
then<00:03:10.020> here's<00:03:10.200> some<00:03:10.320> more<00:03:10.440> drag<00:03:10.739> routes

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
then here's some more drag routes

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.590 
then here's some more drag routes
because<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.489> playing<00:03:11.730> man<00:03:11.970> coverage<00:03:12.000> once

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
because it's playing man coverage once

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.710 
because it's playing man coverage once
again<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.610> right<00:03:14.610> here<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.330> don't<00:03:15.660> know

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
again and right here this I don't know

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.330 
again and right here this I don't know
why<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.959> couldn't<00:03:16.230> get<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.410> cash<00:03:16.680> animation<00:03:17.250> I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
why I couldn't get a cash animation I

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.650 
why I couldn't get a cash animation I
guess<00:03:17.519> maybe<00:03:17.700> because<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.269> quarterback

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
guess maybe because the quarterback

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.199 
guess maybe because the quarterback
overthrew<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.170> by<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:20.130> know<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.670> tiny<00:03:21.030> bit

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
overthrew it by you know just a tiny bit

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.750 
overthrew it by you know just a tiny bit
but<00:03:21.630> women<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.080> go<00:03:22.170> catch<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.590> ball<00:03:22.799> which

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
but women you go catch the ball which

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.120 
but women you go catch the ball which
really<00:03:24.120> pissed<00:03:24.450> me<00:03:24.540> off<00:03:24.630> but<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.920> right

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
really pissed me off but that right

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.850 
really pissed me off but that right
there<00:03:26.190> should<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:26.670> been<00:03:26.760> caught<00:03:27.060> too<00:03:27.330> but

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
there should have been caught too but

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.250 
there should have been caught too but
