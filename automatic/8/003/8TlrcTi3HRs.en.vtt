 minutes one of the four computers

 who implement their programs as themselves 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.400
 what to do that one is set there

 so much fun if you look 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.890
 if you write something to the program 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.659
 you can see what come out there believe this 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.110
