00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.799
 in Austria is not only within 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.750
 Energie AG is the leader of the 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.190
 segments disposal but also 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.250
 throughout Austria in waste management 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.789
 lead active with over 1000 employees 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.179
 including all subsidiaries are 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.390
 We are operational at 28 locations and 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.890
 we will really be with you in the future 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.600
 many new information in the area 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.010
 waste management and the 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.090
 ecological resources sparing 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.800
 inform 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.020
 already today we start if one 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.330
 very interesting contribution as from the 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.670
 area waste incineration not only 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.020
 energy is created but also resources 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.210
 can be won 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.310
 Have fun watching and see 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.460
 this raw material from before him 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.340
 valuable materials like iron copper 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.590
 aluminum or brass are obtained 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.960
 These are simple 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.030
 slag as raw material after the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.910
 incineration of residual waste remains 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.220
 because despite increased 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.810
 Environmental awareness and separate collection 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.240
 there are still many valuable materials in 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.570
 the waste bin tied in 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.960
 Electric appliances pans pots coins 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.370
 jewelry cell phones or beverage cans 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.580
 make an inexhaustible 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.680
 reservoir at so-called 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.170
 secondary raw materials there but how filters 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.450
 Now look for these hidden treasures 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.700
 the inconspicuous raw material 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.790
 Austria had like the whole industry 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.370
 from the pure garbage disposal operation out 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.400
 to an energy and raw material 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.500
 developed 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.250
 on the one hand, garbage does not become like it did before 20 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.960
 years ago, just dumped somewhere 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 thrown away and buried but 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.430
 will be burned 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.250
 from which energy is gained to another 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.680
 valuable materials such as paper carton plastics 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.170
 looks and so on is disconnected 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.310
 collected recycled and immediately 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.310
 back into the recycling cycle 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.959
 it is particularly interesting to introduce 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.359
 at the waste incineration where you not only 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.430
 Energy gain around 170 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.740
 gigawatt hours of electricity and 130 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.960
 gigawatt hours 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.060
 FernwÃ¤rme but where we also metals 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.670
 those in the trash are urgent after the 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.680
 Burn out over remains 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.720
 a liberated metal impact is 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.640
 a rock similar to completely 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.970
 dangerous material is deposited 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.380
 but important is we get that 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.810
 metals precious metals again 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.610
 get the benefits of this treatment 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.890
 are clear hand for a 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.810
 These valuable raw materials will be back 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.890
 the metal processing circuit 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.590
 recycled 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.110
 on the other hand you can save a lot of money co2 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.080
 in comparison to the recovery of this 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.030
 materials which and how many tons 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.060
 valuable raw materials are used by the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.490
 avg won annually and how many 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.980
 tons of co2 are thereby saved 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.690
 through the modern strong preparation 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.990
 which we at the location which meanwhile 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.470
 We will operate for the fifth time 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.630
 in sum, around 5000 tons of high quality 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.750
 metals from the oven knock out of it 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.760
 about 3,000 tons of non-ferrous metals 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.710
 is essentially aluminum 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.470
 that's brass that's copper so very 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.120
 high quality material and around 2000 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.050
 tons of iron metals these 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.120
 recovered metals if one too 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.430
 One then immediately in the cabins 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.470
 fed process that is again 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.410
 refined and new materials from 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.290
 This makes metal possible 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.420
 Save 20,000 tonnes of co2 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.130
 a significant contribution, of course, too 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:53.610
 would see the carbon footprint 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.610
 avg clean environment clean future
