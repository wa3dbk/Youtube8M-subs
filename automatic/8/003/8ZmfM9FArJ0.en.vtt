up it depends if you want it tight or

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
up it depends if you want it tight or
loose<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.159> make<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> bigger<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.119> use

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
loose you can make it bigger you can use

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
loose you can make it bigger you can use
three<00:01:30.570> fingers<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.140> want<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.439> bigger<00:01:31.650> crawl

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
three fingers if you want a bigger crawl

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.770 
three fingers if you want a bigger crawl
or<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.610> use<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:33.000> finger<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> want<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
or you can use one finger if you want a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.840 
or you can use one finger if you want a
smaller<00:01:34.049> curl<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.770> tend<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
smaller curl but I tend to like the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
smaller curl but I tend to like the
shape<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.329> curl<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.170> when<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> use

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
shape of a curl that I get when I use

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.240 
shape of a curl that I get when I use
two<00:01:37.740> fingers<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.570> then<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.900> pin<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> curl<00:01:41.009> at

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
two fingers and then you pin the curl at

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.539 
two fingers and then you pin the curl at
the<00:01:41.310> base<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:43.290> let<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.649> hair<00:01:43.799> cool<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the base and you let the hair cool and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.730 
the base and you let the hair cool and
then<00:01:45.210> you'll<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> nice<00:01:45.810> tight<00:01:46.259> curl<00:01:46.560> that
