bike here we're checking to make sure
the<00:01:10.159> Jesus<00:01:11.090> square<00:01:11.420> was<00:01:11.840> off<00:01:12.020> by<00:01:12.200> a

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
the Jesus square was off by a

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.080 
the Jesus square was off by a
quarter-inch<00:01:12.830> shot<00:01:13.220> which<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:13.640> measurement

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
quarter-inch shot which is measurement

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.780 
quarter-inch shot which is measurement
which<00:01:14.780> actually<00:01:15.200> like<00:01:15.500> was<00:01:15.770> 8<00:01:16.010> inch<00:01:16.220> up<00:01:16.369> square

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
which actually like was 8 inch up square

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.980 
which actually like was 8 inch up square
so<00:01:17.780> after<00:01:18.260> we<00:01:18.409> just<00:01:18.710> being<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.369> little<00:01:19.520> bit

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
so after we just being a little bit

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:29.850 
so after we just being a little bit
we've<00:01:20.990> got<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.320> square<00:01:21.560> up<00:01:21.740> right<00:01:22.070> by<00:01:23.030> 3/4<00:01:28.240> and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
we've got to square up right by 3/4 and

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.680 
we've got to square up right by 3/4 and
155<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.920> 3/4<00:01:33.820> finish<00:01:34.820> off<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.060> corner<00:01:35.360> walls

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
155 a 3/4 finish off the corner walls

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.999 
155 a 3/4 finish off the corner walls
and<00:01:36.820> measured<00:01:37.820> Center<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.560> well<00:01:39.560> in<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.860> bar

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
and measured Center and well in a bar

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.680 
and measured Center and well in a bar
there<00:01:40.280> we're<00:01:40.850> lift<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:41.119> thing<00:01:41.360> off<00:01:41.509> the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
there we're lift this thing off the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.060 
there we're lift this thing off the
floor<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:41.990> it's<00:01:42.259> a<00:01:42.289> little<00:01:42.380> easier<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.740> work<00:01:42.770> on

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
floor so it's a little easier to work on

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.300 
floor so it's a little easier to work on
now<00:01:43.220> we<00:01:44.090> got<00:01:44.240> one<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.630> uprights<00:01:44.990> fit<00:01:45.590> we

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
now we got one of the uprights fit we

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.760 
now we got one of the uprights fit we
ground<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.660> corner<00:01:47.990> weld<00:01:48.170> on<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.530> get<00:01:48.649> it

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
ground the the corner weld on to get it

so<00:04:11.470> we'll<00:04:11.800> just<00:04:11.950> kind<00:04:12.100> of<00:04:12.250> tweaked<00:04:12.460> it<00:04:12.580> in<00:04:12.700> when

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
so we'll just kind of tweaked it in when

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
so we'll just kind of tweaked it in when
we<00:04:12.910> mount<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.240> the<00:04:13.360> truck

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
otherwise for the most part I think we

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.620 
otherwise for the most part I think we
got<00:04:17.769> a<00:04:17.799> pretty
