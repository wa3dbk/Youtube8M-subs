00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
politoed here not really common but it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.249 
politoed here not really common but it
works<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.119> me<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.509> that's<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:24.840> I'm<00:01:24.930> using<00:01:25.110> so

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
works for me so that's what I'm using so

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.660 
works for me so that's what I'm using so
I<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.619> drill<00:01:25.799> pick<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.159> his

I go for the drill pick on his
limbs<00:01:26.820> account<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> doesn't<00:01:27.659> die<00:01:27.780> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
limbs account and it doesn't die I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.600 
limbs account and it doesn't die I
probably<00:01:28.590> got<00:01:28.740> minimum<00:01:29.100> damage<00:01:29.310> there

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
probably got minimum damage there

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.940 
probably got minimum damage there
because<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> normally<00:01:30.270> does<00:01:30.689> kill<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.619> that's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
because I normally does kill but that's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.569 
because I normally does kill but that's
fine<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.400> fine

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
fine it's fine

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.859 
fine it's fine
