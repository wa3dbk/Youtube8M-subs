00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and also it's just a great alternative

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.099 
and also it's just a great alternative
to<00:00:17.460> soft<00:00:17.789> drinks<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.240> things<00:00:18.420> like<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.630> but

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
to soft drinks and things like that but

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.810 
to soft drinks and things like that but
we're<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.410> start<00:00:19.650> off<00:00:19.800> doing<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.490> we're

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
we're going to start off doing is we're

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.570 
we're going to start off doing is we're
going<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.990> squash<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.230> lemons<00:00:24.650> like<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
going to squash the lemons like this the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.890 
going to squash the lemons like this the
reason<00:00:26.760> why<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.330> before<00:00:27.630> cutting

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
reason why we do that before cutting

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.700 
reason why we do that before cutting
them<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.740> actually<00:00:29.099> makes<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:30.590> more<00:00:31.590> of

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
them is it actually makes the more of

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.370 
them is it actually makes the more of
the<00:00:31.830> juice<00:00:32.009> come<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.840> then<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.050> cut<00:00:34.260> them

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the juice come out then we just cut them

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.990 
the juice come out then we just cut them
in<00:00:34.469> half<00:00:40.070> bring<00:00:41.070> your<00:00:41.280> sharp<00:00:41.520> knife<00:00:41.579> always

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
in half bring your sharp knife always

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.910 
in half bring your sharp knife always
hops<00:00:49.370> just<00:00:50.370> give<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> good<00:00:50.820> squeeze<00:00:51.920> now

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
hops just give it a good squeeze now

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.549 
hops just give it a good squeeze now
depending<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.489> how<00:00:53.640> fresh<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.090> lemons<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
depending on how fresh the lemons are it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.830 
depending on how fresh the lemons are it
will<00:00:55.680> determine<00:00:56.120> how<00:00:57.120> much<00:00:57.270> juice<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
will determine how much juice you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.959 
will determine how much juice you
actually<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.320> out<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.559> each<00:00:58.649> lemon<00:00:59.039> it

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
actually get out of each lemon it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.670 
actually get out of each lemon it
doesn't<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> freshest<00:01:01.379> lemon

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
doesn't have to be the freshest lemon

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.439 
doesn't have to be the freshest lemon
but<00:01:01.920> obviously<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> fresher<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
but obviously the fresher it is the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.550 
but obviously the fresher it is the
better<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.439> now<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.619> gives<00:01:04.949> us<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:06.560> three

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
better so now that gives us about three

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.760 
better so now that gives us about three
hundred<00:01:07.710> milliliters<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.520> juice<00:01:09.439> what<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.560> do

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
hundred milliliters of juice what we do

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.600
