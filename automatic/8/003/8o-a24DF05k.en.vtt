you're gonna end up a protagonist so our

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
numbers are 1 1 5 and 666 there are two

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
instances of one occurring okay so there

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.050 
instances of one occurring okay so there
are<00:03:18.690> two<00:03:18.840> ones<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.949> what<00:03:20.069> we<00:03:20.190> want<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.579> do<00:03:20.760> is

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
are two ones and what we want to do is

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.780 
are two ones and what we want to do is
take<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.690> number<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.709> number<00:03:23.129> of<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.519> times

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
take that number the number of the times

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.000 
take that number the number of the times
of<00:03:24.030> occurrences<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.959> times<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.440> by<00:03:25.590> one<00:03:25.889> of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
of occurrences and times it by one of

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.420 
of occurrences and times it by one of
the<00:03:26.099> numbers<00:03:26.519> in<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.120> second<00:03:27.720> set<00:03:28.349> that<00:03:29.250> would

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
the numbers in the second set that would

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.629 
the numbers in the second set that would
be<00:03:29.579> six<00:03:29.940> two<00:03:30.810> number<00:03:31.139> ones<00:03:31.409> so<00:03:32.190> there's<00:03:32.400> two

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
be six two number ones so there's two

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.559 
be six two number ones so there's two
times<00:03:33.299> six<00:03:33.750> equals<00:03:34.169> 12<00:03:34.530> now<00:03:35.190> if<00:03:35.489> we<00:03:35.760> sort<00:03:36.449> of
