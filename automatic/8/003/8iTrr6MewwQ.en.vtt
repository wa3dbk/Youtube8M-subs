Today we have a chance to enjoy a very unusual performance at Novosibirsk airport

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.300
and we see off our first support team members of the Sochi Olympic Games 2014

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.500
the most famous and popular children's wind orchestra Bis Band.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.300
Bravo!

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.100
We wish you happiness, joy and let us bring each other as much love as possible.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.300
Music is what exactly makes us closer to the sky.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.900
Have a good flight and hail to Sochi 2014! Hooray!

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.500
Thank you!
