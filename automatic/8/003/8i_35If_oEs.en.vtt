00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.630
 of the country 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:58.150
 to summarize but I know 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:02.549
 all the municipalities of mexico 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:07.049
 the 125 municipalities of the state of mexico 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.049
 who visited more than once 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.010
 and also the 70 municipalities of oaxaca 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:25.290
 and it gets tired 12 there is difference between having 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.450
 been unemployed 20 minutes in a municipality 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.700
 and meet him 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.519
 although that's a lot to say in comparison 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.080
 of each egg although we keep going 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.880
 Talking about Tabasco 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.970
 the senator lose ist a fernando amaya 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.519
 I do not say that Mexico is a good country for 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.910
 Long live foreigners do not know 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.130

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.700
 private schools of villahermosa 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.349
 Tabasco are Venezuelans are Colombians 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.290

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:01.290
 workers in pemex who cleans the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.829
 toilet the one who sweeps the floor is 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.230

 conditioned are foreigners 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:17.209
 hospitable country business what hurts and 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.780
 it hurts in the soul to see that a congress 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.850
 and a senate of the republic be in 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.700
 against your country against the people 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.040
 who chose them who are against their 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.650
 culture and its education and that before 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.660

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.660
 it hurts and you hurt 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.639
 but what hurts the most is that we do not 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.139
 food poverty hurts but the 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.820
 goleada 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.860
 politicians grab what is left 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.680
 to entertain the masses and not us 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.979
 let's realize how they're hanging with the 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.979
 bone 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.320
