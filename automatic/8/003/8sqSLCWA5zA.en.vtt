00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.990 
got the little opening here so when it
starts<00:02:34.030> burning<00:02:34.180> down<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.780> feed<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:36.000> this

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
starts burning down you can feed it this

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.620 
starts burning down you can feed it this
wood<00:02:37.239> here<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.510> kind<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.870> wet<00:02:38.109> so<00:02:39.450> we'll<00:02:40.450> see

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
wood here is kind of wet so we'll see

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.569 
wood here is kind of wet so we'll see
how<00:02:40.780> long<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.140> takes<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:42.069> actually<00:02:42.160> get<00:02:42.430> it

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
how long it takes to actually get it

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.900 
how long it takes to actually get it
started<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.359> I'm<00:02:44.109> almost<00:02:45.069> positive<00:02:45.430> it's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
started and I'm almost positive it's

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.680 
started and I'm almost positive it's
gonna<00:02:46.150> start<00:02:46.359> suiting<00:02:46.660> up<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.139> stuff<00:02:47.380> but

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
gonna start suiting up and stuff but

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.430 
gonna start suiting up and stuff but
unfortunately<00:02:49.690> that's<00:02:49.840> what<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.109> get<00:02:50.229> when

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
unfortunately that's what you get when

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.070 
unfortunately that's what you get when
you<00:02:50.530> have<00:02:50.650> a

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.400 
my opinion I mean this little thing is
just<00:03:43.390> awesome<00:03:45.390> since<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:46.810> small<00:03:47.050> you<00:03:47.290> do

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
just awesome since it is so small you do

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.590 
just awesome since it is so small you do
have<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.710> you<00:03:48.490> know<00:03:48.580> tend<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.060> fire<00:03:49.300> you

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
have to you know tend to the fire you

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.320 
have to you know tend to the fire you
know<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.620> keep<00:03:50.890> putting<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.790> wood<00:03:51.910> in<00:03:52.180> there

and stuff like that but other than that

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.420 
and stuff like that but other than that
it's<00:03:57.660> it's<00:03:58.660> pretty<00:03:58.900> efficient<00:03:59.430> I'd

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
