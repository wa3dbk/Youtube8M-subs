00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.889
 work we are going to make this flower as if it were in third dimension here 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.099
 nothing else we have 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.519
 one round will do another round the one that we are going to do 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.160
 what's behind this one 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.810
 so that she was tall and she was prettier 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.240
 to achieve that we are going to need to go to the part of here 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.989
 behind 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.730
 and make an insertion of hanging chains to achieve a second 

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:29.089
 petals rather 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.940
 simon according to the second line of petals 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.949
 I eat my point here 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 If I grab it, it will produce 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.909
 what is the flower here 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.580
 I'm going to weave three chains 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.020
 so that it allows me to leave at the same time as from here back 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.469
 where I am going to take 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.089
 the part of what is the center of each petal 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.969
 and there they can be so iranzo 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.159
 to abide pull from there start hanging the chains 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.539
 so that in this way you want to intersperse the petal here look 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.569
 a different way good to me I like it more when the flowers 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.330
 the petals are interspersed 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.920
 in these three doubles double high or high 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.050
 I'm going to take and the one in the middle 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.380
 took two threads this way 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.750
 and I'm going to take out 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.590
 a point to step on this way that I already went to the back 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.560
 and I'm not 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.779
 percent modifying nor pulling this point here 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.659
 in this way we 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.000
 we are going to win from point to point here in the middle part 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.240
 to weave 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.829
 percent the hanging chains that we need to have assemble the following 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.210
 firecrackers 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.729
 we are already in the back here we are going to define 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.010
 to be removed we want you to want our petals in this case 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.039
 Per hundred if I make the chain 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.649
 I hit him back here if long very hanging the petals will be more 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:52.609
 retired 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.849
 so here I am going to give a five chain ratio 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.790
 2. 3. 4. 5 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.770
 i could take 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.479
 again the midpoint of the three high double points that are these are 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.089
 the longest 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.089
 here I am going to take 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.359
 2 and those so that it has greater strength 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.839
 pakistan and pulled a Swiss point 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:25.809
 so I'm left with this first hanging chain that is where I'm going to ride 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:30.229
 the following petals you can weave instead of five can weave 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.460
 but it's good that you 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.760
 consider good to see how in this flower to say 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.400
 with those five chains it seems good 3 4 5 and we're going to go to the next petal 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.359
 same 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.359
 point of the middle part and there we are going to take 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.719
 two centuries of that point 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.789
 those on the top 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.919
 and we take out with an encryption point 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.829
 Well, here I am going to show you how it is left from the opposite 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.829
 it shows the point that we are grabbing 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.019
 here all these points is blind 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.650
 is the intention to win the point for the part of back here 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.399
 and so let's ride 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:16.399
 our five chains in each of them 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.859
 well look here here the last five chains 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.069
 i here I have 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.199
 the three chains that I went back and the first five york from where he dies 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.039
 to hang these chains are going to do 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.919
 of this part 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:33.790
 from here 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.419
 derÃ³n of the same thing in pc 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:37.949
 the first point 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:38.969
 to remove 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.949
 the five chains 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.300
 you're already touring 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.209
 I will not show you 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.749
 that's how they look 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:49.099
 Pakistan 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.639
 and you're already touring 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.319
 those five chains that will grab from there we're going to jump 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.849
 to this first percent 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.119
 to these first five chains that are hanging we are going to spend our 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.449
 hook and we leave the list set 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.319
 so in this way 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.089
 hanging our hook with our points of these synco chains that 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.959
 they're here 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.180
 here we will start doing then 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.030
 another 5 good one petal here in these five hanging chains 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.059
 we started with two chains 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.419
 i will knit here half a point 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.620
 after 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.860
 a point to eta 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.860
 then a high point 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.419
 see how we are raising the points from the smallest to the largest 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.710
 coming to the high point we will knit 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.900
 instead of three in this case there are four petals in this petal 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.900
 double highs 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.710
 this is one 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.870
 two 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.860
 3 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.520
 4 as we go knitting the stitches 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.550
 We are going through them so that we can fit in all the points after the 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.900
 four point to double high points now let's weave a 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.770
 high point 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.870
 normal 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.999
 and then a valeta point 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:19.599
 and this one we are going to grow the last half point because here we do 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:25.099
 It is convenient that each point that each petal is separated because we are already in the 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.839
 back side 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:28.419
 staying in this way 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.800
 already this is the second petals i will continue 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.389
 how we made this catalog doing all until the end of the round
