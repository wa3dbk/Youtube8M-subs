 Hello, you are with the origami, I am Ventsi Vassilev 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.080
 In this tutorial I will show you how to make a simple Christmas star 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.360
 Prepare a square piece of paper and scissors and let's start :) 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.920
 First we fold the square sheet of paper halfway ahead 

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:41.017
 On the right side, fold and unfold from both corners so that we get a cross point 

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:11.983
 Take the lower left corner and place it on the intersection, then press the paper with your hand to get the folds. 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.600
 Take the angle from the intersection point and bend symmetrically backwards 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.180
 Take the bottom right corner and bend forward 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 We bend back 

00:01:54.372 --> 00:02:01.012
 Take the scissors and cut the unnecessary part of the model 

00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:18.993
 The star is almost ready, just to fix the folds 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.880
 The star is ready, we can decorate the Christmas tree :) 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.500
