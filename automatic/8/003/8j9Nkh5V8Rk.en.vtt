00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:11.470
 nhk is linked to the motion of one camera with eight clothes cameras for all cameras 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.060
 You can shoot so that the gaze points match 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:19.410
 Developed a new viewpoint robot camera system 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:23.700
 By using this, we call it a vision, but 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:30.150
 Such as the body of the positive-like point of view goes around and mad to stop the time 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:35.050
 Earn using a fixed camera is you can do a video representation of the navel 8 conventional methods 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:41.110
 I was able to take pictures only in the limited space or narrow space . 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:43.690
 However, players who moved dynamically with the camera system that climbed this book 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:49.390
 Government in various places in a good space 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:55.149
 I was able to shoot the car body and expressed it with my vision. 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:01:00.000
 Each robot camera is equipped with two motors for pan and tilt 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:03.000
 You can also zoom to share lens information 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.040
 And the image taken by a robot camera 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.150
 Ya just switched simple than more or less error in the direction of control has occurred and smooth 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.120
 It will not be a picture 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:19.990
 Where to virtually re-direction control takes in an image taken on a computer 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:25.630
 It performs image processing in the camera virtually taken in the direction of the soon by 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.700
 All round vision from the completion to a process it is 8 to switch the video about 1 minute 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:34.000
 It is possible to play a picture 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:36.220
 At first we bring to the shooting spot such as broadcast of that porch program and change to this present slow 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.980
 Image expression crossing in a similar way 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.720
 I would like to do something good in the future with good vision 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:48.440
 We believe 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:54.260
 Also, the multi- viewpoint robot camera system developed this time is based on the captured viewpoint video 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:58.360
 Integral stereo TV under development by nhk by generating integral stereo image 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.360
 It can also be applied as an imaging system
