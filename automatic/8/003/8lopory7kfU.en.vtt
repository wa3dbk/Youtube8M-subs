00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
that my journey started and I'm not sure

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.759 
that my journey started and I'm not sure
which<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> these<00:00:30.840> roads<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.410> was<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.740> I

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
which of these roads it was that I

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.889 
which of these roads it was that I
actually<00:00:31.800> went<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> was<00:00:33.210> uphill<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
actually went up but it was uphill and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.720 
actually went up but it was uphill and
it<00:00:34.020> was<00:00:34.140> really<00:00:34.440> tough<00:00:34.739> for<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.010> long<00:00:35.280> long<00:00:35.520> time

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
it was really tough for a long long time

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.670 
it was really tough for a long long time
going<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> way<00:00:36.360> around<00:00:36.750> here<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.140> then

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
going all the way around here and then

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.319 
going all the way around here and then
somewhere<00:00:38.129> around<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> where<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> think

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
somewhere around here is where I think

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.119 
somewhere around here is where I think
the<00:00:39.750> footage<00:00:39.960> starts<00:00:40.469> because<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.920> see

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the footage starts because you can see

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.010 
the footage starts because you can see
this<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.850> where<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> descent<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:42.750> through

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
this is where the descent down through

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.750 
this is where the descent down through
this<00:00:43.140> valley<00:00:43.379> starts<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.040> valley<00:00:44.250> was

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
this valley starts and this valley was

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.340 
this valley starts and this valley was
absolutely<00:00:45.300> lovely<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.200> see

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
absolutely lovely you can kind of see

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.690 
absolutely lovely you can kind of see
the<00:00:46.500> shape<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.129> because<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the shape of it here because of the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.090 
the shape of it here because of the
freedom<00:00:48.570> apps<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.020> Google<00:00:49.320> Earth<00:00:49.469> has<00:00:49.739> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
freedom apps that Google Earth has and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130 
freedom apps that Google Earth has and
once<00:00:50.309> again<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.670> got<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.940> say<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.930> footage

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
once again I got to say that the footage

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.600 
once again I got to say that the footage
you're<00:00:52.350> gonna<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.920> nothing<00:00:53.250> in

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
comparison compared to actually being

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.410 
comparison compared to actually being
there<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> where<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> journey<00:00:57.149> goes
