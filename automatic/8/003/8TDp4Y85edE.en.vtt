here's<00:00:10.710> some<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.160> my<00:00:11.809> electrolyte<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.110> we

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
here's some of my electrolyte that we

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.490 
here's some of my electrolyte that we
put<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.620> our<00:00:13.710> hydrogen<00:00:14.160> generators<00:00:15.380> here's<00:00:16.380> a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
put in our hydrogen generators here's a

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.400 
put in our hydrogen generators here's a
close-up<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:18.390> installation<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:19.230> the

water trap on top of the water trap is

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.000 
water trap on top of the water trap is
the<00:00:24.300> line<00:00:24.480> out<00:00:24.690> into<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> air<00:00:25.650> intake

the line out into the air intake

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.009 
the line out into the air intake
manifold<00:00:26.640> which<00:00:27.570> tees<00:00:27.990> into<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.619> PCV<00:00:29.250> valve
