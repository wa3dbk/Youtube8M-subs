the<00:01:48.439> trampoline<00:01:48.829> a<00:01:48.859> second<00:01:49.219> but<00:01:49.340> when<00:01:49.490> you're

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
the trampoline a second but when you're

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.029 
the trampoline a second but when you're
in<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.999> air<00:01:50.149> how<00:01:50.869> can<00:01:51.109> you<00:01:51.140> possibly<00:01:51.439> keep

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
in the air how can you possibly keep

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.469 
in the air how can you possibly keep
track<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.340> where<00:01:52.729> you<00:01:52.880> are<00:01:53.030> when<00:01:53.359> you're

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
track of where you are when you're

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.059 
track of where you are when you're
flipping<00:01:53.719> and<00:01:54.079> turning<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.590> doing<00:01:54.829> all<00:01:54.950> that

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
flipping and turning and doing all that

flipping and turning and doing all that
kind<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.369> stuff<00:01:55.429> does<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:55.789> just<00:01:55.939> practice<00:01:56.389> of

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
kind of stuff does it just practice of

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.749 
kind of stuff does it just practice of
course<00:01:57.079> practice<00:01:57.649> I<00:01:57.770> started<00:01:58.159> learning<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.579> bum

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759

way up but when I can do that oh I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.039 
way up but when I can do that oh I
remember<00:02:02.179> a<00:02:02.719> grade<00:02:03.049> a<00:02:03.079> great<00:02:03.889> visit<00:02:04.719> but<00:02:05.719> once

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
remember a grade a great visit but once

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.179 
remember a grade a great visit but once
you<00:02:06.200> work<00:02:06.319> your<00:02:06.469> way<00:02:06.590> up<00:02:06.619> you<00:02:06.950> know<00:02:07.069> it's

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
you work your way up you know it's

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.650 
you work your way up you know it's
important<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:07.609> spot<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.060> trampoline<00:02:08.509> know

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
important to spot the trampoline know

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.120 
important to spot the trampoline know
where<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:08.899> are<00:02:09.050> in<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.530> air<00:02:09.619> at<00:02:09.740> all<00:02:09.860> times

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
where you are in the air at all times

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.500 
where you are in the air at all times
and<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.399> be<00:02:10.670> focused<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.300> when<00:02:11.420> you're

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
and just be focused so when you're

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.850 
and just be focused so when you're
competing<00:02:11.810> there<00:02:12.080> actually<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.470> an<00:02:12.560> X<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:12.740> the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
competing there actually is an X in the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.020 
competing there actually is an X in the
middle<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.220> have<00:02:13.310> something<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.610> aim<00:02:13.790> at

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
middle so you have something to aim at

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.180 
middle so you have something to aim at
yeah<00:02:14.390> now<00:02:14.750> are<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:14.990> how<00:02:15.530> do<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.680> keep<00:02:15.890> aware
