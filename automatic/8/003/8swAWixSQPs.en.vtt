when emerging infection is an infection

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.850 
when emerging infection is an infection
that<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.480> brand-new

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
that is brand-new

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.160 
that is brand-new
there<00:00:14.190> are<00:00:14.370> infections<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.599> have<00:00:15.809> been<00:00:15.990> with

there are infections that have been with

there are infections that have been with

at one time in history of evolution they

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.120 
at one time in history of evolution they
were<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.210> emerging<00:00:24.630> infection<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.680> right<00:00:25.890> now

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
were an emerging infection but right now

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.339 
were an emerging infection but right now
in<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> 21st<00:00:26.939> century<00:00:27.230> they're<00:00:28.230> an

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
in the 21st century they're an

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.620 
in the 21st century they're an
established<00:00:28.890> infection<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:30.029> every<00:00:30.269> once<00:00:30.480> in

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
established infection but every once in

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.700 
established infection but every once in
a<00:00:30.720> while<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.800> brand<00:00:32.279> new<00:00:32.660> infection

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
a while you get a brand new infection

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.430 
a while you get a brand new infection
sometimes<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:35.040> infection<00:00:35.640> has<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.440> profound

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
sometimes that infection has a profound

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.610 
sometimes that infection has a profound
global<00:00:38.190> health<00:00:38.399> impact<00:00:39.140> sometimes<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
global health impact sometimes it's a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.700 
global health impact sometimes it's a
curiosity<00:00:41.420> let<00:00:42.420> me<00:00:42.540> give<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.840> some<00:00:43.079> examples

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
curiosity let me give you some examples

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.170 
curiosity let me give you some examples
of<00:00:44.059> emerging<00:00:45.059> infections<00:00:46.160> hiv/aids<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
of emerging infections hiv/aids is the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.510 
of emerging infections hiv/aids is the
prototype<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.320> emerging<00:00:49.920> infection

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
prototype of an emerging infection

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.660 
prototype of an emerging infection
because<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.059> new<00:00:51.620> certainly<00:00:52.620> new<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.399> came

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
because it's new certainly new that came

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.180 
because it's new certainly new that came
in<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.210> 20th<00:00:54.809> century<00:00:54.920> was<00:00:55.920> first

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
in in the 20th century was first

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.700 
in in the 20th century was first
recognized<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.030> 1981<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.079> likely<00:00:58.469> around

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
recognized in 1981 but was likely around

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.970 
recognized in 1981 but was likely around
four<00:00:59.010> decades<00:00:59.460> before<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:01.199> human<00:01:01.680> species

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
four decades before the human species

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.759 
four decades before the human species
has<00:01:02.399> never<00:01:02.640> had<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.239> pandemic<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.290> AIDS<00:01:04.530> before

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
has never had a pandemic of AIDS before

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.850 
has never had a pandemic of AIDS before
so<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.460> classical<00:01:06.270> emerging<00:01:07.260> infection

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
so it's a classical emerging infection

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.810 
so it's a classical emerging infection
of<00:01:08.010> profound<00:01:08.939> global<00:01:09.659> health<00:01:10.110> impact<00:01:10.820> SARS

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
of profound global health impact SARS

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.170 
of profound global health impact SARS
was<00:01:12.810> also<00:01:13.200> an<00:01:13.320> emerging<00:01:13.770> infection<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:15.030> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
was also an emerging infection but it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.600 
was also an emerging infection but it
lasted<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.049> year<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> dissipated

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
lasted for one year and dissipated

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.649 
lasted for one year and dissipated
spontaneously<00:01:18.479> those<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:19.680> emerging

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
spontaneously those are emerging

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.359 
spontaneously those are emerging
re-emerging<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.810> an<00:01:22.020> infection<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.799> has

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
re-emerging is an infection that has

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.480 
re-emerging is an infection that has
been<00:01:23.610> around<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.619> reappears<00:01:25.619> under

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
been around but reappears under

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.580 
been around but reappears under
different<00:01:26.729> circumstances<00:01:27.140> either<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.500> a

or in a different region so let's talk
about<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.960> West<00:01:36.960> Nile<00:01:37.229> virus<00:01:37.740> has<00:01:37.950> been

about that West Nile virus has been

centuries only several years ago did it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.859 
centuries only several years ago did it
come<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.860> United<00:01:44.220> States<00:01:44.630> likely<00:01:45.630> by
