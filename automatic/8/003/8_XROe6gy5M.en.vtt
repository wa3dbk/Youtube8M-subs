00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.450 
like that and if i can get it like I
mean<00:01:33.780> I'm<00:01:33.869> little<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.500> think<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> 85<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.340> 86

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
mean I'm little I think the 85 or 86

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.690 
mean I'm little I think the 85 or 86
engineering<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> assume<00:01:36.750> maybe<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.700> minimum

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
engineering so I assume maybe at minimum

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.370 
engineering so I assume maybe at minimum
60<00:01:39.210> k<00:01:39.570> XP<00:01:40.250> per<00:01:41.250> 1<00:01:41.490> i<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:42.090> i<00:01:42.270> mean<00:01:42.869> i<00:01:42.990> prestiged

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
60 k XP per 1 i think i mean i prestiged

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.050 
60 k XP per 1 i think i mean i prestiged
a<00:01:43.500> couple<00:01:43.740> times<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.130> i'm<00:01:44.250> sure<00:01:44.490> i<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.909> at

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
a couple times so i'm sure i can get at

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.219 
a couple times so i'm sure i can get at
least<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.560> which<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> 6k<00:01:47.280> tokens<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.780> 6k

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
least that which is 6k tokens so the 6k

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.740 
least that which is 6k tokens so the 6k
tokens<00:01:49.770> i<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.299> what<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
tokens i do that you know what is that

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.910 
tokens i do that you know what is that
15<00:01:52.259> 16<00:01:52.590> x<00:01:53.240> 16<00:01:54.240> x<00:01:54.479> at<00:01:54.899> sixteen<00:01:55.290> floors<00:01:55.439> i<00:01:55.770> can

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
15 16 x 16 x at sixteen floors i can

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.730 
15 16 x 16 x at sixteen floors i can
easily<00:01:56.189> manage<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.180> mean<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.380> might<00:01:58.560> be

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
easily manage that so I mean it might be

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.830 
easily manage that so I mean it might be
it<00:01:58.920> might<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.070> rough<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.700> might<00:02:00.119> be<00:02:00.270> difficult

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it might be rough it might be difficult

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840 
it might be rough it might be difficult
but<00:02:01.229> I'm<00:02:01.350> gonna<00:02:01.500> hope<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.040> pray<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.610> I'm

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
but I'm gonna hope and pray that I'm

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
but I'm gonna hope and pray that I'm
looking<00:02:03.090> done<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.899> said<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.380> looks

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
looking done and like I said if it looks

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.109 
looking done and like I said if it looks
like<00:02:04.619> I'm<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:05.070> able<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.430> done<00:02:05.610> then

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
like I'm not be able to get it done then

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.609 
like I'm not be able to get it done then
I'm<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.270> gonna<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.719> know<00:02:06.840> take<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.110> easy<00:02:07.320> and
