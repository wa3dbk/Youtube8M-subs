blind<00:01:51.140> when<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.469> comes<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:52.009> distance<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.329> i'm

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
blind when it comes to distance so i'm

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.289 
blind when it comes to distance so i'm
short-sighted<00:01:54.039> before<00:01:55.039> scats<00:01:55.819> I'm<00:01:56.119> just

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.690 

so<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.320> think<00:02:03.590> I'm<00:02:03.920> pretty<00:02:04.130> good<00:02:04.250> at<00:02:04.400> drawing

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700
