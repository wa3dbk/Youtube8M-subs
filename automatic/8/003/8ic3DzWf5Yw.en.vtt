and properties and amuse the following

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.240 
and properties and amuse the following
IP<00:01:48.850> address<00:01:49.560> they're<00:01:50.560> going<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.799> want<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.039> go

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
IP address they're going to want to go

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
IP address they're going to want to go
to<00:01:51.310> CMD<00:01:51.970> type<00:01:52.869> in<00:01:53.110> ipconfig

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.490 

and<00:01:57.390> then<00:01:57.539> it'll<00:01:57.869> give<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.350> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
information so if you have obtain an IP

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.919 
information so if you have obtain an IP
address<00:02:00.630> it'll<00:02:01.530> tell<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
address it'll tell you what that it is

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:09.830 
address it'll tell you what that it is
so<00:02:03.929> then<00:02:04.429> what<00:02:05.429> you<00:02:06.329> will<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:07.380> do<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.840> put

so then what you will have to do is put

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.509 
so then what you will have to do is put
in<00:02:09.989> your<00:02:10.259> IP<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:13.400> that's<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
in your IP that you want so that's the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.259 
in your IP that you want so that's the
one<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> put<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.780> then<00:02:16.110> it'll<00:02:16.709> just<00:02:17.489> there's

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
one I put in and then it'll just there's

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.119 
one I put in and then it'll just there's
also<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.569> tutorial<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.260> youtube<00:02:19.470> if<00:02:19.799> you<00:02:19.950> need

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
also a tutorial on youtube if you need

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.890 
also a tutorial on youtube if you need
but<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.120> general<00:02:21.330> stuff<00:02:21.660> seed

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
but this is just the general stuff seed

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.990 
but this is just the general stuff seed
so<00:02:22.170> all<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.560> out<00:02:22.769> make<00:02:23.519> sure<00:02:23.549> it<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:23.819> matches

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
so all that out make sure it all matches

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.180 
so all that out make sure it all matches
actually<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:24.810> easier<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.290> do<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.410> peed<00:02:25.799> on

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
actually it's easier if you do I peed on

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.280 
actually it's easier if you do I peed on
take<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.140> slow<00:02:28.760> forest<00:02:29.760> /<00:02:29.880> all<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.959> then<00:02:31.110> it'll

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
take it slow forest / all and then it'll

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.100 
take it slow forest / all and then it'll
give<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.560> everything<00:02:32.480> seem<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.690> that's<00:02:33.930> all

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
give you everything seem like that's all

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.150 
give you everything seem like that's all
my<00:02:34.260> stuff<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:35.329> then<00:02:36.349> you'd<00:02:37.349> click<00:02:37.560> ok<00:02:37.920> that

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
my stuff and then you'd click ok that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.809 
my stuff and then you'd click ok that
makes<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.519> statics<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.329> can't<00:02:39.540> change<00:02:40.819> so

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
makes it statics and it can't change so

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:49.400 
makes it statics and it can't change so
then<00:02:42.410> ok<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.470> that's<00:02:43.739> all<00:02:43.950> that's<00:02:44.220> done

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.750 

so<00:02:50.040> then<00:02:50.220> what<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.550> would<00:02:50.700> do<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.690> would<00:02:51.930> go<00:02:52.110> to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
so then what you would do it would go to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.190 
so then what you would do it would go to
you<00:02:53.760> need<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.030> forward<00:02:54.360> your<00:02:54.480> poor<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:55.020> allow

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
you need to forward your poor to allow

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.270 
you need to forward your poor to allow
people<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:56.040> join

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.780 

pour<00:02:59.880> forward<00:03:01.010> simple<00:03:02.010> port<00:03:02.250> forward<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.670> what

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
pour forward simple port forward is what

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.860 
pour forward simple port forward is what
you<00:03:02.910> need<00:03:03.030> then<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.870> download<00:03:04.770> that<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.690> I

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
you need then you download that and I

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:17.230 
you need then you download that and I
have<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:08.040> want<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.580> run<00:03:09.240> that

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.470 

okay<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:17.840> you<00:03:18.170> can<00:03:18.230> select<00:03:18.590> your<00:03:19.240> router<00:03:20.240> from

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
okay so you can select your router from

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.530 
okay so you can select your router from
that<00:03:20.690> list<00:03:20.930> put<00:03:21.590> in<00:03:21.740> your<00:03:22.010> router<00:03:22.520> IP<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:23.360> might

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
that list put in your router IP it might

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.080 
that list put in your router IP it might
do<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.720> automatically<00:03:24.380> type<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.520> admin<00:03:25.940> the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
do that automatically type in admin the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.190 
do that automatically type in admin the
password<00:03:26.480> would<00:03:26.630> be<00:03:26.780> admin<00:03:27.140> as<00:03:27.290> well<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.030> then

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
password would be admin as well and then

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.350 
password would be admin as well and then
