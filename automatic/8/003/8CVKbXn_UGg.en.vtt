before<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.299> was<00:03:14.450> with<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.900> late<00:03:15.380> buddy<00:03:15.650> rich<00:03:15.950> we

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
before it was with a late buddy rich we

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.490 
before it was with a late buddy rich we
just<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.269> practice<00:03:17.720> once<00:03:17.930> in<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.109> while<00:03:18.320> when

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
just the practice once in a while when

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.020 
just the practice once in a while when
we<00:03:18.530> were<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.920> same<00:03:19.100> town<00:03:19.400> on<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.730> road<00:03:20.000> and

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
we were in the same town on a road and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.090 
we were in the same town on a road and
it<00:03:20.269> was<00:03:20.390> at<00:03:20.540> Harry<00:03:20.720> James<00:03:21.019> so<00:03:21.890> that's

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
it was at Harry James so that's

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.490 
it was at Harry James so that's
basically<00:03:22.640> with<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.060> thing<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.600> can<00:03:23.810> it

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
basically with that thing you can it

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.920 
basically with that thing you can it
says<00:03:24.769> one<00:03:25.190> two

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:37.770 

it's<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.440> kind<00:03:29.710> of<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:29.890> thing<00:03:30.180> right<00:03:31.800> so<00:03:36.780> you

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
it's that kind of a thing right so you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.840 
it's that kind of a thing right so you
go<00:03:37.960> as<00:03:38.080> fast<00:03:38.290> as<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.650> want<00:03:38.800> that<00:03:39.040> way<00:03:39.220> but<00:03:39.700> it

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
go as fast as you want that way but it

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.560 
go as fast as you want that way but it

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
doesn't sound I think this good well

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.140 
doesn't sound I think this good well
let's<00:03:43.959> find<00:03:44.230> out<00:03:44.440> here's<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.340> natural<00:03:45.760> real

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
let's find out here's the natural real

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.130 
let's find out here's the natural real
way<00:03:46.330> playing<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.930> here<00:03:47.200> now<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:49.030> Safeway

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:06.540 

natural<00:03:53.140> here<00:03:55.680> so<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:04.230> cheating<00:04:05.230> way<00:04:05.550> the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
natural here so the cheating way the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.229 
natural here so the cheating way the
natural<00:04:07.030> way<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:09.510> other<00:04:10.510> way<00:04:12.120> but<00:04:13.120> the

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
natural way the other way but the

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.940 
natural way the other way but the
cheating<00:04:13.660> way<00:04:13.780> you'd<00:04:13.989> use<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.230> in<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.739> much

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
cheating way you'd use that in a much

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.699 
cheating way you'd use that in a much
faster<00:04:14.980> tempo<00:04:15.970> oh<00:04:16.180> sure<00:04:16.570> would<00:04:17.140> you<00:04:17.260> would<00:04:17.560> you

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
faster tempo oh sure would you would you

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.349 
faster tempo oh sure would you would you
use<00:04:17.950> it<00:04:18.130> at<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.280> tempo<00:04:18.609> like<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:19.000> oh<00:04:19.030> yeah<00:04:19.329> I

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
use it at a tempo like that oh yeah I

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:33.420 
use it at a tempo like that oh yeah I
would<00:04:19.540> tempo<00:04:20.470> here

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.750 

so<00:04:34.430> on<00:04:34.640> you<00:04:34.820> go<00:04:38.530> basically<00:04:39.530> well<00:04:40.400> that<00:04:40.580> would

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
so on you go basically well that would

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:48.520 
so on you go basically well that would
be<00:04:40.790> slow<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.540> would<00:04:44.500> or<00:04:45.500> one<00:04:45.950> way<00:04:46.130> this<00:04:46.340> way
