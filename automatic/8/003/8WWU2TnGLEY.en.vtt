00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 again and again one hears in the press that 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.150
 the north pole will melt away 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.370
 photos showed where the north pole always 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.800
 less ice has to do research 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.389
 even after what is really there as 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.940
 First let's take a look 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.010
 changes since 2007 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.430
 In the year the ice was strongest 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.430
 back 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.220
 we will see more ice again in 2008 than 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.080
 2007 is present however the is correct 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.950
 20 year average not 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.950
 he is cheated 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.100
 a comparison to another 20 years 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.170
 average weirder 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.000
 from the same source, the information 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.250
 on the right are definitely the ones 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.470
 you can also do right later here in the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.119
 video see an error or intentional order 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.119
 to make it look more dramatic 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.550
 Here you can do a three-year comparison 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.290
 Well 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.720
 as mass increase again that 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.460
 but clearly contradicts the information 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.400
 from the increasingly melting 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.380
 polar ice a report from 2009 with 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.790
 dramatic title and you show two 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.950
 Pictures of north pole 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.570
 only that is nothing extraordinary 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.240
 every year goes to the middle or end 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.280
 september the ice back though the ice 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.140
 Less goes back in summer 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.750
 it so represented whether the ice 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.580
 unstoppable melts and how 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.040
 we can already see that 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.470
 unstoppable mysterious melting of the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.810
 Ice without tools stop because so 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.210
 swiftly as the ice melts begins 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.760
 it also grows mysterious again 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.650
 or it is only ever from the minimum 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.050
 No one speaks of the stinking 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.120
 maximum is probably because of that 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.980
 the ice masses almost always in winter 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.590
 no matter how little or equal 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.660
 much ice melted in the summer is the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.560
 I will prove later too 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.810
 and 2011 is similar to 2010 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.490
 This year, too, is melting and freezing 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.080
 The water in the media may be natural 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.450
 also in this year no 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.520
 Horror messages are missing there it says that 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.560
 ice in the arctic ocean around the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.930
 nordpol has declined sharply again 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.790
 the perennial two to five meters 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.500
 Thick ice melts even faster than 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.430
 previously assumed was one 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.890
 scientist of 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.050
 alfred-vomer-institut to this 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.180
 other dramatic fact is fact 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.250
 but that in winter ice masses always 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.610
 almost identical to what you see 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.610
 can 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.670
 2012 have 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.010
 the back reaches a peak in 2012 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.020
 and is stronger than the previous record 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.180
 2007, however, there is one 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.890
 special feature because of the ice decline 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.930
 It was not just the heat that was there 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.070
 an exceptionally strong storm 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.380
 beginning of middle august 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.450
 this has literally the whole ice 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.460
 blown away and set for a new record 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.590
 worried but that is no reason now 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.300
 for panic because the ice already has 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.140
 almost average values again 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.330
 reached 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.830
 Here is a satellite photo of the stream 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.830
 comparable to a hurricane 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.440
 Here is a current diagram 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.450
 the ice at the north pole you can also see 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.340
 that despite the large mass loss 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.590
 the values ​​are again 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.780
 normalize it look at you completely 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.430
 exactly this diagram comes from 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.590
 same source of wind most of the here 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.079
 shown excerpts the pictures for 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.370
 But the end is fake about 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.440
 at 2005 is lied from 2002 to 2006 gave 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.570
 there are no significant differences 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.710
 Nevertheless, the diagram sinks but also the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.710
 pictures are fake 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.809
 here the right representation on the 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.669
 right side I have the approximate 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:38.009
 transferred edges on the left side 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.229
 here was quite clumsy worked but 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.050
 it is even worse than me 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.369
 show will at this floor yet 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.399
 worked worse 

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:50.909
 Consider 2007 was the lowest value 

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:53.279
 just over four until 2006 except for a few 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.860
 exceptions around the six this scale has 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:58.770
 but 5 as mist worth something already wrong 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.899
 is also the steady decline and 2008 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.069
 as the lowest value are absolutely wrong 

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:06.809
 From 2008 to 2011 the value is 5 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.610
 comes that the pictures of the ice 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:11.069
 they are not right with the wrong ones 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.619
 years are about some pictures 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.879
 even fake and that's what you show us 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:16.879
 then as a real garden 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.840
 the red line shows 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.000
 real values as well as about them in 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.280
 Reality is you could do it all 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.180
 to go on forever there is clear 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.130
 tips will be like 2007 and 2012 but that 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.050
 Ice grows even after such peaks 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.580
 pictures and does not disappear despite 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.580
 rising carbon dioxide
