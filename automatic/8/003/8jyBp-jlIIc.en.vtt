playability<00:02:50.190> wise<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.269> doesn't<00:02:51.510> cut<00:02:51.840> it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
playability wise it just doesn't cut it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.199 
playability wise it just doesn't cut it
for<00:02:51.959> me<00:02:52.139> that<00:02:52.379> once<00:02:52.620> intimate<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:54.180> to

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
for me that once intimate I just have to

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.539 
for me that once intimate I just have to
have<00:02:54.540> either<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.900> CDM<00:02:55.500> or<00:02:55.799> a<00:02:55.859> couple<00:02:56.459> of

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
have either a CDM or a couple of

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.429 
have either a CDM or a couple of
sentiments<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.269> offer<00:02:57.540> some<00:02:58.079> good

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
sentiments that can offer some good

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.559 
sentiments that can offer some good
defensive<00:02:58.980> support<00:02:59.370> i<00:02:59.430> guess<00:02:59.670> like<00:02:59.879> just

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
defensive support i guess like just

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.089 
defensive support i guess like just
having<00:03:00.750> one<00:03:00.989> centimeter<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.650> basically

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
having one centimeter like basically

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.190 
having one centimeter like basically
five<00:03:02.430> attackers<00:03:02.819> isn't<00:03:03.569> good<00:03:03.689> enough<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:04.109> a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
five attackers isn't good enough it's a

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.259 
five attackers isn't good enough it's a
no-go<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.920> don't<00:03:05.129> need<00:03:05.220> five<00:03:05.519> attackers<00:03:05.909> to

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
no-go I don't need five attackers to

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.000 
no-go I don't need five attackers to
build<00:03:06.450> up<00:03:06.599> my<00:03:06.750> play<00:03:07.019> like<00:03:07.530> if<00:03:07.680> I'm<00:03:07.799> using

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.770 
build up my play like if I'm using
centum<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.639> they<00:03:08.849> will<00:03:08.970> naturally<00:03:09.180> push<00:03:09.599> up

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
centum is they will naturally push up

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.569 
centum is they will naturally push up

BAM<00:04:25.440> yang<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.830> very<00:04:26.280> very<00:04:26.550> hard<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.030> defend<00:04:27.360> and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
BAM yang is very very hard to defend and

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.780 
BAM yang is very very hard to defend and
the<00:04:27.930> way<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.110> was<00:04:28.350> playing<00:04:28.650> was<00:04:29.160> super<00:04:29.580> sweaty

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
the way I was playing was super sweaty

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.310 
the way I was playing was super sweaty
like<00:04:30.030> if<00:04:30.270> when<00:04:30.780> I'm<00:04:30.930> playing<00:04:31.050> these

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
like if when I'm playing these

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.600 
like if when I'm playing these
tournament<00:04:31.770> games<00:04:31.920> I<00:04:32.130> don't<00:04:32.160> really<00:04:32.430> play

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
tournament games I don't really play

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.000 
tournament games I don't really play
that<00:04:32.640> good<00:04:32.940> football<00:04:33.360> so<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.320> either<00:04:34.680> be

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
that good football so it's either be

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.160 
that good football so it's either be
sweat<00:04:35.340> while<00:04:35.550> sweat<00:04:35.910> or<00:04:36.090> be<00:04:36.330> sweated<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:36.990> for

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
sweat while sweat or be sweated and for

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.720 
sweat while sweat or be sweated and for
me<00:04:37.320> I'm<00:04:37.770> going<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.130> swear<00:04:38.370> that's<00:04:38.550> what<00:04:38.580> i'm

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
me I'm going to swear that's what i'm

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.280 
me I'm going to swear that's what i'm
using<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.090> BAM<00:04:39.270> yang<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.690> we<00:04:39.780> did<00:04:39.960> in<00:04:40.080> fact

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
using a BAM yang and we did in fact

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.020 
using a BAM yang and we did in fact
smash<00:04:40.650> him<00:04:40.800> for<00:04:41.040> nil<00:04:41.250> but<00:04:41.400> now<00:04:41.520> he<00:04:41.580> was<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:41.850> good

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
smash him for nil but now he was a good

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.760 
smash him for nil but now he was a good
player<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.450> yeah<00:04:42.990> he<00:04:43.110> was<00:04:43.230> probably<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.560> best

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
player and yeah he was probably the best

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.310 
player and yeah he was probably the best
of<00:04:44.310> all<00:04:44.580> of<00:04:44.730> them<00:04:44.880> but<00:04:45.300> now<00:04:45.450> we<00:04:45.510> move<00:04:45.810> into<00:04:46.080> the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
of all of them but now we move into the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.010 
of all of them but now we move into the
final<00:04:46.590> game<00:04:47.070> against<00:04:47.970> this<00:04:48.120> team<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.690> was<00:04:48.870> like

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
final game against this team I was like

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.020 
final game against this team I was like
hang<00:04:49.230> on<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.440> minute<00:04:49.620> what's<00:04:50.280> going<00:04:50.730> on<00:04:50.970> here

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
hang on a minute what's going on here

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.430 
hang on a minute what's going on here
he's<00:04:51.300> got<00:04:51.450> like<00:04:51.540> poor<00:04:51.750> chemistry<00:04:52.230> in<00:04:52.290> that

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
he's got like poor chemistry in that

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.930 
he's got like poor chemistry in that
although<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.860> was<00:04:52.980> a<00:04:53.010> very<00:04:53.220> very<00:04:53.490> good<00:04:53.670> player

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
although it was a very very good player

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.900 
although it was a very very good player
we<00:04:54.630> only<00:04:54.780> scored<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.350> one<00:04:55.530> goal<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:56.130> very<00:04:56.640> early

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
we only scored the one goal a very early

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.520 
we only scored the one goal a very early
on<00:04:56.940> before<00:04:57.180> he<00:04:57.420> could<00:04:57.540> sub<00:04:57.780> on<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.050> defender

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
on before he could sub on the defender

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.110 
on before he could sub on the defender
and<00:04:58.710> obviously<00:04:59.040> we<00:04:59.250> won<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.580> cup<00:04:59.760> which<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.000> was

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
and obviously we won the cup which I was

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.450 
and obviously we won the cup which I was
happy<00:05:00.480> about<00:05:00.570> but<00:05:01.260> if<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.590> listen<00:05:01.740> closely<00:05:02.070> to

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
happy about but if you listen closely to

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.460 
happy about but if you listen closely to
what<00:05:02.670> the<00:05:03.030> actual<00:05:03.150> commentators<00:05:03.990> were<00:05:04.020> saying

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
what the actual commentators were saying

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.620 
what the actual commentators were saying
they<00:05:04.980> were<00:05:05.040> saying<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.700> I<00:05:05.760> was<00:05:06.030> like<00:05:06.210> going

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
they were saying that I was like going

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.420 
they were saying that I was like going
through<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:07.170> the<00:05:07.320> next<00:05:07.440> game<00:05:07.770> in<00:05:08.010> that<00:05:08.100> so<00:05:08.400> I

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
through to the next game in that so I

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.010 
through to the next game in that so I
think<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.880> game<00:05:09.060> like<00:05:09.300> glitchin<00:05:09.780> didn't

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
think the game like glitchin didn't

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.570 
think the game like glitchin didn't
actually<00:05:10.170> put<00:05:10.560> me<00:05:10.710> against<00:05:11.010> someone<00:05:11.100> in<00:05:11.490> the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
actually put me against someone in the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.250 
actually put me against someone in the
final<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.180> don't<00:05:12.540> know<00:05:12.600> if<00:05:12.780> that's<00:05:12.990> like

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260
