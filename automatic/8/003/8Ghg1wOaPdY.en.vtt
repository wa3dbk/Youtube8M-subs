all<00:00:08.620> right<00:00:08.770> in<00:00:08.920> our<00:00:09.040> last<00:00:09.880> video<00:00:10.210> we<00:00:10.389> study

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:10.629 
all right in our last video we study

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.230 
all right in our last video we study
Newton's<00:00:11.639> second<00:00:12.639> law<00:00:12.670> of<00:00:12.790> motion<00:00:12.940> which

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
Newton's second law of motion which

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.850 
Newton's second law of motion which
states<00:00:13.750> that<00:00:13.840> the<00:00:14.110> acceleration<00:00:14.559> of<00:00:14.769> an

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
states that the acceleration of an

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.070 
states that the acceleration of an
object<00:00:14.889> is<00:00:15.400> equal<00:00:15.610> to<00:00:15.790> the<00:00:16.000> net<00:00:16.420> force<00:00:16.450> acting

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
object is equal to the net force acting

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.160 
object is equal to the net force acting
on<00:00:17.230> it<00:00:17.290> divided<00:00:18.099> by<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:18.310> mass<00:00:18.610> so<00:00:19.119> right<00:00:19.869> here

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
on it divided by the mass so right here

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.269 
on it divided by the mass so right here
in<00:00:20.290> this<00:00:20.349> video<00:00:20.650> I'm<00:00:20.710> going<00:00:20.830> to<00:00:20.890> show<00:00:21.009> you<00:00:21.099> some

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
in this video I'm going to show you some

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.210 
in this video I'm going to show you some
examples<00:00:21.730> using<00:00:22.000> this<00:00:22.750> formula<00:00:23.260> now<00:00:23.439> remember

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
examples using this formula now remember

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.759 
examples using this formula now remember
that<00:00:24.369> our<00:00:24.460> units<00:00:24.850> for<00:00:25.150> acceleration<00:00:26.080> is

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
that our units for acceleration is

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.900 
that our units for acceleration is
meters<00:00:27.250> per<00:00:27.480> second<00:00:28.480> squared<00:00:29.430> for<00:00:30.430> force<00:00:30.670> it's

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
meters per second squared for force it's

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.200 
meters per second squared for force it's
Newtons<00:00:31.390> and<00:00:31.660> then<00:00:32.379> for<00:00:32.860> mass<00:00:33.550> is<00:00:33.850> going<00:00:34.030> to<00:00:34.090> be

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
Newtons and then for mass is going to be

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.250 
Newtons and then for mass is going to be
in<00:00:34.390> kilograms

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
in kilograms

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.380 
in kilograms
okay<00:00:35.590> so<00:00:38.729> acceleration<00:00:39.729> is<00:00:40.000> equal<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.299> force

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
okay so acceleration is equal to force

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.070 
okay so acceleration is equal to force
divided<00:00:41.260> by<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.830> mass<00:00:42.159> and<00:00:43.000> again<00:00:43.540> we<00:00:43.930> can

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
divided by the mass and again we can

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.979 
divided by the mass and again we can
write<00:00:44.110> this<00:00:45.239> equation<00:00:46.239> in<00:00:46.540> different<00:00:46.600> ways

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
write this equation in different ways

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.619 
write this equation in different ways
okay<00:00:47.680> because<00:00:48.100> there's<00:00:48.400> three<00:00:48.670> variables<00:00:49.570> so

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
okay because there's three variables so

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:50.880 
okay because there's three variables so
we<00:00:49.659> can<00:00:49.900> write<00:00:50.110> it<00:00:50.229> in<00:00:50.320> terms<00:00:50.530> of<00:00:50.769> each

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
we can write it in terms of each

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.979 
we can write it in terms of each
variable<00:00:51.220> if<00:00:52.030> we<00:00:52.180> want<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.479> write<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.659> in<00:00:52.780> terms

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
variable if we want to write it in terms

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.149 
variable if we want to write it in terms
of<00:00:53.850> F<00:00:54.850> for<00:00:55.299> example<00:00:55.390> we<00:00:55.720> could<00:00:55.839> say<00:00:56.019> F<00:00:56.379> is<00:00:56.799> equal

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
of F for example we could say F is equal

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.039 
of F for example we could say F is equal
to<00:00:57.190> M<00:00:58.059> times<00:00:58.989> a<00:01:00.269> okay<00:01:01.269> this<00:01:01.449> little<00:01:01.690> dot<00:01:01.839> just

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
to M times a okay this little dot just

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.020 
to M times a okay this little dot just
means<00:01:02.199> multiplication<00:01:02.890> or<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.549> go<00:01:03.670> might<00:01:03.850> see

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
means multiplication or you go might see

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.480 
means multiplication or you go might see
it<00:01:04.150> sometimes<00:01:04.570> written<00:01:04.930> just<00:01:05.409> ma<00:01:05.890> okay<00:01:06.430> so

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
it sometimes written just ma okay so

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.920 
it sometimes written just ma okay so
when<00:01:06.760> you<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:06.939> two<00:01:07.090> variables<00:01:07.119> next<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.810> each

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
when you have two variables next to each

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
when you have two variables next to each
other<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:08.229> know<00:01:08.260> that<00:01:08.350> it's<00:01:08.590> meant<00:01:08.799> to<00:01:08.860> be

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
other you know that it's meant to be

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.310 
other you know that it's meant to be
multiplication<00:01:09.909> if<00:01:10.690> we<00:01:10.780> wanted<00:01:11.050> to<00:01:11.110> write<00:01:11.200> it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
multiplication if we wanted to write it

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.490 
multiplication if we wanted to write it
in<00:01:11.410> terms<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.770> M<00:01:12.010> we'd<00:01:12.520> say<00:01:12.670> m<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:13.030> equal<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.600> F

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
in terms of M we'd say m is equal to F

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.190 
in terms of M we'd say m is equal to F
divided<00:01:15.490> by<00:01:15.610> 8<00:01:15.850> all<00:01:16.630> right<00:01:16.750> just<00:01:16.960> be<00:01:17.080> aware

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
divided by 8 all right just be aware

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.350 
divided by 8 all right just be aware
that<00:01:17.260> this<00:01:17.440> is<00:01:17.500> all<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.280> same<00:01:18.490> equation<00:01:19.060> so<00:01:19.270> if

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
that this is all the same equation so if

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.820 
that this is all the same equation so if
you're<00:01:19.510> you'll<00:01:19.870> just<00:01:20.080> need<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.260> change<00:01:20.650> the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
you're you'll just need to change the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.610 
you're you'll just need to change the
depending<00:01:21.280> on<00:01:21.460> what<00:01:22.450> you're<00:01:22.630> solving<00:01:22.900> for<00:01:23.260> so

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
depending on what you're solving for so

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.110 
depending on what you're solving for so
if<00:01:23.770> you're<00:01:23.890> solving<00:01:24.070> for<00:01:24.280> acceleration<00:01:24.820> you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
if you're solving for acceleration you

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.000 
if you're solving for acceleration you
can<00:01:25.150> use<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.630> this<00:01:25.810> way<00:01:26.050> if<00:01:26.710> you're<00:01:26.890> solving

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
can use it this way if you're solving

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.410 
can use it this way if you're solving
for<00:01:27.160> Forrest<00:01:27.580> you<00:01:27.670> can<00:01:27.790> just<00:01:27.970> do<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.240> mass

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
for Forrest you can just do the mass

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.580 
for Forrest you can just do the mass
times<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.870> acceleration<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:31.030> mass<00:01:31.590> in

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
times the acceleration and for mass in

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.680 
times the acceleration and for mass in
force<00:01:32.800> over<00:01:33.040> acceleration<00:01:33.730> alright<00:01:34.510> but<00:01:34.600> what

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
force over acceleration alright but what

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.000 
force over acceleration alright but what
I'm<00:01:34.840> going<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.050> show<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.230> is<00:01:35.350> actually<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.650> much

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
I'm going to show you is actually a much

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.390 
I'm going to show you is actually a much
easier<00:01:36.040> way<00:01:36.370> to<00:01:36.520> help<00:01:36.820> you<00:01:37.000> navigate<00:01:37.540> um<00:01:38.400> using

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
easier way to help you navigate um using

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.730 
easier way to help you navigate um using
these<00:01:39.700> equations<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:41.110> you're<00:01:41.440> going<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.650> see

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
these equations and you're going to see

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.350 
these equations and you're going to see
this<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.920> lot<00:01:42.130> more<00:01:42.520> when<00:01:42.880> we<00:01:42.970> start<00:01:43.180> doing

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
this a lot more when we start doing

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.840 
this a lot more when we start doing
speed<00:01:43.750> distance<00:01:44.080> entire<00:01:44.440> problems<00:01:44.950> but<00:01:45.520> I

this<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:02.620> simply<00:02:03.040> cover<00:02:03.850> up<00:02:04.120> what<00:02:04.840> you're

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
this is you simply cover up what you're

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.230 
this is you simply cover up what you're
looking<00:02:05.320> for<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.830> then<00:02:06.310> it'll<00:02:06.580> give<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:06.970> the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
looking for and then it'll give you the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.399 
looking for and then it'll give you the
formula<00:02:08.049> okay<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:09.099> for<00:02:09.340> example<00:02:10.260> let's<00:02:11.260> say

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
formula okay so for example let's say

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.110 
formula okay so for example let's say
we're<00:02:11.560> looking<00:02:11.650> for<00:02:11.860> force<00:02:12.250> all<00:02:12.760> right<00:02:12.909> so<00:02:13.030> if

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
we're looking for force all right so if

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.590 
we're looking for force all right so if
you<00:02:13.150> cover<00:02:13.480> up<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.690> F<00:02:13.930> ok<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:16.090> see<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.390> other

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
you cover up the F ok you see the other

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.170 
you cover up the F ok you see the other
M<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.380> next<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.830> each<00:02:17.950> other<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.700> M

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
M and a next to each other so M

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.880 
M and a next to each other so M
and<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.840> nice<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.439> each<00:02:21.500> other<00:02:21.590> means

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
and a nice to each other means

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.949 
and a nice to each other means
multiplication<00:02:22.519> so<00:02:22.939> force<00:02:23.329> is<00:02:23.540> equal<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.870> mass

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
multiplication so force is equal to mass

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.360 
multiplication so force is equal to mass
times<00:02:24.470> acceleration

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.640 

and<00:02:28.780> that's<00:02:29.780> our<00:02:29.989> formula<00:02:30.260> if<00:02:30.470> we're<00:02:30.560> looking

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
and that's our formula if we're looking

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.800 
and that's our formula if we're looking
for<00:02:30.950> force<00:02:31.129> we<00:02:31.280> simply<00:02:31.579> cover<00:02:31.819> that<00:02:32.000> up<00:02:32.060> okay

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
for force we simply cover that up okay

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.479 
for force we simply cover that up okay
and<00:02:33.049> it<00:02:33.500> can<00:02:33.620> be<00:02:33.709> anywhere<00:02:34.069> it<00:02:34.189> works<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
and it can be anywhere it works the

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.160 
and it can be anywhere it works the
other<00:02:34.519> way<00:02:34.730> too<00:02:34.849> if<00:02:35.480> you're<00:02:35.689> looking<00:02:35.989> for

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
other way too if you're looking for

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.869 
other way too if you're looking for
acceleration<00:02:36.680> we've<00:02:37.159> already<00:02:37.370> learned<00:02:37.640> that

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
acceleration we've already learned that

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.569 
acceleration we've already learned that
acceleration<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.599> equal<00:02:38.629> to<00:02:38.900> force<00:02:39.549> over<00:02:40.549> the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
acceleration is equal to force over the

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.250 
acceleration is equal to force over the
mass<00:02:40.849> that's<00:02:41.299> division<00:02:41.840> when<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.079> have<00:02:42.230> a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
mass that's division when you have a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.449 
mass that's division when you have a
number<00:02:42.500> on<00:02:42.739> top<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.040> each<00:02:43.129> other<00:02:43.250> so

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
number on top of each other so

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.160 
number on top of each other so
acceleration<00:02:43.849> is<00:02:44.299> equal<00:02:44.359> to<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.900> force

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
acceleration is equal to the force

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.280 
acceleration is equal to the force
divided<00:02:46.040> by<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.670> mass<00:02:46.939> which<00:02:47.689> is<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> formula

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
divided by the mass which is the formula

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.800 
divided by the mass which is the formula
that<00:02:48.319> we<00:02:48.560> work<00:02:48.769> with<00:02:48.980> from<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.459> beginning<00:02:49.879> all

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
that we work with from the beginning all

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.119 
that we work with from the beginning all
right<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.109> then<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:51.409> you're<00:02:51.560> looking<00:02:51.680> for<00:02:52.010> the

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
right and then if you're looking for the

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.160 
right and then if you're looking for the
mass<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.700> simply<00:02:53.090> just<00:02:53.450> cover<00:02:53.720> up<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.019> him

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
mass you simply just cover up to him

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.990 
mass you simply just cover up to him
that's<00:02:54.739> F<00:02:55.069> over<00:02:55.579> a<00:02:55.609> so<00:02:55.760> mass<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:57.019> equal<00:02:57.769> to

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
that's F over a so mass is equal to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.930 
that's F over a so mass is equal to
force<00:02:59.000> divided<00:02:59.780> by<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.349> acceleration<00:03:00.940> so

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
force divided by the acceleration so

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.509 
force divided by the acceleration so
draw<00:03:02.389> this<00:03:02.480> little<00:03:02.780> triangle<00:03:03.010> on<00:03:04.010> your<00:03:04.159> papers

make the easier for you to figure out

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.050 
make the easier for you to figure out
what<00:03:08.239> you're<00:03:08.780> looking<00:03:09.019> for<00:03:09.230> what<00:03:09.409> formula<00:03:10.060> so

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
what you're looking for what formula so

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.890 
what you're looking for what formula so
let's<00:03:11.269> look<00:03:11.389> at<00:03:11.540> some<00:03:11.750> examples<00:03:12.260> okay<00:03:16.900> now

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
let's look at some examples okay now

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.009 
let's look at some examples okay now
here<00:03:18.470> we<00:03:18.560> go<00:03:19.000> alright<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.209> this<00:03:20.359> first<00:03:20.510> example

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
here we go alright so this first example

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.369 
here we go alright so this first example
says<00:03:21.159> how<00:03:22.159> much<00:03:22.370> force<00:03:22.849> is<00:03:23.120> required<00:03:23.420> to

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
says how much force is required to

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.250 
says how much force is required to
accelerate<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:25.099> two<00:03:25.430> kilogram<00:03:25.940> mass<00:03:26.209> at<00:03:26.569> three

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
accelerate a two kilogram mass at three

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.229 
accelerate a two kilogram mass at three
meters<00:03:27.530> per<00:03:27.680> second<00:03:28.069> so<00:03:28.639> it<00:03:28.730> says<00:03:28.879> how<00:03:29.030> much

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
meters per second so it says how much

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.210 
meters per second so it says how much
force<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:29.690> we<00:03:29.810> know<00:03:29.989> first<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.379> all<00:03:30.530> we're

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
force so we know first of all we're

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.520 
force so we know first of all we're
looking<00:03:31.370> for<00:03:31.579> force<00:03:32.030> all<00:03:32.900> right<00:03:33.049> wait<00:03:33.290> let's

draw our triangle okay so we've got Hey
okay<00:03:39.319> so<00:03:39.949> we're<00:03:40.099> looking<00:03:40.280> for<00:03:40.400> four<00:03:40.609> so<00:03:40.760> we

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
okay so we're looking for four so we

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.939 
okay so we're looking for four so we
cover<00:03:41.060> up<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.299> force<00:03:41.569> and<00:03:41.870> we<00:03:42.379> see<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.650> force

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
cover up the force and we see that force

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.839 
cover up the force and we see that force
is<00:03:43.099> equal<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.459> M<00:03:43.690> next<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:44.930> M<00:03:45.260> times<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.849> M

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
is equal to M next to a so M times a M

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.569 
is equal to M next to a so M times a M
times<00:03:47.389> a<00:03:47.629> all<00:03:48.470> right<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.799> we're<00:03:49.190> looking<00:03:49.430> for

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
times a all right and we're looking for

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.379 
times a all right and we're looking for
the<00:03:49.669> force<00:03:49.909> it's<00:03:50.120> said<00:03:50.389> that<00:03:50.419> our<00:03:52.090> mass<00:03:53.090> was

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
the force it's said that our mass was

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.110 
the force it's said that our mass was
two<00:03:53.720> kilograms<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:55.639> we're<00:03:55.790> gonna<00:03:55.879> most

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
two kilograms and we're gonna most

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.479 
two kilograms and we're gonna most
flight<00:03:56.359> at<00:03:56.510> times<00:03:56.780> three<00:03:57.590> meters<00:03:57.949> per<00:03:58.129> second

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
flight at times three meters per second

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.539 
flight at times three meters per second
squared<00:03:58.790> and<00:04:00.639> 3<00:04:01.639> times<00:04:01.940> 2<00:04:02.209> is<00:04:02.389> 6<00:04:03.099> so<00:04:04.099> our<00:04:04.129> force

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
squared and 3 times 2 is 6 so our force

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.849 
squared and 3 times 2 is 6 so our force
is<00:04:04.669> going<00:04:04.849> to<00:04:04.909> be<00:04:05.030> equal<00:04:05.269> to<00:04:05.389> 6<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:05.959> it's<00:04:06.769> gonna

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
is going to be equal to 6 and it's gonna

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.219 
is going to be equal to 6 and it's gonna
be<00:04:07.010> 6<00:04:07.310> Newtons<00:04:08.060> because<00:04:08.449> force<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.959> measured

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:09.229 
be 6 Newtons because force is measured

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.599 
be 6 Newtons because force is measured
in<00:04:09.650> Newtons<00:04:10.629> all<00:04:11.629> right<00:04:11.750> let's<00:04:11.930> do<00:04:12.109> a<00:04:12.919> few<00:04:13.549> more

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
in Newtons all right let's do a few more

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.939 
in Newtons all right let's do a few more
examples<00:04:14.019> damn<00:04:15.019> I'm<00:04:15.290> gonna<00:04:15.409> redraw<00:04:15.769> my

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
examples damn I'm gonna redraw my

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.710 
examples damn I'm gonna redraw my
triangles<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:16.970> can<00:04:17.120> see<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.419> little<00:04:17.479> bit

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
triangles so you can see it a little bit

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.640 
triangles so you can see it a little bit
better

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.590 

all<00:04:24.650> right<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:25.310> next<00:04:25.460> example<00:04:25.760> says<00:04:26.090> given<00:04:26.510> a

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
all right this next example says given a

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.740 
all right this next example says given a
force<00:04:26.900> of<00:04:27.140> 100<00:04:28.010> Newtons<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:28.880> an<00:04:29.090> acceleration

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
force of 100 Newtons and an acceleration

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.290 
force of 100 Newtons and an acceleration
of<00:04:29.870> 10<00:04:30.200> meters<00:04:30.620> per<00:04:30.650> second<00:04:31.220> squared<00:04:31.550> what<00:04:32.180> is

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
of 10 meters per second squared what is

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.720 
of 10 meters per second squared what is
the<00:04:32.450> mass<00:04:32.770> okay<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:33.830> we're<00:04:34.130> looking<00:04:34.280> for<00:04:34.640> the

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
the mass okay so we're looking for the

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.680 
the mass okay so we're looking for the
mass<00:04:34.940> okay

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
mass okay

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.940 
mass okay
so<00:04:37.540> mass<00:04:38.540> we<00:04:38.990> cover<00:04:39.230> up<00:04:39.290> the<00:04:39.380> M<00:04:39.560> because<00:04:39.800> that's

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
so mass we cover up the M because that's

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.250 
so mass we cover up the M because that's
what<00:04:40.070> we're<00:04:40.190> looking<00:04:40.370> for<00:04:40.460> equals<00:04:41.120> F<00:04:41.330> over<00:04:42.020> a

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
what we're looking for equals F over a

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.680 
what we're looking for equals F over a
forest<00:04:43.010> over<00:04:43.280> acceleration<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.000> mass<00:04:44.360> is

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
forest over acceleration so mass is

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.230 
forest over acceleration so mass is
equal<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.560> force<00:04:46.000> divided<00:04:47.000> by<00:04:47.150> the

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
equal to the force divided by the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.910 
equal to the force divided by the
acceleration<00:04:47.770> okay

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
acceleration okay

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.620 
acceleration okay
it<00:04:48.980> said<00:04:49.370> my<00:04:49.520> force<00:04:49.820> was<00:04:50.410> 100<00:04:51.410> Newtons<00:04:52.010> and

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
it said my force was 100 Newtons and

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.550 
it said my force was 100 Newtons and
that's<00:04:53.630> gonna<00:04:53.840> be<00:04:53.960> divided<00:04:54.320> by<00:04:54.410> my

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
that's gonna be divided by my

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.890 
that's gonna be divided by my
acceleration<00:04:55.040> which<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:55.460> said<00:04:55.670> was<00:04:55.880> 10<00:04:56.300> meters

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
acceleration which it said was 10 meters

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.150 
acceleration which it said was 10 meters
per<00:04:57.080> second<00:04:57.770> squared<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:59.180> can<00:04:59.360> see<00:04:59.510> that

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
per second squared and I can see that

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160 
per second squared and I can see that
100<00:05:01.160> divided<00:05:01.490> by<00:05:01.520> 10<00:05:01.820> we<00:05:02.120> know<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.960> cross

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
100 divided by 10 we know and cross

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.420 
100 divided by 10 we know and cross
these<00:05:03.320> out<00:05:03.560> 10<00:05:03.830> divided<00:05:04.220> by<00:05:04.250> 1<00:05:04.550> is<00:05:05.000> gonna<00:05:05.780> be<00:05:05.870> 10

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
these out 10 divided by 1 is gonna be 10

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.950 
these out 10 divided by 1 is gonna be 10
but<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.700> says<00:05:08.000> we're<00:05:08.330> looking<00:05:08.360> for<00:05:08.660> our<00:05:08.720> mass

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
but it says we're looking for our mass

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.130 
but it says we're looking for our mass
and<00:05:09.290> mass<00:05:09.440> is<00:05:09.650> measured<00:05:09.830> in<00:05:10.100> kilograms<00:05:10.460> so

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
and mass is measured in kilograms so

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.580 
and mass is measured in kilograms so
this<00:05:12.140> the<00:05:12.680> mass<00:05:12.860> of<00:05:13.100> this<00:05:13.250> object<00:05:13.310> would<00:05:13.850> be<00:05:13.970> 10

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
this the mass of this object would be 10

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.950 
this the mass of this object would be 10
kilograms<00:05:15.670> okay<00:05:16.670> pretty<00:05:17.120> simple<00:05:17.570> all<00:05:17.840> right

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
kilograms okay pretty simple all right

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.840 
kilograms okay pretty simple all right
with<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.440> little<00:05:18.710> practice<00:05:18.800> you'll<00:05:19.490> be<00:05:19.550> getting

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
with a little practice you'll be getting

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.180 
with a little practice you'll be getting
it<00:05:19.940> in<00:05:20.060> no<00:05:20.180> time<00:05:20.420> all<00:05:20.630> right<00:05:21.110> we'll<00:05:21.350> do<00:05:21.560> one

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
it in no time all right we'll do one

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.270 
it in no time all right we'll do one
more<00:05:22.400> okay<00:05:23.120> it<00:05:23.720> says<00:05:24.050> this<00:05:24.440> one<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:24.650> asking<00:05:25.010> for

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
more okay it says this one is asking for

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.060 
more okay it says this one is asking for
the<00:05:25.730> acceleration<00:05:26.300> is<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.260> is<00:05:27.380> what<00:05:27.800> is<00:05:27.920> the

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
the acceleration is that is what is the

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.070 
the acceleration is that is what is the
acceleration<00:05:28.610> of<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:29.090> 10<00:05:29.330> kilogram<00:05:29.810> mass

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
acceleration of a 10 kilogram mass

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.450 
acceleration of a 10 kilogram mass
pushed<00:05:30.860> by<00:05:31.100> a<00:05:31.130> 5<00:05:31.730> Newton<00:05:32.510> force<00:05:32.980> okay<00:05:33.980> so<00:05:34.040> we're

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
pushed by a 5 Newton force okay so we're

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.160 
pushed by a 5 Newton force okay so we're
looking<00:05:34.550> for<00:05:34.850> acceleration<00:05:35.480> so<00:05:35.690> we<00:05:35.810> cover<00:05:36.050> up

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
looking for acceleration so we cover up

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.170 
looking for acceleration so we cover up
the<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.410> and<00:05:37.070> we<00:05:37.190> see<00:05:37.340> that<00:05:37.460> acceleration<00:05:37.970> is

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
the a and we see that acceleration is

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.500 
the a and we see that acceleration is
equal<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:38.630> force<00:05:38.990> divided<00:05:39.680> by<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:39.950> mass

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
equal to the force divided by the mass

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.080 
equal to the force divided by the mass
acceleration<00:05:41.510> is<00:05:41.960> equal<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.290> the<00:05:42.440> force

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
acceleration is equal to the force

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.410 
acceleration is equal to the force
divided<00:05:44.090> by<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.570> mass<00:05:45.040> okay<00:05:46.070> and<00:05:46.280> so<00:05:46.820> our

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
divided by the mass okay and so our

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.420 
divided by the mass okay and so our
force<00:05:47.780> as<00:05:47.990> its<00:05:48.260> told<00:05:48.470> us<00:05:48.620> here<00:05:48.860> was<00:05:49.070> 5<00:05:49.460> Newtons

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
force as its told us here was 5 Newtons

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.370 
force as its told us here was 5 Newtons
and<00:05:52.540> our<00:05:53.540> mass<00:05:53.930> is<00:05:54.520> 10<00:05:55.540> kilograms<00:05:56.540> okay

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
and our mass is 10 kilograms okay

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.650 
and our mass is 10 kilograms okay
so<00:06:00.040> our<00:06:01.040> acceleration<00:06:01.310> is<00:06:01.970> gonna<00:06:02.270> be<00:06:02.420> 5

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
so our acceleration is gonna be 5

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.500 
so our acceleration is gonna be 5
divided<00:06:03.500> by<00:06:03.650> 10<00:06:04.370> all<00:06:05.300> right

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
divided by 10 all right

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.670 
divided by 10 all right
and<00:06:05.930> so<00:06:06.530> that<00:06:06.920> is<00:06:07.070> gonna<00:06:07.250> be<00:06:07.840> 5<00:06:08.840> is<00:06:09.050> half<00:06:09.290> of<00:06:09.440> 10

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
and so that is gonna be 5 is half of 10

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.020 
and so that is gonna be 5 is half of 10
so<00:06:09.950> in<00:06:10.220> terms<00:06:10.760> of<00:06:10.940> a<00:06:11.000> decimal<00:06:11.330> 1/2<00:06:11.990> would<00:06:12.140> be

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
so in terms of a decimal 1/2 would be

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.610 
so in terms of a decimal 1/2 would be
0.5<00:06:14.050> all<00:06:15.050> right<00:06:15.260> we're<00:06:15.410> looking<00:06:15.470> for

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
0.5 all right we're looking for

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.000 
0.5 all right we're looking for
acceleration<00:06:16.250> so<00:06:16.580> it's<00:06:16.700> going<00:06:16.820> to<00:06:16.880> be<00:06:16.940> 0.5
