00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.000
Subramanya Temple. 
 Saluvan Kuppam, Mamallapuram.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Golden Era 
3rd Century B.C - 3rd Century A.D

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.800
Saravana! Filming is prohibited here. We'll be in trouble.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.000
Don't worry. Just a bit more...

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.000
I hear someone approaching.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.800
Mankind's most natural urge is to explore.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.300
Society defines us based on our quest.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.800
My quest was conceived and prodded by one man - Saravanan

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.300
You must be aware of the Padmanabhan Temple treasure.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.600
Thirteen Lakh Forty Thousand Crores! That is the temple's worth.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.300
If a temple is meant to stash uncovered riches, what about God?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If I told you Ganesha is the most celebrated idol, would you believe me?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Do not have a half-baked perception!!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There was a time when beasts hunted men.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.500
To protect his clan, Man used rocks and stones to kill his predators.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.800
These rocks could have become his Gods.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.000
You believe that faith in God was created by men, don't you?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Man thrived in communities, not families.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
When leaders conquered and ruled in legacy, they would have become Gods.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
The records of history have been blurred...

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.500
...and replaced with myth and fictional characters.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.000
Who is behind this?

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.500
Whatever little knowledge we have about our history...

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.500
...we owe it to God and his temples.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
A day will finally come..

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.500
...when a fool like me will question a genius like you.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
What story will you cook up?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.500
Rational thinking wasn't always a part of our grandma's stories...

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.000
...but God was definitely in most of them.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Idol worship shouldn't be underestimated.
