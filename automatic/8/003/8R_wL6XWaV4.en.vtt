here's what they do this comes off your
pump<00:00:31.270> right<00:00:31.810> up<00:00:31.899> here<00:00:32.079> two<00:00:32.290> bolts<00:00:32.529> goes<00:00:32.680> off

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
pump right up here two bolts goes off

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.590 
pump right up here two bolts goes off
there's<00:00:32.980> no<00:00:33.100> ring<00:00:33.280> on<00:00:33.399> there<00:00:33.610> there's<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.360> clamp

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
there's no ring on there there's a clamp

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.240 
there's no ring on there there's a clamp
on<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.840> way<00:00:34.930> down<00:00:35.110> and<00:00:35.290> that's<00:00:35.440> it<00:00:35.649> you<00:00:36.100> get

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
on the way down and that's it you get

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.810 
on the way down and that's it you get
that<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:37.120> sensor<00:00:37.780> on<00:00:37.930> here<00:00:38.230> which<00:00:38.579> allows<00:00:39.579> air

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
that the sensor on here which allows air

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.799 
that the sensor on here which allows air
conditioned<00:00:40.120> up<00:00:40.239> to<00:00:40.329> work<00:00:40.480> when<00:00:40.660> you're

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
conditioned up to work when you're

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.530 
conditioned up to work when you're
turning<00:00:41.190> anyway<00:00:42.190> inside<00:00:42.670> of<00:00:42.820> here<00:00:43.059> you<00:00:43.300> should

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
turning anyway inside of here you should

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.060 
turning anyway inside of here you should
have<00:00:43.719> a<00:00:43.960> crimp<00:00:44.320> fitting<00:00:44.590> just<00:00:44.710> like<00:00:44.920> this

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
have a crimp fitting just like this

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.950 
have a crimp fitting just like this
right<00:00:45.309> here<00:00:45.579> a<00:00:45.760> crimp<00:00:46.149> fitting<00:00:46.420> like<00:00:46.540> that<00:00:46.719> on

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
right here a crimp fitting like that on

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.990 
right here a crimp fitting like that on
the<00:00:47.050> end<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.320> hose<00:00:47.440> well<00:00:48.190> they<00:00:48.280> do<00:00:48.339> but<00:00:48.640> look

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
the end of a hose well they do but look

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.819 
the end of a hose well they do but look
at<00:00:49.120> this<00:00:49.179> let's<00:00:49.449> dam<00:00:49.629> Honda<00:00:50.050> they<00:00:50.500> put<00:00:50.710> this

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
at this let's dam Honda they put this

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.380 
at this let's dam Honda they put this
rubber<00:00:51.070> jacket<00:00:51.519> over<00:00:51.579> top<00:00:51.699> it<00:00:52.059> so<00:00:52.210> what

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
rubber jacket over top it so what

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.910 
rubber jacket over top it so what
happens<00:00:52.780> look<00:00:53.050> at<00:00:53.109> that<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:53.379> collects<00:00:53.649> all<00:00:53.739> the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
happens look at that it collects all the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.979 
happens look at that it collects all the
crap<00:00:54.160> in<00:00:54.370> there<00:00:54.519> and<00:00:54.969> it<00:00:55.120> just<00:00:55.269> rots<00:00:55.480> or<00:00:55.660> inward

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
crap in there and it just rots or inward

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.079 
crap in there and it just rots or inward
it<00:00:56.230> just<00:00:56.410> rotted<00:00:56.620> all<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.190> way<00:00:57.370> let<00:00:57.820> me<00:00:57.910> pull

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
it just rotted all the way let me pull

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.130 
it just rotted all the way let me pull
that<00:00:58.120> down<00:00:58.359> look<00:00:58.870> at<00:00:58.929> that

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
that down look at that

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.259 
that down look at that
so<00:00:59.859> there's<00:01:00.070> your<00:01:00.219> clamp<00:01:00.489> that<00:01:00.579> cools<00:01:00.969> that<00:01:01.120> on

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
so there's your clamp that cools that on

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.720 
so there's your clamp that cools that on
there<00:01:01.420> so<00:01:01.539> what<00:01:01.659> happens<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:03.070> power<00:01:03.460> steering

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
there so what happens the power steering

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.580 
there so what happens the power steering
fluid<00:01:03.909> pisses<00:01:04.449> up<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.809> hose<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.260> clamps

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
fluid pisses up to the hose the clamps

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.860 
fluid pisses up to the hose the clamps
you<00:01:05.680> rotor<00:01:05.860> off<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.760> got<00:01:06.880> probably<00:01:07.150> 1,500<00:01:07.810> to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
you rotor off you got probably 1,500 to

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.960 
you rotor off you got probably 1,500 to
2,000<00:01:08.409> pounds<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:08.770> that<00:01:08.860> line<00:01:09.100> you<00:01:09.700> know<00:01:09.790> what

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
2,000 pounds in that line you know what

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.550 
2,000 pounds in that line you know what
that's<00:01:10.630> what<00:01:10.750> happened<00:01:11.140> that's<00:01:11.260> all<00:01:11.409> the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560

the<00:01:53.140> sensor<00:01:53.740> we<00:01:53.890> can<00:01:53.920> change<00:01:54.250> after<00:01:54.460> ok<00:01:55.240> give

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
the sensor we can change after ok give

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:07.109 
the sensor we can change after ok give
it<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.509> pull<00:02:02.490> here<00:02:03.490> we<00:02:03.579> go<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:06.579> this<00:02:06.729> one<00:02:06.909> do<00:02:07.030> it
