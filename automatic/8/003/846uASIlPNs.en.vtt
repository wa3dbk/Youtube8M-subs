00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
consecutive dominant 7th that go a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:03:18.089 
consecutive dominant 7th that go a
little<00:02:35.880> further<00:02:36.180> do<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.510> know<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> song

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.070 

those<00:03:29.080> are<00:03:29.260> all<00:03:29.380> fives<00:03:29.740> going<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.430> one<00:03:30.610> for

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
those are all fives going to one for

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.640 
those are all fives going to one for
Japanese<00:03:32.080> seventh<00:03:33.060> going<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.270> a<00:03:34.320> what<00:03:35.320> is<00:03:35.440> that

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
that's upper fourth is no seventh is the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.150 
that's upper fourth is no seventh is the
five<00:03:47.080> of<00:03:47.350> D

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.360

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
and D seventh is a five in Chains and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.800 
and D seventh is a five in Chains and
we're<00:03:53.520> going<00:03:53.730> right<00:03:53.910> around<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.360> circle<00:03:54.750> of

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
we're going right around the circle of

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:05.360 
we're going right around the circle of
fifths<00:04:03.260> it<00:04:04.260> doesn't<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.800> song<00:04:05.070> but<00:04:05.250> it

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
fifths it doesn't in that song but it

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:26.730 
fifths it doesn't in that song but it
often<00:04:05.790> does<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.840> old<00:04:06.960> song

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
that goes from one chord to the three or

seven to the fly of 7 to the 1 so it

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.430 
seven to the fly of 7 to the 1 so it
goes<00:04:40.550> let's<00:04:40.970> see<00:04:41.090> 1<00:04:41.389> 2<00:04:41.419> 3<00:04:42.639> 4<00:04:43.639> 5<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.810> goes<00:04:45.080> 5

that we've talked about in the past so
chord<00:04:51.020> progressions<00:04:51.500> like<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:52.009> move<00:04:52.160> up<00:04:52.370> a

chord progressions like to move up a

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.520 
chord progressions like to move up a
fourth<00:04:52.759> just<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.180> remember<00:04:53.360> that<00:04:53.600> they<00:04:54.289> like

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
fourth just to remember that they like

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.900 
fourth just to remember that they like
to<00:04:54.680> move<00:04:54.800> up<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.039> forth<00:04:55.280> particularly<00:04:55.820> if

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
to move up and forth particularly if

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.580 
to move up and forth particularly if
there's<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.180> seventh<00:04:56.570> eighth<00:04:56.750> if<00:04:57.229> there's<00:04:57.530> a

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
there's a seventh eighth if there's a

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:12.540 
there's a seventh eighth if there's a
seventh<00:04:58.039> of<00:05:06.880> seven<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:08.180> goes<00:05:08.780> up<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:09.080> fourth

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
around the circle of fifths doing that

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:37.820 
around the circle of fifths doing that
in<00:05:16.070> fact<00:05:16.220> let's<00:05:16.430> do<00:05:16.550> that

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.830 

seven<00:05:38.830> soon<00:05:39.190> did<00:05:39.910> you<00:05:39.940> notice<00:05:40.270> when<00:05:40.390> we<00:05:40.570> got<00:05:40.690> to

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
seven soon did you notice when we got to

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:48.439 
seven soon did you notice when we got to
eat

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.379 

just<00:05:49.409> like<00:05:49.729> spinning<00:05:50.729> wheel<00:05:50.849> I<00:05:50.969> think<00:05:51.270> it's

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
just like spinning wheel I think it's

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.409 
just like spinning wheel I think it's
called<00:05:51.599> that<00:05:51.960> we<00:05:52.110> played<00:05:52.529> through<00:05:52.740> earlier

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
called that we played through earlier

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.149 
called that we played through earlier
okay<00:05:54.419> so<00:05:54.479> that's<00:05:54.900> one<00:05:55.289> kind<00:05:55.650> of<00:05:55.860> chord

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
okay so that's one kind of chord

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.499 
okay so that's one kind of chord
progression<00:05:56.639> that's<00:05:56.789> used<00:05:57.029> a<00:05:57.180> great<00:05:57.479> deal

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
progression that's used a great deal

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.839 
progression that's used a great deal
they're<00:05:57.960> called<00:05:58.139> consecutive<00:05:58.849> dominant

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
they're called consecutive dominant

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:01.549 
they're called consecutive dominant
seventh<00:06:00.270> so<00:06:00.629> make<00:06:00.839> a<00:06:00.870> note<00:06:00.960> of<00:06:01.139> that<00:06:01.289> and

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:01.559 
seventh so make a note of that and

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:03.549 
seventh so make a note of that and
notice<00:06:01.889> them<00:06:02.099> in<00:06:02.279> all<00:06:02.430> your<00:06:02.639> piano<00:06:02.909> playing

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:03.559 
notice them in all your piano playing

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:06.379 
notice them in all your piano playing
the<00:06:04.559> more<00:06:04.830> you<00:06:05.039> notice<00:06:05.520> about<00:06:05.759> chord

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
the more you notice about chord

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.570 
the more you notice about chord
progressions<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.800> better<00:06:08.009> off<00:06:08.279> you<00:06:08.550> are

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
progressions the better off you are

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.640 
progressions the better off you are
because<00:06:09.089> those<00:06:09.330> chord<00:06:09.689> progressions<00:06:10.229> occur

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
because those chord progressions occur

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.950 
because those chord progressions occur
over<00:06:11.249> and<00:06:11.370> over<00:06:11.759> and<00:06:11.879> over<00:06:12.210> again<00:06:12.300> in<00:06:12.659> song

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
over and over and over again in song

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.829 
over and over and over again in song
after<00:06:13.229> song<00:06:13.439> so<00:06:14.069> you<00:06:14.339> don't<00:06:14.669> have<00:06:14.819> to<00:06:14.969> you

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:15.839 
after song so you don't have to you

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.299 
after song so you don't have to you
don't<00:06:15.930> have<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:16.199> reinvent<00:06:16.499> the<00:06:16.770> wheel<00:06:16.889> in

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:17.309 
don't have to reinvent the wheel in

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:19.279 
don't have to reinvent the wheel in
other<00:06:17.460> words<00:06:17.639> once<00:06:17.879> you<00:06:18.059> know<00:06:18.270> certain<00:06:19.020> chord

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
other words once you know certain chord

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.589 
other words once you know certain chord
progressions<00:06:19.830> you<00:06:20.009> can<00:06:20.159> see<00:06:20.370> them<00:06:20.580> coming<00:06:20.879> and

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
progressions you can see them coming and

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:23.719 
progressions you can see them coming and
it<00:06:21.779> it<00:06:22.439> speeds<00:06:22.800> up<00:06:22.949> your<00:06:22.979> sight<00:06:23.310> reading<00:06:23.550> if

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
it it speeds up your sight reading if

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.399 
it it speeds up your sight reading if
you<00:06:23.759> receive<00:06:24.089> a<00:06:24.270> sight<00:06:24.509> reader<00:06:24.749> but<00:06:25.199> if<00:06:25.319> you

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
you receive a sight reader but if you

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:26.989 
you receive a sight reader but if you
play<00:06:25.620> by<00:06:25.830> your<00:06:26.009> chords<00:06:26.580> you<00:06:26.669> know<00:06:26.789> what's

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:26.999 
play by your chords you know what's

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:29.659 
play by your chords you know what's
coming<00:06:27.360> so<00:06:27.599> it<00:06:28.169> just<00:06:28.469> is<00:06:28.800> good<00:06:29.039> all-around<00:06:29.249> for

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
coming so it just is good all-around for
