 video playback which is enough is 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.320
 more with the ipad for example and it can 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.570
 charging for 10 minutes gives time 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.280
 enough for four hours to use something 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.180
 more or less like motomax but with the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.519
 motorola

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.390

 change who the people are 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.019
 arriving at the stage the side is at last a 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.019
 interface oriented towards the 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.250

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.040
 lower pre-installed applications and -
