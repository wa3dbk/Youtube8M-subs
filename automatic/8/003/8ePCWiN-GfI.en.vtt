00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.719
 a word sums up the Mancunian career of 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.670
 cristiano ronaldo trophy in six seasons 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.860
 at manchester ronaldo won eight 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.549
 titles for a champions league at 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.600
 Manchester 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.830
 Ronaldo has become a great player 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.080
 can do everything he can score 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.820
 any goal style of the heads 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.380
 right foot left foot outside the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.760
 surface it's really a super 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.990
 attacker we know what he is capable 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.620
 to do but it is very difficult 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.510
 to stop won his first league of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.060
 champions with the real became the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.070
 main objective of ronaldo the real 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.200
 madrid waits for 11 years its tenth 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.520
 big-eared cup 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.530
 relegated far behind the barÃ§a in 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.540
 championship the success of the season the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.110
 real depends on this eighth finals 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.370
 against manchester 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.350
 we had ups and downs this 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.120
 season in liga we did not have the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.250
 success hoped but the team is improving 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.149
 the real has this ambition to win his 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.610
 tenth champions league 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.930
 that's what all our fans want 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.469
 try their father even if it will be 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.960
 difficult 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:08.490
 the team is well prepared we have to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.450
 all look in the same direction as 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.009
 we want to succeed the last 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.499
 confrontation between the real and 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.450
 manchester dates back to 2003 at the time a 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:20.759
 other ronaldo had qualified the real in 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.979
 semi final the ronaldo of today 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.350
 hope to do as well as yesterday's 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:31.380
 and celebrate at best his reunion with 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.549
 his former mentor sir alex ferguson he 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.499
 taught me the basics of football 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.939
 i arrived at manchester united in 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:37.109
 only 18 years old and serge doucet 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.880
 imagine it in my career the 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.079
 best of the ways 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.179
 I already said them in the past but 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.499
 but I repeat it is one of those 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.889
 who mattered most to me in the 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:46.020
 soccer 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:47.219
 it will obviously be a very hard match 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.849
 especially for the return match to old 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.180
 trafford 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.140
 there will be a lot of emotion for sure 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.580
 but I think it's going to be okay 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.240
 because in my opinion the real has a better 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.530
 team the big players score 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.110
 the story of the game in the big 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.450
 matches the real manchester tonight 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.170
 is an opportunity for Ronaldo to write his 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.170
 own legend
