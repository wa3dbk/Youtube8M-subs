00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.189
 cent 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.169
 we enter a new moment in Brazilian education 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.130
 a time of much more professionalism with more planning 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.319
 organization and evaluation 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.720
 this moment requires a very large joint 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.339
 embellishment with federal government of the state governments that the municipal governments 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.459
 this policy that was implemented in the federal government 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.040
 and that has all the support of the state government 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.540
 it is realized from ibmec which is the index of development of the 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.350
 basic education 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.620
 then must therefore this index that will ask for the quality of the work within 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.080
 of our schools 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.600
 what qualities 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 what is correct in relation to the teaching-learning process 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.850
 with which our teachers are coming 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.960
 so our students are learning 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.850
 like this 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.690
 we will then measure the productivity of pedagogical work 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.710
 4th grade students and 8th graders 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.060
 elementary school as well as high school 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.130
 be evaluated in relation to what they have learned in Portuguese 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.750
 etna mathematics these two indexes are giving result 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.950
 questioned with the incident the approval of our students 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.250
 will give the reference said how are 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.670
 our schools than what is happening with this educational process. 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.380
 within schools 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 within the municipality in the state and in Brazil commented 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.580
 the brazilian evidence is one of the components of the leader and index of development 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.270
 of basic education 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.390
 it is very important that everyone participates responsibly 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.250
 to take the Brazilian test is an act of citizenship both for the student who is going 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.649
 fill in the questions when you parents who will accompany this 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.840
 development of the students for the teachers who will apply the test 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.209
 pay school that is opening this space so that the proof occurs leader 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.279
 thankfully the paranÃ¡ 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:24.819
 has proved to be a state of majority if development of basic education 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.609
 but there is still much to do 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.120
 and we are on this path we are working with our teachers 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.590
 working with our structure 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.770
 working in school management 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.309
 working with pedagogical practices 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:44.489
 and it is important that the whole society was seen to have its role in this movement 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.659
 in favor of education 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.619
