tail heavy it might be a little bit more
difficult<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.289> ride<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.649> out

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
difficult to kind of ride that out

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.130 
difficult to kind of ride that out
without<00:00:58.890> washing<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.789> now<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> stance<00:01:00.840> like

flex<00:01:07.020> rating<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.680> would<00:01:08.040> say<00:01:08.189> actually<00:01:08.580> that's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
flex rating I would say actually that's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.350 
flex rating I would say actually that's
maybe<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.360> bit<00:01:09.540> more<00:01:09.750> almost<00:01:10.340> 6<00:01:11.360> because

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
maybe a little bit more almost 6 because

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080 
maybe a little bit more almost 6 because

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.940 
of a Titan all spine that's right
there's<00:01:15.479> actually<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.140> spine<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.740> runs

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
there's actually one spine that runs
