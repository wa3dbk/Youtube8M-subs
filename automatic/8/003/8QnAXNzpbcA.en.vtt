00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.839
 rf here I found a very funny thing 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.170
 such a site and here you see on your 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.700
 con wars dot com 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.949
 come here and there is a simulator case 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.930
 contract simulator vks goal is very 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.350
 fun because well spend your 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.970
 money on easy cases not hunting 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.710
 but not all people can afford it and yes 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.820
 someone does not need to so indulge 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.989
 probably everyone can 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:36.960
 here you are a strong stimulator go go go 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.629
 choose any case well let's say 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.710
 remove here is that little black that u 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.610
 we may fall 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.340
 here now is all that we can fall 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.969
 push start and that we fall 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.430
 and we and falls nonsense but the thing here 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.930
 what you see is written the price he writes the price 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.030
 real price which is on trade 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.059
 the site 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.070
 well, actually all write that as 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.240
 you have fallen because of how much is almost us 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.820
 this zyrka fell out 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.770
 m44 but galil falls to us and this is nonsense 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.460
 to friends because it is generally full 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460
 full 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 Well, nothing really gets to us of course 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.630
 friends this video is more fun because 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.290
 as a matter of fact, we donâ€™t beat anything 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.590
 it's just pampering but indulge 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.780
 I can find it I think it is very fun 5 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.060
 attack the same galil which no one 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.540
 need and while the dearest I fell for 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.329
 dollar 20 23 cents something well you see 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.880
 nothing comes out good i hope 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.619
 all the same, at least for a little red length 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.780
 subject but you see and the probability 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.299
 loss is about the same in real 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 case because it is very difficult to 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.399
 something you fell 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.280
 actually this is not all that there is 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.729
 on this site you can also clean up 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.840
 other case and so on but here still 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.360
 there is another thing when a simulator 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.430
 contracts here pushes trades contract 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.590
 the simulator opens it 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.050
 what quality do we want to craft 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.610
 weapons well let us be reds 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:35.140
 the coolest here let's say we lay 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.630
 there 10 red line of and click here 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.049
 Here we subscribe 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.810
 and they give us a chameleon 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:49.030
 Yes, that gives you well, it happens at least 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:52.540
 wants to craft let's say azimov give 10 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.410
 red line of chameleon and falls 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.739
 it is possible to admit something else 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.819
 change wanted to swim away rushed to ps3 us 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.079

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.329
 marketplace opens and how much 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:16.239
 really worth the gun well you see 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:19.180
