00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.480 

their<00:00:05.890> grill<00:00:07.170> with<00:00:08.170> the<00:00:08.290> older<00:00:08.530> model<00:00:08.830> WRX<00:00:09.340> is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
their grill with the older model WRX is

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.580 
their grill with the older model WRX is
is<00:00:09.700> probably<00:00:09.969> a<00:00:10.030> little<00:00:10.240> easier<00:00:10.570> more<00:00:11.410> light

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
is probably a little easier more light

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.509 
is probably a little easier more light
distribution<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:14.290> just<00:00:14.769> some<00:00:14.889> ideas<00:00:15.309> of<00:00:15.490> how

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
distribution and just some ideas of how

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.429 
distribution and just some ideas of how
to<00:00:15.669> mount<00:00:15.879> them<00:00:16.180> should<00:00:16.810> we<00:00:16.930> look<00:00:17.080> something

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
to mount them should we look something

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.760 
to mount them should we look something
like<00:00:17.470> this<00:00:17.710> of<00:00:17.919> course<00:00:17.950> not<00:00:18.520> with<00:00:18.700> the<00:00:18.820> bar<00:00:19.770> so

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
like this of course not with the bar so

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.600 
like this of course not with the bar so
tell<00:00:21.279> the<00:00:21.399> lights<00:00:21.930> 500<00:00:22.930> FF<00:00:23.529> series<00:00:23.770> driving

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
tell the lights 500 FF series driving

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.549 
tell the lights 500 FF series driving
lamps<00:00:24.759> right<00:00:25.090> there<00:00:27.719> what<00:00:28.719> I<00:00:28.750> plan<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.079> do<00:00:29.290> is

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:29.559 
lamps right there what I plan to do is

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:37.770 
lamps right there what I plan to do is
melt<00:00:29.829> it<00:00:30.070> all<00:00:30.570> my<00:00:31.570> license<00:00:31.989> plate<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.480> just

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
melt it all my license plate and just

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.180 
melt it all my license plate and just
have<00:00:37.930> it<00:00:38.140> removable<00:00:38.910> what<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.030> all<00:00:40.180> you<00:00:40.960> need

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
have it removable what you all you need

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.940 
have it removable what you all you need
on<00:00:42.190> top<00:00:42.370> of<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:42.760> kit<00:00:42.970> is<00:00:43.000> some<00:00:43.240> quick<00:00:43.510> release

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
on top of the kit is some quick release

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.290 
on top of the kit is some quick release
so<00:00:44.950> when<00:00:45.100> you<00:00:45.190> wire<00:00:45.370> it<00:00:45.550> up<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.880> your<00:00:46.000> switch

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
so when you wire it up to your switch

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.600 
so when you wire it up to your switch
inside<00:00:46.720> you<00:00:47.440> can<00:00:47.590> just<00:00:47.770> quickly<00:00:47.980> release<00:00:48.400> it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
inside you can just quickly release it

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.000 
inside you can just quickly release it
and<00:00:48.880> remove<00:00:49.270> this<00:00:49.420> whole<00:00:49.660> mount<00:00:49.900> when<00:00:50.860> you're

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
and remove this whole mount when you're

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.810 
and remove this whole mount when you're
not<00:00:51.130> in<00:00:51.250> need

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
not in need

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.200 
not in need
I<00:00:51.850> mean<00:00:52.510> it's<00:00:52.630> not<00:00:52.750> really<00:00:52.920> aerodynamic<00:00:53.920> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
I mean it's not really aerodynamic and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.830 
I mean it's not really aerodynamic and
the<00:00:55.210> best<00:00:55.480> thing<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:57.060> could<00:00:58.060> also<00:00:58.210> melt<00:00:58.660> it

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
the best thing I could also melt it

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.260 
the best thing I could also melt it
behind<00:00:59.260> my<00:00:59.710> grill<00:01:00.010> I<00:01:00.160> see<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.670> people<00:01:00.940> do<00:01:01.090> that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
behind my grill I see so people do that

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.319 
behind my grill I see so people do that
but<00:01:01.570> I<00:01:02.550> didn't<00:01:03.550> really<00:01:03.760> want<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:03.970> mess<00:01:04.210> with

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
but I didn't really want to mess with

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:05.880 
but I didn't really want to mess with
the<00:01:04.479> flow<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.290> don't<00:01:05.500> think<00:01:05.680> light

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
the flow and I don't think light

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.770 
the flow and I don't think light
discharge<00:01:06.579> would<00:01:06.729> be<00:01:06.880> that<00:01:07.060> great<00:01:07.299> behind<00:01:07.630> all

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
discharge would be that great behind all

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.800 
discharge would be that great behind all
this<00:01:07.960> but<00:01:11.670> easy<00:01:12.670> thing<00:01:12.939> with<00:01:13.060> this<00:01:13.210> this<00:01:13.630> is<00:01:13.780> a

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
this but easy thing with this this is a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.160 
this but easy thing with this this is a
cheap<00:01:14.170> $5<00:01:14.710> aluminum<00:01:15.340> bar<00:01:15.520> from<00:01:16.509> Home<00:01:16.659> Depot<00:01:16.689> if

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
cheap $5 aluminum bar from Home Depot if

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.929 
cheap $5 aluminum bar from Home Depot if
I<00:01:17.229> don't<00:01:17.409> like<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.710> I<00:01:17.889> mount<00:01:18.249> it<00:01:18.399> and<00:01:18.579> then<00:01:18.729> put

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
I don't like it I mount it and then put

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.209 
I don't like it I mount it and then put
it<00:01:18.969> behind<00:01:19.149> there<00:01:19.479> I<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:20.770> thought<00:01:20.889> this<00:01:21.009> is<00:01:21.189> a

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
it behind there I just thought this is a

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.359 
it behind there I just thought this is a
better<00:01:21.939> first<00:01:22.209> option<00:01:22.679> and<00:01:23.679> you<00:01:23.950> also<00:01:24.069> need<00:01:24.340> a

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
better first option and you also need a

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.090 
better first option and you also need a
drill<00:01:24.759> of<00:01:24.880> course<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.270> drill<00:01:25.479> some<00:01:25.630> holes<00:01:26.100> so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
drill of course a drill some holes so

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.300 
drill of course a drill some holes so
you<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.340> mount<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.700> onto<00:01:27.880> your<00:01:28.179> car<00:01:28.749> and<00:01:29.079> then

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you can mount it onto your car and then

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.580 
you can mount it onto your car and then
some<00:01:30.310> bigger<00:01:30.549> screw<00:01:30.969> holes<00:01:31.179> onto<00:01:32.170> each<00:01:32.289> side

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
some bigger screw holes onto each side

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.590 
some bigger screw holes onto each side
so<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.039> can<00:01:33.249> mount<00:01:33.429> your<00:01:33.490> lights<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:36.600> ground

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
so you can mount your lights to ground

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.760 
so you can mount your lights to ground
and<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:37.929> is<00:01:37.990> where<00:01:38.229> I'm<00:01:38.289> going<00:01:38.439> to<00:01:38.499> put<00:01:38.649> the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
and this is where I'm going to put the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.649 
and this is where I'm going to put the
quick-connect

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
quick-connect

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.330 
quick-connect
B<00:01:40.659> spot<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.170> I<00:01:41.200> can<00:01:41.350> quickly<00:01:41.529> remove<00:01:41.859> it<00:01:42.159> and

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
B spot so I can quickly remove it and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.099 
B spot so I can quickly remove it and
just<00:01:42.579> have<00:01:42.850> everything<00:01:43.119> still<00:01:43.539> connected

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
just have everything still connected

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.309 
just have everything still connected
into<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.469> car<00:01:44.679> this<00:01:45.549> is<00:01:45.850> your<00:01:46.359> switch<00:01:47.079> that

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
into the car this is your switch that

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.019 
into the car this is your switch that
goes<00:01:47.469> into<00:01:47.619> your<00:01:47.709> car<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.249> just<00:01:48.279> follow<00:01:48.729> this

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:49.029 
goes into your car so just follow this

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:52.760 
goes into your car so just follow this
you<00:01:49.299> get<00:01:49.389> to<00:01:49.599> really<00:01:49.840> relays<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:50.950> in<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:52.060> kit

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you get to really relays in in the kit

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.999 
you get to really relays in in the kit
right

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
right

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.059 
right
first<00:01:54.310> off<00:01:54.549> black<00:01:55.179> wire<00:01:55.499> black<00:01:56.499> wire<00:01:56.740> from

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
first off black wire black wire from

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.230 
first off black wire black wire from
each<00:01:57.479> fog<00:01:58.479> light<00:01:58.779> this<00:01:59.770> is<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.130> relay<00:02:00.490> four

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
each fog light this is the relay four

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.390 
each fog light this is the relay four
wires<00:02:01.599> come<00:02:01.990> from<00:02:02.200> it

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.750 

so<00:02:08.400> you<00:02:08.490> want<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> find<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.970> black<00:02:09.270> wire

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
so you want to find the black wire

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.480 
so you want to find the black wire
it's<00:02:11.760> from<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> relay<00:02:15.920> now<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.250> see<00:02:17.370> how

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
it's from the relay now you can see how

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.960 
it's from the relay now you can see how
it<00:02:17.640> splits<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:20.100> just<00:02:20.610> match<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
it splits like that and just match the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.820 
it splits like that and just match the
colors<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.450> use<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.990> butt<00:02:22.140> connector<00:02:22.620> that

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
colors up use the butt connector that

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.890 
colors up use the butt connector that
they<00:02:23.040> supplied<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:24.090> we'll<00:02:24.450> be<00:02:24.570> right<00:02:24.750> back

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
they supplied and we'll be right back

independently the lights a lot of people
do<00:03:28.069> it<00:03:28.190> into<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.520> high<00:03:28.640> beam<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.180> can<00:03:29.209> do<00:03:29.450> that

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
do it into the high beam you can do that

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.290 
do it into the high beam you can do that
as<00:03:29.720> well<00:03:30.010> it's<00:03:31.010> an<00:03:31.130> easy<00:03:31.250> fix<00:03:31.580> if<00:03:31.849> you<00:03:32.060> don't

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
as well it's an easy fix if you don't

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.229 
as well it's an easy fix if you don't
like<00:03:32.450> one<00:03:32.630> way<00:03:32.810> or<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.050> other

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
like one way or the other

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.300 
like one way or the other
the<00:03:35.239> shorter<00:03:35.599> the<00:03:35.630> wire<00:03:36.020> this<00:03:36.950> part<00:03:37.220> right

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
the shorter the wire this part right

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.970 
the shorter the wire this part right
here<00:03:37.370> will<00:03:38.150> go<00:03:38.270> to<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.540> battery<00:03:38.870> this<00:03:39.739> is<00:03:39.800> a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
here will go to the battery this is a

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.890 
here will go to the battery this is a
long<00:03:40.220> way<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.819> one<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.000> your<00:03:41.120> views<00:03:41.569> as<00:03:41.720> close

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
long way so one of your views as close

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.010 
long way so one of your views as close
as<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.200> can<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:43.420> power<00:03:44.420> source

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
as you can to the power source

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.420 
as you can to the power source
so<00:03:45.200> that'll<00:03:45.440> be<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.530> battery<00:03:47.920> all<00:03:48.920> right<00:03:49.040> make

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
so that'll be the battery all right make

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.640 
so that'll be the battery all right make
sure<00:03:49.489> wires<00:03:49.819> will<00:03:50.030> go<00:03:50.060> through<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.480> -<00:03:50.720> these

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
sure wires will go through the - these

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.940 
sure wires will go through the - these
two<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.130> then<00:03:52.220> your<00:03:52.370> ground<00:03:52.610> inside<00:03:53.060> your

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
two and then your ground inside your

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.640 
two and then your ground inside your
somewhere<00:03:54.950> near<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.850> switch<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:57.260> I'll<00:03:57.410> find<00:03:57.530> a

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
somewhere near the switch so I'll find a

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.440 
somewhere near the switch so I'll find a
grommet<00:03:58.040> hole<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.430> you'd<00:03:58.580> like<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:58.819> use<00:03:58.970> and

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
grommet hole that you'd like to use and

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.850 
grommet hole that you'd like to use and
push<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.050> through<00:04:01.750> yeah<00:04:02.750> grab<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.590> hole<00:04:03.739> right

push it through yeah grab the hole right

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.390 
push it through yeah grab the hole right
there<00:04:04.100> where<00:04:04.280> your<00:04:04.459> audio<00:04:04.850> wires<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:07.040> just<00:04:07.250> be

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
there where your audio wires you just be

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.180 
there where your audio wires you just be
to<00:04:07.519> do<00:04:07.670> there<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:08.650> got<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.680> yellow<00:04:09.920> wire

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
to do there I got the yellow wire

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.050 
to do there I got the yellow wire
through<00:04:11.260> right<00:04:12.260> there

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
through right there

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.520 
through right there
plan<00:04:14.060> on<00:04:14.209> making<00:04:14.569> a<00:04:14.630> switch<00:04:14.870> right<00:04:15.110> here<00:04:15.290> I

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
plan on making a switch right here I

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.129 
plan on making a switch right here I
already<00:04:15.920> have<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.190> spot<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:17.690> we're<00:04:17.989> going<00:04:18.079> to

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
already have a spot so we're going to

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.150 
already have a spot so we're going to
walled<00:04:18.350> it<00:04:18.500> in<00:04:18.620> there<00:04:18.829> or<00:04:19.489> cut<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.239> up<00:04:21.160> there's

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
walled it in there or cut it up there's

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.300 
walled it in there or cut it up there's
the<00:04:22.370> wires<00:04:23.169> we<00:04:24.169> can<00:04:24.320> hook<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.560> up<00:04:24.710> make<00:04:25.160> sure

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
the wires we can hook it up make sure

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.500 
the wires we can hook it up make sure
you<00:04:25.400> get<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.610> third<00:04:25.790> one<00:04:26.000> that<00:04:26.030> gets<00:04:26.360> to

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
you get the third one that gets to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.110 
you get the third one that gets to
ground<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:27.830> you're<00:04:27.979> through<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.250> any<00:04:28.370> long

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
ground and you're through it any long

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.560 
ground and you're through it any long
side<00:04:29.419> you're<00:04:29.720> up<00:04:30.850> Jessi's<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.180> that's<00:04:32.330> pretty

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
side you're up Jessi's and that's pretty

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.029

on the Cassie this will look like after
you're<00:04:52.130> done<00:04:52.280> all<00:04:52.460> wiring<00:04:52.729> ground

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
you're done all wiring ground

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.770 
you're done all wiring ground
you<00:04:54.830> just<00:04:55.039> follow<00:04:55.190> back<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.840> yellow<00:04:58.419> goes<00:04:59.419> to

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
you just follow back and yellow goes to

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.380 
you just follow back and yellow goes to
the<00:05:01.210> alright<00:05:02.210> so<00:05:02.419> that<00:05:02.570> goes<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:03.110> switch

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
the alright so that goes to the switch

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.620 
the alright so that goes to the switch
and<00:05:05.390> then<00:05:05.539> your<00:05:06.039> green<00:05:07.039> goes<00:05:07.400> to<00:05:07.550> your<00:05:07.640> battery

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
and then your green goes to your battery

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.700 
and then your green goes to your battery
and<00:05:10.190> your<00:05:11.190> black<00:05:11.760> goes<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.090> your<00:05:12.420> fogs<00:05:12.960> or<00:05:13.560> your

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
and your black goes to your fogs or your

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.310 
and your black goes to your fogs or your
driving<00:05:14.070> lights<00:05:14.280> hook<00:05:15.210> it<00:05:15.360> up<00:05:15.480> and<00:05:15.600> test<00:05:16.050> if<00:05:16.200> it

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
driving lights hook it up and test if it

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.490 
driving lights hook it up and test if it
works<00:05:17.210> alright<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:18.690> there's<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.140> configuration

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
works alright so there's a configuration

see what I did right there pretty much
goes<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.480> screw<00:06:12.930> holes<00:06:13.170> in<00:06:13.350> there<00:06:13.560> and<00:06:14.490> two<00:06:14.760> big

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
goes to screw holes in there and two big

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.910 
goes to screw holes in there and two big
holes<00:06:15.600> right<00:06:15.750> here<00:06:15.810> for<00:06:16.200> there<00:06:16.350> I<00:06:16.530> kept<00:06:16.800> it

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
holes right here for there I kept it

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.330 
holes right here for there I kept it
more<00:06:17.130> in<00:06:17.220> the<00:06:17.280> middle<00:06:17.490> just<00:06:17.850> because<00:06:18.030> of<00:06:19.340> laws

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
more in the middle just because of laws

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.080 
more in the middle just because of laws

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.540 
of physics
now<00:06:21.570> here<00:06:21.870> made<00:06:22.290> I<00:06:22.320> could<00:06:22.620> fell<00:06:22.800> to<00:06:22.950> kind<00:06:23.430> of

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
now here made I could fell to kind of

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.630 
now here made I could fell to kind of
give<00:06:24.180> a<00:06:24.330> little<00:06:24.450> more<00:06:25.100> hooking<00:06:26.100> up<00:06:26.340> for<00:06:26.370> the

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
give a little more hooking up for the

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.890 
give a little more hooking up for the
wire<00:06:26.820> I<00:06:27.320> did<00:06:28.320> the<00:06:28.440> quick<00:06:28.680> release<00:06:29.660> so<00:06:30.660> here's<00:06:30.840> a

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
wire I did the quick release so here's a

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.200 
wire I did the quick release so here's a
quick<00:06:31.140> release<00:06:31.320> that<00:06:31.980> stays<00:06:32.340> on<00:06:32.580> the<00:06:32.670> car<00:06:32.910> for

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
quick release that stays on the car for

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.050 
quick release that stays on the car for
the<00:06:33.300> ground<00:06:33.600> and<00:06:34.290> this<00:06:34.410> is<00:06:34.470> for<00:06:34.770> the<00:06:34.860> power

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060
