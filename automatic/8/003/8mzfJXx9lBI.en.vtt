first need to visit the cygwin website

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.839 
first need to visit the cygwin website
and<00:00:10.019> download<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.410> segment<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:10.860> store<00:00:11.130> as<00:00:11.610> you

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
can see there are two packages available

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.369

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
the 64-bit version and the 32-bit

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.109 
the 64-bit version and the 32-bit
version<00:00:16.560> now<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.160> need<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.580> choose<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.090> right

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
version now you need to choose the right

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.390 
version now you need to choose the right
version<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.289> windows<00:00:19.800> install<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400

where cygwin packages are stored we need

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320 
where cygwin packages are stored we need
to<00:01:05.010> choose<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.460> repository<00:01:06.119> as

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
to choose the repository as

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.090 
to choose the repository as
geographically<00:01:07.049> close<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.710> where<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.010> are

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
located this is a performance issue and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.820 
located this is a performance issue and
the<00:01:11.250> closer<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> repo<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.780> us<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.200> faster

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the closer the repo is to us the faster

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.980 
the closer the repo is to us the faster
it'll<00:01:13.979> download<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.360> since<00:01:15.540> I'm<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.750> Australia
