00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.230
 on the stupid girl 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.470
 number 2 since we recall that the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.970
 last time we won with connected 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.680
 and so we have a cost and this time 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.509
 it is our studies that come to us 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.770
 challenge they saw the video on this game 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.040
 they said we think we can 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.660
 beat 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.349
 yeah we did not bear any power 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.170
 win against his followers what they 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.579
 do to win that's it and suddenly we 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.670
 had the good idea to challenge you on a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.340
 game that we do not control is thought 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.780
 how he's called that kind stayed 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.219
 houston football crosses 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.300
 so here is the principle is that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.559
 this is a completely stupid game 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.149
 graphics are not bad me it's not 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.640
 you are going to be careful if you can 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.679
 to see a boat going to the bottom but hey 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.820
 we have two minutes each to do the 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.679
 maximum of days so we will do better 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:02.190
 commented lang lang you play which I 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:03.620
 not frankly I do not sulk the whiskeys 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.320
 count people the counter maintenance 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:12.509
 4 chip in sun staff expressed 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.250
 Polish you see that you say it in 2 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.930
 minutes each two minutes there I believe 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.590
 that it helped me or you diminish like that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.590
 ok 3 2 with and brazil 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:36.100
 it's like watching the score right with 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:52.650
 here it is the pigeon's wings know I 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:55.540
 know i can do that yes jean ibrac 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.070
 the dynamics of the legs on how much 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.780
 a two that's it does not I did 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:07.840
 how much talent and did eight years ago 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:10.600
 made to move from the railing he to 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.610
 how much time do we have the 8 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.280
 month I think so well we did not look 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.770
 he did tilt the coaching is then 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:24.580
 went I spent eight years in ukiah 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.920
 let's continue score will leave is acquitted 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.410
 in the heart of time, so it counts 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.350
 in time I will go loler television to 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.930
 shit are you going to draw on a 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.720
 it returns the initial position 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.489
 rely on that will go back to ac the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.489
 green button and after that it's both 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.750
 circuits 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:08.430
 you have a package but it went to him 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:19.560
 school three things that remain the 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:21.450
 Gentlemen it's good good go nominal 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.680
 joke that he betrayed then others 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.640
 rib guards pressed on a in fact that 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.630
 means a month initiated positions 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.800
 when these good does not leave but I 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:34.340

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:46.350
 bunkers and its schedules of styles 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:47.970
 we thought we saw something in the beginning 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.150
 stupid or so he's always been very 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.150
 strong 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:02.470
 strategy is me I find it 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:06.310
 as well as a two three- rods kind 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.080
 full axis facing nicolas hulot a lot 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.030
 the can went around the world at the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.610
 sail then we will activate the project 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.370
 bounce also moves and no message 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:25.840
 as well as this year a style that you 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:32.110
 hovels yeah I think passion is 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:33.310
 beautiful leaning on a bone you come back in 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.139
 according to his career where balloons to 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.310
 the winged like little nails and at a 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.720
 leg to joey starr okay I 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.030
 including the trigger it blocks 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:52.690

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:54.520
 crossed them he does like that I do not 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.270
 can not say that he did 8 I admit 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.539
 that by a team game like the 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:10.710
 quick blow to the east believe I have 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:10.710
 it does not smell good 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.430

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:41.830
 on california king bed north of the band 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.510
 of pc list of rotten games I think 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.850
 that you have won the southern committee 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.290

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.060
 no star of the team was equipped to 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.770
