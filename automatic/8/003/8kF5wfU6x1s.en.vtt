00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
in most situations I think that it's

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.280 
in most situations I think that it's
good<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> blend<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> cut<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.140> these

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
must have because you never know what

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.760
