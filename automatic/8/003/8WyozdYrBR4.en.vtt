this topic back up again because I was

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.039 
this topic back up again because I was
really<00:02:05.610> disappointed<00:02:05.729> about<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.509> not<00:02:06.780> being

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.940 
made I don't want to see it made and I
think<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.420> happen

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
think that it can happen

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.949 
think that it can happen
I<00:02:10.009> mean<00:02:10.280> halo<00:02:10.610> was<00:02:10.849> originally<00:02:11.510> supposed<00:02:11.840> to

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
I mean halo was originally supposed to

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.380 
I mean halo was originally supposed to
be<00:02:12.080> made<00:02:12.349> by<00:02:12.650> Peter<00:02:13.310> Jackson<00:02:13.370> I'm<00:02:13.910> not<00:02:14.150> sure<00:02:14.300> if

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
be made by Peter Jackson I'm not sure if

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.729 
be made by Peter Jackson I'm not sure if
he<00:02:14.480> was<00:02:14.599> going<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.780> be<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:14.930> producer<00:02:15.319> or

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
he was going to be a producer or

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.930 
he was going to be a producer or
director<00:02:15.830> but<00:02:16.760> they<00:02:16.879> had<00:02:17.090> weeda<00:02:17.420> on<00:02:17.690> board<00:02:18.019> and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
director but they had weeda on board and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.610 
director but they had weeda on board and
Microsoft<00:02:19.940> really<00:02:20.420> vouched<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:21.140> Peter

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
Microsoft really vouched for Peter

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.040 
Microsoft really vouched for Peter
Jackson<00:02:22.099> but<00:02:22.430> unfortunately<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.599> budget

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
Jackson but unfortunately the budget

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.680 
Jackson but unfortunately the budget
just<00:02:24.260> got<00:02:24.440> way<00:02:24.800> out<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:25.069> hand<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:26.060> they<00:02:26.480> just

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
just got way out of hand and they just

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.820 
just got way out of hand and they just
couldn't<00:02:26.870> afford<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.260> make<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:27.530> kind<00:02:27.739> of

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
couldn't afford to make that kind of

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.070 
couldn't afford to make that kind of
movie<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.700> think<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.120> eventually<00:02:29.330> it

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
movie and I think that eventually it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.949 
movie and I think that eventually it
will<00:02:30.349> be<00:02:30.620> made<00:02:30.860> one<00:02:31.130> day<00:02:31.340> when<00:02:32.000> when<00:02:32.300> when<00:02:32.630> halo

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
will be made one day when when when halo

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.110 
will be made one day when when when halo
is<00:02:33.170> even<00:02:33.530> bigger<00:02:33.769> than<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.160> already<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.489> but

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
is even bigger than it already is but

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.640 
is even bigger than it already is but
unfortunately<00:02:35.390> it's<00:02:36.049> gonna<00:02:36.140> be<00:02:36.319> put<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
unfortunately it's gonna be put on the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.470 
unfortunately it's gonna be put on the
back<00:02:36.830> burner<00:02:36.860> for<00:02:37.190> now<00:02:37.519> however<00:02:37.819> I<00:02:38.090> was<00:02:38.299> so

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
back burner for now however I was so

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.970 
back burner for now however I was so
sure<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.690> halo<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.230> movie<00:02:39.500> would<00:02:39.709> have<00:02:39.739> been

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
sure that halo the movie would have been

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.970 
sure that halo the movie would have been
a<00:02:40.190> very<00:02:40.519> amazing<00:02:41.060> video<00:02:41.930> game<00:02:42.200> adaptation

movie<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.489> really<00:02:44.090> can't<00:02:44.330> think<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.690> what<00:02:44.959> a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
movie I really can't think of what a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.320 
movie I really can't think of what a
good<00:02:45.440> video<00:02:45.739> game<00:02:46.130> movie<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.670> except<00:02:47.299> for

high level of lactose that was Street

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.199 
high level of lactose that was Street
