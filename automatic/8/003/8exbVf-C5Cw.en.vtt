 operette it is a basha device 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.840
 low-end precisely and therefore not 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.030
 without a circuit than to expect who knows 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.980
 what technical characteristics 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.780
 however this is a video 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.269

 small is law we go immediately to see 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.699
 the content you can see the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.960
 convention is very small account that the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:13.060
 my hand collection remains very small 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.700
 very sober in cardboard with coating 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.750
 plasticate had it up to produce al 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.950
 that we're going to see a lot better 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.299
 small and light that our plant 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.409
 unavailable even in coloring 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:36.579
 black, however, you can see the dress 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.100
 how the thickness is not its own 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.409
 very fine, however, we say the mobile is 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.149
 really light they know what it should 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.500
 being in a bacterium should be 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.350

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.729
 here is the light fine point battery 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.119
 since 1470 milan because anyway for a 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.469
 device with 3-inch display can 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.880
 fit a house the guide is not 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.189

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.990
 here is what to adapt ourselves 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.430
 we have Portuguese so we can 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.710
 certainly to connect the device to 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:30.370
 current to charge it last 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:34.270

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.610

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.850

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.350
 matri that we have a space for 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.580
 micro SIM 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.240
 and sorry for the micro sd we have a 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.190
 moment to insert a battery

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:41.460
 first start of lg or not to the right the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.460
 typical place of mg 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:53.760
 let's see a little ok here is android 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.650
 installed version 4.3.2 then 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.550
 however we have a jelly bean 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.280
 we have a cpu 1 GHz single core we 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.830
 do it said one ram memory 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.530
 battery that are very first dates 1400 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.720

 qvga resolution and nothing or the mobile 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.690
 overall even that much battery 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.710
 light here is to have given it far away 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:29.540
