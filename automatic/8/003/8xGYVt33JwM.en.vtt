I'm so stressed I have done all the
reading<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.700> pharmacology<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.540> I<00:00:57.600> still

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
reading for pharmacology and I still

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.590 
reading for pharmacology and I still
don't<00:00:58.260> understand<00:00:58.800> receptors<00:00:59.600> antagonists

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600

agonist antagonist let's start off by

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.380 
agonist antagonist let's start off by
talking<00:01:17.329> about<00:01:17.750> what<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.289> receptor<00:01:18.890> is<00:01:19.070> a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
talking about what a receptor is a

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.469 
talking about what a receptor is a
receptor<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.810> specific<00:01:21.670> chemical<00:01:22.670> or<00:01:22.880> site

receptor is a specific chemical or site

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.240 
receptor is a specific chemical or site
in<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.689> body<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.350> most<00:01:24.560> drugs<00:01:24.920> interact

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
in the body that most drugs interact

with to produce effects these receptors

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.419 
with to produce effects these receptors
are<00:01:28.819> activated<00:01:29.119> or<00:01:30.020> turned<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.649> by<00:01:31.369> the

narcan it's an antagonist it would take

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.619 
narcan it's an antagonist it would take
away<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.099> opiates<00:02:37.609> from<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.909> receptor<00:02:38.390> site

away the opiates from the receptor site
which<00:02:39.140> would<00:02:39.379> block<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.829> agonist<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.939> were
