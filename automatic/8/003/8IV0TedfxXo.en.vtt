00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
wanted to touch base and show you guys

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
wanted to touch base and show you guys
how<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> camera<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.830> going<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
how to do that the camera is going to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.130 
how to do that the camera is going to
come<00:00:23.189> over<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.460> zoom<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.869> show<00:00:25.080> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
come over and zoom in here and show you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.740 
come over and zoom in here and show you
guys<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.039> see<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.180> level<00:00:27.570> is

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
guys if you see right here the level is

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.620 
guys if you see right here the level is
up<00:00:28.109> high<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.670> mainly<00:00:29.910> because<00:00:30.449> your

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
up high that is mainly because your

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.560 
up high that is mainly because your
water<00:00:31.489> settles<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> bottom<00:00:32.759> water<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
water settles to the bottom water is

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.330 
water settles to the bottom water is
heavier<00:00:33.930> than<00:00:34.110> fuels<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.559> your<00:00:34.739> water<00:00:34.980> sucks

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
heavier than fuels so your water sucks

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340 
heavier than fuels so your water sucks
down<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> bottom<00:00:36.050> what<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
do is right here is a nozzle on this 482

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
do is right here is a nozzle on this 482
dive<00:00:39.690> coat<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> other<00:00:40.829> dive<00:00:41.070> because

what we were talking about now you're in

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.740 
what we were talking about now you're in
the<00:01:39.250> safe<00:01:39.460> zone<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:40.030> all<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.270> have<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.450> do<00:01:40.600> is

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
the safe zone and all you have to do is

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.649 
the safe zone and all you have to do is
lock<00:01:40.960> up<00:01:41.200> that<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.909> collar<00:01:42.909> right<00:01:43.180> here<00:01:43.479> and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
lock up that that collar right here and

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.100 
lock up that that collar right here and
then<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.289> stop<00:01:44.590> now<00:01:45.159> our<00:01:45.520> fuel<00:01:45.820> level<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.360> back

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
then you stop now our fuel level is back

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.660 
then you stop now our fuel level is back
into<00:01:47.560> where<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.799> collar<00:01:48.009> is<00:01:48.189> supposed<00:01:48.399> to<00:01:48.490> be

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
into where the collar is supposed to be

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.149 
into where the collar is supposed to be
we<00:01:49.180> basically<00:01:49.479> got<00:01:49.720> rid<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.990> all<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.560> water

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
we basically got rid of all of the water

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.950 
we basically got rid of all of the water
that's<00:01:51.520> setting<00:01:51.880> into<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.210> sediment<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.780> here

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
that's setting into the sediment of here

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.680 
that's setting into the sediment of here
and<00:01:53.140> now<00:01:53.740> all<00:01:54.490> we<00:01:54.549> have<00:01:54.970> in<00:01:55.119> here<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:55.330> fuel

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
and now all we have in here is fuel
