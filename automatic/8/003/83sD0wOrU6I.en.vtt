whatever weapon you're holding of
Christopher's<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.820> give<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.210> animation

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.399 

housing<00:01:04.619> backwards<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:06.140> let's<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
housing backwards here let's get to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
housing backwards here let's get to
firing<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:08.060> let's<00:01:09.060> look<00:01:09.180> at<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.420> fully

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
firing it let's look at this fully

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.330 
firing it let's look at this fully
custom<00:01:10.080> base<00:01:10.460> little<00:01:11.460> frame<00:01:11.729> rate<00:01:11.880> issues

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
custom base little frame rate issues

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:26.480 
custom base little frame rate issues
let's<00:01:14.340> fire<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> couple<00:01:14.820> shots<00:01:25.310> like<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.430> said

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
let's fire a couple shots like I said

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.100 
let's fire a couple shots like I said
the<00:01:26.729> animation<00:01:27.210> quality<00:01:27.360> could<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> little

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the animation quality could be a little

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.350 
the animation quality could be a little
better<00:01:31.040> with<00:01:32.040> any<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.460> Christopher's<00:01:33.000> weapons

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
better with any of Christopher's weapons

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.560 
better with any of Christopher's weapons
you<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> K<00:01:34.470> by<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> way<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:36.240> mag

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
you that's what the K by the way the mag

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.230 
you that's what the K by the way the mag
drop<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.490> don't<00:01:38.640> know<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> derivative

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
drop so I don't know if is a derivative

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.870 
drop so I don't know if is a derivative
of<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:41.509> Leroy's<00:01:42.509> base<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.200> something<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.040> think

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
of the Leroy's base or something I think

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.260 
of the Leroy's base or something I think
it<00:01:44.970> might<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.960> no<00:01:46.140> idea<00:01:46.259> though<00:01:50.270> you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
it might be I have no idea though you

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:05.850 
it might be I have no idea though you
can<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.479> some<00:01:51.659> framerate<00:01:51.930> issues<00:01:52.140> again

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.219 

getting<00:02:06.610> some<00:02:06.760> more<00:02:06.880> frame<00:02:07.120> a<00:02:07.270> shoot<00:02:07.510> up<00:02:07.750> jump

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
getting some more frame a shoot up jump

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.340 
getting some more frame a shoot up jump
skip<00:02:08.440> sorry<00:02:08.770> jump<00:02:09.280> skip<00:02:09.460> Oh<00:02:09.729> God<00:02:10.630> can<00:02:10.990> cut<00:02:11.200> this

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
skip sorry jump skip Oh God can cut this

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.700 
skip sorry jump skip Oh God can cut this
off<00:02:15.780> sorry<00:02:16.780> about<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> jump<00:02:17.200> there<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.440> had<00:02:17.620> to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
off sorry about the jump there I had to

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.120 
off sorry about the jump there I had to
fix<00:02:17.890> something<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:19.020> day<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.080> fire<00:02:20.410> this<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.980> all

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
fix something a day to fire this so all

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.650 
fix something a day to fire this so all
in<00:02:24.220> all<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.460> does<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> decent<00:02:24.910> amount<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.330> damage

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
in all it does a decent amount of damage

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.170 
in all it does a decent amount of damage
the<00:02:25.990> sounds<00:02:26.350> could<00:02:26.530> also<00:02:26.620> be<00:02:26.830> better<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.310> they

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
the sounds could also be better and they

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.210 
the sounds could also be better and they
could<00:02:28.330> be<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.480> lot<00:02:28.630> more<00:02:28.660> better<00:02:29.620> sounding

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
could be a lot more better sounding

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.960 
could be a lot more better sounding
could<00:02:30.610> be<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> lot<00:02:30.850> more<00:02:30.910> powerful<00:02:31.330> but<00:02:31.780> oh<00:02:32.970> no

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
could be a lot more powerful but oh no

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.050 
could be a lot more powerful but oh no
it's<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:34.390> good<00:02:34.540> weapon<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.430> on<00:02:36.610> his<00:02:36.820> base

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
it's a good weapon and it's on his base

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.550 
it's a good weapon and it's on his base
I<00:02:37.420> don't<00:02:37.660> know<00:02:37.750> if<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.020> derivative<00:02:38.440> of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
I don't know if it's a derivative of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.620 
I don't know if it's a derivative of
Leroy's<00:02:39.040> base<00:02:39.280> or<00:02:39.550> something<00:02:39.910> but<00:02:40.150> because

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
Leroy's base or something but because

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.080 
Leroy's base or something but because
you<00:02:40.720> get<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.959> mag<00:02:41.170> drops<00:02:41.670> okay<00:02:42.670> let<00:02:42.790> me<00:02:42.880> show

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
you get the mag drops okay let me show

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.350 
you get the mag drops okay let me show
that<00:02:43.270> again<00:02:43.390> oh<00:02:47.370> then<00:02:48.370> drop<00:02:48.610> back<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.150> time

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
that again oh then drop back that time

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:58.460 
that again oh then drop back that time
strange<00:02:50.730> let's<00:02:51.730> get<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.910> camera<00:02:52.209> out<00:02:52.360> here

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:12.800 

fully<00:02:59.470> custom<00:03:00.010> model

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.449 

I<00:03:12.870> think<00:03:13.739> that's<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.069> about<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:14.489> weapon<00:03:14.849> I

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
I think that's it about this weapon I

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.130 
I think that's it about this weapon I
just<00:03:17.459> like<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.090> base<00:03:18.239> on<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.660> it's<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.989> nice

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
just like the base on this it's a nice

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.640 
just like the base on this it's a nice
base<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:20.849> fully<00:03:21.480> custom<00:03:21.930> model<00:03:22.200> texture

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
base and the fully custom model texture

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.809 
base and the fully custom model texture
sounds<00:03:23.250> animations<00:03:24.180> for<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.630> or<00:03:24.780> just<00:03:25.110> perfect

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819
