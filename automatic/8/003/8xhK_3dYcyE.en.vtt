00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
hi guys so today I'm going to review and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.370 
hi guys so today I'm going to review and
compare<00:00:14.430> the<00:00:14.790> L'Oreal<00:00:15.210> Paris<00:00:15.240> lipsticks<00:00:15.960> with

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
compare the L'Oreal Paris lipsticks with

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.650 
compare the L'Oreal Paris lipsticks with
the<00:00:16.619> Revlon<00:00:17.100> lip<00:00:17.279> butters<00:00:17.700> and<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.570> actually

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the Revlon lip butters and I actually

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.840 
the Revlon lip butters and I actually
didn't<00:00:19.140> hear<00:00:19.320> much<00:00:19.920> about<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.340> l'oreal<00:00:20.610> crest

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
didn't hear much about the l'oreal crest

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.370 
didn't hear much about the l'oreal crest
before<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> saw<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.360> most<00:00:21.599> and<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.960> think<00:00:22.200> they

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
before I saw the most and I think they

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.870 
before I saw the most and I think they
were<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.529> stores<00:00:22.890> ahead<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> launch<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
were in stores ahead of the launch and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.990 
were in stores ahead of the launch and
they<00:00:24.390> were<00:00:24.450> a<00:00:24.930> few<00:00:25.500> weeks<00:00:25.740> before<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.849> lip

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
they were a few weeks before the lip

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.310 
they were a few weeks before the lip
butters<00:00:27.329> so<00:00:27.509> I<00:00:27.540> picked<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> few<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.079> those<00:00:28.169> up

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
butters so I picked a few of those up

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.900 
butters so I picked a few of those up
thinking<00:00:28.739> they'll<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.340> while<00:00:29.610> I'm<00:00:29.730> waiting

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
thinking they'll do while I'm waiting

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.339 
thinking they'll do while I'm waiting
because<00:00:30.450> I<00:00:30.509> was<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.750> desperate<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.140> lip

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
because I was so desperate for lip

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.690 
because I was so desperate for lip
butters<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:31.860> I<00:00:32.189> thought<00:00:32.400> they<00:00:32.640> were

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
butters and I thought they were

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000 
butters and I thought they were
l'oréal's<00:00:33.329> version<00:00:33.900> at<00:00:34.170> Gloria's<00:00:34.470> answer<00:00:34.920> to

l'oréal's version at Gloria's answer to
the<00:00:35.160> Revlon<00:00:35.430> lip<00:00:35.460> butter<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.660> thought<00:00:36.840> they

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the Revlon lip butter and I thought they

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.000

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.990 
were going to be a similar consistency
and<00:00:38.960> yeah<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.290> picks<00:00:40.500> those<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:41.000> really

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
and yeah so it picks those up really

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.939 
and yeah so it picks those up really
really<00:00:42.090> liked<00:00:42.329> those<00:00:42.680> really<00:00:43.680> super

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
moisturizing a really nice sheer formula

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.599 
moisturizing a really nice sheer formula
you<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.199> just<00:00:46.350> pop<00:00:46.590> them<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.800> your<00:00:46.829> bag<00:00:47.010> even

the brights you can put them on without

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.209

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
thought they were going to be like the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.189 
thought they were going to be like the
books<00:00:56.789> around<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> similar<00:00:57.510> price<00:00:57.780> point<00:00:58.050> I

video um so I'll link that below as well

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.050 
video um so I'll link that below as well
but<00:01:09.920> for<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> similar<00:01:11.310> price<00:01:11.520> points<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
but for the similar price points I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.640 
but for the similar price points I
thought<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.170> were<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> be

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
thought that they were going to be

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
thought that they were going to be
pretty<00:01:13.890> much<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> same<00:01:14.250> thing<00:01:14.580> from

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
pretty much the same thing from

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.860 
pretty much the same thing from
different<00:01:15.000> runs<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.480> they<00:01:15.540> were<00:01:15.600> really

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
different runs but they were really

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.810 
different runs but they were really
renowned<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.410> you've<00:01:16.530> got<00:01:16.680> one<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:17.640> just

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
renowned so if you've got one don't just

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.000 
renowned so if you've got one don't just
think<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.330> don't<00:01:18.960> need<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.440> other<00:01:19.620> one<00:01:19.650> because

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
think I don't need the other one because

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.130 
think I don't need the other one because
it's<00:01:20.160> completely<00:01:20.520> completely<00:01:21.360> different<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
it's completely completely different the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.700 
it's completely completely different the
l'oreal<00:01:22.470> caress<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.210> much<00:01:24.210> much<00:01:24.690> surer<00:01:25.290> than

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
l'oreal caress is much much surer than

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
l'oreal caress is much much surer than
the<00:01:26.460> lip<00:01:26.640> butter<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.270> literature<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.870> much

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the lip butter the literature is much

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
the lip butter the literature is much
more<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.740> lipstick<00:01:29.160> it's<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.520> glossy<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
more like a lipstick it's a glossy and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
more like a lipstick it's a glossy and
it<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.720> feel<00:01:30.870> moisturizing<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.980> this<00:01:32.130> is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it just feel moisturizing but this is

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.100 
it just feel moisturizing but this is
sheer<00:01:32.730> and<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.150> more<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.510> a<00:01:33.540> tinted<00:01:34.050> lip

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
sheer and it's more like a tinted lip

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.330 
sheer and it's more like a tinted lip
balm<00:01:34.440> it's<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> completely<00:01:35.160> different

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
balm it's a completely different

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.150 
balm it's a completely different
consistency<00:01:36.180> i<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.750> prefer<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.800> l'oreal

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
consistency i do prefer the l'oreal

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.700 
consistency i do prefer the l'oreal
caress<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.690> reason<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> feels<00:01:40.230> very

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
caress and for that reason it feels very

like<00:04:09.829> lollipop<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.489> I<00:04:10.549> like<00:04:12.400> what<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.609> called

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
like lollipop and I like what is called

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.460 
like lollipop and I like what is called
red<00:04:15.140> velvet<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.799> but<00:04:16.959> just<00:04:17.959> be<00:04:18.169> aware<00:04:18.199> that

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
red velvet and but just be aware that

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.259 
red velvet and but just be aware that
they<00:04:18.829> are<00:04:18.949> not<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.340> same<00:04:19.519> thing<00:04:19.820> so<00:04:20.090> if<00:04:20.150> you

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
they are not the same thing so if you

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.320 
they are not the same thing so if you
bought<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:21.340> l'oreal<00:04:22.340> caress<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.090> think

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
bought the l'oreal caress and you think

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.700 
bought the l'oreal caress and you think
that<00:04:23.449> the<00:04:23.510> lipids<00:04:23.840> can<00:04:24.050> be<00:04:24.169> shared<00:04:24.440> they<00:04:24.590> are

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
that the lipids can be shared they are

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.290 
that the lipids can be shared they are
really<00:04:25.070> not<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:25.340> if<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.490> do<00:04:25.639> not<00:04:25.789> like<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.060> bulb

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
really not so if you do not like a bulb

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.820 
really not so if you do not like a bulb

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
lit you are not gonna like those

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.040 
lit you are not gonna like those

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
kind of a stain so if I'm using a

kind of a stain so if I'm using a
lollipop<00:05:20.580> for<00:05:20.610> example<00:05:21.210> then<00:05:22.169> after<00:05:22.650> the

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
gone away it still does kind of leave a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.790 
gone away it still does kind of leave a
wash<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.479> color<00:05:27.660> on<00:05:27.840> my<00:05:27.930> lips<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.320> do<00:05:28.560> like

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
that whereas I preferred the Loreal

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.980 
that whereas I preferred the Loreal
caress<00:05:32.820> because<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.240> could<00:05:33.360> pop<00:05:33.509> in<00:05:33.660> my<00:05:33.690> room

really smooth nice
everything's<00:05:58.979> perfect<00:05:59.729> whereas<00:06:00.360> this<00:06:00.449> one's

with clumps of solid color in it if you

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.659
