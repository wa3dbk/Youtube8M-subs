many different metrics that are
available<00:00:33.579> to<00:00:33.910> cyclists<00:00:34.450> now<00:00:34.600> but<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.050> bottom

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
available to cyclists now but the bottom

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.050 
available to cyclists now but the bottom
line<00:00:35.410> is<00:00:35.590> is<00:00:36.040> that<00:00:36.190> it<00:00:36.400> really<00:00:36.580> comes<00:00:36.850> down<00:00:36.910> to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
line is is that it really comes down to

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.810 
line is is that it really comes down to
duration<00:00:37.660> and<00:00:37.810> intensity<00:00:38.680> and<00:00:38.980> all<00:00:39.640> the

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
duration and intensity and all the

duration and intensity and all the
different<00:00:40.210> things<00:00:40.420> that<00:00:40.480> we<00:00:40.660> look<00:00:40.870> at<00:00:41.020> in

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
different things that we look at in

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.290 
different things that we look at in
terms<00:00:41.829> of<00:00:42.010> analysis<00:00:42.579> or<00:00:42.760> drive<00:00:43.000> from<00:00:43.180> those

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.810 
terms of analysis or drive from those
two<00:00:43.360> factors<00:00:43.870> so<00:00:44.350> it's<00:00:44.530> really<00:00:44.710> how<00:00:45.310> long<00:00:45.579> am<00:00:45.730> I

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
two factors so it's really how long am I

timeframe but fundamentally it just

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.590 
timeframe but fundamentally it just
comes<00:01:19.959> down<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:20.409> how<00:01:21.280> long<00:01:21.520> did<00:01:21.670> I<00:01:21.759> go<00:01:21.939> and<00:01:22.209> how

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
comes down to how long did I go and how

physiologist named Hans I yay he had

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.729 
physiologist named Hans I yay he had
something<00:02:10.990> called<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.349> general<00:02:11.620> adaptation

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
something called the general adaptation

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.160 
something called the general adaptation
syndrome<00:02:12.250> which<00:02:12.849> was<00:02:13.000> really<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.480> kind<00:02:14.110> of

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
syndrome which was really this kind of

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.230 
syndrome which was really this kind of
dose-response<00:02:14.680> paradigm

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
dose-response paradigm

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.720 
dose-response paradigm
and<00:02:16.630> then<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.960> dose-response<00:02:17.380> paradigm<00:02:18.040> he

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
and then that dose-response paradigm he

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.430 
and then that dose-response paradigm he
really<00:02:18.880> spoke<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:19.630> idea<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:20.050> there<00:02:20.320> was

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
really spoke to this idea that there was

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.520 
really spoke to this idea that there was
some<00:02:20.650> stress<00:02:21.010> or<00:02:21.810> challenge<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:22.930> our<00:02:23.050> life<00:02:23.230> and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
some stress or challenge in our life and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.820 
some stress or challenge in our life and
our<00:02:24.360> response<00:02:25.360> for<00:02:25.540> adaptation<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.350> if

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
our response for adaptation to that if

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.170 
our response for adaptation to that if
we<00:02:26.920> want<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.160> break<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.370> down<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.730> training

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
we want to break it down the training

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.000 
we want to break it down the training
you<00:02:28.630> can<00:02:28.780> break<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:28.960> down<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.380> really<00:02:29.650> simple

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
you can break it down to a really simple

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.000 
you can break it down to a really simple
idea<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.150> say<00:02:31.300> popping<00:02:31.780> corn<00:02:32.080> right<00:02:32.710> that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
idea of say popping corn right that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.100 
idea of say popping corn right that
ultimately<00:02:33.880> if<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.240> put<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.600> bag<00:02:34.840> of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
ultimately if you put that bag of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.680 
ultimately if you put that bag of

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
a physiologist it is to help people pop

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.550 
a physiologist it is to help people pop
as<00:03:00.580> much<00:03:00.760> corn<00:03:01.090> as<00:03:01.240> possible<00:03:01.720> if<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.870> will<00:03:02.170> no

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
as much corn as possible if you will no

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.810 
as much corn as possible if you will no
matter<00:03:02.710> how<00:03:02.920> many<00:03:03.100> kernels<00:03:03.490> they<00:03:03.580> have<00:03:03.700> to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
matter how many kernels they have to

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.570 
matter how many kernels they have to
begin<00:03:03.970> with<00:03:04.300> or<00:03:04.570> or<00:03:05.010> no<00:03:06.010> matter<00:03:06.130> what<00:03:06.400> type<00:03:06.550> of

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
equipment they have to do that with and

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.910 
equipment they have to do that with and
so<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:10.360> know<00:03:10.390> one<00:03:11.350> way<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.500> really<00:03:11.770> think

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
so you know one way to really think

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.770 
so you know one way to really think
about<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.820> that<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.210> you<00:03:13.630> don't

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
about it is this is that if you don't

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.870 
about it is this is that if you don't
put<00:03:14.290> enough<00:03:14.500> stress<00:03:15.040> on<00:03:15.190> your<00:03:15.310> system<00:03:15.640> if<00:03:15.820> you

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
put enough stress on your system if you

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.490 
put enough stress on your system if you
don't<00:03:16.030> train<00:03:16.240> hard<00:03:16.480> enough<00:03:16.720> you're<00:03:17.230> not<00:03:17.350> going

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
don't train hard enough you're not going

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.810 
don't train hard enough you're not going
to<00:03:17.560> pop<00:03:17.740> all<00:03:17.950> your<00:03:18.100> kernels<00:03:18.430> you're<00:03:18.550> not<00:03:18.670> going

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
to pop all your kernels you're not going

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.940 
to pop all your kernels you're not going

to optimize your your adaptation your

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.090 
to optimize your your adaptation your
physiology<00:03:21.220> if<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:22.360> put<00:03:23.350> too<00:03:23.380> much<00:03:23.650> power<00:03:23.920> or

you've trained too much you're going to

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.350 
you've trained too much you're going to
start<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.930> burn<00:03:26.140> those<00:03:26.380> kernels<00:03:27.360> ultimately

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
start to burn those kernels ultimately

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.880 
start to burn those kernels ultimately
what<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:28.570> want<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:28.930> do<00:03:29.050> is<00:03:29.290> find<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.710> sweet

what you want to do is find that sweet

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.000 
what you want to do is find that sweet
