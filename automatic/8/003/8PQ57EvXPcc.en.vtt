00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.220 
lights and you can see the lighting
effect<00:04:07.030> that<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.240> mouse<00:04:07.390> actually<00:04:07.780> has<00:04:07.960> so

I'm<00:04:08.290> going<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.500> turn<00:04:08.590> out<00:04:08.740> some<00:04:08.890> of<00:04:08.980> these

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
I'm going to turn out some of these

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.580 
I'm going to turn out some of these
studio<00:04:09.430> lights<00:04:09.670> here<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:11.170> can<00:04:11.290> see<00:04:11.470> the

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
studio lights here and you can see the

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.700 
studio lights here and you can see the
lighting<00:04:11.950> of<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.130> mouse<00:04:13.410> sounds<00:04:14.410> like<00:04:14.530> some

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
lighting of the mouse sounds like some

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.420 
lighting of the mouse sounds like some
kind<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:16.350> event<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.739> we're<00:04:17.830> going<00:04:17.980> to<00:04:18.070> do<00:04:18.250> the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
kind of event that we're going to do the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.150 
kind of event that we're going to do the
lighting<00:04:18.640> of<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.850> mouse<00:04:19.090> but<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:20.590> as<00:04:20.920> you<00:04:21.070> can

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
lighting of the mouse but so as you can

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.830 
lighting of the mouse but so as you can
see<00:04:21.310> it's<00:04:21.459> actually<00:04:21.760> changing<00:04:22.150> colors<00:04:22.480> it<00:04:22.720> has

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
this nice little flame again this is

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.610 
this nice little flame again this is
very<00:04:24.790> reminiscent<00:04:25.390> like<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.750> razor<00:04:26.080> type<00:04:26.410> mouse

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
very reminiscent like a razor type mouse

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.120 
very reminiscent like a razor type mouse
this<00:04:27.580> one<00:04:27.730> is<00:04:27.820> just<00:04:27.880> kind<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.180> rotating<00:04:28.570> colors

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
this one is just kind of rotating colors

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.680 
this one is just kind of rotating colors
you<00:04:30.130> can<00:04:30.250> see<00:04:30.400> here<00:04:30.580> as<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.790> sides<00:04:31.120> got<00:04:31.480> some

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
you can see here as the sides got some

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.140 
you can see here as the sides got some
markings<00:04:32.140> as<00:04:32.350> well<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.730> colors<00:04:34.030> are

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
markings as well and the colors are

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.690 
markings as well and the colors are
changing<00:04:34.660> on<00:04:34.810> it<00:04:34.960> it's<00:04:35.710> got<00:04:35.860> some<00:04:36.130> lighting
