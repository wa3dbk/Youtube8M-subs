history that black people say is right

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.420 
history that black people say is right
well<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:21.380> just<00:02:21.500> right<00:02:21.860> because<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.160> black

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
well it's just right because a black

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.460 
well it's just right because a black
person<00:02:22.850> said<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.600> me<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.900> shows<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.200> lack

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
person said it to me that shows a lack

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.390 
person said it to me that shows a lack
of<00:02:25.330> intelligence<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.500> shows<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.770> bit<00:02:28.250> of

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
of intelligence and it shows a bit of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.640 
of intelligence and it shows a bit of
being<00:02:28.580> delusional<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.570> really<00:02:30.200> does<00:02:30.440> and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
being delusional it really does and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.900 
being delusional it really does and
maybe<00:02:30.740> that's<00:02:30.980> what<00:02:31.160> happens<00:02:31.490> when<00:02:31.610> people

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
maybe that's what happens when people

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.550 
maybe that's what happens when people
are<00:02:32.000> told<00:02:32.150> they're<00:02:32.390> nothing<00:02:32.600> they<00:02:33.260> need<00:02:33.470> to

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
are told they're nothing they need to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.930 
are told they're nothing they need to
become<00:02:33.680> king<00:02:34.100> of<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.310> world<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.790> then

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
become king of the world and then

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.310 
become king of the world and then
eventually<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.420> end<00:02:35.570> up<00:02:35.660> back<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.020> Middle

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
eventually you end up back in the Middle

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.690 
eventually you end up back in the Middle
where<00:02:36.470> everybody<00:02:36.860> should<00:02:37.100> be<00:02:37.130> which<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.400> we've

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
where everybody should be which is we've

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.910 
where everybody should be which is we've
all<00:02:37.850> played<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.150> role<00:02:38.390> but<00:02:39.140> it's<00:02:39.290> it's<00:02:39.590> really
