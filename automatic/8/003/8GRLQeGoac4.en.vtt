00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the systems is very good and it's quite

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.380 
the systems is very good and it's quite
easy<00:01:31.289> to<00:01:31.619> use<00:01:32.039> compared<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> some<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
other systems since we have people

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.469 
other systems since we have people
coming<00:01:35.310> from<00:01:35.429> all<00:01:35.610> over<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> world<00:01:35.910> here<00:01:36.330> we

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
coming from all over the world here we

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.870 
coming from all over the world here we
don't<00:01:36.630> want<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.899> have<00:01:37.020> an<00:01:37.530> xray<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.250> doesn't

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
don't want to have an xray that doesn't

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.520 
don't want to have an xray that doesn't
work<00:01:39.030> or<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.360> software<00:01:39.869> system<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.320> doesn't

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
work or a software system that doesn't

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.270 
work or a software system that doesn't
work<00:01:40.800> when<00:01:41.009> somebody<00:01:41.310> needs<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:41.670> picture<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.320> we

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
work when somebody needs a picture so we

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.230 
work when somebody needs a picture so we
already<00:01:44.490> talked<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.789> little<00:01:44.909> bit<00:01:45.030> about

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
already talked a little bit about

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.910 
already talked a little bit about
phosphorus<00:01:45.780> plate<00:01:46.050> versus<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> direct

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
phosphorus plate versus the direct

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.580 
phosphorus plate versus the direct
sensor<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.520> again<00:01:48.060> advantages<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.319> handle

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
sensor and again advantages you handle

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.380 
sensor and again advantages you handle
it<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.800> like<00:01:50.009> film<00:01:50.250> disadvantages<00:01:51.030> same

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it just like film disadvantages same

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.630 
it just like film disadvantages same
thing<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> basic<00:01:55.740> system<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.369> are<00:01:56.550> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
thing so the basic system I like are the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.070 
thing so the basic system I like are the
ones<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.970> take<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> directly<00:01:57.630> into<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
ones that take it directly into the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.809 
ones that take it directly into the
computer<00:01:58.200> where<00:01:59.069> you<00:01:59.190> have<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.369> standard

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
computer where you have your standard

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.760 
computer where you have your standard
x-ray<00:02:00.780> head<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.289> have<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> replace

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
x-ray head you don't have to replace

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.620 
x-ray head you don't have to replace
that<00:02:01.830> you<00:02:02.580> put<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.819> sensor<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.270> patient's

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that you put the sensor in the patient's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.630 
that you put the sensor in the patient's
mouth<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.020> receives<00:02:04.380> imaging<00:02:04.890> goes<00:02:05.280> down<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
mouth it receives imaging goes down the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.730 
mouth it receives imaging goes down the
wire<00:02:05.850> shows<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> computer<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.409> about

wire shows up in the computer in about

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.889 
wire shows up in the computer in about
four<00:02:08.130> seconds<00:02:08.549> would<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.329> like<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.660> try<00:02:09.840> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
four seconds would you like to try to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.810 
four seconds would you like to try to
diagnose<00:02:10.440> from<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:10.920> tiny<00:02:11.100> x-ray<00:02:11.549> as<00:02:11.700> we

all of that stuff is can be removed it's

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.539 
all of that stuff is can be removed it's
not<00:02:26.700> part<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.120> image<00:02:28.280> let's<00:02:29.280> say<00:02:29.400> you're

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
not part of the image let's say you're

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.830 
not part of the image let's say you're
looking<00:02:29.609> for<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.970> decay<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.540> take<00:02:30.720> an

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
looking for a decay and you take an

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.199 
looking for a decay and you take an
x-ray<00:02:31.109> and<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:32.280> look<00:02:32.459> at<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.850> say<00:02:33.030> well<00:02:33.060> I

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
x-ray and you look at it and say well I

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.819 
x-ray and you look at it and say well I
think<00:02:33.329> that<00:02:33.660> became<00:02:33.959> might<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.500> into<00:02:34.709> the

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
think that became might be into the

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.890 
think that became might be into the
nerve<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.280> can't<00:02:35.609> really<00:02:35.760> tell<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.359> sure<00:02:36.390> I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
nerve but I can't really tell for sure I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.599 
nerve but I can't really tell for sure I
don't<00:02:37.290> know<00:02:37.380> if<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.620> possibly<00:02:38.130> going<00:02:38.370> low

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
don't know if it's possibly going low

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.520 
don't know if it's possibly going low
past<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.049> can<00:02:40.230> artificially

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
past that but you can artificially

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.340 
past that but you can artificially
enhance<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.519> edge<00:02:41.730> sharpness<00:02:42.090> by<00:02:42.900> pushing<00:02:43.170> a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
enhance the edge sharpness by pushing a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.380 
enhance the edge sharpness by pushing a
button<00:02:43.380> which<00:02:43.890> incorporates<00:02:44.760> an<00:02:44.880> algorithm

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
button which incorporates an algorithm

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.050 
button which incorporates an algorithm
and<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:46.350> dexus<00:02:47.010> it's<00:02:47.190> called<00:02:47.370> clear<00:02:47.700> view<00:02:47.910> and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
and on dexus it's called clear view and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.430 
and on dexus it's called clear view and
this<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.269> what<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.510> looks<00:02:48.690> like<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.200> now<00:02:49.380> you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
this is what it looks like and now you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.140 
this is what it looks like and now you
get<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> much<00:02:49.920> better<00:02:49.980> outline<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.670> where<00:02:50.940> that

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
get a much better outline of where that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.990 
get a much better outline of where that
decay<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.230> if<00:02:52.859> you<00:02:53.040> have<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> film<00:02:53.579> that's<00:02:53.670> too

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
decay is if you have a film that's too

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.030 
decay is if you have a film that's too
light<00:02:54.299> with<00:02:54.900> regular<00:02:55.320> films<00:02:55.680> you've<00:02:55.859> pretty

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
light with regular films you've pretty

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.349 
light with regular films you've pretty
much<00:02:56.130> done<00:02:56.519> you've<00:02:56.730> got<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.970> shoot<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.239> again

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
much done you've got to shoot it again

thirty<00:03:03.480> two<00:03:03.660> shades<00:03:03.930> darker<00:03:04.049> so<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.070> can<00:03:05.250> just

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
thirty two shades darker so you can just

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.979 
thirty two shades darker so you can just
adjust<00:03:05.579> that<00:03:05.940> image<00:03:06.269> so<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.630> see<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> whole

is<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.500> good<00:03:46.650> idea<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.980> have<00:03:47.100> two<00:03:47.580> images<00:03:47.910> on

is a good idea to have two images on

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.270 
is a good idea to have two images on
every<00:03:48.780> tooth<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.260> don't<00:03:49.920> think<00:03:50.100> it's<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.250> good

the upper molar and that second shot

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.410 
the upper molar and that second shot
should<00:04:01.560> be<00:04:01.710> from<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:01.980> distal<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:03.060> reason<00:04:03.330> we

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
should be from the distal the reason we

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.450 
should be from the distal the reason we
go<00:04:03.570> from<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.840> distal<00:04:04.200> on<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.560> upper<00:04:04.920> molar<00:04:05.190> is

go from the distal on the upper molar is

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.940 
go from the distal on the upper molar is
because<00:04:06.210> a<00:04:06.510> perpendicular<00:04:06.990> shot<00:04:07.470> shows<00:04:07.800> you

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
because a perpendicular shot shows you

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.700 
because a perpendicular shot shows you
all<00:04:08.100> three<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.460> the<00:04:08.580> roots<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:09.230> distal<00:04:10.230> shot<00:04:10.470> is

all three of the roots a distal shot is

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.460 
all three of the roots a distal shot is

going to superimpose to the canals but

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.810 
going to superimpose to the canals but
you<00:04:13.590> will<00:04:13.710> not<00:04:13.830> see<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.100> two<00:04:14.340> canals<00:04:14.580> the

enhancement<00:04:24.810> thing<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.440> like<00:04:25.620> about<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.950> if<00:04:26.520> you

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
enhancement thing I like about it if you

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.950 
enhancement thing I like about it if you
take<00:04:26.850> a<00:04:26.880> picture<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.420> don't<00:04:27.570> like<00:04:27.780> it

take a picture and you don't like it

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.290 
take a picture and you don't like it
it's<00:04:28.080> not<00:04:28.230> quite<00:04:28.500> sharp<00:04:28.860> enough<00:04:29.130> enhance<00:04:30.120> it

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
it's not quite sharp enough enhance it

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.750 
it's not quite sharp enough enhance it
make<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:30.720> sharper<00:04:31.110> with<00:04:31.200> clear<00:04:31.470> view<00:04:31.710> or<00:04:32.310> you

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
make it sharper with clear view or you

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.160 
make it sharper with clear view or you
can<00:04:32.910> push<00:04:33.060> another<00:04:33.300> button<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.810> reverse<00:04:34.140> the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
dense so it looks like it's just jumping

coming up there and look between the
teeth<00:05:25.050> there's<00:05:25.290> some<00:05:25.440> blood

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:26.129

can also measure and enhance the apex
you<00:05:32.789> can<00:05:32.939> make<00:05:33.089> it<00:05:33.209> larger<00:05:33.860> you<00:05:34.860> can<00:05:35.009> move<00:05:35.159> that

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:35.339 
you can make it larger you can move that

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.209 
you can make it larger you can move that
image<00:05:35.699> around<00:05:36.229> you<00:05:37.229> can<00:05:37.379> draw<00:05:37.649> on<00:05:37.679> it<00:05:37.919> you<00:05:38.099> can

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
image around you can draw on it you can

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.070 
image around you can draw on it you can
isolate<00:05:38.610> certain<00:05:38.819> areas<00:05:39.209> circle<00:05:39.629> things<00:05:39.869> on

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
isolate certain areas circle things on

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.350 
isolate certain areas circle things on
it<00:05:40.229> all<00:05:40.619> these<00:05:41.039> image<00:05:41.369> tools<00:05:41.639> you<00:05:41.759> can<00:05:41.909> use<00:05:41.939> and

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
it all these image tools you can use and

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.329 
it all these image tools you can use and
you<00:05:42.929> can<00:05:43.080> even<00:05:43.199> measure<00:05:43.499> the<00:05:43.739> canal<00:05:44.039> as<00:05:44.219> we

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:44.339 
you can even measure the canal as we

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.519 
you can even measure the canal as we
talked<00:05:44.610> earlier<00:05:45.080> but<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.139> thing<00:05:46.169> I<00:05:46.349> like<00:05:46.499> most

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:46.529 
talked earlier but the thing I like most

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.799 
talked earlier but the thing I like most
about<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.249> dexus<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.759> this<00:05:48.029> little<00:05:48.599> sensor

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:48.809 
about the dexus is this little sensor

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:51.949 
about the dexus is this little sensor
the<00:05:49.559> sensor<00:05:49.589> has<00:05:50.129> the<00:05:50.339> corners<00:05:50.819> cut<00:05:51.059> off<00:05:51.269> and

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:51.959 
the sensor has the corners cut off and

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.570 
the sensor has the corners cut off and
you<00:05:52.080> may<00:05:52.199> wonder<00:05:52.379> what's<00:05:52.949> the<00:05:53.039> advantage<00:05:53.309> of

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
you may wonder what's the advantage of

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.839 
you may wonder what's the advantage of
that<00:05:53.689> and<00:05:54.689> the<00:05:54.809> advantage<00:05:55.289> is<00:05:55.529> it's<00:05:56.189> much<00:05:56.550> more

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
that and the advantage is it's much more

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.939 
that and the advantage is it's much more
comfortable<00:05:57.209> to<00:05:57.539> have<00:05:58.199> that<00:05:58.379> sensor<00:05:58.800> in<00:05:58.919> your

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
comfortable to have that sensor in your

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.279 
comfortable to have that sensor in your
mouth<00:05:59.219> you've<00:05:59.999> all<00:06:00.240> had<00:06:00.449> x-rays<00:06:00.959> where<00:06:01.199> you

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
mouth you've all had x-rays where you

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.079 
mouth you've all had x-rays where you
bent<00:06:01.529> the<00:06:01.589> corner<00:06:02.039> so<00:06:02.399> it<00:06:02.490> would<00:06:02.610> slide<00:06:02.909> in

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:03.089 
bent the corner so it would slide in

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.299 
bent the corner so it would slide in
comfortably<00:06:03.599> on<00:06:03.689> the<00:06:03.869> lower<00:06:04.199> you<00:06:04.919> can't<00:06:05.159> bend

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:05.309 
comfortably on the lower you can't bend

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:07.969 
comfortably on the lower you can't bend
the<00:06:05.399> corner<00:06:05.669> of<00:06:05.699> a<00:06:05.849> sensor<00:06:06.469> but<00:06:07.469> also<00:06:07.649> on<00:06:07.889> the

back of it in that little roundball

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:12.169 
back of it in that little roundball
that's<00:06:10.050> where<00:06:10.319> the<00:06:10.409> electronics<00:06:11.039> are<00:06:11.219> many<00:06:11.999> of

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:12.179 
that's where the electronics are many of

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:14.480 
that's where the electronics are many of
the<00:06:12.300> ultra<00:06:12.959> thin<00:06:13.289> models<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.919> electronics

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
the ultra thin models the electronics

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.699 
the ultra thin models the electronics
are<00:06:14.550> around<00:06:14.789> the<00:06:14.939> periphery<00:06:15.300> of<00:06:15.629> the<00:06:16.289> sensor

are around the periphery of the sensor

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:19.850 
are around the periphery of the sensor
and<00:06:16.919> that<00:06:17.639> means<00:06:17.969> that<00:06:18.269> you<00:06:18.809> lose<00:06:19.110> real<00:06:19.499> estate

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
and that means that you lose real estate

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.589 
and that means that you lose real estate
you<00:06:20.339> have<00:06:20.459> a<00:06:20.490> bigger<00:06:20.759> sensor<00:06:21.179> than<00:06:21.329> you<00:06:21.449> need

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
you have a bigger sensor than you need

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:23.839 
you have a bigger sensor than you need
to<00:06:21.719> get<00:06:21.869> a<00:06:21.899> small<00:06:22.199> image<00:06:22.619> with<00:06:23.219> this<00:06:23.429> one<00:06:23.639> it's

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
to get a small image with this one it's

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.119 
to get a small image with this one it's
smaller<00:06:24.149> than<00:06:24.269> a<00:06:24.419> number<00:06:24.719> two<00:06:24.929> but<00:06:25.829> it<00:06:25.979> is

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.129 
smaller than a number two but it is

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.269 
smaller than a number two but it is
using<00:06:26.999> the<00:06:27.089> entire<00:06:27.589> frame<00:06:28.589> reference<00:06:28.860> and<00:06:29.219> if

using the entire frame reference and if

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:30.889 
using the entire frame reference and if
we<00:06:29.369> need<00:06:29.489> more<00:06:29.550> space<00:06:29.969> we<00:06:30.240> can<00:06:30.269> move<00:06:30.569> it<00:06:30.689> so<00:06:30.839> you

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:30.899 
we need more space we can move it so you

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:33.129 
we need more space we can move it so you
can<00:06:31.019> use<00:06:31.169> this<00:06:31.319> one<00:06:31.800> size<00:06:32.039> on<00:06:32.309> kids<00:06:32.579> or<00:06:32.789> adults

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139
