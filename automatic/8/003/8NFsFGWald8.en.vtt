00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
look at is dollars and cents and if like

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.520 
look at is dollars and cents and if like
an<00:01:27.150> R<00:01:27.330> wheat<00:01:27.540> we're<00:01:27.720> gonna<00:01:27.810> go<00:01:28.020> over<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.290> six

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
an R wheat we're gonna go over at six

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.890 
an R wheat we're gonna go over at six
times<00:01:28.770> probably<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.730> six<00:01:30.210> applications

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
times probably that's six applications

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.810 
times probably that's six applications
if<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.230> call<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> plane<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.010> around<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.640> it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
if we call the plane in around here it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.040 
if we call the plane in around here it
cost<00:01:33.000> us<00:01:33.150> about<00:01:33.330> eight<00:01:33.510> dollars<00:01:33.840> an<00:01:33.960> acre

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
cost us about eight dollars an acre

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.600 
cost us about eight dollars an acre
every<00:01:34.380> time<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> plane<00:01:34.830> comes<00:01:35.070> across<00:01:35.280> that's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
every time the plane comes across that's

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.610 
every time the plane comes across that's
$48<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.690> it<00:01:36.870> myself<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.320> figure<00:01:37.530> it's

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
$48 if I do it myself I figure it's

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.050 
$48 if I do it myself I figure it's
gonna<00:01:37.710> cost<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.370> three<00:01:38.640> let's<00:01:38.880> even

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
gonna cost two or three let's even

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.580 
gonna cost two or three let's even
figure<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.570> high<00:01:39.690> side<00:01:39.960> figure<00:01:40.290> three

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
figure on the high side figure three

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.620 
figure on the high side figure three
dollars<00:01:40.950> times<00:01:41.160> six<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.670> 18<00:01:42.060> okay<00:01:42.330> so<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.480> got

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
dollars times six it's 18 okay so I got

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.200 
dollars times six it's 18 okay so I got
48<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.410> plane<00:01:43.680> versus<00:01:44.310> 18<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:44.880> myself

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
48 for the plane versus 18 for myself

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.570 
48 for the plane versus 18 for myself
that's<00:01:45.570> $30<00:01:46.290> an<00:01:46.410> acre<00:01:46.500> okay<00:01:47.160> so<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.370> I<00:01:47.400> got<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
that's $30 an acre okay so if I got a

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.960 
that's $30 an acre okay so if I got a
thousand<00:01:47.940> acres<00:01:48.000> its<00:01:48.470> $30,000<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.590> made<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:50.190> I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
thousand acres its $30,000 I made and I

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.240 
thousand acres its $30,000 I made and I
guess<00:01:51.300> it<00:01:51.660> is<00:01:51.900> money<00:01:52.230> and<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.830> something

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
guess it is money and it's something

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.190 
guess it is money and it's something
that<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.300> do<00:01:54.420> myself<00:01:54.600> why

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that I think that I can do myself why

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.930 
that I think that I can do myself why
would<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:55.980> well<00:01:56.310> let<00:01:56.640> me<00:01:56.700> talk<00:01:56.910> about

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
would I not do it well let me talk about

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.030 
would I not do it well let me talk about
$100<00:01:57.570> an<00:01:57.750> hour<00:01:57.870> jobs<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.500> think<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.770> how<00:01:58.890> many

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
$100 an hour jobs you think of how many

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.040 
$100 an hour jobs you think of how many
acres<00:01:59.190> you<00:01:59.370> can<00:01:59.550> get<00:01:59.670> across<00:01:59.970> if<00:02:00.660> you<00:02:00.750> figure

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
acres you can get across if you figure

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.140 
acres you can get across if you figure
the<00:02:01.200> value<00:02:01.590> being<00:02:01.950> at<00:02:02.250> five<00:02:02.550> dollars<00:02:02.760> an<00:02:03.090> acre

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
the value being at five dollars an acre

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.550 
the value being at five dollars an acre
that<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.540> save<00:02:03.780> three<00:02:04.110> dollars<00:02:04.410> doing

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that you save three dollars doing

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.900 
that you save three dollars doing
yourself<00:02:05.010> versus<00:02:05.310> eight<00:02:05.430> dollars<00:02:05.730> for<00:02:05.760> a

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
yourself versus eight dollars for a

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.460 
yourself versus eight dollars for a
plane<00:02:06.150> that's<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.540> pretty<00:02:06.720> good<00:02:06.930> job<00:02:07.170> that's

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
plane that's a pretty good job that's

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.990 
plane that's a pretty good job that's
easily<00:02:07.650> three<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:08.190> four<00:02:08.369> hundred<00:02:08.460> dollars<00:02:08.640> an

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
easily three or four hundred dollars an

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.580 
easily three or four hundred dollars an
hour<00:02:09.210> that<00:02:09.570> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.840> earn<00:02:09.990> by<00:02:10.259> spraying

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
hour that you can earn by spraying

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.330 
hour that you can earn by spraying
things<00:02:10.860> yourself

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
things yourself

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.670 
things yourself
now<00:02:11.610> when<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.030> talk<00:02:12.210> about<00:02:12.240> tram<00:02:12.720> lanes<00:02:12.990> I<00:02:13.230> know

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
now when we talk about tram lanes I know

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.559 
now when we talk about tram lanes I know
that<00:02:13.799> I<00:02:13.980> get<00:02:14.159> a<00:02:14.189> lot<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.519> response<00:02:15.000> back<00:02:15.540> from

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
that I get a lot of response back from

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.630 
that I get a lot of response back from
our<00:02:15.989> show<00:02:16.200> saying<00:02:16.590> I'm<00:02:16.769> not<00:02:16.980> set<00:02:17.250> up<00:02:17.280> for<00:02:17.430> that

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
our show saying I'm not set up for that

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.160 
our show saying I'm not set up for that
it<00:02:17.939> sounds<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.299> lot<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.569> work<00:02:18.840> how

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
it sounds like a lot of work how

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.660 
it sounds like a lot of work how
complicated<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.010> yeah<00:02:20.310> there's<00:02:20.519> nothing

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
complicated is it yeah there's nothing

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.670 
complicated is it yeah there's nothing
much<00:02:20.969> to<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.209> basically<00:02:21.510> there<00:02:22.019> are<00:02:22.049> companies

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
much to it basically there are companies

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.020 
much to it basically there are companies
out<00:02:22.950> there<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.189> make<00:02:23.430> these<00:02:23.549> tramline

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
out there that make these tramline

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.699 
out there that make these tramline
systems<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.719> let's<00:02:24.959> say<00:02:25.109> you've<00:02:25.230> got<00:02:25.260> an<00:02:25.560> air

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
systems and let's say you've got an air

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.199 
systems and let's say you've got an air
seater<00:02:26.040> all<00:02:26.310> you're<00:02:26.459> gonna<00:02:26.549> do<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.819> you're

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
seater all you're gonna do is you're

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.509 
seater all you're gonna do is you're
going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.599> direct<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.349> seed<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.920> was<00:02:29.219> going

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
going to direct the seed that was going

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.580 
going to direct the seed that was going
to<00:02:29.640> go<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.030> those<00:02:30.359> two<00:02:30.689> rows<00:02:30.959> where<00:02:31.200> your<00:02:31.349> tract

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
to go in those two rows where your tract

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.440 
to go in those two rows where your tract
is<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:32.129> direct<00:02:32.519> them<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.420> outside

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
is you direct them just to the outside

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.770 
is you direct them just to the outside
of<00:02:34.349> those<00:02:34.650> two<00:02:34.709> rows<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.730> pushing<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.480> seed

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
of those two rows so pushing that seed

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.780 
of those two rows so pushing that seed
out<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.170> now<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.439> basically<00:02:37.739> have<00:02:38.219> double<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
out so now you basically have double the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.580 
out so now you basically have double the
amount<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.269> seed<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.750> rows<00:02:39.930> next<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.469> it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
amount of seed in the rows next to it

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.949 
amount of seed in the rows next to it
which<00:02:40.799> we<00:02:41.430> actually<00:02:41.879> want<00:02:42.090> because<00:02:42.629> we're

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
which we actually want because we're

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.140 
which we actually want because we're
gonna<00:02:43.170> try<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> compensate<00:02:44.069> for<00:02:44.489> having<00:02:44.790> no

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
gonna try to compensate for having no

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.349 
gonna try to compensate for having no
seed<00:02:45.599> in<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.079> tract<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:47.159> that's<00:02:47.819> really<00:02:48.090> all

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
seed in that tract and that's really all

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.059 
seed in that tract and that's really all
there<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.659> to<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.019> it's<00:02:49.230> nothing<00:02:49.620> more<00:02:49.769> than<00:02:49.829> a

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
there is to it it's nothing more than a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.819 
there is to it it's nothing more than a
diversion<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.760> seed<00:02:51.060> when<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.959> need<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.530> to

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
diversion of seed when you need to to

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.530 
diversion of seed when you need to to
get<00:02:53.099> this<00:02:53.250> thing<00:02:53.489> set<00:02:53.730> up<00:02:53.760> but<00:02:54.090> what<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.359> have

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
get this thing set up but what you have

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.330 
get this thing set up but what you have
to<00:02:54.720> do<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.989> get<00:02:55.169> all<00:02:55.319> your<00:02:55.530> equipment<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.099> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
to do is get all your equipment on the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.409 
to do is get all your equipment on the
same<00:02:56.579> tracks

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
same tracks

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.179 
same tracks
so<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.629> want<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.200> be<00:02:58.290> running<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.680> same<00:02:58.859> spray

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
so you want to be running the same spray

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.530 
so you want to be running the same spray
if<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.370> got<00:02:59.519> multiple<00:02:59.909> sprayers<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.389> your

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
if you got multiple sprayers on your

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.209 
if you got multiple sprayers on your
farm<00:03:00.719> obviously<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.379> nice<00:03:01.620> when<00:03:01.889> they<00:03:02.069> all

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.099 
farm obviously it's nice when they all
have<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.639> same<00:03:02.669> boom<00:03:03.269> width<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.870> kind

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
have the same boom width and that kind

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.140 
have the same boom width and that kind
of<00:03:04.139> thing<00:03:04.349> but<00:03:04.620> if<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.459> get<00:03:05.609> everything<00:03:05.849> set

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
season because I've got crop canopy now

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.559 
season because I've got crop canopy now
I've<00:03:16.590> got<00:03:16.799> these<00:03:16.980> rows<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.639> are<00:03:17.699> open<00:03:18.090> what

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
I've got these rows that are open what

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.449 
I've got these rows that are open what
kind<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.840> problems<00:03:19.229> am<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.349> gonna<00:03:19.500> run<00:03:19.680> into<00:03:20.190> but

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
kind of problems am I gonna run into but

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.399 
kind of problems am I gonna run into but
like<00:03:20.609> on<00:03:20.760> our<00:03:20.909> farm<00:03:21.299> we've<00:03:21.449> got<00:03:21.629> 120<00:03:22.290> foot

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
like on our farm we've got 120 foot

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.890 
like on our farm we've got 120 foot
booms<00:03:22.680> now<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.340> we<00:03:23.970> don't<00:03:24.180> have<00:03:24.419> very<00:03:24.629> many

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
booms now so we don't have very many

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.809 
booms now so we don't have very many
tracks<00:03:25.349> out<00:03:25.590> there<00:03:25.799> across<00:03:26.010> an<00:03:26.280> entire<00:03:26.489> field

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
tracks out there across an entire field

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.460 
tracks out there across an entire field
it's<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.389> not<00:03:27.569> that<00:03:27.599> big<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:28.049> deal<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.440> other

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
it's just not that big a deal the other

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.259 
it's just not that big a deal the other
thing<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:28.919> by<00:03:29.069> diverting<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.849> seed<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.150> was

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
thing is by diverting that seed that was

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.909 
thing is by diverting that seed that was
supposed<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.659> go<00:03:30.780> in<00:03:30.989> those<00:03:31.139> tracks<00:03:31.530> you're

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
supposed to go in those tracks you're

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.800 
supposed to go in those tracks you're
gonna<00:03:32.010> have<00:03:32.280> more<00:03:32.819> plants<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.479> those<00:03:33.569> plants

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
gonna have more plants and those plants

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.210 
gonna have more plants and those plants
are<00:03:33.959> going<00:03:34.109> to<00:03:34.199> grow<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.439> little<00:03:34.620> taller<00:03:35.010> and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
are going to grow a little taller and

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.189 
are going to grow a little taller and
shade<00:03:35.669> that<00:03:35.879> rope<00:03:36.120> yes<00:03:36.479> it's<00:03:36.750> not<00:03:36.870> going<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.109> be

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
shade that rope yes it's not going to be

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.259 
shade that rope yes it's not going to be
perfect<00:03:37.620> but<00:03:37.799> let's<00:03:38.159> keep<00:03:38.519> in<00:03:38.669> mind<00:03:38.699> if<00:03:39.150> we

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
perfect but let's keep in mind if we

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.629 
perfect but let's keep in mind if we
just<00:03:39.510> skip<00:03:39.959> those<00:03:40.199> two<00:03:40.739> rows<00:03:41.099> right<00:03:41.400> there

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
just skip those two rows right there

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.280 
just skip those two rows right there
divert<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.150> seed<00:03:42.359> over<00:03:42.659> those<00:03:42.900> rows<00:03:43.139> are

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
divert the seed over those rows are

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.129 
divert the seed over those rows are
still<00:03:43.620> smaller<00:03:44.280> than<00:03:44.489> our<00:03:45.239> 30<00:03:45.569> inch<00:03:45.780> rows<00:03:45.989> we

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
still smaller than our 30 inch rows we

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.539 
still smaller than our 30 inch rows we
have<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.500> we're<00:03:46.620> standing<00:03:46.919> in<00:03:47.040> right<00:03:47.159> now<00:03:47.220> in

the plane come in now you can do the job
yourself<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:20.039> can<00:04:20.190> save<00:04:20.400> money<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.759> way<00:04:20.820> you

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
yourself you can save money that way you
