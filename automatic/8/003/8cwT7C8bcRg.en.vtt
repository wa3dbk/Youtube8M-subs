00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 then I knew he would come 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.540
 this moment to the moment i get 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.910
 I would be put in front of the window for 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.559
 don't bring out the lights and have everyone 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.009
 neighbors who stare at you badly 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.690
 why are you talking to a car that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.970
 among other things it is not even the canon but it is 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.949
 the go pro so one thing not 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.140
 you don't even need the video camera, 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.590
 well so now we have reached the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.189
 maximum of embarrassment so long 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.300
 so do think that my visible god 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.270
 I think my neighbors have 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.550
 accepted in this thing and so it goes well 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:44.340
 actually she was sure it would be 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:45.930
 arrived but down here wrong ok 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.580
 actually I knew he was coming 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.660
 this moment is the time when 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.100
 don't worry, that's not me 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.230
 now I'm leaving youtube and didn't come back 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.140
 more absolutely not however at the moment in 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.629
 which I would have said no to youtube instead 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.640
 of the lavic study, however, one thing 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.970
 normal because it is the beta flows 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.260
 quite important and that is it covers a 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.250
 very important role of mine 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.800
 life 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.119
 and in any case it is precisely for the month of 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.070
 June that is waiting with a sun that 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.810
 talk like you know if you don't know 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.149
 because maybe you just followed me there 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.710
 I say now this year is my year 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.660
 of maturity in the sense that I 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.360
 this year I am a mature student and I will have to 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.520
 give exams this month month of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.340
 June as every year from the rude e 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.550
 so as they are practically 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.920
 mentally broke out there really are 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.560
 I feel stranded in anxiety 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.570
 behind and unprepared in everything I think 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 just that I won't be able to shoot videos 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.350
 for the month of June 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.240
 sorry a busy casino has 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.220
 precisely it is only in the month of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.869
 June and then I'll be back in July 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.259
 with all the videos I've planned from 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.050
 doing is that they really are so much 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.200
 anxiously worried and I have so much 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.539
 fear that I want to concentrate totally 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.060
 on the study and therefore this will be 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.369
 the last video of June and then return 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.860
 precisely to the first doubts and n 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.630
 to then return in early July as not 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.459
 as soon as I finish my exams I'll be back 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.959
 to make videos maybe even finish 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.660
 fine giulio because in any case we are not in 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.580
 however, we will see however that this is the case 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.569
 this will be the last video for the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.780
 moment and I'm sorry if maybe I'm not 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.160
 managed to make videos that many come 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.920
 in hand required as for example with 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.959
 physical activity but also there indeed 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.569
 I'm not doing anything for the study 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.180
 I'm really becoming obscene 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.920
 looks like a sloth I eat sleep I study 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.690
 May from a study I eat sleep study 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.550
 ours went to the pool alone anymore 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.260
 suitable for running I do it practically 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.760
 the more home gymnastics I have become 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.670
 really 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.220
 an impressive thing though is I will come back 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.900
 as soon as i finish the exams as soon as it finishes 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.060
 all this ambaradan I will return to do 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.560
 video, however, is also what me 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.030
 sorry indeed if they failed to 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.790
 make videos that maybe you asked me 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.730
 already for some time but just now 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.310
 the type from early April that I am in 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.709
 perennial anxiety for maturity and then 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.930
 not really as soon as I finish 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.459
 exams I'll be back I'll have it all 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.680
 what I have in mind to do because a 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.239
 lots of projects as soon as I return 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.190
 the first video that will be will be a type 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.290
 30 minute video in which I will get married with 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.319
 I will talk to you about this school year 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.920
 this year in general of how it is 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.299
 giving of family friendships loves the most 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.859
 or less here I have to tell also a 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.470
 Lots of things I never got to 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.950
 and time to tell you nothing 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.109
 will be back in July I recommend not 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.150
 scatter there are other videos a 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.069
 look at you paul expo blog that i think 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.790
 I liked it so much because it got 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.139
 a good success and the latest video video 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.579
 the challenge as to keep us short 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.310
 this video software to watch 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.560
 so maybe look at you are seen 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.840
 They are shown 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.250
 nothing I leave you enemy box all the links 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.989
 to follow me in the other profiles of the 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.430
 I remind you of other social networks 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.739
 especially at the blog 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.840
 instagram snapshots that I just put 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.520
 find everything in the infobox there is also 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.620
 under the text to register if you want 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.300
 sign up for not losing my other 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.790
 video that I will begin to publish from him 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.260
 a bit of a contradiction to this thing 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.320
 find and nothing I think I have the ticket 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.790
 everything is in panic I will have it 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.639
 said 500 times impossible though 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.560
 really or huge fear on one side 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.080
 I didn't want to finish school because 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.350
 I knew he had with the exams e 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.330
 that I would have had a constant panic is 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.030
 but I can't wait to finish that, too 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.880
 everything ends up passing to a phase 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.919
 of new life is not at the university 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.080
 or whatever I am going to do in 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.370
 future because I'm still not sure at 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.580
 one hundred percent of what it will go to 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.960
 do but I look forward to that too 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.330
 finish everything and move on to a new one 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.180
 phase of my life is but I am in others 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.889
 so I hope you support me too 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.870
 maybe between maturity itself is not 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.760
 this year I wish you good luck 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.560
 I recommend you give it your all 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.690
 so much bunch knows we have to go out

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.860
 high schools, whatever you do 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.750
