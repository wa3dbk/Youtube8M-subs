00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
tough group I think they're three very

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.260 
tough group I think they're three very
different<00:02:21.780> teams<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.530> think<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:24.120> know

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
challenges 2-1 argentina and will and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.640 
challenges 2-1 argentina and will and
possibly<00:02:29.220> what<00:02:29.460> mexico<00:02:29.970> will<00:02:30.440> although<00:02:31.440> we've

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
possibly what mexico will although we've

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.620 
possibly what mexico will although we've
got<00:02:31.800> one<00:02:32.040> eye<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.460> next<00:02:32.850> game<00:02:33.030> argentine

got one eye on the next game argentine

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.960 
got one eye on the next game argentine
air<00:02:33.780> our<00:02:33.930> prime<00:02:34.260> concern<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.980> obviously<00:02:35.100> Korea

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
air our prime concern is obviously Korea

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.460 
air our prime concern is obviously Korea
but<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.240> think<00:02:36.480> you're<00:02:36.660> right<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.170> very

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
but I think you're right it is a very

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.590 
but I think you're right it is a very
difficult<00:02:37.710> group<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.970> teams<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.360> get

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600

through<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.990> group<00:02:40.260> will<00:02:40.410> certainly

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
through this group will certainly

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.520 
through this group will certainly
