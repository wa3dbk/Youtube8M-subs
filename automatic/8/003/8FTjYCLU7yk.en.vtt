00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
and what i found when listening to their

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.550 
and what i found when listening to their
tracks<00:00:16.910> are<00:00:17.030> not<00:00:17.060> a<00:00:17.150> workout<00:00:17.600> the<00:00:18.050> chords<00:00:18.500> that

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
tracks are not a workout the chords that

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.830 
tracks are not a workout the chords that
I<00:00:18.680> playing<00:00:18.920> I<00:00:19.220> was<00:00:20.150> looking<00:00:20.390> how<00:00:20.510> on<00:00:20.600> earth<00:00:20.690> are

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
I playing I was looking how on earth are

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.090 
I playing I was looking how on earth are
they<00:00:20.930> playing<00:00:21.200> some<00:00:21.530> of<00:00:21.620> that<00:00:21.680> stuff<00:00:21.920> but

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
they playing some of that stuff but

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.800 
they playing some of that stuff but
actually<00:00:22.280> it's<00:00:22.610> because<00:00:22.730> a<00:00:23.240> lot<00:00:23.630> of<00:00:23.660> their

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
actually it's because a lot of their

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.620 
actually it's because a lot of their
songs<00:00:24.020> are<00:00:24.230> in<00:00:24.350> drop<00:00:24.680> D<00:00:24.710> so<00:00:25.640> that's<00:00:26.390> why<00:00:26.510> you're

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
songs are in drop D so that's why you're

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.660 
songs are in drop D so that's why you're
just<00:00:26.780> basically<00:00:27.020> dropping<00:00:27.440> the<00:00:27.800> bottom<00:00:28.520> a

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
just basically dropping the bottom a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.150 
just basically dropping the bottom a
string<00:00:29.030> down<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.960> D<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:30.470> quick<00:00:30.680> way<00:00:30.800> of<00:00:30.890> doing

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
string down to a D so quick way of doing

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.700 
string down to a D so quick way of doing
that<00:00:31.280> of<00:00:31.370> course<00:00:31.960> is<00:00:32.960> if<00:00:33.079> you<00:00:33.170> play<00:00:33.350> your<00:00:33.500> third

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
that of course is if you play your third

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:43.790 
that of course is if you play your third
string<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.160> D<00:00:37.179> turn<00:00:38.179> that<00:00:38.329> box<00:00:38.629> bring<00:00:38.929> down

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.970 

so<00:00:44.800> they're<00:00:44.920> basically<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.370> same

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.970 

okay<00:00:51.380> obviously<00:00:52.380> if<00:00:52.440> you've<00:00:52.530> got<00:00:52.650> a<00:00:52.680> cheater

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
okay obviously if you've got a cheater

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.710 
okay obviously if you've got a cheater
than<00:00:53.190> using<00:00:53.490> Schumer's<00:00:53.850> work<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.240> bit<00:00:54.600> more

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
than using Schumer's work for a bit more

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
than using Schumer's work for a bit more
accurate<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.180> very<00:00:57.390> first<00:00:57.540> chord<00:00:57.960> you

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
accurate so the very first chord you

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.240 
accurate so the very first chord you
could<00:00:59.130> cheat<00:00:59.610> by<00:01:00.090> using<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.600> shape<00:01:01.250> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
could cheat by using this shape and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.470 
could cheat by using this shape and
playing<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.670> up<00:01:02.790> here<00:01:04.970> but<00:01:05.970> doesn't<00:01:06.120> quite

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
playing it up here but doesn't quite

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.030 
playing it up here but doesn't quite
sound<00:01:06.870> right<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> way<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.680> you're<00:01:08.010> doing

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
sound right so the way that you're doing

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.880 
sound right so the way that you're doing
it<00:01:08.370> is<00:01:08.550> from<00:01:09.170> fifth<00:01:10.170> string<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> third

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
it is from fifth string on the third

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:29.170 
it is from fifth string on the third
fret<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.580> three<00:01:12.290> three<00:01:14.150> five

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.910 

and<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:31.450> from<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.540> fifth<00:01:32.720> string<00:01:32.960> just

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
and then from the fifth string just

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.770 
and then from the fifth string just
borrowing<00:01:34.400> across<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.330> fifth<00:01:35.540> and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
borrowing across the the fifth and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.840 
borrowing across the the fifth and
fourth<00:01:36.020> string<00:01:36.320> with<00:01:36.800> your<00:01:36.830> finger<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.430> just

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
fourth string with your finger and just

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:51.350 
fourth string with your finger and just
play<00:01:38.180> three<00:01:38.630> five<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:43.000> then<00:01:44.000> open<00:01:44.420> on<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.630> box

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.080 

that<00:01:52.360> top<00:01:52.630> part<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:52.900> like<00:01:53.140> Carol<00:01:53.500> at<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.680> D<00:01:54.090> we

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
that top part is like Carol at the D we

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:24.190 
that top part is like Carol at the D we
just<00:01:55.270> not<00:01:55.390> playing<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.750> top<00:01:55.930> string

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.700
