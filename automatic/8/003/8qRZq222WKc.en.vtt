00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.040
 hello cold steel company releases 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.049
 interesting knives some interesting 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.300
 items and in this case we are with you 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.930
 let's talk a little bit about the knife 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.699
 its plastic and oh leather sheath about 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 plastic knives and leather sheath 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.289
 to him like this here it all looks like if 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.500
 look from the side even somehow 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.890
 it is unusual to put it all in frame 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.950
 cold steel fgx karambit as written on 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.649
 the site may be something wrong 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.940
 I read but actually here's such 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.410
 his design is powerful shoes pretty 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.260
 sharp to come down to the tip 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.579
 Well, let's say this knife if you can 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.770
 call him a knife he's not very sharp but 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.399
 still on they can do all sorts of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.630
 Affairs means the handle and the knife itself is made 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.250
 from material greivari and moles i'm so 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.470
 I understand greivari then directly 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.560
 them this plastic croton tackle on the handle 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 so let's say tires rubber 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.890
 plastic knife 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.439
 it turns out there is such a hole 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.280
 very comfortable with various grabs all 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.310
 ergonomically thought out everything falls but 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.710
 just perfectly powerful stops you can 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.840
 here little finger catch but anyway 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.280
 there is a very very powerful emphasis and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.409
 various grip 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.900
 there are possible why it is convenient mide not 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.860
 hook or index finger in order 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.159
 to actually 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.979
 the knife did not slip out once again 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.860
 let's say accordingly I see for 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.229
 given loner too 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.229
 combat use cut them somehow bread 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.259
 and sausage is not very convenient and 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.200
 almost unreal but this is such 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.630
 hidden wearing knife which you can 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.550
 take with you where you don't take with 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.400
 something metallic 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.010
 and it's pretty interesting of course i don't 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.800
 I recommend you to wear such weapons 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.710
 the plane though he weapons 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.660
 legislation is not and is not even 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.390
 is his metal weapon 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:28.050
 double based on which it is made it 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:30.420
 cold steel tiger main let's say knife 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.670
 from which this one was actually made 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.620
 plastic feature is pressed call 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.220
 the walls on is that they 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.060
 make their plastic knives based 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.390
 some previously developed and 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.130
 proven other models 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.440
 here everything is very tenacious pay attention 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.920
 that such a pretty hard one had like 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.700
 this structure is kind of as if 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.450
 Well, I do not know the bolts are screwed into the handle 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.190
 in fact it's just such a rubber 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.330
 That's all very cool considering the price 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.350
 this knife is only $ 13 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.510
 in the us it is in my very profitable 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.730
 purchase and even if you are called 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.170
 doubt this knife will not work 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.370
 like not like you can 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.900
 purchase in the appendage 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.540
 actually then fold your 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.350
 impressions how it was done and 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:29.630
 me up to the knife I really didnâ€™t take for myself 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.590
 for your brother but in any case it is 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:37.170
 let's say so interesting interesting option 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.010
 It means on another website that you do 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.709
 on the knife 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.480
 Well, the shoes of this knife, I intend in the area 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.640
 7 and 3 millimeters that is very such 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.430
 serious for plastic it is a little bit 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.390
 bends here but for let's say 1 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.860
 times it can be enough for two 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.840
 here let us be a little larger 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.980
 dimensions how to measure it is not clear but like this 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.250
 up to 22 millimeter blade length is obtained 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.890
 somewhere in the area 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.870
 115 millimeters but it's the same length 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.790
 cutting edge in the area 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.010
 110 millimeters to 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.410
 looking again how you can measure 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.329
 It would be measured and this way would then have 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:25.139
 we got the same 115 and by the way 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:35.900
 Here about the comparison of dimensions here 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:39.930
 so like this with 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.880
 but since we are going to wear it 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.889
 how comfortable is it wearing by the way 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.650
 saying this knife goes without a scabbard like 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.759
 all my plastic knives of them all 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.060
 67 grams 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.400
 the total weight I immediately weigh the sheath needed 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.210
 were made by master alexey who 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.120
 you could see on my channel this 74 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.860
 grams for here such here need 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.930
 some just say about 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.840
 what you need weighty heavy but I would not 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.440
 said that for men add 74 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.690
 grams weight at theirs there including 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.080
 clothes yes compared to their general 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.760
 weighing it hard to be made very 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.710
 very high quality they are almost here 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.960
 so that snaps and very securely 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.020
 fixes a knife molded clearly by 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.849
 he was coined again by Alexey 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.669
 you could order almost any 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:35.130
 wearing option was coined option 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.440
 wearing horizontally on a belt over 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.020
 back as the main option well you can 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.820
 actually arrange and in front of you here 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.539
 these here are the reverse way not back for 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.080
 back worn captured and so that's 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.220
 way 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.010
 retrieved but all it takes is clearly 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.840
 less than a second of time there even pinpoint 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.330
 don't need what it takes somewhere in 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.060
 half a second to cure this 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.060
 knife it is very very quick and easy with 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.610
 one side there is a secure fit 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.270
 pretty appearance multiplied by 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.220
 On the other hand, everything is very fast and convenient. 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.669
 removed themselves need nice smell 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.990
 skin and produce me as always 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.830
 great impression i'm not really 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.170
 advertise but 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.750
 of Alexey Alexey is just one 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.110
 the master with whom let's say I have 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.030
 contact whom i can come to 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.950
 which I can take some scabbard and 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.950
 show you if i had 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.020
 need to show several 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.970
 I probably would have shown the masters 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.970
 several masters that is it in 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.770
 principle not some kind of advertising specific 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.670
 the person who is there for me is something 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.260
 pays and so on no it's just one 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.680
 from my acquaintances who makes 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:55.110
 quality stuff and let's say so i 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:59.750
 I think that they should be shown here 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:02.460
 here is the moment about the scabbard and the knife 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:06.330
 a series of plastic need quite 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:11.000
 great interesting maybe someone from 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.000
 you will be this information is useful until
