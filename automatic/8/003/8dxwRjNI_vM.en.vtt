00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 what is going on people of the countries again 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.790
 here you people surprises you wanted 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.260
 it's different and that's why today 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.790
 again a new pokémon myth my 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.280
 god that was still disease all 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.190
 work together well and know 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.070
 not if today's myth is like that again 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.570
 it gets scary or it stays 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.130
 it is definitely a beautiful one 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.109
 myth and he became much of you 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.730
 wanted and I was really upset 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.590
 survive because he also tells me 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.090
 even totally baffled but nonsense 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.480
 I 'm a long time but it starts immediately 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.130
 with the death of radical the myth 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.530
 says that this is the radical of the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.809
 rival gary on the ship ms n in 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 urania during a fight like that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.399
 seriously injured that all injuries 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.440
 who will die the old editions pokémon 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.969
 played and will think so because 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 be the most that can be possibly 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.780
 remember that several times on the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.550
 rival gary hits a country in the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.770
 fight and so on everything 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.260
 The fight on the ship in Urania city 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.420
 It is the last time that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.460
 were his looks radically and later 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.880
 you meet gary in phuket tower in 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.979
 labbadia city oddly field in 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 the conversation between esch and gary the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.820
 sentence from gary you do not know how it is 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.820
 to lose a pokémon 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.670
 ok it is also said that in 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.330
 phuket to the radical of gary buried 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.010
 should be 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.930
 well, you can now say he had 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.510
 the radical on the pc box after 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.640
 the fight and that he is on a pokémon 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.900
 cemetery from dead point one speaks 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 not so surprising now 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.400
 Well people but it goes on even further 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.160
 gary is now in the pokémon league 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.710
 finally become the cup champ and you 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.350
 So you should at least see it 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.270
 In this fight dialog, Gary says in the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.729
 German version of the game's sentence 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.920
 Your pokemon are fit in the 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.280
 English version, however, says gary 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 the sentence of the pokemon dongle or up 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.910
 German his pokemon do not look dead 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.310
 Okay and I do not know how it works 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.590
 you go today but I have every time 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.009
 when playing 1 second the feeling 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.200
 Gary is a very strong one 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.480
 I disinclinate my good ones are the choice 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.640
 It's a kind of contest but Gary 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.120
 seems to be downright infatuated with it 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.700
 his 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.100
 always the best and everything better 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.930
 to have as oneself and of meeting 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.390
 hate somehow always gets hit 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.549
 bigger there is even one like to 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.590
 own crib pastorin is told 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.750
 that gary has always been quite a bit 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.610
 hate on it because it had always 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.049
 the one who was preferred and 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.950
 Because Gary always in the background 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.959
 was pressed 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.640
 that is even observable after the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.070
 fight in the pokémon league is coming 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.570
 professor eich in the hall and praises it 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.160
 for his victory and that his pokemon 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.470
 he has trained very well that he himself 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.440
 Gary has taken wonderful care of her 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.090
 however, he was hard to be pokémon 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.310
 and he did not train them well and 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.040
 he did not do well and he was 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.390
 not so great now and it could be 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.239
 let in that gary one 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.310
 Little poor boy is with very deep 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.810
 he hate himself with his 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.810
 must compensate for megalomania 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.860
 and now it's up to you guys again 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.300
 So what do you say to this story 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.790
 Personally, I think this myth 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.410
 he could possibly vote for him 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.390
 is not completely explained plausibly 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.520
 outlandish as that in wanja syndrome 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.240
 and why should not the developers 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.220
 just a little one 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.900
 background story a tree on the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.120
 but it is not indicated 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.890
 opinions are now being addressed 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.260
 comments as always below in the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.640

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.580
