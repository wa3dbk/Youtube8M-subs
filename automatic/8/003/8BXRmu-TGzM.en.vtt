00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.930
 unlike the previous video where 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.759
 talk about the option to restore with 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.469
 the option to remove everything and restore 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.509
 windows will make it clear 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.280
 absolutely everything we have in 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.799
 our hard drive including the 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.080
 personal files programs and 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.240
 applications as well as any change 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.119
 what we have done to the windows registry 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.429
 in other words windows will create as 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.220
 a clean installation but it's still 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.560
 better option than doing the installation in 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.390
 an empty hard drive because the only thing 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.030
 makes windows with the option to remove 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.640
 everything and restore it will eliminate any 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.490
 configuration file foreign to a 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.710
 clean installation this will obviously be 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.050
 a quicker task than going back to 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.090
 install the system from a disk in the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.640
 start screen we type the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.470
 words remove everything and we enter 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.480
 configuration let's see this option 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.420
 which says remove everything and reinstall 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.520
 When you select it, this opens 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.050
 screen and a message appears 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.320
 similar to the one we saw earlier 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.670
 although with only two lines it says 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280
 that what is going to happen is that the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.360
 personal files and applications 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.490
 they are going to eliminate 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.460
 the configuration of the pc will return to its 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.070
 default values I repeat this is 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.770
 an option to have to format the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.590
 hard drive and install windows again 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.140
 it's a faster alternative at the end 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.300
 our windows will be exactly 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.270
 as if we had done that kind of 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.890
 installation from a dvd or cd in summary 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.310
 If our system has many errors 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.530
 and uninstall programs does not solve it 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.390
 we have no choice but to leave windows 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.610
 how it came from the factory and that we can 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.530
 perform with this function or with a 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.509
 new installation as I mentioned but 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.290
 remember that this second option is more 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:50.170
 difficult and it takes longer according to microsoft with 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.360
 remove everything and restore windows you'll have 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.119
 the same result as that kind of 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.710
 facilities but in a shorter time and 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.600
 Especially designed for 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.149
 beginners because as you can see 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.580
 you only select the option and 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.410
 then this next button the only 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.590
 problem that I see with this feature 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.410
 is that if our windows 8 is so 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.730
 damaged that can not be loaded 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.140
 correctly it will not help 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.420
 select it 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.550
 from the system itself since no 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.310
 we can enter windows so 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.319
 necessarily in those cases we must use 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.900
 a recovery disk something that already 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.090
 I mentioned in another video or a disc 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.910
 of windows to start the installation 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.120
 from that disk and also be able to use 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.550
 from it the recovery options or 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.550
 well do an installation from scratch
