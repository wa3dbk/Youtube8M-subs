00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.090
 here at the unexpected American's booth 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.670
 I actually found some games that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.580
 you do not actually find the booths 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 games in gaming companies 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.300
 the first one here that I tested was 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.740
 curious even by my friend's tip 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.180
 player where you have already recorded a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.090
 interview he commented told me 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.359
 you will see later interview is 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.340
 the dragon ball again see if this dragon 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.289
 that this new generation is there 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.140
 available on playstation 4 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.760
 I even liked his graphics more 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.649
 Because dragon ball was not coming 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.350
 pleasing a lot in graphics there is a good 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.840
 time and if it is really beautiful and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 're beautiful the care to see there but 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.090
 You can still compare with naruto that is 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.190
 seventh generation and I think that in the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.079
 earns several good aspects 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.289
 anyway the game is not ready 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.690
 anyway it's the style has box that he more 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.640
 free you ball environment and such 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.100
 only there the scenario that is available 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.170
 is that of tournament arts tournament 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.970
 that arena then it is a space 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.439
 more limited but closed you can not 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.159
 get out of the ball can not put it out 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.780
 his 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.939
 the evaluation until it became more 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.680
 concentrated more frenetically without much 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.460
 for a day that the business is hiding 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.810
 the more it bothers a little because 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.759
 end up putting it off 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.350
 closing the fight a little more monotonous 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.880
 I like the frantic action I can not 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.920
 hiding you looking for 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.540
 partners in a pile for me, it's okay not to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.350
 that's what my porraaaaa of the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.150
 at least two games 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.329
 that is why you should know that you do not 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.780
 I like your plug so much, but the game. 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.610
 there 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.920
 following is this style until I 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.650
 already pleased to go back to another 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.409
 game that was really a surprise neither 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.909
 I remember if there was announcement of him is the good dje 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.960
 let the look give a 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.340
 all stars lon nol 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.590
 unmask the pomegranates that is available 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.049
 for playstation 3 when you have a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.939
 arena with 3d drive with 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.159
 depth you choose your joÃ£o 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.140
 can develop to the ultimate shape 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.820
 in the middle of the battle filling the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.950
 energy field when it returns 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.320
 becomes stronger as it returns to the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.729
 time 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.709
 interesting is lisbon coming back with a 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.440
 certain quality still does not convince me 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.230
 both denied as much as the classic 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.959
 Hubble Arena and Clear Rosana 2 is also 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.080
 cool but I liked it it's good to see digimon 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.300
 coming back from games without being just a rpg 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.260
 so many different games and he is well 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.650
 promising 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.720
 detail is good is very cool 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.700
 but so is part of the effect of the powers 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.720
 and the texture of the scenery is still 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.100
 very precarious 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.060
 Of course we have to wait for the version 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.060
 end to draw more conclusions
