because<00:04:35.100> again<00:04:35.340> this<00:04:35.490> is<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.930> Anti<00:04:36.930> Mini<00:04:39.800> and

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
because again this is a Anti Mini and

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.570 
because again this is a Anti Mini and
then<00:04:41.400> in<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.669> back<00:04:42.350> access<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.919> rear<00:04:44.340> is

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
then in the back access to the rear is

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.060 
then in the back access to the rear is
oh<00:04:45.470> that<00:04:46.470> looks<00:04:46.620> familiar<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:49.860> have<00:04:50.010> a

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
pretty impressive storage area because

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.480 
pretty impressive storage area because
again<00:04:51.960> this<00:04:52.890> is<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.100> not<00:04:53.460> mini<00:04:55.310> removable<00:04:56.310> cover

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
again this is a not mini removable cover

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.070 
again this is a not mini removable cover
comes<00:04:56.790> off<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.780> underneath<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.560> do<00:04:58.710> have<00:05:00.080> you

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
comes off and underneath you do have you

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.530 
comes off and underneath you do have you
do<00:05:01.200> have<00:05:01.380> more<00:05:01.740> storage<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.250> your<00:05:02.850> spare<00:05:03.240> tire

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
do have more storage and your spare tire

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.670 
do have more storage and your spare tire
kit<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:04.020> believe<00:05:04.470> that<00:05:05.090> this<00:05:06.090> comes<00:05:06.330> with

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
kit and I believe that this comes with

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.780 
kit and I believe that this comes with
run-flat<00:05:07.680> tires<00:05:07.919> perhaps<00:05:08.400> because<00:05:08.640> I<00:05:08.729> know

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
run-flat tires perhaps because I know

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.030 
run-flat tires perhaps because I know
there's<00:05:09.060> no<00:05:09.180> spare<00:05:09.450> tire<00:05:09.660> so<00:05:12.830> there<00:05:13.830> you<00:05:13.890> go

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
there's no spare tire so there you go

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.840 
there's no spare tire so there you go
you<00:05:14.070> got<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.250> twin<00:05:14.520> exhaust<00:05:14.850> back<00:05:15.090> there<00:05:16.850> all

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
you got the twin exhaust back there all

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.380 
you got the twin exhaust back there all
right<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:18.090> again<00:05:18.300> this<00:05:18.540> is<00:05:18.660> a<00:05:18.780> 2012<00:05:20.090> not<00:05:21.090> Mini

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
right so again this is a 2012 not Mini

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.850 
right so again this is a 2012 not Mini
