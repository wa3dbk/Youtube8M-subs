00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hi everyone fought morning 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.040
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.400
 little tutorial of gta 5 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.540
 so this little tutorial is for you 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.309
 show how can train will do how 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.920
 we can do to win a lot 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.240
 money and nay and a lot of xp in one 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.890
 moment on gta 5 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.869
 so it's very simple I started a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 small racing with friends is to draw 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.630
 of wing the race call to wing pull 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.609
 here and so this little race for 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.880
 me is very very fast 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.079
 it lasts about 55 seconds maximum 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.710
 if we do it well 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.140
 so you will be able to take example 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.050
 if you do not know this little 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.289
 technique or this way this is this 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.850
 short race so this race is paying off 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.260
 still a lot of money actually 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.620
 all are many in the home more 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.360
 earn money and xp power 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.760
 find that at the end 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.450
 I ride a lot in a team and my 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.340
 crime bar a lot and I think 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.480
 that is one of the best 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.840
 techniques to earn xp 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.480
 after after that allows you to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.370
 buy apartments or cars from 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.080
 motorcycles finally everything is going to be full of 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.660
 things if you have a lot of money 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.720
 I personally bought myself a 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.970
 small to leave thanks to that and so that's it 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.220
 well I advise everyone to do his 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.170
 technical tripe to gain a little 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.940
 of money that it's true that the show 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.400
 lasts more or less five ten minutes 15 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.080
 minutes it depends which and we win 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.370
 what is it? 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.990
 3000 9000 silver for just 1500 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.030
 of xp andyy but what so 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.430
 while there you found that I 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.680
 earns 1500 and some xp for recall 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.200
 a run of 55 seconds is when 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.120
 even enough buzzed this activity I 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.650
 do not know if he requit star is going to do the 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.370
 day on that because that I 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.790
 the impression that it's really not 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.050
 balanced with the missions 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.650
 so here you have seen all the art all 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.570
 money I 'm at 5800 and 1500 xp have 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.270
 not even 55 seconds so that's really 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.640
 really a mode we sell farm very 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.560
