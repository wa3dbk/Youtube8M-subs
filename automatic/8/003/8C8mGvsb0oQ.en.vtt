and<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.790> say<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.240> looks<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.840> would

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and I can say this looks like it would

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.270 
and I can say this looks like it would
probably<00:01:55.320> hold<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.220> well<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.670> use

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
probably hold up really well to use

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.649 
probably hold up really well to use
could<00:01:59.280> probably<00:01:59.549> run<00:01:59.820> your<00:02:00.000> truck<00:02:00.210> over<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659
