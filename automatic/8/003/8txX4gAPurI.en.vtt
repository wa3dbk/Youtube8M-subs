00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.440 

there's<00:01:41.660> a<00:01:41.780> four<00:01:42.470> inch<00:01:42.650> filtered<00:01:43.190> disc<00:01:43.460> I<00:01:43.820> was

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
there's a four inch filtered disc I was

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.280 
there's a four inch filtered disc I was
hoping<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:45.050> would<00:01:46.360> break<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.570> stream<00:01:47.900> up<00:01:48.170> a

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
hoping it would break the stream up a

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.960 
hoping it would break the stream up a
little<00:01:48.500> more<00:01:48.800> but<00:01:48.860> as<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.400> can<00:01:49.550> see<00:01:49.610> it

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
little more but as you can see it

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.090 
little more but as you can see it
doesn't<00:01:50.300> really<00:01:53.290> just<00:01:54.290> goes<00:01:54.500> pretty<00:01:54.920> much

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
doesn't really just goes pretty much

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.770 
doesn't really just goes pretty much
straight<00:01:55.370> through<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:58.600> there's<00:01:59.600> not<00:01:59.720> really

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
straight through and there's not really

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.500 
straight through and there's not really
a<00:02:00.170> much<00:02:00.740> reflux<00:02:01.370> going<00:02:01.940> on<00:02:02.120> inside<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:04.510> this

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
a much reflux going on inside the this

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.420 
a much reflux going on inside the this
packed<00:02:05.960> column<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:06.800> this<00:02:06.950> little<00:02:07.220> pack

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
packed column in this little pack

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
packed column in this little pack
section<00:02:09.610> pretty<00:02:10.610> much<00:02:10.880> goes<00:02:11.120> straight

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
section pretty much goes straight

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.400 
section pretty much goes straight
through<00:02:11.510> just<00:02:11.750> channel<00:02:12.350> straight<00:02:12.650> through<00:02:14.740> so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
through just channel straight through so

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.110 
through just channel straight through so
this<00:02:18.410> needs<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.920> be<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.660> lot<00:02:20.660> more<00:02:20.900> effective<00:02:21.590> of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
this needs to be a lot more effective of

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:31.630 
this needs to be a lot more effective of
spreading<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.240> around

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.190 

then

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.080 

more<00:02:35.830> bubble<00:02:36.220> plates<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:39.220> have<00:02:39.250> three<00:02:39.700> bubble

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
more bubble plates we have three bubble

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.630 
more bubble plates we have three bubble
plates<00:02:40.360> then<00:02:42.690> now<00:02:43.690> it's<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.230> two<00:02:45.010> bubble<00:02:45.370> plates

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640
