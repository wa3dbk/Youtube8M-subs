 we are going to remove the chain from 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.970
 the crown must be loosened 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.240
 tensioners to the maximum you loosen the 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.260
 left tensioner and then loosen the 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.869
 right tensioner that when the turnbuckles 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.670
 its unscrewed to the maximum you die the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:47.590
 wheel the same you desire it cazouls the 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:52.500
 cast on one side and then on the other 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:57.090
 push the wheel to the maximum and you come 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.090
 remove the string from the agreement at 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.229
 we are going to disassemble the crank of the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:11.340
 pedal with the pedal loosen you 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:15.060
 the nut of the key does not serve it 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.090
 not thoroughly what in general it takes 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.530
 go out with the hammer so why broke 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.510
 the pod screw let back 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.100
 completely and you tap with a gesture 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.630
 commercial 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.840
 when it comes out you loosen a little 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.370
 little and you always continue to rest 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:49.500
 thank you to what I call the gesture 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:51.450
 commercial of course the hammer the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.900
 key is removed you can remove 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.900
 the pedal 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.200
 to drop the tray you pull 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.170
 slightly above 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:09.800
 be careful lock washer you 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:14.570
 take it off you remove it and you 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:18.200
 remove also the motor chain pato is 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.630
 removed before putting the tray back 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.090
 tighten the crank thing of the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.700
 pedal let's put the chain back 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.940
 motor so as for the upside down and the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.200
 same principle you positioned it and we 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.580
 know that you turn them made 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.550
 attention because if you block the 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.640
 fingers in it does not hurt you 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:42.260
 put back the chain part cycle of your 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.510
 mobile is so same principle you 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.890
 present against there on the pedals 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.950
 to present you with beauty where there is the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:54.350
 Tensioner makes a spin the sphere days 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.560
 before handing the crank of your 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.840
 crankset it will have to check a 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.950
 thing that is to say that the trays that 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.260
 you are now buying in the shops 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.130
 are more made by peugeot cd 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.720
 compatible it adapts but according to 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.209
 builders they are not necessarily 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.590
 identical identical and that you're going the 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.620
 find at the level of the pucks of 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.720
 wedging why not what's needed before 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.959
 to stall your tray you have to know 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.080
 one thing it needs to be your channel that 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.060
 here is the motor chain remains the most 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.400
 possible right so and an axis to his 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:34.880
 rights between the back yard and the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.010
 the teeth that you have no on your 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.390
 tray with this toothing the man must 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.960
 that the chain remains the most straight 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.810
 possible 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.060
 why because if panting either towards 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.530
 the left is to the right 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.180
 they will tend to derail the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.380
 worry will end up at the level of the 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.950
 belt is exactly the same 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.070
 principle 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.750
 it will be necessary to align the kz2 your 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.010
 tray with the kz2 your clutch 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.320
 like for the chain so that 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.660
 it's not too much left or too much 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.639
 on the right that it remains the most straight 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.090
 possible 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:13.210
 so that your robin's neck is not ne 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.270
 do not eat some people get 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.389
 complain about having a strap that sucks 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.689
 prematurely 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.909
 the worry is that then the trays 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.129
 which which also presupposes prematurely 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.229
 it's a bad wedge if your 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.990
 run away in one direction or in 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:32.129
 the other one you go wrong 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.129
 automatically your tray 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:41.360
 the alignment between your string figures 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:44.750
 motor and crown and right between the 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.150
 belt so between the clutch and the 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.740
 plateau its rights so of course we can 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.290
 not always be entitled right you have 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.880
 always a small shift but made to 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:57.670
 better then 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:03.490
 so we're going to hand the crank 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:06.820
 we position it like this you take 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.820
 the planet 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:19.729
 the positions 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:25.610
 is we tightened the screen exit them 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:28.639
 rather strong maple bridges or towards the 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:32.930
 cops and poggio formidable the other 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:35.270
 crank is now installed we 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.120
 let's reinstall the strap on the 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.779
 tray you pass it in the pedal 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.360
 in the crank 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:42.490
 you just put it on your clutch 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.680
 or on vario 1 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.629
 everything depends on the engine that you have you 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.629
 lift the muffler in order to 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:52.669
 back off or over 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:56.930
 the engine is you spin the 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:59.419
 pulley we will reinstall the wheel 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.120
 back the wait hong kong or pulled 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:04.610
 on it so that 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.900
 turnbuckles you place the turnbuckle on the left 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:12.349
 and you place the tensioner on the right 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:15.800
 then you tighten up the 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:17.419
 Tensioners when you reinstall 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.099
 your tray it will have to put the 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.560
 Greece in for these 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:26.990
 use the sprinkler that is on the 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:29.990
 boat to be able to grease your 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.000
 plateau here you have a jet a 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.099
 small copper particles with a 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.460
 ball inside it will have you 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:44.050
 equipped with a grease pump with a 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:47.149
 tip to the padres to clacy come m 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:50.689
 the tip of the grease pump on the 

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:55.099
 nozzle to support the most strongly 

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:56.449
 possible and press the pump to 

00:07:55.099 --> 00:08:00.560
 fat in such a way is what you 

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:02.899
 send the address directly into the 

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.219
 plateau then you will see it's not 

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.020
 very practical you really have to support 

00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:08.749
 very very much what greece has 

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.889
 tendency to go out on the sides and you 

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:10.189
 do not worry it comes back anyway 

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:15.550
 in 

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:15.550
 this is where our plate comes out and grease
