curling iron this is the better method

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.340 
curling iron this is the better method
to<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> especially<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> hair<00:01:19.259> is

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to do it especially if the hair is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.080 
to do it especially if the hair is
really<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.860> layered<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> might

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
really really layered because you might

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.910 
really really layered because you might
not<00:01:21.270> catch<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.409> from<00:01:22.590> bottom

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
not catch it all if you go from bottom

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
not catch it all if you go from bottom
to<00:01:22.950> top<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.299> hold<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.990> few

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
to top and you just hold it for a few

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.600 
to top and you just hold it for a few
seconds<00:01:25.650> you're<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:25.979> trying<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.220> get<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> curl

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
seconds you're not trying to get a curl

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.580 
seconds you're not trying to get a curl
or<00:01:26.820> anything<00:01:27.030> they're<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.630> trying<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
or anything they're just trying to get a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
or anything they're just trying to get a
roll<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> bottom<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.390> it's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
roll going on at the bottom so it's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.710 
roll going on at the bottom so it's
easier<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> curl<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.450> got<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
easier to curl so you see you just got a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.380 
easier to curl so you see you just got a
little<00:01:36.810> something<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.250> shape<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:39.150> roll

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
little something on the shape you roll

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.170 
little something on the shape you roll
it<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:41.159> anything<00:01:41.400> comes<00:01:41.579> out<00:01:41.939> like
