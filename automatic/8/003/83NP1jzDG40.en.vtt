00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.350
 Have you heard me speaking here other times than a year 11? 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.960
 is a very important year for the lords of the world because they believe in the 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.479
 that the eleven 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.389
 Be the number of their god. 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.299
 and those 10 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.070
 would be however or number 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.429
 it turned out to be 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.429
 and one of them being 11 would be in ducks 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.970
 God's 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.329
 well in 2009 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.880
 it's a year 11 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.179
 for them 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.760
 because we have two but nine 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.450
 so too in 1901 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.670
 It was students and for them 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.490
 9 plus one plus one 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.710
 in the same way the year 1900 and 10 was also years 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.920
 emerged in the year 1910 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.980
 the lords of the world 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.410
 created 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 various networks 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.610
 to imprison us 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.450
 different methods to enslave us 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.180
 which are working fine 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.829
 fulfilling its role 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.690
 until this day 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.420
 I'm a man trying here in this exercise that we're going to do 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.240
 he only 1 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.330
 investments 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.049
 and the lords of the world have done 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.770
 in 1910 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.360
 the last year 11 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.330
 before 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.900
 of 2009 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.720
 it is called the central American bangu 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.010
 the american federal reserve 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.910
 Why did it happen that year? 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.420
 He is in the United States. 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.320
 in georgia 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.820
 coincidence or not 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.420
 Where are the days plates? 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.570
 what do they bring there 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.660
 the 10 goals of the world's lords regarding humanity 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.810
 and that even 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.170
 between them 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.950
 is well described in several languages 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.170
 that the population should turn around 500,000 people 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.590
 beyond the board of georgia 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.499
 in the state of georgia 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.769
 also 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.089
 have fema coffins 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:21.279
 sema's actions are basically centered on 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.409
 in the state of georgia 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.719
 and coincidence or not 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.459
 in 1910 in this same state of Georgia 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.459
 the enlightened families gathered 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:38.040
 these meeting was a single meeting 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.539
 led by the family to portugal 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:45.659
 and family Wednesday 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.379
 and are the main exponents 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.939
 two illuminated 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.299
 at this time 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.319
 these two families were the leaders as they are today 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.629
 two banks 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.529
 which provides money to the United States at the time 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:02.469
 is today 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.389
 provide for the entire planet 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.389
 by well saying the almost whole planet 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.409
 and I told you what happened at that meeting 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:18.339
 that the world's lords led by 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:19.399
 high slaughter 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.689
 and by the ugly votes 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.789
 they created this year 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:25.309
 to raze new 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:26.239
 federal 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.090
 American 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.979
 the American central bank 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.979
 a private bank is not from the government 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.489
 What happened at that meeting? 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.479
 they called him 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.859
 beyond 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.319
 of the families that ruled the world 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.319
 also bank owners 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.349
 who competed among themselves 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.089
 called for an agreement 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.039
 it's a negotiation 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.249
 at this time 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:00.249
 they already sponsored each of their candidates 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.499
 to the senate 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:05.309
 the presidency of the american republic 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.929
 only from then on 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.639
 proposed the creation 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.299
 of the federal reserve 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.029
 and with this bank 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.569
 they would have now 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:19.650
 to anoint 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.620
 coordination of work in better organized work 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.100
 in practical terms we can say that they were there forming a cartel of the 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.090
 bankers 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.720
 that exists until today that controls the world economy 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.509
 in the present day 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.740
 What is this poster for? 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.289
 of bankers 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.509
 the federal reserve 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.990
 had the backing 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.669
 towards 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.270
 the legal question 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.509
 they moved all their contingent of politicians 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:04.009
 who were in public office to prepare, from then on, the laws 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.199
 Why this support? 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.650
 to this initiative of the creation 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.650
 of the reserve fund 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.670
 American 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.330
 from the American bank 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
 How did the thing start working over there? 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.379
 they had the opportunity then from that important year for them 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.430
 1910 students 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.960
 to start 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.089
 a money-making process that exists today 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.490
 they elected the money from 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.300
 out of the blue 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.909
 Some scholars call the Mandraque effect an allusion to the character of 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.849
 40's comics 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.889
 that could make things appear 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.379
 with a magic trick taking off his top hat 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.650
 that's how it's done to me today 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.790
 I'll do is that the basic reasoning about it 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.309
 let us abolish this reasoning all the technical terms that they use 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:05.700
 and why not use a technical terms 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.159
 So we can not understand what they're talking about. 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.289
 even when it has to announce something about the issues 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.439
 with these technical terms we stay with the agents 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:18.240
 we are to whom 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.800
 of what they are really saying because we do not understand the 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.330
 technical terms 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.099
 but let's take a very simple analysis that is also you know 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.809
 the common here in this work that we do 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:33.899
 is to make things more complicated in a simpler way 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.449
 for understanding is easier 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.289
 as with the government you work with a reserve fund 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:43.789
 American 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.789
 with the Federal Reserve Bank of the cartel of bankers 

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:50.939
 the American government in the beginning was the American government today 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.569
 are basically all governments in the world 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.569
 including our country Brazil 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:00.999
 let's start from the following principle 

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:04.249
 the government spends much more than it collects
