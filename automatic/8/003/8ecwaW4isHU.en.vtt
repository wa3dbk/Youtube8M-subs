part two in my double Oh Reiser saga in
this<00:00:06.480> part<00:00:06.750> we'll<00:00:06.930> be<00:00:07.170> covering<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:08.040> Oh<00:00:24.140> so

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
this part we'll be covering the Oh so

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.890 
this part we'll be covering the Oh so
here<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.279> Arizer<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:29.720> really<00:00:30.720> never

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
here we have the Arizer I really never

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.160 
here we have the Arizer I really never
planned<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.859> make<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.790> early<00:00:33.059> along<00:00:33.899> with

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
planned to make it this early along with

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.200 
planned to make it this early along with
the<00:00:34.320> double<00:00:34.590> O<00:00:34.680> Gundam<00:00:35.300> just<00:00:36.300> because<00:00:36.829> I

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
the double O Gundam just because I

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.900 
the double O Gundam just because I
thought<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.450> design<00:00:39.950> would<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.010> too<00:00:41.489> hard<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
thought the design would be too hard to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.470 
thought the design would be too hard to
pull<00:00:42.090> off<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.629> my<00:00:42.780> surprise<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:44.670> works<00:00:45.239> pretty

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
pull off to my surprise it works pretty

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.299 
pull off to my surprise it works pretty
well<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:47.460> design<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.110> O<00:00:49.140> riser<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.980> hard

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
well the design of the O riser is hard

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.389 
well the design of the O riser is hard
to<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:52.199> well<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.710> making<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.129> functional

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
to get as well as making it functional

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.310 
to get as well as making it functional
at<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> same<00:00:54.210> time<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.610> tricky<00:00:56.940> to

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
at the same time so it can be tricky to

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.790 
at the same time so it can be tricky to
fit<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> transformation<00:00:59.219> and<00:01:00.770> deal<00:01:01.770> with

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
fit in the transformation and deal with

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.090 
fit in the transformation and deal with
the<00:01:02.129> balance<00:01:02.579> issues<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.350> double<00:01:04.710> o<00:01:04.830> riser

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the balance issues of the double o riser

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.940 
the balance issues of the double o riser
while<00:01:05.519> still<00:01:05.880> retaining<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.600> accurate<00:01:07.260> o

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
while still retaining an accurate o

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.710 
while still retaining an accurate o
riser<00:01:08.610> form<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.260> think<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.619> did<00:01:10.830> pretty<00:01:10.860> good

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
riser form and I think I did pretty good

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.880 
riser form and I think I did pretty good
with<00:01:13.520> this<00:01:14.520> model<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:16.409> could<00:01:16.560> see<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
with this model here you could see the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.450 
with this model here you could see the
bottom<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.460> pretty<00:01:17.970> hollow<00:01:18.799> just<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.979> close-up

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
bottom is pretty hollow just a close-up

here

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.230 

pretty<00:01:36.100> simple

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:55.160 

they're<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:42.990> at<00:01:43.110> either<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.380> top

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
many have it the ill riser anyway this

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.230 
many have it the ill riser anyway this
