00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
from the opposite side of the valve stem

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.720 
from the opposite side of the valve stem
that<00:01:00.899> way<00:01:01.079> you're<00:01:01.440> sure<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.550> break

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
around to where the valve stem is pull

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.090 
around to where the valve stem is pull
the<00:01:09.510> valve<00:01:09.659> stem<00:01:09.869> out<00:01:10.640> set<00:01:11.640> your<00:01:11.729> two<00:01:11.939> beside

tire<00:02:06.399> on<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:09.160> rim<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.640> start<00:02:10.390> at<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.569> valve

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
tire on the rim and start at the valve

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.380 
tire on the rim and start at the valve
stem<00:02:10.959> again<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:12.220> way<00:02:12.400> it's<00:02:12.819> easiest<00:02:13.150> the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
stem again that way it's easiest the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.699 
stem again that way it's easiest the
valve<00:02:13.569> stem<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.900> kind<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.170> hardest<00:02:14.500> part

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
valve stem is kind of the hardest part

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.070 
valve stem is kind of the hardest part
to<00:02:14.739> get<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.190> tire<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:16.360> then<00:02:16.900> just

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
to get on the tire and then just

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.520 
to get on the tire and then just
continue<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.590> go<00:02:17.709> around<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.099> rim<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:20.380> may

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
continue to go around the rim you may

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.820 
continue to go around the rim you may
have<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.800> continue<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.370> tuck<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.730> tube<00:02:21.940> into

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
have to continue to tuck the tube into

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.620 
have to continue to tuck the tube into
the<00:02:23.830> tire<00:02:24.099> may<00:02:24.730> kind<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:24.970> want<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.180> pop<00:02:25.390> out<00:02:25.599> on

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
the tire may kind of want to pop out on

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.780 
the tire may kind of want to pop out on
you<00:02:25.870> right<00:02:26.080> now<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.349> then<00:02:26.580> then<00:02:27.580> just<00:02:27.700> go

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
you right now and then then just go

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.820 
you right now and then then just go
around<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.299> your<00:02:28.450> thumbs<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:31.620> push<00:02:32.620> that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
guy on there and then make sure it's all

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.830 
guy on there and then make sure it's all
on<00:02:36.910> there<00:02:37.060> evenly<00:02:39.329> then<00:02:40.329> you<00:02:40.450> can<00:02:40.599> go<00:02:40.750> ahead

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
on there evenly then you can go ahead

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.670 
on there evenly then you can go ahead
and<00:02:41.760> fill<00:02:42.760> your<00:02:42.790> tire<00:02:43.090> with<00:02:43.269> there<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.630> put<00:02:44.590> it

and fill your tire with there and put it
back<00:02:44.769> on<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:45.010> bike<00:02:47.819> then<00:02:48.819> always<00:02:49.090> always

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
back on the bike then always always

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.100 
back on the bike then always always
always<00:02:49.959> remember<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.829> reattach<00:02:51.430> your<00:02:51.489> break

at<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.170> end<00:02:54.569> probably<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.660> most<00:02:55.810> important

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
at the end probably the most important

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.979 
at the end probably the most important
part<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.489> how<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.700> replace<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.390> tire<00:02:58.750> on

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
part that is how you replace the tire on

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.290 
part that is how you replace the tire on
