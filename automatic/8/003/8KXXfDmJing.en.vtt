the respect that it looks bad ass and
that<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.850> why<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.030> am<00:00:33.270> trying<00:00:33.750> my<00:00:33.930> absolute

hardest<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.760> make<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.390> gun<00:00:36.780> work<00:00:37.320> I've<00:00:37.860> tried

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
hardest to make this gun work I've tried

but<00:00:40.410> there's<00:00:40.800> nothing<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.430> makes<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.879> gun

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
but there's nothing that makes this gun

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.410 
but there's nothing that makes this gun
better<00:00:42.960> than<00:00:43.170> an<00:00:43.320> auto<00:00:43.590> rifle<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.340> short<00:00:45.239> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
better than an auto rifle in short to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.510 
better than an auto rifle in short to
mid-range<00:00:45.660> situation<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> there's<00:00:47.309> nothing

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
mid-range situation and there's nothing

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.069 
mid-range situation and there's nothing
that<00:00:47.700> makes<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.090> fun<00:00:48.300> better<00:00:48.539> than<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.809> scout

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that makes it fun better than a scout

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.709 
that makes it fun better than a scout
rifle<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.710> long-range<00:00:50.070> situations<00:00:51.030> this

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
rifle in long-range situations this

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.139 
rifle in long-range situations this
thing<00:00:52.050> doesn't<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> place<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.940> game

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
thing doesn't have a place in the game

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.930 
thing doesn't have a place in the game
right<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.500> think<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.860> goes<00:00:56.309> that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
right now and I think that goes that

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.569 
right now and I think that goes that
holds<00:00:57.239> true<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:58.530> pulse<00:00:58.920> prices<00:00:59.340> pulse

holds true for all pulse prices pulse

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.729 
holds true for all pulse prices pulse
rifles<00:01:00.000> don't<00:01:00.539> really<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> role<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
rifles don't really have a role in this

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
rifles don't really have a role in this
game<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.430> fulfill<00:01:03.000> they<00:01:03.239> there's

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
game right now to fulfill they there's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
so this county isn't even better than

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.359 
so this county isn't even better than
auto<00:01:30.180> rifles<00:01:30.659> or<00:01:30.810> Scout<00:01:31.049> rifles<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.740> PvE<00:01:32.220> I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
swear so I'm not really sure is that it

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.530 
swear so I'm not really sure is that it
definitely<00:01:35.670> needs<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> buff<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.360> pulse

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and all games at you and they're either

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.149 
and all games at you and they're either
awful<00:01:54.540> or<00:01:54.720> they're<00:01:54.930> great<00:01:55.229> look<00:01:55.500> at<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> m16

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
awful or they're great look at the m16

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.219 
awful or they're great look at the m16
in<00:01:56.310> modern<00:01:56.490> warfare<00:01:56.640> 3<00:01:56.790> thing<00:01:57.240> was<00:01:57.390> awful<00:01:57.869> but

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
in modern warfare 3 thing was awful but

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.810 
in modern warfare 3 thing was awful but
then<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.469> look<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.680> type<00:01:58.860> 95<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> same

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
then you look at type 95 in the same

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.270 
then you look at type 95 in the same
game<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.659> great<00:02:00.899> amazing<00:02:01.860> best<00:02:02.070> gun<00:02:02.250> in

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
game it was great amazing best gun in

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.780 
game it was great amazing best gun in
the<00:02:02.430> game<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.939> good<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.360> was

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
the game so good that it was

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.700 
the game so good that it was
competitive<00:02:04.300> so<00:02:04.690> we<00:02:04.840> don't<00:02:05.080> want<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.470> to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
competitive so we don't want that to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.280 
competitive so we don't want that to
happen<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:06.640> pulse<00:02:06.910> rifles<00:02:07.390> right<00:02:07.870> now<00:02:08.020> we're

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
happen to pulse rifles right now we're

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.340 
happen to pulse rifles right now we're
in<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.380> m16<00:02:08.860> category<00:02:09.310> they<00:02:09.399> suck<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:09.940> can

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
in the m16 category they suck but can

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.220 
in the m16 category they suck but can
Bungie<00:02:11.350> will<00:02:11.950> bungee<00:02:12.250> buff<00:02:13.090> them<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.600> will

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
Bungie will bungee buff them and will

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.540 
Bungie will bungee buff them and will
they<00:02:14.350> make<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.010> they're<00:02:15.190> not<00:02:15.340> the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
they make it so that they're not the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.400 
they make it so that they're not the
most<00:02:15.580> o<00:02:15.850> piecing<00:02:16.210> in<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.360> game<00:02:16.510> but<00:02:17.170> I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
most o piecing in the game but I

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.950 
most o piecing in the game but I
completely<00:02:17.740> understand<00:02:18.730> right<00:02:19.030> now<00:02:19.060> why<00:02:19.600> they

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
completely understand right now why they

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.930 
completely understand right now why they
are<00:02:20.260> not<00:02:20.560> buffing<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.100> why<00:02:21.370> they're<00:02:21.580> in<00:02:21.760> the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
are not buffing that why they're in the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.760 
are not buffing that why they're in the
situation<00:02:22.540> as<00:02:22.630> they<00:02:22.750> are<00:02:22.900> there<00:02:23.140> why<00:02:23.500> they're

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
situation as they are there why they're

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.010 
situation as they are there why they're
not<00:02:23.950> super<00:02:24.280> secure<00:02:25.000> strong<00:02:25.270> or<00:02:25.720> at<00:02:25.810> least

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
not super secure strong or at least

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.650 
not super secure strong or at least
Evans<00:02:26.650> or<00:02:26.890> below<00:02:27.160> average<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:28.510> can

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
Evans or below average and I can

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.150 
Evans or below average and I can
definitely<00:02:28.780> see<00:02:29.050> why<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.620> because<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:30.010> you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
definitely see why that is because I you

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.100 
definitely see why that is because I you
would<00:02:30.610> get<00:02:30.760> obliterated<00:02:31.180> by<00:02:31.570> polar<00:02:31.780> cycles

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
would get obliterated by polar cycles

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.740 
would get obliterated by polar cycles
that's<00:02:32.290> all<00:02:32.530> you'd<00:02:32.740> see<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.400> right<00:02:34.150> now<00:02:34.180> I

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
that's all you'd see so right now I

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.050 
that's all you'd see so right now I
think<00:02:35.110> bungees<00:02:35.650> treading<00:02:36.010> carefully<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.790> I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
think bungees treading carefully and I

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.670 
think bungees treading carefully and I
think<00:02:37.120> that's<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.510> right<00:02:37.690> thing<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:38.050> do<00:02:38.230> we'll

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
think that's the right thing to do we'll

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.850 
think that's the right thing to do we'll
see<00:02:38.980> as<00:02:39.220> time<00:02:39.430> goes<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.880> if<00:02:40.270> pulse<00:02:41.080> rifles<00:02:41.530> can

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
see as time goes on if pulse rifles can

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.310 
see as time goes on if pulse rifles can
work<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.370> little<00:02:42.490> better<00:02:42.670> but<00:02:43.300> for<00:02:43.570> now<00:02:43.780> some

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
work a little better but for now some

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.199 
work a little better but for now some
things<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.740> found<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.459> make<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.760> work<00:02:45.970> a

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
things I found I can make it work a

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.690 
things I found I can make it work a
little<00:02:46.690> better<00:02:46.959> if<00:02:47.350> you're<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.680> masochist<00:02:48.430> and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
little better if you're a masochist and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.600 
little better if you're a masochist and
you<00:02:48.880> like<00:02:49.240> getting<00:02:49.600> shit<00:02:49.900> on<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.830> you<00:02:51.160> really

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
you like getting shit on and you really

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.740 
you like getting shit on and you really
want<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.850> use<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> pulse<00:02:52.240> right<00:02:52.450> when<00:02:52.630> you've

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
want to use a pulse right when you've

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.100 
want to use a pulse right when you've
got<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.900> fetish<00:02:53.200> for<00:02:54.060> burst<00:02:55.060> guns<00:02:55.330> then<00:02:55.750> here's

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
got a fetish for burst guns then here's

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.810 
got a fetish for burst guns then here's
a<00:02:56.350> couple<00:02:56.620> things<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.280> well<00:02:58.110> one<00:02:59.110> thing<00:02:59.410> is

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
a couple things that well one thing is

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.199 
a couple things that well one thing is
hold<00:03:00.820> down<00:03:01.170> slightly<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.860> aim<00:03:03.400> stick<00:03:03.790> when

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
hold down slightly on the aim stick when

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.060 
hold down slightly on the aim stick when
you're<00:03:04.390> shooting<00:03:04.600> anything<00:03:05.050> most<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.860> works

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
you're shooting anything most this works

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.920 
you're shooting anything most this works
better<00:03:06.400> for<00:03:06.700> mid<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.060> long<00:03:07.239> range<00:03:07.510> because

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
better for mid and long range because

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.780 
better for mid and long range because
the<00:03:08.080> recoil<00:03:08.470> applies<00:03:08.860> more<00:03:09.130> but<00:03:09.370> at<00:03:09.519> what<00:03:09.760> I

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
the recoil applies more but at what I

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.420 
the recoil applies more but at what I
found<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.360> consistent<00:03:11.290> issue<00:03:11.650> with<00:03:12.100> pulse

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
found is a consistent issue with pulse

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.180 
found is a consistent issue with pulse
rifles<00:03:12.910> is<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.780> recoil<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.650> too<00:03:15.010> much

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
rifles is the recoil it is too much

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.300 
rifles is the recoil it is too much
between<00:03:16.019> within<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.170> burst<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:17.890> first

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
between within the burst so like first

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.009 
between within the burst so like first
bullet<00:03:18.640> second<00:03:19.030> bullet<00:03:19.180> third<00:03:19.480> bullet<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:19.900> the

bullet second bullet third bullet in the

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.810 
bullet second bullet third bullet in the
burst<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.500> recoil<00:03:20.860> is<00:03:20.980> way<00:03:21.190> too<00:03:21.250> much<00:03:21.519> between

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
burst the recoil is way too much between

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.759 
burst the recoil is way too much between
those<00:03:22.060> bullets<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.660> makes<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.260> almost

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
those bullets it makes it almost

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.440 
those bullets it makes it almost
impossible<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.459> get<00:03:24.580> consistent<00:03:25.090> head<00:03:25.239> John

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
impossible to get consistent head John

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.199 
impossible to get consistent head John
even<00:03:26.350> if<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.830> do<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.190> trick<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:27.970> which

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
even if you do is a trick but it which

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.990 
even if you do is a trick but it which
is<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.420> trick<00:03:28.660> where<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.870> aim<00:03:29.440> down<00:03:29.470> on<00:03:29.799> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
is a trick where you aim down on the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.640 
is a trick where you aim down on the
stick<00:03:31.000> up<00:03:31.120> just<00:03:31.299> a<00:03:31.390> little<00:03:31.570> bit<00:03:31.660> while<00:03:32.440> you're

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
stick up just a little bit while you're

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.039 
stick up just a little bit while you're
shooting<00:03:32.799> really<00:03:33.519> helps<00:03:33.940> but<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.269> still<00:03:34.780> is

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
shooting really helps but it still is

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.560 
shooting really helps but it still is
very<00:03:35.080> hard<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.950> do<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.820> also<00:03:37.000> makes<00:03:37.180> it

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
very hard to do and it also makes it

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.110 
very hard to do and it also makes it
difficult<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.230> aim<00:03:38.500> while<00:03:39.070> you're<00:03:39.310> trying<00:03:39.970> to

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
difficult to aim while you're trying to

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.090 
difficult to aim while you're trying to
hold<00:03:40.420> down<00:03:40.570> on<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.049> dick<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.530> slightly<00:03:41.860> at

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
hold down on this dick just slightly at

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.800 
hold down on this dick just slightly at
the<00:03:42.220> same<00:03:42.400> time<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:43.209> that's<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.690> know<00:03:43.750> that's

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
the same time so that's you know that's

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.930 
the same time so that's you know that's
a<00:03:44.019> lot<00:03:44.140> of<00:03:44.200> work<00:03:44.410> compared<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:44.950> when<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:45.700> could

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
a lot of work compared to when I could

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.850 
a lot of work compared to when I could
just<00:03:46.060> use<00:03:46.209> an<00:03:46.360> auto<00:03:46.540> rifle<00:03:46.989> but<00:03:47.380> if<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.560> really

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
just use an auto rifle but if you really

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.590 
just use an auto rifle but if you really
want<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.280> use<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.459> pulse<00:03:48.760> rifle<00:03:49.209> that<00:03:49.360> tip

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
want to use a pulse rifle that tip

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.710 
want to use a pulse rifle that tip
really<00:03:50.080> does<00:03:50.290> help<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.850> you<00:03:52.030> it'll<00:03:52.540> take<00:03:52.570> a

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
really does help and you it'll take a

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.180 
really does help and you it'll take a
little<00:03:52.900> bit<00:03:52.989> getting<00:03:53.320> these<00:03:53.500> two<00:03:53.769> but<00:03:54.070> once

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
little bit getting these two but once

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.350 
little bit getting these two but once
you<00:03:54.280> get<00:03:54.370> used<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:54.730> you'll<00:03:54.910> find<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.269> it

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
you get used to it you'll find that it

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.030 
you get used to it you'll find that it
definitely<00:03:55.450> helps<00:03:55.840> your<00:03:56.049> long-range<00:03:56.260> shots<00:03:56.769> I

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
definitely helps your long-range shots I

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.590 
definitely helps your long-range shots I
found<00:03:57.489> that<00:03:57.640> out<00:03:57.760> when<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.090> was<00:03:58.180> trying<00:03:58.420> to

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
found that out when I was trying to

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.600 
found that out when I was trying to
shoot<00:03:58.750> an<00:03:58.870> enemy<00:03:59.170> from<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.380> distance<00:03:59.830> be<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.310> long

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
shoot an enemy from a distance be a long

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.509 
shoot an enemy from a distance be a long
way<00:04:00.850> on<00:04:00.880> moon<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:02.140> could<00:04:02.860> I<00:04:02.890> could<00:04:03.070> get<00:04:03.370> like

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
way on moon and I could I could get like

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.490 
way on moon and I could I could get like
one<00:04:03.790> balloon<00:04:04.150> on<00:04:04.360> time<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:04.780> on<00:04:05.019> him<00:04:05.260> at<00:04:05.380> a<00:04:05.410> time

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
one balloon on time and on him at a time

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.530 
one balloon on time and on him at a time
and<00:04:05.860> it<00:04:05.950> was<00:04:06.040> just<00:04:06.130> like<00:04:06.190> what<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.670> hell<00:04:07.269> this

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
and it was just like what the hell this

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.840 
and it was just like what the hell this
guns<00:04:07.780> awful<00:04:08.410> once<00:04:08.890> I<00:04:08.980> tried<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.250> trick<00:04:09.489> out<00:04:09.700> I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
guns awful once I tried that trick out I

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.310 
guns awful once I tried that trick out I
was<00:04:10.150> actually<00:04:10.299> able<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.660> start<00:04:10.870> getting<00:04:10.989> some

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
was actually able to start getting some

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.340 
was actually able to start getting some
decent<00:04:11.739> long<00:04:11.829> distance

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
decent long distance

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.590 
decent long distance
but<00:04:12.890> it's<00:04:13.010> a<00:04:13.040> lot<00:04:13.310> more<00:04:13.370> work<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.940> do<00:04:14.120> that<00:04:14.360> and

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
but it's a lot more work to do that and

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.690 
but it's a lot more work to do that and
it<00:04:14.990> kills<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.290> lot<00:04:15.320> slower<00:04:15.650> than<00:04:16.130> if<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.459> had<00:04:16.490> a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
it kills a lot slower than if you had a

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.490 
it kills a lot slower than if you had a
scout<00:04:16.940> rifle<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.450> still<00:04:17.780> full<00:04:18.050> breakfast<00:04:18.410> and

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
scout rifle so still full breakfast and

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.979 
scout rifle so still full breakfast and
replacing<00:04:18.890> game<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.340> another<00:04:19.880> trick<00:04:20.270> is<00:04:20.450> this

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
replacing game and another trick is this

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.730 
replacing game and another trick is this
gun<00:04:21.230> is<00:04:21.440> full<00:04:22.130> auto<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.730> I<00:04:23.600> found<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.470> I

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
gun is full auto and I found that I

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.590 
gun is full auto and I found that I
think<00:04:25.010> this<00:04:25.100> is<00:04:25.160> on<00:04:25.340> purpose<00:04:25.490> if<00:04:25.970> it's<00:04:26.390> not

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
think this is on purpose if it's not

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.500 
think this is on purpose if it's not
then<00:04:26.990> funds<00:04:27.560> you<00:04:27.710> get<00:04:27.860> on<00:04:28.010> it<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:29.300> gun<00:04:29.480> is

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
then funds you get on it this gun is

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.770 
then funds you get on it this gun is
full<00:04:29.960> auto<00:04:30.170> so<00:04:30.830> if<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.640> depending<00:04:32.330> on<00:04:32.330> how<00:04:32.570> far

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
full auto so if you depending on how far

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.510 
full auto so if you depending on how far
you<00:04:32.960> hold<00:04:33.200> down<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.500> trigger<00:04:33.770> is<00:04:34.010> how<00:04:34.280> many

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
you hold down the trigger is how many

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.250 
you hold down the trigger is how many
births<00:04:34.820> it'll<00:04:35.180> shoot<00:04:35.390> so<00:04:35.810> if<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:35.990> hold<00:04:36.140> it

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
births it'll shoot so if you hold it

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.470 
births it'll shoot so if you hold it
down<00:04:36.380> most<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.160> way<00:04:37.310> it'll<00:04:38.030> just<00:04:38.270> shoot

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
down most of the way it'll just shoot

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.640 
down most of the way it'll just shoot
for<00:04:38.630> burst<00:04:39.050> even<00:04:39.320> though<00:04:39.410> this<00:04:39.470> gun<00:04:39.620> has

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
for burst even though this gun has

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.790 
for burst even though this gun has
fibers<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.720> if<00:04:41.720> you<00:04:42.080> hold<00:04:42.290> it<00:04:42.380> down<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.680> got

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
fibers and if you hold it down you got

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.410 
fibers and if you hold it down you got
to<00:04:42.830> mash<00:04:43.070> it<00:04:43.250> down<00:04:43.280> all<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.670> way<00:04:43.820> it'll<00:04:44.150> shoot

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
to mash it down all the way it'll shoot

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.410 
to mash it down all the way it'll shoot
all<00:04:44.660> five<00:04:44.930> first<00:04:45.250> which<00:04:46.250> is<00:04:46.700> interesting<00:04:47.240> so

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
all five first which is interesting so

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.150 
all five first which is interesting so
if<00:04:47.480> you<00:04:47.570> just<00:04:47.690> press<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:47.930> just<00:04:48.170> a<00:04:48.260> little<00:04:48.290> or

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
if you just press it just a little or

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.190 
if you just press it just a little or
just<00:04:49.220> a<00:04:49.580> little<00:04:49.910> more<00:04:50.060> than<00:04:50.090> a<00:04:50.270> little<00:04:50.600> then

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
just a little more than a little then

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.590 
just a little more than a little then
it'll<00:04:51.530> do<00:04:51.710> two<00:04:52.100> bursts<00:04:52.550> which<00:04:52.940> is<00:04:53.120> which<00:04:53.360> can

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
it'll do two bursts which is which can

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.200 
it'll do two bursts which is which can
suck<00:04:54.050> because<00:04:54.950> I<00:04:55.010> you<00:04:55.490> know<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.640> really<00:04:56.000> have

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
suck because I you know you really have

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.790 
suck because I you know you really have
to<00:04:56.330> mash<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.810> trigger<00:04:57.050> down<00:04:57.290> that's<00:04:57.560> not<00:04:57.680> what

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
to mash the trigger down that's not what

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.500 
to mash the trigger down that's not what
I<00:04:57.830> want<00:04:58.040> to<00:04:58.100> do<00:04:58.220> every<00:04:58.490> time<00:04:58.700> you<00:04:58.910> know<00:04:59.120> auto

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
I want to do every time you know auto

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.300 
I want to do every time you know auto
rifle<00:04:59.930> I<00:05:00.020> could<00:05:00.200> just<00:05:00.350> press<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:00.890> down<00:05:01.010> just<00:05:01.220> a

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
rifle I could just press it down just a

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.430 
rifle I could just press it down just a
little<00:05:01.430> bit<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.730> I'll<00:05:01.820> fire<00:05:02.030> everything<00:05:02.540> give

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
little bit and I'll fire everything give

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.520 
little bit and I'll fire everything give
them<00:05:03.560> everything<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:03.920> got<00:05:04.070> so<00:05:05.380> yeah<00:05:06.380> that's

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
them everything I got so yeah that's

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.110 
them everything I got so yeah that's
another<00:05:06.950> thing<00:05:07.070> that<00:05:07.310> you<00:05:07.340> can<00:05:07.430> do<00:05:07.670> with<00:05:07.700> it<00:05:08.000> as

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
another thing that you can do with it as

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.860 
another thing that you can do with it as
for<00:05:08.990> bad<00:05:09.320> juju<00:05:09.770> itself<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.970> upgrades<00:05:11.570> I

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
for bad juju itself the upgrades I

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.000 
for bad juju itself the upgrades I
haven't<00:05:12.200> gotten<00:05:12.350> many<00:05:12.500> of<00:05:12.680> them<00:05:12.770> yet<00:05:12.890> because

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
haven't gotten many of them yet because

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.100 
haven't gotten many of them yet because
it<00:05:13.280> takes<00:05:13.430> forever<00:05:13.730> to<00:05:14.000> level<00:05:14.360> up<00:05:14.450> exotic<00:05:14.900> guns

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
it takes forever to level up exotic guns

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.620 
it takes forever to level up exotic guns
but<00:05:15.830> one<00:05:16.190> thing<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.670> I<00:05:16.700> could<00:05:16.910> see<00:05:17.120> making

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
but one thing that I could see making

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.670 
but one thing that I could see making
this<00:05:17.750> gone<00:05:17.990> somewhat<00:05:18.920> more<00:05:19.190> viable<00:05:19.580> is<00:05:20.680> after

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
this gone somewhat more viable is after

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.790 
this gone somewhat more viable is after
a<00:05:21.710> kill<00:05:22.070> this<00:05:22.610> gun<00:05:22.880> gets<00:05:23.210> an<00:05:23.840> instant<00:05:24.470> reload

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
a kill this gun gets an instant reload

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.920 
a kill this gun gets an instant reload
time<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:25.340> more<00:05:25.730> damage<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.300> that's<00:05:26.720> one<00:05:26.900> of

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
time and more damage and that's one of

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.540 
time and more damage and that's one of
the<00:05:27.050> big<00:05:27.230> downfalls<00:05:27.740> with<00:05:27.950> this<00:05:28.130> thing<00:05:28.370> as

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
the big downfalls with this thing as

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.820 
the big downfalls with this thing as
well<00:05:28.760> is<00:05:29.060> that<00:05:29.390> it<00:05:29.900> has<00:05:30.020> such<00:05:30.230> a<00:05:30.260> small<00:05:30.560> clip

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
well is that it has such a small clip

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.550 
well is that it has such a small clip
size<00:05:31.100> like<00:05:31.640> it<00:05:31.880> takes<00:05:32.150> if<00:05:32.420> you<00:05:32.870> land<00:05:33.170> every

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
size like it takes if you land every

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.070 
size like it takes if you land every
bullet<00:05:33.920> and<00:05:34.820> you<00:05:34.850> only<00:05:35.300> get<00:05:35.510> a<00:05:35.540> few<00:05:35.840> head<00:05:36.050> shots

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
bullet and you only get a few head shots

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.920 
bullet and you only get a few head shots
it<00:05:36.530> takes<00:05:36.770> at<00:05:36.950> least<00:05:37.030> four<00:05:38.030> bursts<00:05:38.570> to<00:05:38.690> kill

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
it takes at least four bursts to kill

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.050 
it takes at least four bursts to kill
them<00:05:39.140> and<00:05:39.320> if<00:05:39.740> you<00:05:39.860> miss<00:05:40.040> a<00:05:40.070> just<00:05:40.430> a<00:05:40.550> little<00:05:40.910> bit

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
them and if you miss a just a little bit

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.610 
them and if you miss a just a little bit
it<00:05:41.450> takes<00:05:41.660> all<00:05:41.810> five<00:05:42.050> burst<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:42.530> you're

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
it takes all five burst and you're

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.780 
it takes all five burst and you're
probably<00:05:42.710> not<00:05:42.950> even<00:05:42.980> kill<00:05:43.340> with<00:05:43.490> that<00:05:43.520> you

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
probably not even kill with that you

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.370 
probably not even kill with that you
have<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:44.060> reload<00:05:44.420> so<00:05:44.690> that<00:05:44.900> would<00:05:45.080> definitely

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
have to reload so that would definitely

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.590 
have to reload so that would definitely
help<00:05:45.740> with<00:05:46.210> reloading<00:05:47.210> if<00:05:47.300> you're<00:05:47.420> really

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
help with reloading if you're really

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.910 
help with reloading if you're really
accurate<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.110> you<00:05:48.170> can<00:05:48.290> get<00:05:48.380> to<00:05:48.500> kill<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:48.860> you

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
accurate and you can get to kill and you

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.070 
accurate and you can get to kill and you
can<00:05:49.100> just<00:05:49.250> keep<00:05:49.460> wailing<00:05:50.030> on<00:05:50.150> people<00:05:50.510> and<00:05:50.630> the

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
can just keep wailing on people and the

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.750 
can just keep wailing on people and the
increase<00:05:51.350> damage<00:05:51.560> will<00:05:51.830> be<00:05:51.920> helpful<00:05:52.190> too<00:05:52.520> so

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
increase damage will be helpful too so

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.820 
increase damage will be helpful too so
that<00:05:53.000> might<00:05:53.240> make<00:05:53.480> this<00:05:53.660> gun<00:05:53.960> balance<00:05:54.590> but<00:05:54.800> I

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
that might make this gun balance but I

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.490 
that might make this gun balance but I
gotta<00:05:55.100> grind<00:05:55.520> this<00:05:55.820> thing<00:05:56.090> so<00:05:56.780> i'll<00:05:57.020> grind<00:05:57.230> it

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
gotta grind this thing so i'll grind it

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.780 
gotta grind this thing so i'll grind it
it'll<00:05:57.830> probably<00:05:57.980> take<00:05:58.160> me<00:05:58.220> about<00:05:58.460> a<00:05:58.520> week<00:05:58.580> to

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
it'll probably take me about a week to

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.850 
it'll probably take me about a week to
get<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.270> that<00:05:59.390> point<00:05:59.630> it<00:05:59.960> took<00:06:00.170> me<00:06:00.350> that<00:06:00.800> long

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
get to that point it took me that long

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.460 
get to that point it took me that long
to<00:06:01.370> get<00:06:01.700> there<00:06:01.850> with<00:06:02.000> my<00:06:02.150> exotic<00:06:02.480> handgun<00:06:03.200> to

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
to get there with my exotic handgun to

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.710 
to get there with my exotic handgun to
get<00:06:03.590> you<00:06:03.740> the<00:06:03.800> same<00:06:04.010> point<00:06:04.340> and<00:06:04.520> upgrades<00:06:05.090> so

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
get you the same point and upgrades so

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.630 
get you the same point and upgrades so
probably<00:06:05.960> take<00:06:06.110> that<00:06:06.290> long<00:06:06.470> i'll<00:06:07.010> get<00:06:07.280> back<00:06:07.460> to

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
probably take that long i'll get back to

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.820 
probably take that long i'll get back to
you<00:06:07.700> guys<00:06:07.820> let<00:06:08.150> you<00:06:08.270> know<00:06:08.390> how<00:06:08.690> it<00:06:08.720> is<00:06:08.870> if<00:06:09.620> it's

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
you guys let you know how it is if it's

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.920 
you guys let you know how it is if it's
balanced<00:06:10.370> and<00:06:10.580> if<00:06:10.790> maybe<00:06:11.060> i<00:06:11.180> was<00:06:11.390> wrong<00:06:11.420> and

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
balanced and if maybe i was wrong and

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.350 
balanced and if maybe i was wrong and
it's<00:06:12.710> just<00:06:12.950> I<00:06:13.130> needed<00:06:13.490> to<00:06:13.580> grind<00:06:13.880> the<00:06:14.000> upgrade

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
it's just I needed to grind the upgrade

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.960 
it's just I needed to grind the upgrade
before<00:06:14.810> this<00:06:14.990> gun<00:06:15.230> was<00:06:15.530> actually<00:06:15.980> balanced<00:06:16.400> so

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
before this gun was actually balanced so

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.540 
before this gun was actually balanced so
that's<00:06:17.780> it<00:06:17.930> for<00:06:17.960> this<00:06:18.140> gun<00:06:18.350> guys

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
that's it for this gun guys

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.210 
that's it for this gun guys
looks<00:06:19.700> fat<00:06:20.270> ass<00:06:20.870> and<00:06:21.620> I'm<00:06:21.740> gonna<00:06:21.860> probably

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
looks fat ass and I'm gonna probably

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.950 
looks fat ass and I'm gonna probably
still<00:06:22.490> use<00:06:22.670> it<00:06:22.700> even<00:06:22.970> though<00:06:23.150> it<00:06:23.270> sucks<00:06:23.540> so

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
still use it even though it sucks so

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:37.129 
still use it even though it sucks so
hope<00:06:24.470> you<00:06:24.500> guys<00:06:24.680> enjoyed<00:06:25.070> and<00:06:25.370> thanks<00:06:26.060> a<00:06:26.090> lot
