00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
mounted and then again I like how I can

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.650 
mounted and then again I like how I can
just<00:06:58.680> kind<00:06:58.890> of<00:06:58.920> change<00:06:59.280> positions<00:06:59.880> I<00:07:00.150> need<00:07:00.390> to

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
just kind of change positions I need to

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.410 
just kind of change positions I need to
it<00:07:01.320> sticks<00:07:01.740> and<00:07:02.040> pretty<00:07:02.940> much<00:07:03.060> any<00:07:03.240> position

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.420 
it sticks and pretty much any position

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.930 
it sticks and pretty much any position
just<00:07:03.990> like<00:07:04.050> velcro<00:07:04.520> there<00:07:05.520> would<00:07:05.670> be<00:07:05.700> up

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
just like velcro there would be up

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.990 
just like velcro there would be up
higher<00:07:06.300> for<00:07:06.600> one<00:07:06.780> I<00:07:07.020> guess<00:07:07.800> show<00:07:08.040> more<00:07:08.340> sky<00:07:08.700> and

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.050 
higher for one I guess show more sky and
less<00:07:09.180> ground<00:07:11.540> alright<00:07:12.540> peace<00:07:12.870> out
