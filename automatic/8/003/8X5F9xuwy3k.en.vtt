important moment in time the connected

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.410 
important moment in time the connected
car<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.689> not<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.170> scenario<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.789> our<00:00:24.029> reality

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.580 

there's<00:00:27.420> no<00:00:27.599> doubt<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.380> happening

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
there's no doubt that this is happening

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
there's no doubt that this is happening
the<00:00:29.160> question<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.760> how<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.390> gonna<00:00:30.510> get

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the question is how are we gonna get

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and the people in the vehicle and it'll

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.969 
and the people in the vehicle and it'll
be<00:01:10.440> cleaner<00:01:11.540> in<00:01:12.540> about<00:01:13.200> ten<00:01:13.470> years<00:01:13.710> from<00:01:13.890> now

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

my own kids are going to get their first
driver's<00:01:16.680> licenses<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.910> it's<00:01:18.060> pretty

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
driver's licenses and it's pretty

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.440 
driver's licenses and it's pretty
conceivable<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.770> would<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.160> a<00:01:20.250> time<00:01:20.490> cars

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
conceivable that would be in a time cars

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.320 
conceivable that would be in a time cars
don't<00:01:22.200> crash<00:01:22.470> into<00:01:22.800> each<00:01:22.830> other<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.300> a
