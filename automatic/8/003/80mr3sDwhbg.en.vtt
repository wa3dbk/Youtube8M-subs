let<00:01:52.649> me<00:01:52.829> hit<00:01:52.979> my<00:01:53.159> boy<00:01:53.399> toys<00:01:53.820> Smith<00:01:54.180> deep<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
let me hit my boy toys Smith deep with a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.080 
let me hit my boy toys Smith deep with a
ba<00:01:56.299> deep<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> pic<00:01:58.399> deep<00:01:59.399> with<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> pic<00:01:59.939> i

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
ba deep with a pic deep with a pic i

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.429

guess<00:02:00.299> these<00:02:00.479> dealers<00:02:00.899> were<00:02:00.990> feeling<00:02:01.290> some

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
guess these dealers were feeling some

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
guess these dealers were feeling some
type<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.680> way<00:02:01.829> since<00:02:02.159> they<00:02:02.280> were<00:02:02.399> playing<00:02:02.640> us

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
type of way since they were playing us

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.899 
type of way since they were playing us
so<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> score<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.530> 7-7<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.820> a

messed<00:04:23.849> up<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.870> sack<00:04:25.169> right<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.590> he

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
messed up that that sack right that he

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.110 
messed up that that sack right that he
would<00:04:25.800> have<00:04:25.889> broke<00:04:26.039> that<00:04:26.220> one<00:04:26.370> too<00:04:26.550> but<00:04:26.760> anyway

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
would have broke that one too but anyway

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.719 
would have broke that one too but anyway
Torrey<00:04:27.659> Smith<00:04:28.110> broke<00:04:28.530> these<00:04:28.800> two<00:04:29.130> defenders

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
Torrey Smith broke these two defenders

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.360 
Torrey Smith broke these two defenders
and<00:04:30.020> he<00:04:31.020> went<00:04:31.260> on<00:04:31.440> his<00:04:31.470> way<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:32.010> end<00:04:32.280> zone

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
and he went on his way to the end zone

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.250 
and he went on his way to the end zone
so<00:04:32.820> usually<00:04:33.000> I<00:04:33.210> say<00:04:33.449> it<00:04:33.570> ain't<00:04:33.720> over<00:04:33.930> till<00:04:33.960> it's

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
so usually I say it ain't over till it's

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.670 
so usually I say it ain't over till it's
over<00:04:34.409> but<00:04:34.740> now<00:04:35.210> yeah<00:04:36.210> this<00:04:36.810> thing's<00:04:37.229> about

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
over it's gonna take a miracle of a

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.370 
over it's gonna take a miracle of a
catch<00:04:41.659> for<00:04:42.659> him<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:42.930> make<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.110> comeback<00:04:43.470> I<00:04:45.380> had

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
catch for him to make a comeback I had

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.930 
catch for him to make a comeback I had
to<00:04:46.500> get<00:04:46.620> on<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.770> safety<00:04:47.159> after<00:04:47.280> that<00:04:47.550> catch<00:04:47.789> I

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
to get on a safety after that catch I

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.610 
to get on a safety after that catch I
say<00:04:48.120> nine<00:04:48.360> letting<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:48.840> happen<00:04:49.020> again<00:04:49.440> but

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
say nine letting that happen again but

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.019 
say nine letting that happen again but
then<00:04:49.770> he<00:04:49.919> sent<00:04:50.130> his<00:04:50.219> receiver<00:04:50.550> to<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.729> middle

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:51.029 
then he sent his receiver to the middle

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.390 
then he sent his receiver to the middle
of<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.180> field<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:51.750> then<00:04:52.469> right<00:04:52.680> here

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
of the field and then right here

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.060 
of the field and then right here
say<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.810> my<00:04:54.810> user<00:04:55.110> game<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.620> strong<00:04:55.889> but
