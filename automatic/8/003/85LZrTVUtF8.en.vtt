00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.330
 we are starting tonight on the a28 with him serious accident at the height of the buttocks 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.689
 4 trucks will ride together around two o'clock this afternoon 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:09.580
 a driver 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.639
 were injured and a kilometer-long traffic jam arises the entire afternoon 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.650
 gestures and several lanes closed 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.920
 ardy tuning thing that now stands on a cyclist bridge over the a28 close by 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.920
 it actually went wrong how is there and now eyi 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.189
 he is really at the point where it goes wrong down here is there 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 he crashed unharmed 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.030
 and yes they are mainly busy with cleaning up a whole line here 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.210
 with trucks and on those proposals when I just arrived for example 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.090
 trucker lifted value if you have been in an injured driver 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.319
 completely put together 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.569
 and then you also really see that the havoc has been it now takes what the af de 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:47.269
 busy here 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.269
 but a few hours ago it was wrong here 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.890
 the havoc is enormous, the trucks are scattered and stand over a width of 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.250
 two days off 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.930
 the rear car is so surprising that the fire brigade is unable to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.080
 get the driver out of the cab 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.870
 Leon van Dam sees the truck behind it 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.780
 he worked out just in time for the emergency lane 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.160
 according to him it is an accident 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.020
 cause by a place that has landed on the highway you also see a man on 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020
 Merkel Ger walked the highway 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 good 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.590
 the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.220
 also the league 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.270
 the police confirm the story 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.039
 the suspected is therefore a place on the road 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.479
 Located there are the numbers of cars for the front truck stops 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.649
 also stop in time but then he is at the rear by two 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.200
 other truck they hit and the driver of the rear truck 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.899
 it has been trapped thereby the driver has been stuck for a long time but is 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:50.850
 approachable 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.280
 A medical trauma helicopter also arrives in the afternoon 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.200
 assistance 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.140
 the accident caused major traffic jams 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.710
 motorists stand still over a length of 9 kilometers 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.390
 traffic towards utrecht will be redirected at the Hoevelaken junction 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.080
 after the expectation 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.249
 what own work 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.339
 about half an hour ago would have been solved here 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.279
 but already the last message 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.499
 it takes another half an hour so expect to put it around half past six 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.069
 must be solved here 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.600
 yes we are you it is of course an injured driver has long been clear 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.169
 which seated 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.269
 this is a completely different pinched two hour accident so about one 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.109
 half past four released 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.239
 the last message is that it was taken to the hospital but how 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.109
 it exactly with a first there will have to wait a little while maybe later 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.229
 tonight or tomorrow more messages about yes the hordes a later more of one 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.330
 couple who thank you so far came back last week because we have 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.460
 to get another news about the highway again about the speed limit 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.920
 this seems to be getting lower 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.099
 yes in many places and you are not allowed to drive no more than 120 kilometers per hour at most 100 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.769
 but in more and more places in our region there are signs on the motorways 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.859
 with 90 and up 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.939
 but if your speed applies at least when it rains, mine is a wet one 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.939
 road surface arjen that are also there you are already 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.899
 afterwards that side had happened the accident is not tender turn a28 a28 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:16.259
 so away from utrecht 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:20.069
 after the amersfoort you really only have to drive a few hundred meters or you will arrive 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.469
 they are already against and that is certainly not the only place 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:28.260
 the attention and 20 every few hundred meters that the motorist must 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:29.209
 let it run 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.909
 those deployed after the annual Rijkswaterstaat inspection from this annual 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.979
 check has come that 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:42.769
 respond we give a removal due to the harsh winter 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.249
 many roads exist that is not the reason that those signs are placed 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:51.909
 this has nothing to do with the winter weather with the decline of the school 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.809
 fact she has to deal with the traffic on the road he has 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.659
 In the era of government banking the combination with the summer break or indeed ensures 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.709
 sure that the municipality of zwijndrecht became wise and that means suffered by one 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.999
 wet road surface 90 km per hour are now in many places 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.019
 first on the assets or 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.909
 and also on multiple routes on the a2 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:23.869
 a27 m 28 The question is of course whether people will also keep to the speed 

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:28.879
 but almost ninety people, according to Rijkswaterstaat, do better 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.650
 risk becomes greater the moment the road became wet 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.150
 you then need an emergency stop 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.530
 can make the tires less grip and then I will be done with it 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:42.979
 nineties so far a few hours is actually checked for it 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.990
 that we can also get fines 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.550
 he wants he has time to say that I also feel when I first left 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.290
 a bit lower in a raid there are really fit 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.580
 I have released that presented to the police who says I think it is very 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.860
 difficult to estimate what is after wet road is that a drop according to 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.330
 centimeters of water 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.979
 I think the flash will not do well but you never know as one 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.039
 encounters a surveillance agent who feels like it and it is just one 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.349
 fine on the pants 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.959
 and perhaps even more important when think and that we can be safe for days 

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:14.229
 drive until the end of being repaired 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.180
 but that 20 upcoming work is planned here for September then 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.180
 they just take it here it goes here and now 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.180
 and the other documents have been promised by Rijkswaterstaat for his 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.120
 have to work there 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.479
 resolved 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:28.580
 thank you 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.360
 and I have by the way 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.249
 3 I just saw 8 more 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.099
 he just fell off 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.459
 hungary per hour lee
