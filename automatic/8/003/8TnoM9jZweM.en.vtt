00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.360
 hey people in my last tutorial got 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.010
 I taught you the lazy board 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.480
 if you have not seen it yet 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.969
 check out the video here 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.119
 that is the basis for the volt 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.350
 which I will show today gives first 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.180
 all the things that I showed there 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.800
 so far you have the perfect mood then you can 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.730
 you with the exercise leader do that to me 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.990
 Show you today to the dashboard just like 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.240
 At the laser board, you also have to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.830
 dashboard with one leg jumping off her 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.450
 then pulls the other leg but not 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.440
 up to the side but just pull it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.350
 Forward 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.969
 s.besten first with angled 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.770
 legs so pull the knee forward 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.899
 otherwise you can easily with the foot 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.370
 the wall got stuck then stretched 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.329
 feet straight forward and out 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.329
 push yourself out to the front 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.610
 for the first time in the 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.410
 getting in the way of movement is only possible 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.769
 a few times the lacie borssum last 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.059
 have shown and tries it 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.730
 Just look at the obstacle 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.620
 to run and the movement as possible 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.540
 to make frontal so always look 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.930
 nice to keep forward and not so 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.340
 very much to go in over the page 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.530
 by being on the dashboard with the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.850
 feet jump forwards it's real 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.890
 important that you are far enough from 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.960
 obstacle away does not jump 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.979
 be close to it if it skips otherwise 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.570
 It's easy for you to do that 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.190
 hang with your feet then you come 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.080
 not really over the worst 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.640
 the dashboard is the fear of it on 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.679
 obstacle to stay so with the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.530
 feet ahead to jump forward and 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.940
 then, most of the time, it is usually easy to imagine 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.140
 If you are afraid at the beginning, that's all 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.330
 to miss with your hands 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.679
 so take first some possible 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.960
 wide wall or a wider one 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.610
 Obstacle if your mats are available 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.350
 have you make heaps and 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.729
 he jumps only times ahead with their feet 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.649
 on it so that you with the march on it 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.990
 lands i have no flaws here now 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.670
 to show most of you will be 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.130
 So I have no mats 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.810
 you right on the wall 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.860
 that did not attract any problem learning it 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.239
 I'll show you a few steps now 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.959
 how you can learn that about the fear 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:58.940
 overcome 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.379
 As I said first time wanted the lacie 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.520
 make a few times and try as possible 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:04.069
 to be there 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.690
 push out the laser bolt is the 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.340
 Same motion as the dashboard 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.500
 expressing the difference is just that 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.510
 We will therefore one which with their feet by 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.250
 front is purely about the fear of it 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.450
 overcome head-on with your feet 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.610
 jump on the wall in front 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.620
 or over the wall I show 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.849
 first of all a few exercises the first 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.239
 is that you just on the wall 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.390
 out of the step out a foot 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:32.640
 pulls up 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:34.680
 accurate leap so if you do now 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.209
 without problems and no problems 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.040
 fear more frontal on the 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.390
 wall to jump and on the construction too 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.220
 land and also with the step sequence 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.590
 Everything is clear and the right distance 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.970
 have found to wall so that we are beautiful 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.250
 could jump on the wall as the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.540
 to stay afraid of the feet but so 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.270
 that they are also possible close 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.739
 so that you do not have to jump too hard 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.020
 then try the same again now 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.010
 but try with hands next to euro 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:10.050
 to land on the wall too 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:11.910
 at the same time as when the now even without 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.950
 problems works you try right after 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.080
 landing the weight on your hands 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.000
 to shift and feet forward 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.680
 pick and express 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.250
 just like you guys soon 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.250
 have shown 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.600
 The move is likely to start 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.250
 first mentioned as weird for you 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.840
 you have a climate that feels like you 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.480
 missed the obstacle for the hands 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.560
 if you see yourself you will have it 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.180
 that's why the exercise is quite good that she 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.560
 first safely lands with his feet 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.720
 then put your hands on data 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.000
 if you have a safe one now 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.040
 Feeling then tried the whole time 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.510
 so we only land with one foot 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.860
 pushes you out of the hands directly 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.860
 I'll show you once 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.060
 I have the leg with me now 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.969
 abspringe 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.739
 pulled straight forward and only 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.030
 the other leg pulled forward 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.859
 has when jumping on the moor 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.480
 put on this I start 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.790
 little bit off what it takes me 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.590
 makes the obstacle easier with the 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.389
 to meet hands and so is the timing 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.009
 First of all, it's easier for everyone to succeed 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.930
 case that hands on the inside too 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.389
 place it because it's right next to it 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.560
 could place the foot and have now 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.130
 my fear that another too 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.680
 miss 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.810
 That's why there 's so much time until now 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.830
 you're really sure about that since where 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.330
 you have to place your hands on us 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.979
 have a good time and that a few 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.229
 you did the whole thing 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.620
 now try without the foot 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.620
 sit up 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:50.789
 if you have done that now too 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.799
 can you already in dashboards 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.509
 There are a few more subtleties now 

00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:56.189
 like her the dashboard in any case 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.719
 can improve and we with the 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:59.999
 Dashboard gets on and on 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.499
 comes after the obstacle so that's her 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.389
 use obstacle can ye then 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:07.529
 to push it out properly and for so long 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.309
 The position is important 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.869
 the hip 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:12.389
 you have to bring her up beautiful 

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:13.409
 and you have to be as flat as possible over that 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.539
 obstacle remain 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.039
 to which also the possibility you have 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.659
 To get the hands out again 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.699
 to press over would be too high 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.769
 Obstacle time from the top up fight 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.869
 with the hands is the burden for the 

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:26.039
 arms very strong and you can not do more 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:28.679
 really put pressure on it 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.199
 to express that it is important that you 

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:33.269
 with the swing from below he upwards 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.909
 goes like that you just do it again with 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:37.379
 the hands can push you out if 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.559
 her from above already down clearance if 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:42.419
 you have to remember that then 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:43.709
 we just intercept points and can 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.799
 no longer you press really out 

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:50.179
 So I as flat as possible from the beginning 

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:50.179
 to stay above the obstacle 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.810
 I hope the video already pleases me 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.010
 could help you with that , if so 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.350
 Thumbs me up 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.600
 if you want to see more tutorials 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.190
 write me the comments to which 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.440
 tricks the tutorials should do 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.300
 then I will look at which 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.220
 tricks most often called then 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.139
 I 'll turn that first and 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.520
 values then upload soon if you 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.870
 Subscribe to a channel you can see 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.610
 immediately when they are uploaded 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.650
 videos so if you do not have it yet 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.060
 have subscribed to the channel it 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.380
 free for you and then get 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.230
 always the information immediately when I return 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.850
 otherwise has uploaded a new trick 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.419
 have fun exercising and we are 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.419
 next time
