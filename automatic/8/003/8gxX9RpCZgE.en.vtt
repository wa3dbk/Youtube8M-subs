00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
that l-shaped nuke you're gonna see me I

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.000 
that l-shaped nuke you're gonna see me I
guess<00:02:22.150> that's<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.599> gas<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.440> we<00:02:23.590> just<00:02:23.830> shot

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
guess that's the gas that we just shot

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.360 
guess that's the gas that we just shot
at<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.849> want<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.120> run<00:02:25.360> forward<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.860> path

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
at you want to run forward and that path

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.160 
at you want to run forward and that path
that<00:02:27.400> hooks<00:02:27.849> around<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.450> goes<00:02:28.540> into<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.900> half

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
that hooks around it goes into a half

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.830 
that hooks around it goes into a half
circle<00:02:29.430> there's<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.790> be<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.940> GPS<00:02:31.540> on<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
circle there's going to be a GPS on the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.960 
circle there's going to be a GPS on the
left-hand<00:02:32.349> side<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.519> bunch<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.849> dudes

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
left-hand side and a bunch of dudes

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.089 
left-hand side and a bunch of dudes
crying<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:36.390> right<00:02:37.390> after<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:37.989> GPS<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.920> want

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
crying and right after that GPS you want

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.860 
crying and right after that GPS you want
to<00:02:39.160> look<00:02:39.430> up<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.030> use<00:02:40.180> your<00:02:40.360> survival

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870
