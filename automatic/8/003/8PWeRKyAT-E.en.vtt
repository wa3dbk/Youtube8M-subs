00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
see the transducer itself is a lot

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.290 
see the transducer itself is a lot
bigger<00:00:08.849> than<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.240> hole<00:00:09.889> and<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.250> won't<00:00:11.460> mount

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
bigger than the hole and it won't mount

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.650 
bigger than the hole and it won't mount
to<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.809> whole<00:00:13.290> bee<00:00:13.410> Lowrance<00:00:13.799> right<00:00:14.040> away<00:00:14.660> so

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
to the whole bee Lowrance right away so

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.000 
to the whole bee Lowrance right away so
he<00:00:15.809> hasn't<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.170> some<00:00:16.410> modifications<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:19.010> do
