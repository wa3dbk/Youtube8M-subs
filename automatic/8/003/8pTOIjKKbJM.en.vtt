the vmc spin shot we've really eliminate
a<00:01:01.649> lot<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.920> those<00:01:02.100> problems<00:01:02.339> so<00:01:03.089> let's<00:01:03.269> take<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
a lot of those problems so let's take a

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.119 
a lot of those problems so let's take a
look<00:01:03.749> at<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.899> thing<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.379> basically<00:01:04.890> what

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
look at this thing and basically what

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.950 
look at this thing and basically what
this<00:01:05.519> deal<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.270> look<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.899> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this deal is if you look at it it's a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.469 
this deal is if you look at it it's a
split<00:01:07.290> shot<00:01:07.500> drop<00:01:07.799> shot<00:01:08.100> style<00:01:08.399> hook<00:01:08.670> but

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
split shot drop shot style hook but

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.999 
split shot drop shot style hook but
we've<00:01:09.630> got<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.290> cool<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:10.740> feature

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
we've got a really cool little feature

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.160 
we've got a really cool little feature
in<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.759> eye<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.149> hook<00:01:12.329> built<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.990> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
in the eye of the hook built into it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.679 
in the eye of the hook built into it
which<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> little<00:01:14.189> swivel<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.820> first<00:01:15.509> of

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
which is a little swivel and first of

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.420 
which is a little swivel and first of
all<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.110> thing<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.469> to<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.680> it's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
all what that thing is going to do it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.760 
all what that thing is going to do it's
going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.670> let<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.820> hook<00:01:18.119> rotate<00:01:18.810> 360

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
going to let that hook rotate 360

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.090 
going to let that hook rotate 360
degrees<00:01:19.950> around<00:01:20.750> that<00:01:21.750> meal<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:22.890> line

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
degrees around that meal and so for line

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.340 
degrees around that meal and so for line
twists<00:01:23.460> no<00:01:24.149> more<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.570> whole<00:01:24.990> rig

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
twists no more of that whole rig

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.319 
twists no more of that whole rig
spinning<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.130> reel<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.119> only

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
spinning as you reel it in the only

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.120 
spinning as you reel it in the only
thing<00:01:27.450> that's<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.780> spin<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.920> hook

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
thing that's going to spin is that hook

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.429 
thing that's going to spin is that hook
no<00:01:29.369> more<00:01:29.579> line<00:01:29.789> twists<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.780> more<00:01:30.960> importantly

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
no more line twists but more importantly

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.440 
no more line twists but more importantly
look<00:01:32.130> how<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.369> thing<00:01:32.729> moves<00:01:32.969> up<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.359> down

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
look how that thing moves up and down

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.590 
look how that thing moves up and down
along<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.289> bond<00:01:34.619> 360<00:01:35.340> degrees<00:01:35.609> and<00:01:35.909> what

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
along with bond 360 degrees and what

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.630 
along with bond 360 degrees and what
that<00:01:36.780> means<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.320> better<00:01:37.649> action<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> bay

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that means is better action to the bay

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420 
that means is better action to the bay
and<00:01:38.850> better<00:01:39.750> hook<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.140> percentage<00:01:40.590> no<00:01:41.159> more

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and better hook up percentage no more

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.029 
and better hook up percentage no more
