split second helicopter in airstrike the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
split second helicopter in airstrike the
goal<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.620> simple<00:00:44.040> when<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.850> many<00:00:45.030> points

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
goal here is simple when as many points

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.119 
goal here is simple when as many points
as<00:00:45.450> possible<00:00:45.510> by<00:00:46.260> avoiding<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.800> missiles

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
as possible by avoiding the missiles

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.160 
as possible by avoiding the missiles
firing<00:00:47.430> down<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:48.989> where

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
firing down on you you can see where

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.720 
firing down on you you can see where
they're<00:00:49.350> targeting<00:00:49.920> before<00:00:50.250> they<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.460> fired

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
they're targeting before they get fired

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.080
