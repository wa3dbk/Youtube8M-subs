reviewing<00:00:10.030> my<00:00:11.030> latest<00:00:11.360> Kirby<00:00:11.809> Lambert

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
reviewing my latest Kirby Lambert

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.249 
reviewing my latest Kirby Lambert
creation<00:00:13.250> and<00:00:13.490> this<00:00:13.849> is<00:00:14.000> an<00:00:14.150> Orion<00:00:14.809> folder

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:15.259 
creation and this is an Orion folder

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.070 
creation and this is an Orion folder
which<00:00:15.710> is<00:00:15.740> very<00:00:16.580> similar<00:00:16.759> to<00:00:16.939> his<00:00:17.270> snap<00:00:17.630> folder

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
which is very similar to his snap folder

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.300 
which is very similar to his snap folder
but<00:00:18.380> without<00:00:18.680> I<00:00:18.740> without<00:00:19.610> a<00:00:19.669> flipper<00:00:19.990> I<00:00:21.310> had

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
but without I without a flipper I had

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.490 
but without I without a flipper I had
Kirby<00:00:22.760> especially<00:00:23.480> make<00:00:23.630> this<00:00:23.779> one<00:00:23.960> for<00:00:24.170> me<00:00:24.350> so

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
Kirby especially make this one for me so

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.570 
Kirby especially make this one for me so
I<00:00:24.529> could<00:00:24.710> pick<00:00:24.830> it<00:00:24.859> up<00:00:24.980> at<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.310> ck<00:00:25.640> g<00:00:25.939> show<00:00:26.210> 2011

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
I could pick it up at the ck g show 2011

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.359 
I could pick it up at the ck g show 2011
so<00:00:28.580> I<00:00:29.410> typically<00:00:30.410> do<00:00:30.590> this<00:00:30.619> every<00:00:30.980> year<00:00:31.160> and

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
so I typically do this every year and

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.880 
so I typically do this every year and
this<00:00:31.519> is<00:00:31.580> the<00:00:31.880> one<00:00:32.029> that<00:00:32.269> I<00:00:32.809> had<00:00:33.440> to<00:00:33.530> make<00:00:33.710> this

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
this is the one that I had to make this

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.640 
this is the one that I had to make this
year<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.780> I'm<00:00:35.780> just<00:00:35.989> going<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:36.230> go<00:00:36.350> through<00:00:36.620> a

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
year and I'm just going to go through a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.700 
year and I'm just going to go through a
few<00:00:36.799> of<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:36.949> features<00:00:37.070> of<00:00:37.309> this<00:00:37.549> knife<00:00:38.710> so

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
few of the features of this knife so

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.219 
few of the features of this knife so
generally<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.519> general<00:00:41.120> materials<00:00:42.049> in<00:00:42.140> the

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:42.229 
generally the general materials in the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.000 
generally the general materials in the
handle<00:00:42.650> include<00:00:43.580> a<00:00:43.960> lightning<00:00:44.960> strike<00:00:45.229> carbon

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
handle include a lightning strike carbon

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.939 
handle include a lightning strike carbon
fiber<00:00:46.190> which<00:00:46.610> is<00:00:46.820> carbon<00:00:47.299> fiber<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:47.720> has

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
fiber which is carbon fiber that has

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.969 
fiber which is carbon fiber that has
copper<00:00:48.949> wiring<00:00:49.690> running<00:00:50.690> through<00:00:50.960> it<00:00:51.080> so<00:00:51.769> that

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
copper wiring running through it so that

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.030 
copper wiring running through it so that
it<00:00:52.549> creates<00:00:52.879> this<00:00:53.030> sort<00:00:53.089> of<00:00:53.330> a<00:00:53.420> pattern<00:00:53.600> here

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
it creates this sort of a pattern here

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.229 
it creates this sort of a pattern here
let's<00:00:55.040> zoom<00:00:55.250> up<00:00:55.400> so<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:55.670> can<00:00:55.820> take<00:00:55.970> a<00:00:56.000> better

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
let's zoom up so you can take a better

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:04.259 
let's zoom up so you can take a better
look<00:00:56.330> at<00:00:56.629> it<00:01:02.049> so<00:01:03.049> there<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:03.260> can<00:01:03.409> see<00:01:03.439> the

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
look at it so there you can see the

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.520 
look at it so there you can see the
lightning<00:01:05.269> strike<00:01:05.570> carbon<00:01:06.020> fiber<00:01:06.229> and

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
lightning strike carbon fiber and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.800 
lightning strike carbon fiber and
there's<00:01:07.070> three<00:01:07.340> tritium<00:01:08.180> dots<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.690> have

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
there's three tritium dots that have

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.940 
there's three tritium dots that have
been<00:01:10.480> inset<00:01:11.480> into<00:01:11.690> here<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.110> Kirby<00:01:12.620> did<00:01:12.770> that

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
been inset into here and Kirby did that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.400 
been inset into here and Kirby did that

g10 on the handle but I I'm still pretty
old<00:01:51.200> school<00:01:51.380> like<00:01:51.740> these<00:01:51.979> titanium<00:01:52.640> bolsters

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
old school like these titanium bolsters

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.780 
old school like these titanium bolsters

ball bearings inset in it and Kirby's

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.529 
ball bearings inset in it and Kirby's
done<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.430> little<00:02:07.580> bit<00:02:07.729> of<00:02:07.790> file<00:02:08.000> working<00:02:08.360> here

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
done a little bit of file working here

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.710 
done a little bit of file working here
and<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:09.739> course<00:02:09.799> that<00:02:10.159> tritium<00:02:10.510> thought<00:02:11.510> that

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
and of course that tritium thought that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.710 
and of course that tritium thought that
I<00:02:12.040> mentioned<00:02:13.040> earlier<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.760> back<00:02:13.940> there

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
I mentioned earlier in the back there

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.290 
I mentioned earlier in the back there
so<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> little<00:02:15.950> bit<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.130> blue<00:02:16.460> anodizing<00:02:17.150> there

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
so a little bit of blue anodizing there

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.660 
so a little bit of blue anodizing there
on<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.570> inside<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.140> file<00:02:18.350> work<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:21.670> elected

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
on the inside of the file work I elected
