00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.010
 radio July 1 in the rules of the road 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.170
 movement introduced a new sign 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.000
 photo information plate 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.469
 video recording of violations actually still 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.450
 surprise but this is not because to 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.850
 photo and video recording of violations we have long been 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.250
 accustomed however to what to do if 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.109
 suddenly a letter of happiness came and dropped in 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.840
 mailbox and happiness with it 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.939
 so you did not come and so we will understand 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.920
 friends well first there are pumpkins to someone 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.080
 handed over the car for use and this one 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.910
 someone in quotes a gentleman committed 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.290
 violation of traffic rules and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.270
 he was caught by the camera video 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.070
 understandably what to answer first 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.020
 queue will not he first 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.730
 you will answer because you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.500
 and the owner of a car 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.270
 because our legislator easier 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.460
 find as property to employees 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.620
 it is easier for the police to find you as the owner 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.539
 cars they are the one who was driving then 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.670
 one day the letter happiness will come exactly in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.410
 your mailbox what to do about it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.270
 it is obvious that if you donâ€™t 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.890
 want to pay a fine you have ten 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.260
 days after receiving this ruling 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.960
 fine on his appeal but just 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.939
 pursed her good and not specifying that well here and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.650
 I was driving a car that day 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.420
 Petrov Ivanov was driving the car 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.700
 or this will be pretty 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.070
 little because it is Petrova or Sidorova 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.020
 will need to pass what we call 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.390
 live for this will need to specify it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.220
 complete data is even better even when submitted 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.439
 complaints lead this live Petrov 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.909
 Ivanov whether cider under the handle in the traffic police let 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.460
 she honestly admits that she is driving 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.080
 It was he who then did not rule out that 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.979
 regarding you ruling fears 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.200
 will be canceled 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.150
 and then the question will be solved 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.729
 whether to punish him a lot of peters or 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.430
 Sidora but once again it is important just like that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.000
 indicate that driving was not me this is not enough 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.649
 need to bring someone who was driving 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.479
 it's important to remember my friends what if 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.540
 violation recorded by camera 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.710
 video recording of violations punish you 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.720
 will not be very harsh 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.310
 notice if you commit 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.060
 violations that do not entail deprivation 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.460
 control rights but there is some kind of plug in 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.040
 fines from 300 say up to 500 rubles you 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.520
 will punish at least 300 rubles but if 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.719
 suddenly this same punishment is still 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.330
 provides for example deprivation of rights 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.090
 control in this case you here in this 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.160
 forks from 300 to 500 will punish to the maximum 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.510
 for as much as 500 rubles and no need 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.780
 run unfortunately this 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.580
 legislation wanting to contend with 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.170
 video cameras in the country are pretty 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.060
 a lot of sex and every driver once 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.340
 received a letter of happiness 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.629
 what is happiness nevertheless on 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.860
 trying to think of something 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.260
 to hang up registration plates 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.180
 rags or fig leaf friends 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.640
 and extremely dangerous occupation because 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.160
 behind the registration plate 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.330
 materials preventing identification 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.000
 this sign punishment 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.830
 down to disenfranchisement 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.140
 not over abuse this another thing 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.329
 if twins drive around the city 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.700
 and you get a letter of happiness with 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.739
 indicating your car number on 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.230
 see that the color of the car doesn't matter and make 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.150
 and actually also not your car in 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.610
 In this case, such craftsmen also have 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.799
 make duplicate hang signs similar to 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.120
 or exactly the same as your signs 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.860
 car naturally with this immediately 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.720
 need to contact the police 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.610
 and not just in traffic police, please cancel 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.870
 fine order i'm not me and hut not 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.209
 my sense of the car is not mine 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.950
 and still rotate vvd with a statement 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.569
 that someone understand perfect she 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.190
 uses your registration marks 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.569
 God forbid tomorrow on this machine 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.250
 commit a crime to you for some reason 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.600
 search for it and find there by the way 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.010
 what exactly do you do if the sign on 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.480
 photo-video fixation on printout in general 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.910
 your registration marks are not visible 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.160
 your car is not your car is not clear 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.810
 it is clear that too go squeezed 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.010
 would be in traffic police note that you have this 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.690
 as much as 10 days and have a view of some 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.630
 traffic police officers install video cameras 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.299
 in the bushes or for example on ambulances 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.130
 NATO assistance in many taxi cars 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.870
 drivers say, well, illegally 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.880
 illegal to pay fine i won't it 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.280
 does not exempt you from paying a fine chase 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.019
 Russia said well, of course incorrectly 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.510
 to install the car on fuel trucks 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.359
 ambulances in cars 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.130
 carrying mousses is incorrect but it is not 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.569
 It means that he has a world machine 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.880
 incorrectly installed then you 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.810
 absolve 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.190
 automatically alas and ah 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.200
 notice my bank friends 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.760
 props there is suddenly a ruling you 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.530
 see the bank details of the recipient 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.480
 no payment 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.510
 budget is not any treasury 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.889
 organization oooh horns and hooves means that 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.350
 recovery sent to crooks on us 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.270
 pay rogue and there were no decide for yourself 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.610
 and my friends very many complain that 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.890
 recovery comes without an indication 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.630
 the date of entry of this ruling into 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.700
 force gives there can not can can 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.830
 only because after receiving 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.500
 rulings fine you have 10 days on 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.240
 appeal if you have not appealed against 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.710
 the tenth day of stepping force and if 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.050
 nobody appealed here at all 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.280
 when force comes therefore no 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.500
 traffic police officer in this ruling 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.340
 just physically can not specify because 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.390
 that he himself does not know 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.950
 the date of entry into force of the judgment 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.540
 can you be considered a debtor if 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.180
 all of a sudden there was no fine order 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.980
 unfortunately until the supreme court said there 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.500
 You have sent a resolution of the fine you 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.120
 he was not received and the postman sent 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.400
 letter happiness back to traffic police 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.290
 for some reason she is considered to have entered for 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.690
 cone in the only joy of it 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.420
 since we had a huge 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.100
 problem in the base of debtors we now have 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.770
 Glory to you, my God, at least temporarily not 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.380
 limit the departure of debtors abroad 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:26.630
 so my friends thank you apparently for 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.630
 borders meet you in the craters
