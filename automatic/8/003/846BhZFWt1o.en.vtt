00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello when preparing the mountain stew in 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.670
 the previous recipe left me half cabbage 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.740
 so I remembered those salads from 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.180
 Cabbage served on some free buses 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.850
 I started doing it 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.800
 first we will cut medium cabbage and ideally 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.750
 would have a mandolin but if not the 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.039
 So you have the first knife 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.859
 six some cuts that are quite thin 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.810
 dump these cuts and return them to 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.810
 cut so there are some thin strips 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.379
 we will cut two small onions or one 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.980
 median in the same way that we have 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.980
 made the cabbage 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.429
 and with carrot, we should also do 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.679
 little sticks and I have made a 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.079
 part like this and the other the grating then 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.510
 for it with a potato peeler gone 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.309
 making very thin strips and then with 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.670
 the knife I finished doing the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.130
 little sticks 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.470
 if you have time and patience then this 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.360
 you can do it with the two carrots and 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.729
 if not then directly the line is 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.840
 it will also be good but the result 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.840
 Well, it's a little different 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.990
 or more 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.590
 rai we will also make an apple 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590
 i 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.420
 in a large bowl we will add the cabbage 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.690
 and the onions 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.690
 and the carrots 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.820
 the grated apple 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.360
 and the juice of a lemon and optionally 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.880
 a spoonful of sugar 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.150
 in a cup we will put about 3 tablespoons 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.150
 mayonnaise 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.649
 between a tablespoon and two mustard 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.830
 and we mix it well and we'll add it to 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.830
 bowl 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.330
 Y 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.319
 now we have to mix well to 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.049
 time that we are compressing it a bit 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.420
 once well mixed we will cover it with 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.060
 transparent film and we'll leave it a 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.069
 night in the fridge 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.680
 and we'll have to take it out of the fridge 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.629
 about 20 or 30 minutes before consuming it 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.040
 I hope you liked the recipe 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.040
 until the next
