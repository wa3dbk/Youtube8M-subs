 the enemies to that baby come out of the bathroom is due to the security guard aside 

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:07.680
 right entering the bathroom using your intercom device 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:09.979
 down the stairs 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.789
 corus to the track 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.829
 he opens the door 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:15.539
 they let them out 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.880
 they see them lose their vehicle 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 and nobody stops them 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.099
 I suppose for fear that I was attacked home be by these people not 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.659
 but 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.879
 I say they are security guards because they do not use it and I understand that this 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.850
 meeting he noticed the situation did the same and warned west to all the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.960
 people so that he was 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.639
 very attentive to that figure the security guards of the bar bar bar armed 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.560
 does not have nothing and how it happened 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.570
 that gun the beards 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.800
 look, I understand that by the media it is a question of 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.879
 small caliber 22 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.820
 If being an expert in the subject, I understand that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 there are weapons with a large solar juggling because they are easy to hide the this 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.500
 between his clothes even though the dark ones so before entering 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.490
 for duck customers at dawn for the safety of children 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.030
 there was no complicity 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.330
 of the bar bar people to allow this to happen inside he urged his 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.150
 aggressor is killed with impunity as we saw it 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.090
 they will say bullfighting terms starting square I can dare to tell you that no 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.410
 in the case that it was / you were 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.630
 percent 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.799
 They will assume their consequences because the company will not tolerate or tolerate 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.630
 factual situation 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.490
 and then, if it was not enough, they clean 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.210
 the scene of the attack 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.250
 and even in trying to induce the experts 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.880
 of the attorney general's office and the paramedics 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.930
 ap cabins live still of course 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.910
 with the bullet in the head to try to see 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.570
 simulate a quarrel 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.290
 no no no no this is not like that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.280
 Immediately the ambulance was called so they lent him the first 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.250
 help in no time this was manipulated this in the scenes 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.250
 in fact we had this year and very up-to-date providing everything 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.500
 what the procuracy deems appropriate to clarify this the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.149
 regrettable events 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:17.819
 he is going to run away the owner 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.970
 moret entity mind museum the owner was very aware truth and very 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.180
 attentions and coast 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.269
 Of course yes 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.100
 In the eyes 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.299
 Of course it is not stopped because it is not there is no need 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.709
 they lived to stop this 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.090
 the most important thing is very attentive to the salute district of saves 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.389
 the issue of permits that has opened the bar bar at half past five 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.339
 of the eu 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:45.279
 Christi were waiting for the diners to leave the few diners who 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.329
 they were 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.869
 but the cut had already been made in advance 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.369
 but it cuts that rights 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.189
 at the edge of three in the morning I understand 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.759
 or it took two and a half hours waiting for it to come out is correct 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:59.109
 that is hard to believe 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:05.039
 pizzi is correct this the bar-bar in this sense the program 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.729
 This will talk to the people or the manager who was there to take the 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.379
 measures that it deems pertinent if there were any administrative fault the bar-bar 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.149
 is willing to take on 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:20.159
 that sector deal with europe with the film complete entered detail 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.509
 each of the things iniesta 11 lending legal representative of the 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:24.839
 bar-bar 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:28.439
 there is no way for the bar-bar to get out of this one, that is to say 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.409
 they let an armed individual pass 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.649
 follows a personality like cabins to the bathroom 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:36.699
 enter the bathroom 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.299
 They shoot 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.309
 a security guard realizes 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:43.219
 the guys come out of the bathroom 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.569
 the index the security councilman warns 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.659
 However, down the stairs they cross the tracks and another security 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.309
 exit door when I imagine that it does not leave us 0 first stops of there that 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:55.069
 I left 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.859
 besides a fire does not characters or is an assassination attempt 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.019
 the aissami not but these even open them I think two doors 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:07.309
 well that they ask for their car they go they clean the blood of the bath 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.339
 They are open between 5 and 5 and a half in the morning 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.339
 when at 3d they saw having started to take people out 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.509
 I did not see that they do not have something 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.469
 this was a faction of seconds 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:24.399
 that was in a fraction of seconds and this team and this is not the authorities this one 

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:26.349
 they are not easily achieved 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.370
 administratively we will reliably prove that the business 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.029
 has all the extras 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:33.490
 real documents 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.490
 this district and they may be working 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:39.710
 right 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.340
 success
