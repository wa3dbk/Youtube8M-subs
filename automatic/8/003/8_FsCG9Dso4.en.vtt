 so I'm going to give a candidate image 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.420
 That helped me a lot. It 's a profession. 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.920
 here you can have all the professions 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.620
 that you could not just be stuck 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.910
 one or two thirteen like some others 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.660
 games is presented you choose the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.770
 the profession you want 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 Then you will not, I will not want to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.250
 I do not want to work in another profession. 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.649
 you in someone else's learning 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.649
 any other example of learning 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.449
 and ask to forget your fans that 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.210
 already has an exception in the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.500
 You ask to forget yours and go 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.210
 teaches the other is that it only stays 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.130
 frozen there when you 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.049
 You want to learn something from January? 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.860
 you can quietly because your 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.540
 click here 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.009
 He's going to teach me, I'll decide which 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.420
 I want to freeze paid an amount 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.450
 derisory of gold 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.540
 I usually whistle and I can get 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.810
 The profession that I want is I will leave 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.329
 in the video description on the link with a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.340
 guide each important profession leads 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.170
 every profession of it goes from what it is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.869
 estimated 400 you may already be disappointed 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.939
 80 than before if you want virtually 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.490
 or to do 3 up you too 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.570
 you can make the 400 you can buy 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.130
 ten levels 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.020
 regardless of the level you are on 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.420
 you operate 10 levels the profession 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.090
 so if I pass all the professions it is 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.770
 you get about r 60 level 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.750
 are the professions very cheated later 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.759
 The correct game in the video description is 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.520
 This tip I have for you. 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.680
 pensions at the beginning is difficult 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.960
 There's a lot of stuff you can get 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.030
 much of this doing map exploration 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.069
 thing of the sport kind enough map 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.450
 take bergues that are necessary 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.459
 You can have taken matter 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.900
 enough off that one could speak 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.440
 trans fat and the next 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.800
 video too 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.840
 So that 's about 20 gold 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.280
 up - you get for professions that 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.780
 they have no material buying everything good 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.980

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.850
 You're just fine with 20 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.950
 goals and manages to put pressure on the 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.710
