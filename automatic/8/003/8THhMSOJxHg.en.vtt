something<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.480> think<00:01:49.540> is<00:01:49.810> uniquely<00:01:50.380> in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
something that I think is uniquely in

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.290 
something that I think is uniquely in
last<00:01:50.680> time<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.040> grill<00:01:51.310> leans<00:01:51.580> over<00:01:51.820> and<00:01:52.030> sort

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
last time the grill leans over and sort

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.600 
last time the grill leans over and sort
of<00:01:52.390> really<00:01:52.630> lends<00:01:53.470> itself<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.950> what<00:01:54.190> Mustangs

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
of really lends itself to what Mustangs

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.760 
of really lends itself to what Mustangs
