00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.860 
this is actually my first pair of grids
that<00:03:20.989> I<00:03:21.139> do<00:03:21.319> own<00:03:21.769> I've<00:03:22.209> never<00:03:23.209> picked<00:03:23.569> up<00:03:23.750> a

that I do own I've never picked up a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.420 
that I do own I've never picked up a
pair<00:03:24.079> of<00:03:24.139> grids<00:03:24.380> before<00:03:24.739> this<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.160> first
