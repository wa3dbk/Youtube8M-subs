do<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.460> agree<00:01:51.729> that<00:01:51.820> having<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.450> urinal<00:01:52.930> is

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
do you agree that having a urinal is

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.260 
do you agree that having a urinal is
kind<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:53.920> counterproductive<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.700> making<00:01:55.210> a

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
kind of counterproductive to making a

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.899 
kind of counterproductive to making a
bathroom<00:01:55.600> gender-neutral<00:01:56.229> yeah<00:02:00.929> I'd<00:02:01.929> say<00:02:02.140> so

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
bathroom gender-neutral yeah I'd say so

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.249 
bathroom gender-neutral yeah I'd say so
my<00:02:03.909> experience<00:02:04.270> both<00:02:04.360> genders<00:02:04.780> can't<00:02:04.990> use<00:02:05.110> it

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
my experience both genders can't use it

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.649 
my experience both genders can't use it
so<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.890> seems<00:02:06.070> like<00:02:06.450> against<00:02:07.450> gender

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
so it seems like against gender

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.509 
so it seems like against gender
