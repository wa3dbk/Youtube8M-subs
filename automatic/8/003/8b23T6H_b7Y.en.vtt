00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.580
 the astronauts landed on the moon 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:13.210
 six times between July 1969 and 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.040
 December 1972 and many ufologists have 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.080
 claimed that the apollo lunar missions 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.150
 of the nasa they definitely found 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.119
 not only UFOs but also beings 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.860
 extraterrestrials some take one more step 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.689
 there saying that the aliens 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.550
 they have been directly involved 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.149
 forming part of the crew of the 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.230
 Apollo missions Apollo 17 off 7 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:37.240
 December 1972 three days later 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.510
 the ship reached the moon and began to 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.280
 orbit on December 11 the module 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.770
 lunar manned by astronauts 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.110
 eugene cernan and harrison schmitt 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.760
 landed on the lunar surface the two 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.470
 astronauts left the lunar module 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.840
 three times during the three days 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.120
 following spending a total of little more 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.880
 of 22 hours of walking and driving in 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.860
 the surface of the moon during one of 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.630
 additional vehicular activities 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.460
 while the nasa called the 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.979
 astronaut hikers outside the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.439
 landing module the next photo 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.120
 was taken one of the dozens sent to 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.370
 the earth from the moon 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.190
 the photo is very strange when it is done 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.620
 a closer extension the face in the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.080
 inside the space helmet that according to the 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.390
 Nasa is from astronaut Cernan looks like 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.640
 a non-human being when comparing 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.090
 commander closed apollo 17 as 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.980
 He appeared in 1972 after 38 years with the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.980
 photo taken on the moon you see that 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.980
 it's definitely not the then who 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.230
 or what is it said that Fernan was the 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.760
 last human being to step on the moon and 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.140
 who went back into the module 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.110
 landing in the final moments 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.030
 after schmidt from entering we are 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.450
 just looking at a picture of fernÃ¡n 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.240
 of 1972 filtered through the lens or 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.250
 we are seeing a being from another world 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.900
 of course they never comment 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.930
 anything related to the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.240
 UFO or extraterrestrial issues but the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.890
 own cernan once said the UFOs 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.890
 come from some other civilization
