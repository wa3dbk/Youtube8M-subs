00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.250
 Welcome to a something 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.700
 sadder video and I'm just now 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.340
 also pretty pissed and yes me 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.769
 need your opinion and that of me 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.450
 had the last days extremely 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.130
 technical problem what completely origin 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.230
 as far as fifa is concerned 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.150
 and now I have the last days 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.640
 my disks cleaned up and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 have a few files between the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.250
 different hard disks back and forth 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 moved among other things also files 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.840
 from origin what does not seem so good 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.239
 was for the program itself and indeed 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.829
 that crashed extremely often i had 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.320
 ever before a year ago 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.360
 ever had 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.890
 at fifa the same other origin 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.390
 programs are not mine anymore 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.250
 player does not really work 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.430
 variety did not start or it is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.140
 started and ran very short and me 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.090
 everything had to be complete accordingly 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.579
 Reinstall and the bad thing about it 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.949
 is that my memory levels are not anymore 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.000
 were taken over with 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.780
 I have tried everything again 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.300
 to arrive here 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.220
 until I realized that I was 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.500
 also for fifa some time ago 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.909
 Write was the cloud sync 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.170
 had disabled because mine 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.020
 probably says it pretty openly 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.430
 against and yes I said the cloud 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.939
 storage which enabled me 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.490
 also no old score more of 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.619
 could load origin directly and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.979
 Accordingly, now our entire bvb 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.600
 career is just gone 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.610
 she is just completely in, so to speak 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.720
 air dissolved and yes I know now 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.009
 itself just now not so 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.299
 Really what I should do about it 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.430
 I just ask you this time 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.159
 I now have two spontaneous 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.229
 The first idea is quite normal 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.689
 only the project continues with the project 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.619
 almost starting at zero again, almost from 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.479
 on the front again 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.340
 the advantage of this is we have that 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.930
 updated squad we have to have 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.299
 not so much from the players 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.890
 big loss so kampl is already 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.509
 because in the carton have added new 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.479
 young players now with the time 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.729
 been added to the bvb and fifa 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.040
 But we have, of course, stop 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.360
 our beautiful memory no longer 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.039
 we are not in season two anymore 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.629
 but we will be back at the beginning 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.740
 in season one which I personally 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.990
 pretty shit find 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.900
 the alternative would be there on friday 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.700
 anyway have the 4000 abo stream and me 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.110
 I said or asked her 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.870
 do not have you in the stream synonymous one 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.670
 I could start my career 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.870
 idea how do we want to do it 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.660
 we in the stream 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.990
 the first season at least the first 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.460
 season in fifa 15 as if by playing 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.990
 we can store a bit over it 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.470
 we can talk a bit about transfers 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.300
 talk and we can watch the whole thing 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.010
 if we were for youtube then I would 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.040
 even do the extra work and would 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.270
 all season games completely together 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.110
 cut that we almost the whole 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.420
 season in 10 14 or so in ten follow 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.780
 say who that means in less than two weeks 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.580
 the whole complete first season ready 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.320
 have played and then with the second 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.750
 Season again therefore him and me times 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.700
 in the half was then almost back with 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.990
 so we would get in on the full consequences 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.040
 now have two things that you 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.780
 So you can either choose it 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.370
 now the consequences continue in normal 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.790
 full length to the normal 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.610
 times virtually from zero 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.890
 or we are often in 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.690
 livestream quasi together this career 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.790
 I'll open this performance 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.620
 I will take this completely 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.480
 cut them all in small pieces 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.320
 so that we were 15 minutes away 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.750
 have follow 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.970
 and there are 34 games almost from the bvb 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.320
 I will cut them together and I will 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.790
 then load it on youtube for the 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.470
 when streaming could not be there 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.080
 and so the first season is played 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.780
 So there you can have your opinion in 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.250
 Write the comments and yes then 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.400
 Of course, it will be Thursday morning 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.590
 first no fifa consequence and then goes 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.260
 on Friday, it continues with the 4000 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.760
 subscribers stream and then yes we see 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.760
 then continue until then bye
