00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.059

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.530
 following post what games they 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.329

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.200

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.660
 very large 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.579
 left only my games entry here 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.690
 memory even to charge because I 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.559
 really guys until the game has more 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.229
 many games the star wars normal bus 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.560
 in barcelona where borges screens or assault 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.280
 8 to ninja drive fruit software and the end of 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.590
 show hecico gancia in 2003 motorcycle and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.560
 motor finally looks how much of a game I 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.210
 have the galley just slipping from the likely 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 many games and I did not even count 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.920
 still but I think around 20 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.200
 vacancies and that's it I asked one 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.640
 facebook page within games which 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.030
 games you want me to post on 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.490
 my beans and my profile and or 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.990
 gabriel rodrigues that his comment 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.799
 will be in the video description and the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.409
 gabriel von teese de jesus asked them 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.659
 the assault and 8 the big bang racing the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.770
 five years ago, soybeans died in 2000 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.619
 true, right? 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.720
 then we will then begin to release 8 to 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.740
 is the first everyone asked the same 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.840
 two games 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.869
 the two guys asked for the same game more 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.290
 finally we will test that the subject is 8 is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.150
 father of the galley 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.150
 which I particularly like a lot 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.280
 let's start it recently when 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.200
 I did a review yet had not been 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.060
 updated this week and was 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.680
 updated is very stay that era 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.410
 seriously, it's very good 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.070
 after the upgrade thanks improved 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.840
 very 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.750
 so it's already cool that is for you 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.810
 here the game is weighing 1 mega and a half 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.790
 approximately it is clear that when 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.810
 you advance it will stand up 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:36.690
 heavier left Iceland a country very 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:41.060
 better only the sif and juan said iceland 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.709
 finally the staff here at lot 8 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.959
 for this game has a soundtrack that 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.770
 has identified a lot with the charts 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.750
 well pesadinho old heavy pesadinha that 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.930
 I will beat to show the reality 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.030
 steal three eyes on the screen all that 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.760
 before updating and journalism 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.830
 happened now 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.239
 Now it happens but that's it. 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.920
 Enjoy with the graphics are very 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.780
 good it's not any device can 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.110
 change it's a quality let's be 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.850
 competent next game I will not give 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.380
 many in the video will get very conflicted 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.630
 does not want something accomplished 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.980
 the beach bob wilson is a very game 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.519
 interesting that has been released 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.010
 recently for windows unitau expensive 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.980
 the fall calling us crazy 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.560
 wait a minute that the game was released 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.660
 recently to see devices with 512 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.269
 so if you have a device with 512 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.100
 error of the environment at last can 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.970
 download to run without problems 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.519
 I have an old number 525 ran 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.920
 perfectly fit to be 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.730
 recently launched career mode as 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.500
 initial 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.650
 You will see that the game works 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.500
 well-competent way, I like and the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.530
 graphics he the professionalism I think 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.420
 so cool 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:03.739
 I'm going to download a little the volume was that I 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:07.930
 I recognize that it is kind of high yes 32 a good 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:11.469
 context to one meter and drop the pullets 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.920
 I hope in 2010's there 6 not understand the 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.900
 guys 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.159
 I played the bar very well when you hit 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.410
 you lose speed 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.449
 really a very good realism has the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.430
 Your acrobatics is a fun game to play. 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.310
 you spend every time is not a game 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.500
 heavy can the two of normal life 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.380

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.940
 1520 dude me perfectly then you 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:36.340
 took 630 or 530 are the new line 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.630
 that has 512 mb of ram may have 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.789
 sure this game will run 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.949
 perfectly well then this was the hit 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:45.280

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.389
 Big five, let's send somebody I do not 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.220

 in the fingers how many times have I played him 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.710
 but I leave him here because I knew 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.599
 who wanted me to see that I test if 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:19.630

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:40.509
 horse comes at the time it gives to play 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.030
 usually have no bug 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:46.770
 this game can even in names with 512 in 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.449
 However, it has a 512 drive 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.030
 Let's play it's our position 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.789
 vertical'll choose anything 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:58.720

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:00.759
 anyway he's upright but anyway 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.310
 You're going to show someone it 's just raining. 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.590
 Graphics drivers are also good and it's okay 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.380
 perhaps my lighter with sun 8 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.150
 even because the proposal of the two games are 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.340
 different ne 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.699

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.680

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.690

 I highlight my family but their car. 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.139
 in real life would be in the jungle and tearful 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:31.090
 damn it 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:32.860
 He came out and nitro guys on facebook to 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.840
 take advantage of the crap that the government fell 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.610
 when I do not answer something 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.190
 because I do not want, it's because I do not 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.470
 I can then insist on not looking at 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.240
 police are on our tail, you can see 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.009
 this guide tube 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.370
 they catch if I had not beaten 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:50.440
 they name capture it but then the game 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.500
 also works normally 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.210
