and he said it's a path from darkness to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.900 
and he said it's a path from darkness to
light<00:00:19.100> it's<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.279> interesting<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.730> hear<00:00:20.820> you

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
light it's so interesting to hear you

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.690 
light it's so interesting to hear you
talk<00:00:20.970> about<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.359> pathologies<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
talk about the pathologies and the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.160 
talk about the pathologies and the
journey<00:00:23.700> toward<00:00:24.180> creating<00:00:24.570> balance<00:00:24.900> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
journey toward creating balance and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.270 
journey toward creating balance and
harmony<00:00:25.290> because<00:00:25.500> that's<00:00:25.800> where<00:00:25.920> my<00:00:26.010> mind<00:00:26.160> has

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
harmony because that's where my mind has

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.670 
harmony because that's where my mind has
been<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.760> with<00:00:26.850> this<00:00:27.170> and<00:00:28.170> now<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:28.590> I'm

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
been going with this and now but I'm

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.050 
been going with this and now but I'm
hearing<00:00:28.860> you<00:00:28.890> speak<00:00:29.039> about<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.490> well<00:00:29.789> now<00:00:30.030> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
hearing you speak about it well now I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:45.510 
hearing you speak about it well now I
think<00:00:30.180> I<00:00:30.570> know<00:00:30.630> I'm<00:00:30.780> on<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:30.990> track

current<00:01:15.880> had<00:01:16.030> showed<00:01:16.270> me<00:01:16.450> some<00:01:16.659> videos<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.500> the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
current had showed me some videos of the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.760 
current had showed me some videos of the
brain<00:01:18.939> state<00:01:19.390> sessions<00:01:19.990> going<00:01:20.200> on<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.710> I

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
brain state sessions going on and I

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.399 
brain state sessions going on and I
could<00:01:20.920> hear<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.490> tones<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:22.149> we<00:01:23.020> just<00:01:23.200> looked

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
could hear the tones and we just looked

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.740 
could hear the tones and we just looked
at<00:01:23.500> each<00:01:23.560> other<00:01:23.829> not<00:01:24.250> only<00:01:24.490> really<00:01:25.000> amazing<00:01:25.539> to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
at each other not only really amazing to

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.859 
at each other not only really amazing to
take<00:01:26.229> these<00:01:26.950> tones<00:01:27.399> and<00:01:27.729> actually<00:01:28.270> make<00:01:28.539> a

take these tones and actually make a

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.300 
take these tones and actually make a
composition<00:01:29.799> that<00:01:29.829> people<00:01:30.189> could<00:01:30.310> dance<00:01:30.610> for

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
composition that people could dance for

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.880 

about<00:01:59.040> 20<00:01:59.460> years<00:01:59.579> ago<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.210> had<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.770> unfortunate

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
about 20 years ago I had the unfortunate

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.219 
about 20 years ago I had the unfortunate
incident<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.759> being<00:02:02.970> assaulted<00:02:03.270> by<00:02:03.659> for<00:02:03.990> youth

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
incident of being assaulted by for youth

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.310 
incident of being assaulted by for youth
one<00:02:04.530> wielding<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.100> baseball<00:02:05.580> bat<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.320> from

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
one wielding a baseball bat and from

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.559 
one wielding a baseball bat and from
that<00:02:07.380> assault<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.280> had<00:02:08.700> post-traumatic<00:02:09.060> stress

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
that assault I had post-traumatic stress

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.370 
that assault I had post-traumatic stress
I<00:02:10.400> used<00:02:11.400> every<00:02:11.730> known<00:02:12.060> modality<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:13.110> period

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
I used every known modality for a period

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.890 
I used every known modality for a period
of<00:02:13.590> about<00:02:13.739> nine<00:02:14.130> years<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.819> relieve<00:02:15.150> myself<00:02:15.420> of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
of about nine years to relieve myself of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.630 
of about nine years to relieve myself of
the<00:02:16.050> symptoms<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.739> post-traumatic<00:02:17.069> stress

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the symptoms of post-traumatic stress

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.290 
the symptoms of post-traumatic stress
without<00:02:18.000> success<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.610> began<00:02:20.730> to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
without success and so I began to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.050 
without success and so I began to
observe<00:02:21.450> my<00:02:21.900> own<00:02:22.019> brain<00:02:22.290> pattern<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.060> from

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
observe my own brain pattern and from

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.620 
observe my own brain pattern and from
that<00:02:24.269> journey<00:02:24.890> developed<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.010> technology

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
that journey developed a technology

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.920 
that journey developed a technology

something that would be

something that would be
audibly<00:05:47.350> responsive<00:05:47.980> fruit<00:05:48.220> oddly

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
audibly responsive fruit oddly

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.180 
audibly responsive fruit oddly

choreography<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:55.600> then<00:05:55.990> if<00:05:56.110> us<00:05:56.350> where<00:05:56.800> all

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
choreography and then if us where all

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.040 
choreography and then if us where all
this<00:05:57.250> came<00:05:57.490> the<00:05:58.210> inspiration<00:05:58.660> all<00:05:58.750> came<00:05:58.900> from

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
this came the inspiration all came from

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.220 
this came the inspiration all came from
her<00:05:59.350> brain<00:05:59.500> waves<00:05:59.770> and<00:06:00.010> I<00:06:00.280> believe<00:06:00.930> it's<00:06:01.930> been

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
her brain waves and I believe it's been

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.020 
her brain waves and I believe it's been
