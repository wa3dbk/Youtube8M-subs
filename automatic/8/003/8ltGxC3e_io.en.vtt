00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:08.109
 hello to everyone of the ancien good 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.660
 today I bring you a trick on the map of the 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.640
 rise of black ops door zombies and this 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.620
 trick is to get on top of this 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.390
 railing this trick is after the 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.839
 patch is worth it because before it was done with 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.400
 an extraction we will do it with a 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.529
 trampoline of these goes and then 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.300
 we will do another trick very similar that is 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.710
 with the same method so we can 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.749
 get out two tricks from the beginning or 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.460
 what are you seeing now that we 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.320
 we will get behind the wall and we can 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.570
 there are lots of actions but that does not 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.730
 we can kill zombies and so good 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.140
 let's start with the first one okay what 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.449
 what we have to do is come here to 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.210
 the stairs where is the improved 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.649
 is nothing forgive the new weapon what 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.629
 we have to do is place just 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.179
 the trampoline there as you see it is worth 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.100
 we wait for it to come down and once 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.050
 get off we go to this one to go 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.390
 little by little until he throws the 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.339
 trampolÃ­ we see that it is going down and not 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.859
 we have to do anything worth then we 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.690
 will throw straight out or you can 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.579
 spend another thing worth the first thing is 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.460
 is what can happen to me that can 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.810
 happen also here we will be invincible and 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.060
 now if we approach the trampoline 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.320
 but we can not move, okay or we're 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.960
 it can happen that of getting inside 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.460
 of the map, that is, outside of forgiveness or stay 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.530
 here we can not move if we 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.049
 you see, I'm here in the middle caught in 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.460
 I really can not leave here and 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.619
 now to leave we can pass two 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.320
 things one do the trick of the 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.090
 railing or get us off the map if 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.399
 we go in here we can not 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.990
 back walesa that if you want to do 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.030
 this trick has gone well but if 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.860
 you want to do the other and you already have to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.929
 you die and try again because 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.640
 here you're not going to get out but yes 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.799
 you can create a lot of zombie action 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.990
 to help your colleagues we 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.670
 to pay the control if you want if you go 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.250
 out there for a spin while 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.670
 our companions kill zombies or as 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.189
 you want 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.140
 out of curiosity like I'm worth as you are 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.939
 watching here and so good here you see 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.500
 that the second thing we will do is the 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.470
 same method we have to take the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.780
 trampoline and then it will not get in here 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.450
 a little bit above ballet if you 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.009
 you see, it's not inside the outside of the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.080
 map what he has done is upload me a little 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.090
 more a few more steps and now we will have 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.500
 to go slowly walking around here 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.820
 until the end 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.360
 there we see that I pass it in fast camera 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.220
 so that no 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.960
 you see we can stay here 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.180
 so the truth is that it's a good 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.340
 trick you see we can do two 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.140
 tricks at once so good then 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.390
