2009-2010<00:00:42.059> when<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.540> kicked<00:00:42.750> off<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
2009-2010 when it really kicked off and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.840 
2009-2010 when it really kicked off and
the<00:00:43.290> government<00:00:43.710> did<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.280> testing<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the government did some testing at that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.490 
the government did some testing at that
time<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:46.079> when<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> government

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
time and that's when the government

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.729 
time and that's when the government
documented<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.460> 22%<00:00:48.149> power<00:00:48.930> reduction<00:00:49.289> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
documented a 22% power reduction of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
netting versus uncovered shell you mean

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.270 
netting versus uncovered shell you mean
keeping<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.930> cool<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.649> cool<00:00:55.680> either

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
keeping it cool so cool either

barracks or whatever is underneath
exactly<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.800> cooler<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.489> didn't

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
exactly it was cooler so it didn't

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910 
exactly it was cooler so it didn't
require<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.539> much<00:01:00.690> energy<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.469> cooling

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
require as much energy as much cooling

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920 
require as much energy as much cooling
because<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.910> wasn't<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.270> hot<00:01:03.449> there's<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> lot

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
because it wasn't as hot there's a lot

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.830 
because it wasn't as hot there's a lot
less<00:01:04.080> expensive<00:01:04.460> exactly<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.600> what

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
less expensive exactly and you know what

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.969 
less expensive exactly and you know what
to<00:01:06.930> bring<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> fuel<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.890> everything

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
to bring all the fuel and everything

else - and the Sanders new costs the
same<00:01:10.470> study<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.310> documented<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
same study actually documented that you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.109 
same study actually documented that you
would<00:01:12.960> save<00:01:13.170> about<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.470> hundred<00:01:13.860> gallons<00:01:14.640> of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
would save about a hundred gallons of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.840 
would save about a hundred gallons of
fuel<00:01:15.299> per<00:01:15.390> day<00:01:16.100> because<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.520> power

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
fuel per day because of that power

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.810 
fuel per day because of that power
ridgemount<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.570> fuel<00:01:18.810> yeah<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.890> um<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.580> know

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.399 
it right here yes sir all comes in two
different<00:01:24.119> types<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.689> camouflage

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
different types of camouflage

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.499 
different types of camouflage
there's<00:01:25.619> two<00:01:25.740> different<00:01:26.180> variants<00:01:27.180> will<00:01:27.330> just

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
there's two different variants will just

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.030 
there's two different variants will just
be<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> Turing<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.110> transparent<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.890> can

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
be a Turing and transparent but we can

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.469 
be a Turing and transparent but we can
do<00:01:29.130> them<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.369> two<00:01:29.490> different<00:01:29.640> colors<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.299> well

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
do them in two different colors as well

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.810 
do them in two different colors as well
which<00:01:30.720> will<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.960> woodland<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.650> desert<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
which will be woodland and desert the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.920 
which will be woodland and desert the
desert<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.270> gonna<00:01:33.420> give<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> best

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
desert is gonna give you the best

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.170 
desert is gonna give you the best
cooling<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> lighter<00:01:35.180> color

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
cooling because it's a lighter color

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.760 
cooling because it's a lighter color
might<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.049> might<00:01:37.229> need<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
might you might need it for the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.969 
might you might need it for the
different<00:01:38.070> vironment<00:01:38.280> exactly<00:01:39.320> okay<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.619> now

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
different vironment exactly okay so now

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.370 
different vironment exactly okay so now

sniper suit it's fully multi spectral as
well<00:01:48.990> which<00:01:49.200> means<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.649> defeats<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.100> wide<00:01:50.310> range

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
well which means it defeats a wide range

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.630 
well which means it defeats a wide range
of<00:01:50.820> sensors<00:01:51.619> visual<00:01:52.619> near<00:01:52.860> infrared<00:01:53.070> thermal

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
of sensors visual near infrared thermal

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.560 
of sensors visual near infrared thermal
and<00:01:54.060> radar<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:55.770> very<00:01:56.340> very<00:01:57.240> lightweight

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and radar and a very very lightweight

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.600 
and radar and a very very lightweight
suit<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.439> also<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> best<00:01:59.040> thing<00:01:59.219> about<00:01:59.250> this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
suit and also the best thing about this

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.819 
suit and also the best thing about this
is<00:01:59.670> it's<00:02:00.090> also<00:02:00.299> flame<00:02:00.810> resistant<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.649> there's

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
is it's also flame resistant so there's

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.770 
is it's also flame resistant so there's
been<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> lot<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.189> issues<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.820> especially<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
been a lot of issues of especially the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.480 
been a lot of issues of especially the
the<00:02:03.810> guys<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.439> are<00:02:04.590> making<00:02:04.770> their<00:02:05.009> own<00:02:05.040> suits

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the guys that are making their own suits

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.270 
the guys that are making their own suits
right<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.659> some<00:02:07.020> flame<00:02:07.649> hazards

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
right can be some flame hazards

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.559 
right can be some flame hazards
associated<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.910> their<00:02:09.119> pen<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
associated with their pen on the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.630 
associated with their pen on the
materials<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> flame<00:02:11.099> resistant

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
materials but this is a flame resistant

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.720 
materials but this is a flame resistant
material

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
material

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.690 
material
and<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.140> if<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.530> was<00:02:14.680> looking<00:02:14.770> through<00:02:14.950> night

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
and so if I was looking through night

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.880 
and so if I was looking through night
vision<00:02:16.120> or<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:17.080> would<00:02:17.260> blend<00:02:17.500> in<00:02:17.709> with

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
vision or this would blend in with

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.150 
vision or this would blend in with
whatever<00:02:18.400> environment<00:02:18.879> you<00:02:19.239> were<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:20.160> yeah

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
whatever environment you were in yeah

whatever environment you were in yeah
easy

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
easy

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.410 
easy
I<00:02:21.760> mean<00:02:22.330> that's<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.690> that's<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.319> big<00:02:23.349> feat<00:02:23.709> yeah

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
I mean that's a that's a big feat yeah

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.830 
I mean that's a that's a big feat yeah
and<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.950> also<00:02:27.129> comes<00:02:27.519> in<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:28.090> woodland<00:02:28.629> too

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840

right this actually comes in three

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220 
right this actually comes in three
colors<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.610> think<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:30.910> urban<00:02:31.330> desert<00:02:31.930> and
