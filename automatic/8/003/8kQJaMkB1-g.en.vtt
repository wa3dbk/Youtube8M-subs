important to have a variety of different
heads<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> point<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.800> paper<00:00:50.399> stone

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.410 
heads on the point on the paper stone
and<00:00:50.910> making<00:00:51.149> different<00:00:51.449> points<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.370> them<00:00:53.420> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and making different points to them and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.000 
and making different points to them and
this<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.840> done<00:00:54.870> easily<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.590> by<00:00:55.710> using

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
this can be done easily just by using

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.099 
this can be done easily just by using
them<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.420> getting<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> blank<00:00:57.930> piece<00:00:58.050> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
them you know getting a blank piece of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.049 
them you know getting a blank piece of
paper<00:00:58.289> putting<00:00:58.920> some<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.070> graphite<00:00:59.789> down

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
paper putting some little graphite down

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.549 
paper putting some little graphite down
and<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:00.570> just<00:01:00.780> smudging<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.289> until<00:01:01.500> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and then just smudging it until you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.229 
and then just smudging it until you
blend<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.039> alright<00:01:02.940> we're<00:01:03.030> gonna<00:01:03.149> start

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
blend it in alright we're gonna start

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.509 
blend it in alright we're gonna start
with<00:01:03.539> metal<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.989> chrome<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.500> armor<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.189> the

start and then later of course smudging

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.130 
start and then later of course smudging
it<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:14.180> now<00:01:15.180> I'm<00:01:15.299> gonna<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.540> starting<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.990> the

it in now I'm gonna be starting with the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.499 
it in now I'm gonna be starting with the
helmet<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.580> you're<00:01:17.700> doing<00:01:17.970> chrome<00:01:18.299> or

helmet and when you're doing chrome or
metal<00:01:18.869> work<00:01:19.080> especially<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.310> case<00:01:20.549> where

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
metal work especially in this case where

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.390 
metal work especially in this case where
I<00:01:20.790> want<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.119> highly<00:01:21.540> reflective<00:01:22.200> look<00:01:22.470> it's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
I want a highly reflective look it's

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.770 
I want a highly reflective look it's
gonna<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.670> important<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> keep<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.420> mind<00:01:24.450> where

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
gonna be important to keep in mind where

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.240 
gonna be important to keep in mind where
the<00:01:24.900> light<00:01:25.049> sauce<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.500> coming<00:01:25.770> from<00:01:25.890> which<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the light sauce is coming from which is

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
the light sauce is coming from which is
in<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.460> case<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.850> right<00:01:27.000> hand<00:01:27.240> side<00:01:27.509> shining

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
in this case the right hand side shining

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.950 
in this case the right hand side shining
in<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> left<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:30.150> also<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> fact<00:01:30.840> that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
in to the left but also the fact that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.740 
in to the left but also the fact that
with<00:01:31.229> metal<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> lot<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.060> pickups<00:01:33.479> from

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
with metal you get a lot of pickups from

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.020 
with metal you get a lot of pickups from
reflected<00:01:34.439> light<00:01:34.650> as<00:01:34.860> well<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.250> reflections

from other areas in the environment in
this<00:01:39.390> case<00:01:39.600> would<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.840> his<00:01:40.049> shoulder<00:01:40.590> perhaps

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
this case would be his shoulder perhaps

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.420 
this case would be his shoulder perhaps
even<00:01:41.610> part<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> cape<00:01:42.360> maybe<00:01:42.869> even<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
pole that's holding the flag but since

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.620 
pole that's holding the flag but since
there's<00:01:47.220> some<00:01:47.430> some<00:01:47.790> areas<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.329> so

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
there's some some areas that are so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.440 
there's some some areas that are so
small<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.290> tiny<00:01:49.729> it's<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.939> important<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
small so tiny it's just important that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.190 
small so tiny it's just important that
we<00:01:51.630> put<00:01:51.810> indication<00:01:52.649> lines<00:01:52.890> now<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.640> be

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
we put indication lines now that can be

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
we put indication lines now that can be
blended<00:01:55.200> shadows<00:01:55.799> where<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.549> darks

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
blended shadows where you have darks

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.420 
blended shadows where you have darks
going<00:01:57.600> from<00:01:57.840> dark<00:01:58.259> mid<00:01:58.530> grade<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.009> high<00:01:59.250> light

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
going from dark mid grade to high light

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.850 
going from dark mid grade to high light
and<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.060> some<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.479> very<00:02:00.659> very<00:02:00.960> fine<00:02:01.469> line

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
and then some just very very fine line

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.889 
and then some just very very fine line
work<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:02.549> gives<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> impression<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.780> a

that's one of the ways that I studied
and<00:02:24.260> got<00:02:24.500> some<00:02:24.740> basic<00:02:24.920> ideas<00:02:25.460> of<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.850> way<00:02:26.060> in

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
and got some basic ideas of the way in

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.900 
and got some basic ideas of the way in
which<00:02:26.590> reflections<00:02:27.590> occur<00:02:27.950> now<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
different rounded crevices anytime I

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.230 
different rounded crevices anytime I
come<00:02:33.470> across<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.980> rounded<00:02:34.370> area<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:34.730> always<00:02:35.060> make

come across a rounded area I always make

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.750 
come across a rounded area I always make
sure<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:35.840> leave<00:02:36.080> just<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.650> hairline<00:02:37.100> of

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
sure that I leave just a hairline of

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.870 
sure that I leave just a hairline of
open<00:02:38.660> space<00:02:38.930> like<00:02:39.170> even<00:02:39.830> if<00:02:39.920> it's<00:02:40.070> you'll<00:02:40.700> see

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
open space like even if it's you'll see

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.340 
open space like even if it's you'll see
what<00:02:41.000> I'm<00:02:41.090> doing<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.420> arm<00:02:41.600> right<00:02:41.870> now

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
what I'm doing the arm right now

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.020 
what I'm doing the arm right now
I'll<00:02:42.620> leave<00:02:42.890> just<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.250> hairline<00:02:43.460> over<00:02:43.940> the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
I'll leave just a hairline over the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.060 
I'll leave just a hairline over the
bicep<00:02:44.540> I'm<00:02:45.200> gonna<00:02:45.320> give<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> close-up<00:02:45.830> of

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
bicep I'm gonna give you a close-up of

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.680 
bicep I'm gonna give you a close-up of
this<00:02:46.220> later<00:02:46.460> on<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:47.180> you're<00:02:47.300> gonna<00:02:47.390> be<00:02:47.510> able<00:02:47.630> to

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
this later on so you're gonna be able to

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.540 
this later on so you're gonna be able to
see<00:02:47.840> what<00:02:47.960> I'm<00:02:48.050> saying<00:02:48.410> I'm<00:02:48.770> not<00:02:48.950> shadowing<00:02:49.460> it

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
see what I'm saying I'm not shadowing it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.190 
see what I'm saying I'm not shadowing it
right<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.060> end<00:02:50.210> of<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.660> line<00:02:50.870> or<00:02:51.170> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
right to the end of the line or the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.770 
right to the end of the line or the
outside<00:02:51.770> perimeter<00:02:52.460> I'm<00:02:52.880> actually<00:02:53.060> leaving<00:02:53.510> a

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
outside perimeter I'm actually leaving a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.080 
outside perimeter I'm actually leaving a
little<00:02:53.930> bit<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.200> white<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.430> I'm<00:02:55.520> leaving<00:02:55.940> a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
little bit of white so I'm leaving a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.700 
little bit of white so I'm leaving a
little<00:02:56.210> white<00:02:56.450> then<00:02:56.990> I'm<00:02:57.110> shadowing<00:02:57.620> from

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
little white then I'm shadowing from

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.110 
little white then I'm shadowing from
dark<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.070> light<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.610> then<00:02:58.730> I'm<00:02:58.850> putting<00:02:59.000> a

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
dark to light and then I'm putting a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.440 
dark to light and then I'm putting a
fine<00:02:59.510> line<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.900> reflection<00:03:00.050> after<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.890> fact

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
fine line of reflection after the fact

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.550 
fine line of reflection after the fact
and<00:03:02.450> by<00:03:02.600> doing<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.050> it<00:03:03.110> gives<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
and by doing this it gives the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.380 
and by doing this it gives the
impression<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:04.070> this<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.760> not<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.150> an

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
impression that this is not a an

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.570 
impression that this is not a an
absorbing<00:03:06.170> fabric<00:03:06.770> or<00:03:06.980> material

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
absorbing fabric or material

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:18.170 
absorbing fabric or material
it's<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.270> reflective<00:03:08.890> surface

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.059 

and<00:03:18.750> we<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:19.049> jumped<00:03:19.349> ahead<00:03:19.439> just<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.829> little

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
and we just jumped ahead just a little

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.039 
and we just jumped ahead just a little
bit<00:03:20.220> you've<00:03:20.790> gotten<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> basic<00:03:21.390> idea<00:03:21.540> now<00:03:21.930> I'm

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
bit you've gotten a basic idea now I'm

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.920 
bit you've gotten a basic idea now I'm
going<00:03:22.319> in<00:03:22.439> with<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.650> paper<00:03:22.860> stump<00:03:23.280> or<00:03:23.879> 2tn<00:03:24.540> and

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
going in with the paper stump or 2tn and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.569 
going in with the paper stump or 2tn and
I'm<00:03:25.079> actually<00:03:25.230> blending<00:03:25.769> this<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.069> a<00:03:26.099> very

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
I'm actually blending this is a very

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.600 
I'm actually blending this is a very
very<00:03:26.909> fine<00:03:27.299> tip<00:03:27.750> paper<00:03:28.470> stump<00:03:28.829> so<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.400> can<00:03:29.519> get

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
very fine tip paper stump so I can get

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.990 
very fine tip paper stump so I can get
into<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:29.909> real<00:03:30.209> fine<00:03:30.599> details

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
into the real fine details

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.949 
into the real fine details
there<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.060> go<00:03:33.209> I'm<00:03:33.269> just<00:03:33.360> blending<00:03:33.689> in

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
there you go I'm just blending in

I'm focusing a little bit more on just
the<00:05:02.250> pattern<00:05:03.030> of<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.780> feathers<00:05:05.510> much<00:05:06.510> like

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
the pattern of the feathers much like

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.200 
the pattern of the feathers much like
you<00:05:06.960> would<00:05:07.139> lay<00:05:07.800> roofing<00:05:08.310> material<00:05:08.820> or

you would lay roofing material or

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.950 
you would lay roofing material or
shingles<00:05:10.010> is<00:05:11.010> how<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.850> feathers<00:05:12.690> lay

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
shingles is how the feathers lay

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.030 
shingles is how the feathers lay
themselves<00:05:13.470> out

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.110
