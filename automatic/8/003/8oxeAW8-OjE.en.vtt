 software in software terms 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.920
 as a personal opinion I did not like 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.539
 everything has its shortcomings but 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.700
 good if you want can see ag view

 where the phone test and take out 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.110
 your own conclusions 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.780
 has implemented some improvements in 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.380
 terms of for example the certification 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.270
 ip67 and in terms of hard as the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.130
 12 megapixel camera sensor and 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.230
 soft cell which is a sensor developed 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.990
 by samsung something like what he does 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.220
 samsung sorry as those who do are and 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.800
 with your sex with your exmor sensor 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.200
 with its exmor sensors and 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.670
 then we also have the software 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 some of the usual ones 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.270
 features that you put samsung for 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.670
 handle with gestures and everything else 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.980
 we have 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.590
 an ability to be a focus after having 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.760
 taken the picture and we also have a mode 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.380
 of energy saving one of the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.360
 policies one of the curiosities and it's 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.360
 than to unlock the phone with him 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.340
 use the fingerprint sensor does not 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.980
 we are going to have to press but 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.530
 we're going to have to slide our finger over 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.690
 the sensor so you can recognize 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.350
 our finger on this differs from the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.300
 Iphone 5s 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.510
 has an estimated date of arrival at 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.370
 market on April 11 and its price is 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.190
 still unknown but you can already 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.540
 observe in amazon a spain by 729 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.329
 euros if I do not remember correctly 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.610
 and it's not just that out there I just do not know if 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.740
 will be true or lie but good 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.470
 and arrival in Argentina estimated that in 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.280
 August I do not know I do not remember very well 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.650
 when the s4 arrived in relation to 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.270
 launch in the international but 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.860
 let's hope it does not take too long 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.840
 let's hope that they increasingly shorten the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.640
 wait times so guys 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.200
 I would like to know what you think in the 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.340
 comments about this new samsung 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.650
 galaxy s 5 if you liked it if not that 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.360
 is that they would like to change not to me the 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.209
 truth is that in terms of the design I 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.580
 I appreciate quite a lot of code 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.380
 repetitive but good there has also been 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.640
 some teasing about the golden model 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.060
 because the back has a touch 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.100
 something like how I'm dotted then 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.440
 it seems that you touch a band-aid so 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.299
 well you know if you like forgotten 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.150
