00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.329
 even the little guilherme already had the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.019
 score at your fingertips with the same 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.989

 andré ganso rossi brasileiro within 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.760
 before starting the game. 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.890
 concentrated santa cruz coaches 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.290
 already prepared to try to reverse the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.880
 leadership situation of the island lion 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.900
 worth the first place of the championship 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.700
 with an opponent who already reverses 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.650
 advantage that we have players 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.720
 profiled to the hymn of pernambuco 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.810

 gilberto castro júnior logo 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.479
 a lot of rush attack from both sides 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.060
 first at 49 seconds after hunting 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.490
 mouse dribbled into the area and played for 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.549

 area the minute after it was the turn of the sport 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.899
 an exchange of passes between roger and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.659
 felipe azevedo who stopped by in the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.329
 goalkeeper tiago cardoso another throw 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.479
 denis marques tabled with mouse hunting 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.770
 nodded out in response the roger is 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.090
 almost opens the scoring 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.670
 if it were not for the reflex of the goalkeeper 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.579
 but the one who got to the goal was 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.069
 client even at 43 minutes after 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.200
 a ball over 1 filled the foot and 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.840
 the ball hit the post hit a 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.750
 grass 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.689
 entered and the zara and skinny the ball hit the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.310
 catch and will finish until the ball entered 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.709
 hit the crossbar on his back so it's 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.989
 it was not a failure not a result of the first 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.050
 time that left the lively coral crowd 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.230
 and why not blessed thinking still 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.500
 most positive guy on the snake wanted more 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.940
 I want to score goal I want 2 to 0 in 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.610
 back to the second stage of the classic 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.420
 it seems the players heard the guy 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.030
 of the snake 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.760
 Look what the mouse hunt did gave that bath. 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.010
 two players accelerated and served denis 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.380
 marques who only stopped in the incredible defense 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.470
 the second goal looked like a 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.750
 very close the red black tied felipe 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.130
 azevedo went as far as to roger that 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.310
 kicked the left corner of thiago 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.750
 cardoso he was still in it but did not 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.390
 1 to 1 shirt 9 was to thank the fans 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.460
 The tie-breaker did not take too long. 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.800
 marques that made the game of number 50 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.380
 with the tricolor shirt he chose the corner 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.960
 left and the club 's goalkeeper 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.480
 santa in front of again 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.530
 It seemed like the game was going to end like this. 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.860
 just seemed 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.720
 in added to the 46 minutes tozzo did 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.060
 A free kick by lucas lima 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.340
 nobody complained it was a penalty even in 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.740
 collection landmarks aurelio hit the corner 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.290
 left and left everything the same 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.900
 end of game in the rue with this result 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.090
 sport becomes champion of the second 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.030
 and now has the advantage of playing the 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.520
 semi-final match at home and 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.530
 if you pass in the final also half 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.709
 We can hardly leave. 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.690
 to tie up is to take 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.010
 first place so it 's classic is 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.989
 decided in detail 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.520
 was one more in this way not always the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.650
 better wins 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.030
 makes one of them more pressing 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.160
 it got impact do not forget it there 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.720
 Let's see if it's missing from the press conference. 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.300
 the goalkeeper 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.280
 penalty shot at a decisive moment. 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.530
 if I had had to opportunity 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.590
 to have a penalty I already had in my 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.790
 head that I would hit are the time of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.290
 penalty there I think it had 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.280
 personality and catches the ball take 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.990
 responsibility 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.510
 the coach faced that tie with a 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.660
 victory for believing until he heard the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.420
 people did not expect to lose right 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.920
 He did not give up so this could 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.150
 even though we did not do everything 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.400
 what we can and should 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:26.470
 to make but in any way a result 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.930
 acceptable for the tricolor side who opened 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.900
 score did not even think to score 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.910
 by chance it's not very important, right? 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.700
 I 'm glad I made a game. 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.460
 so I hope to make another game better 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:44.350
 but that's the way we should win. 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.020
 skirt meet is the most important 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.080
 even with the tie the feeling that is 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.260
 defeat is a situation is conflicting 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.600
 not you pleased with the team 's performance 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.490
 for everything the team has done on the pitch and is 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.620
 logical what we realized it was a 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.600
 sadness about the result by the 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:08.340
 the end of the punishment game we 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:11.790
 but that's what we showed in the game today 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.590
 since we have the conditions to 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.500
 to dispute the title we call our 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.090
 opponent in the next stage the semifinals 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.310
 the first place sport of the 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.650
 Pernambuco plays against Ypiranga and 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.860
 santa cruz third placed faces the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.860
