was kind of handy and I'll show you real

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500 
was kind of handy and I'll show you real
quick<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.750> looks<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.519> and<00:00:29.519> then<00:00:30.300> we'll

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
quick what it looks like and then we'll

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.780 
quick what it looks like and then we'll
take<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> closer<00:00:31.109> look<00:00:31.279> here<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.430> this

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
take a closer look here it is this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.660 
take a closer look here it is this
basically<00:00:33.480> terms<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.110> iPad<00:00:34.500> air<00:00:34.710> into<00:00:35.160> almost

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
basically terms the iPad air into almost

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000 
basically terms the iPad air into almost
like<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.940> little<00:00:36.090> laptop<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.960> terms<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.440> form

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
like a little laptop in terms of form

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.750 
like a little laptop in terms of form
factor<00:00:38.460> there<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.430> again<00:00:41.430> let's<00:00:41.640> take

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
factor there it is and again let's take

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.860 
factor there it is and again let's take
a<00:00:41.820> closer<00:00:42.090> look<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.480> I'll<00:00:42.540> show<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.690> why<00:00:42.840> I

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
a closer look and I'll show you why I

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.979 
a closer look and I'll show you why I
like<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:44.570> okay<00:00:45.570> we've<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
like this so much okay we've got the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.470 
like this so much okay we've got the
iPad<00:00:46.320> air<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> Left<00:00:47.250> we've<00:00:47.489> got<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.910> Zagg

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
iPad air on the Left we've got the Zagg

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.290 
iPad air on the Left we've got the Zagg
folio<00:00:49.110> keyboard<00:00:49.860> case<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> right<00:00:50.489> roughly

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
folio keyboard case on the right roughly

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.330 
folio keyboard case on the right roughly
the<00:00:51.449> same<00:00:51.870> size<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.530> terms<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.860> footprint

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the same size in terms of footprint

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.639 
the same size in terms of footprint
which<00:00:53.699> makes<00:00:53.940> sense<00:00:54.149> because<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:55.260> iPad<00:00:55.620> air

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
which makes sense because the iPad air

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
which makes sense because the iPad air
fits<00:00:56.129> right<00:00:56.430> inside<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:57.090> there's<00:00:57.270> no<00:00:57.420> wasted

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
fits right inside here there's no wasted

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.779 
fits right inside here there's no wasted
space<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.100> rid<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> air<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
space you get rid of the air for a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.569 
space you get rid of the air for a
second<00:01:00.180> I'll<00:01:00.420> show<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> mean<00:01:01.199> by<00:01:01.410> that

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
second I'll show you what I mean by that

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.860 
second I'll show you what I mean by that
let<00:01:02.579> me<00:01:02.609> open<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.359> we'll<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
let me open this up we'll go to the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230 
let me open this up we'll go to the
keyboard<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> second<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.060> see

the plastic and it kind of funnels the
sound<00:01:31.740> towards<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.880> honestly<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.079> sound

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
quality has been pretty much the same as

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.450 
quality has been pretty much the same as
not<00:01:36.570> having<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.990> case<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.740> don't<00:01:38.310> feel

not having a case on it I don't feel

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.249 
not having a case on it I don't feel
like<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.790> its<00:01:39.119> muffled<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:39.720> I've<00:01:39.810> lost<00:01:39.840> any

of thing your home button all the way
over<00:02:27.720> there<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.129> pretty<00:02:29.310> thin

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900

that<00:02:32.280> from<00:02:32.459> here<00:02:32.489> but<00:02:32.879> it's<00:02:33.090> relatively<00:02:34.019> thin

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
that from here but it's relatively thin

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.020 
that from here but it's relatively thin
and<00:02:34.530> then<00:02:35.370> when<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.519> put<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.760> all<00:02:35.819> together

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
and then when you put it all together

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.580 
and then when you put it all together
let<00:02:36.810> me<00:02:36.930> do<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.260> now<00:02:38.930> just<00:02:39.930> put<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.319> in

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
let me do that now just put that in

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
let me do that now just put that in
there<00:02:40.739> like<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.849> now<00:02:42.000> secure<00:02:42.540> and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
there like that it's now secure and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.430 
there like that it's now secure and
should<00:02:44.610> already<00:02:44.940> be<00:02:45.060> paired<00:02:45.510> yep<00:02:45.900> there<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.319> is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
should already be paired yep there it is

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.869 
should already be paired yep there it is
it<00:02:46.859> pairs<00:02:47.160> pretty<00:02:47.430> quickly

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
it pairs pretty quickly

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.390 
it pairs pretty quickly
and<00:02:49.519> wakes<00:02:50.519> very<00:02:51.299> quickly<00:02:51.569> as<00:02:51.810> well<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.829> find

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
and wakes very quickly as well so I find

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.190 
and wakes very quickly as well so I find
I<00:02:53.489> don't<00:02:53.640> find<00:02:53.760> myself<00:02:53.910> struggling<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.930> use<00:02:55.079> it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
I don't find myself struggling to use it

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.630 
I don't find myself struggling to use it
I<00:02:55.260> want<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.500> use<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.920> keyboard<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.459> start

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
I want to use the keyboard I just start

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.809 
I want to use the keyboard I just start
using<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.239> works<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:58.640> again<00:02:59.640> you've

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
using it and it works so again you've

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.569 
using it and it works so again you've
got<00:02:59.849> different<00:03:00.920> different<00:03:01.920> keys<00:03:02.129> here<00:03:02.400> at<00:03:02.459> the

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
got different different keys here at the

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.000 
got different different keys here at the
top<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:03.150> could<00:03:03.329> do<00:03:03.450> music<00:03:04.260> playback<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.829> could

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
top I could do music playback I could

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.580 
top I could do music playback I could
change<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.760> volume<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.659> so<00:03:06.810> forth<00:03:07.079> so

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
change the volume so and so forth so

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.710 
change the volume so and so forth so
what<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:07.890> essentially<00:03:08.340> does<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:09.390> pretty

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
what this essentially does is it pretty

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.360 
what this essentially does is it pretty
much<00:03:09.810> doubles<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.379> weight<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.799> iPad<00:03:11.129> air

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
much doubles the weight of the iPad air

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.800 
much doubles the weight of the iPad air
but<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.090> gives<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:13.730> laptop<00:03:14.730> like<00:03:15.000> form

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
but it gives you a laptop like form

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.809 
but it gives you a laptop like form
factor<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:17.040> feel<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.370> I'm<00:03:17.489> carrying
