00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
be able to get them all but we're going

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.009 
be able to get them all but we're going
to<00:00:30.970> allow<00:00:31.060> people<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.449> respect<00:00:31.810> their

new<00:00:34.300> things<00:00:34.449> so<00:00:39.479> we're<00:00:40.479> not<00:00:40.570> entirely

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
new things so we're not entirely

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.750 
new things so we're not entirely
grounded<00:00:41.559> in<00:00:41.680> reality<00:00:41.830> but<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.460> kind<00:00:42.640> of<00:00:42.670> the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
grounded in reality but the kind of the

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.660 
grounded in reality but the kind of the
way<00:00:42.850> we<00:00:43.000> look<00:00:43.150> at<00:00:43.330> it<00:00:43.479> is<00:00:43.629> if<00:00:43.900> it's<00:00:44.110> possible<00:00:45.100> or

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
way we look at it is if it's possible or

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.160 
way we look at it is if it's possible or
on<00:00:45.790> future<00:00:46.239> weapons<00:00:46.570> or<00:00:46.750> something<00:00:47.019> like<00:00:47.110> that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
on future weapons or something like that

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.289 
on future weapons or something like that
then<00:00:47.650> then<00:00:48.220> we'll<00:00:48.370> allow<00:00:48.790> it<00:00:48.909> in<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.119> game

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.299 
then then we'll allow it in the game

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.410 
then then we'll allow it in the game
whenever<00:00:50.229> there<00:00:50.409> is<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.559> decision<00:00:51.010> between

whenever there is a decision between
something<00:00:52.420> that's<00:00:52.600> realistic<00:00:53.110> or<00:00:53.470> something

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
something that's realistic or something

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:02.680 
something that's realistic or something
that's<00:00:53.920> fun<00:00:54.190> we<00:00:54.850> always<00:00:55.239> go<00:00:55.420> for<00:00:55.600> what's<00:00:55.780> fun

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.039 

you<00:01:03.230> just<00:01:03.440> used<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.829> boost<00:01:04.810> boosts<00:01:05.810> have

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
you just used a boost boosts have

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.020 
you just used a boost boosts have
positive<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:06.799> negative<00:01:07.159> effects<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:07.729> while

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
positive and negative effects so while

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.640 
positive and negative effects so while
one<00:01:08.210> boost<00:01:08.420> might<00:01:08.659> may<00:01:08.810> give<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:09.200> more<00:01:09.380> health

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
one boost might may give you more health

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.700 
one boost might may give you more health
it<00:01:10.130> might<00:01:10.280> also<00:01:10.460> make<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:10.850> less<00:01:11.090> accurate<00:01:11.710> so

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
it might also make you less accurate so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.590 
it might also make you less accurate so
there's<00:01:13.040> always<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> trade-off<00:01:13.640> you're

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
there's always a trade-off you're

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.359 
there's always a trade-off you're
allowed<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.960> equip<00:01:15.290> to<00:01:15.530> boost<00:01:15.770> before<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.220> go

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
allowed to equip to boost before you go

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.120
