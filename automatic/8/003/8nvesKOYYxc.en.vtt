00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
then this was what was to come next but

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.770 
then this was what was to come next but
was<00:00:57.260> is<00:00:57.590> actually<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.129> killer<00:00:58.850> keyword

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.379 
NASCAR changed a homologation rule and
at<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:04.039> point<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.519> wouldn't<00:01:04.699> be<00:01:04.879> equitable

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:05.389 
at that point it wouldn't be equitable

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:07.029 
at that point it wouldn't be equitable
to<00:01:05.539> run<00:01:05.719> these<00:01:05.990> because<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:06.590> cost<00:01:06.829> of

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
to run these because the cost of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.190 
to run these because the cost of
building<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.459> was<00:01:07.609> too<00:01:07.789> high<00:01:07.999> now<00:01:08.929> Larry
