00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
one in the corner I thought even the

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.460 
one in the corner I thought even the
possession<00:04:30.180> before<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.600> he<00:04:30.750> was<00:04:30.900> lining<00:04:31.320> up

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
possession before that he was lining up

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.770 
possession before that he was lining up
to<00:04:31.500> take<00:04:32.010> it<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.850> defense<00:04:33.270> closed<00:04:33.540> out

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
to take it and the defense closed out

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.970 
to take it and the defense closed out
and<00:04:33.990> it's<00:04:34.110> just<00:04:34.320> getting<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.620> comfort<00:04:34.950> level

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980
