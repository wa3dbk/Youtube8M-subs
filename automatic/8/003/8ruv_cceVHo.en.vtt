different<00:00:33.449> lengths<00:00:33.960> an<00:00:34.220> ombre<00:00:35.220> is<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:36.570> stage<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
different lengths an ombre is a stage of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.070 
different lengths an ombre is a stage of
the<00:00:37.800> same<00:00:38.040> basic<00:00:38.580> color<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.360> changes<00:00:39.870> at

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
the same basic color and it changes at

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.979 
the same basic color and it changes at
intervals<00:00:40.650> or<00:00:40.949> tones<00:00:41.670> from<00:00:42.300> light<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> dark

intervals or tones from light to dark

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.380 
intervals or tones from light to dark
and<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.340> pattern<00:00:44.670> will<00:00:44.879> repeat<00:00:45.239> itself

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and then the pattern will repeat itself

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.520 
and then the pattern will repeat itself
on<00:00:45.839> a<00:00:45.900> print<00:00:46.440> those<00:00:47.339> are<00:00:47.550> computer-generated

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
on a print those are computer-generated

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.700 
on a print those are computer-generated
and<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:50.040> can<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.400> a<00:00:50.430> multiple<00:00:50.909> of<00:00:51.150> colorways

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
and they can be a multiple of colorways

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.689 
and they can be a multiple of colorways
different<00:00:52.710> lengths<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.190> where<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.489> can

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
different lengths to where you can

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.799 
different lengths to where you can
create<00:00:53.850> stripes<00:00:54.750> fair<00:00:55.620> isle<00:00:55.800> patterns<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.909> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
create stripes fair isle patterns and a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
create stripes fair isle patterns and a
lot<00:00:58.049> of<00:00:58.170> different<00:00:58.470> colors<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.860> those<00:00:59.070> those

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
lot of different colors so those those

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.060 
lot of different colors so those those
are<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.820> always<00:01:00.150> consistent<00:01:00.360> now<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.409> number

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
are not always consistent now the number

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.490 
are not always consistent now the number
of<00:01:02.190> stitches<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.909> you<00:01:03.120> use<00:01:03.659> really<00:01:04.170> affects

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
of stitches that you use really affects

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.610 
of stitches that you use really affects
the<00:01:04.710> width<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.190> the<00:01:05.339> pattern<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.060> develop

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
the width of the pattern as they develop

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.200 
the width of the pattern as they develop
generally<00:01:07.620> most<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:08.190> these<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.090> be

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
generally most of these are going to be

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.789 
generally most of these are going to be
more<00:01:09.390> pronounced<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.290> working<00:01:10.470> with

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
more pronounced when you're working with

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.370 
more pronounced when you're working with
knitting<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> crochet<00:01:12.330> also<00:01:12.960> creates

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
knitting but the crochet also creates

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.370 
knitting but the crochet also creates
some<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:14.100> interesting<00:01:14.400> patterns<00:01:15.380> now

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
some really interesting patterns now

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.880 
some really interesting patterns now
here<00:01:16.800> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.280> see<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.580> multis<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.890> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
here you can see the multis on the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.550 
here you can see the multis on the
knitted<00:01:20.160> piece<00:01:20.420> they<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.660> either<00:01:22.260> create

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
knitted piece they can either create

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.650 
knitted piece they can either create
stripes<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.400> sometimes<00:01:23.910> they'll<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.480> like

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
stripes or sometimes they'll be like

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.780 
stripes or sometimes they'll be like
little<00:01:24.840> blocks<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.350> color<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.860> maybe<00:01:26.070> pool<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
little blocks of color or maybe pool and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.840 
little blocks of color or maybe pool and
with<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.390> crochet<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.230> starts<00:01:29.130> creating<00:01:29.580> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
with the crochet it starts creating a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.190 
with the crochet it starts creating a
little<00:01:30.060> bit<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.330> different<00:01:30.690> pattern<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
little bit of a different pattern and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.810 
little bit of a different pattern and
you<00:01:31.290> start<00:01:31.530> getting<00:01:31.620> diagonal<00:01:32.280> stripes<00:01:32.550> with

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you start getting diagonal stripes with

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.530 
you start getting diagonal stripes with
that<00:01:33.060> also<00:01:33.500> with<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.830> hat<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:36.060> using<00:01:36.480> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that also with the hat that's using a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.180 
that also with the hat that's using a
garter<00:01:36.870> stitch<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.950> actually

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
garter stitch and that's actually

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.940 
garter stitch and that's actually
creating<00:01:38.790> striping<00:01:39.450> patterns<00:01:40.080> so<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.440> know

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
creating striping patterns so you know

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.260 
creating striping patterns so you know
your<00:01:41.130> different<00:01:41.460> stitches<00:01:41.640> your<00:01:41.910> different

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
your different stitches your different

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.760 
your different stitches your different
widths<00:01:42.540> will<00:01:42.720> create<00:01:43.050> different<00:01:43.440> patterns

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
widths will create different patterns

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.610 
widths will create different patterns
for<00:01:44.010> you<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.820> center<00:01:45.150> we<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.480> an<00:01:46.050> ombre

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
for you in the center we have an ombre

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.140 
for you in the center we have an ombre
and<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.890> varied<00:01:49.890> shades<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.610> one

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
and that is the varied shades of one

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.510 
and that is the varied shades of one
color<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.690> again<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.620> creates<00:01:53.010> when<00:01:53.370> you're

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
color and again that creates when you're

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.000 
color and again that creates when you're
knitting<00:01:53.670> which<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.660> top<00:01:54.810> piece<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.830> can

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
knitting which is the top piece you can

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.060 
knitting which is the top piece you can
get<00:01:56.370> a<00:01:56.400> striping<00:01:56.909> pattern<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.470> striping

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
get a striping pattern and the striping

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.770 
get a striping pattern and the striping
pattern<00:01:59.250> also<00:01:59.550> develops<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.330> crochet

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
pattern also develops in the crochet

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.750 
pattern also develops in the crochet
however<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.650> get<00:02:01.830> like<00:02:01.980> little<00:02:02.130> blips<00:02:02.550> of

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
however it you get like little blips of

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.399 
however it you get like little blips of
color<00:02:03.000> again<00:02:03.450> depending<00:02:04.080> on<00:02:04.170> how<00:02:04.350> many

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
color again depending on how many

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.059 
color again depending on how many
stitches<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:06.360> stitch<00:02:06.680> technique<00:02:07.680> that

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
stitches and the stitch technique that

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.399 
stitches and the stitch technique that
you're<00:02:08.220> using<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.729> then<00:02:09.209> we<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.569> our<00:02:09.720> prints

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
you're using and then we have our prints

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.070 
you're using and then we have our prints
on<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> end<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.360> those<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.569> lot<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.840> fun

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
on the end and those are a lot of fun

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.330 
on the end and those are a lot of fun
because<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.379> really<00:02:13.860> never<00:02:13.980> know<00:02:14.099> what

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
because you really never know what

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.740 
because you really never know what
you're<00:02:14.489> going<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.730> get<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.209> get<00:02:15.390> stripe

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
