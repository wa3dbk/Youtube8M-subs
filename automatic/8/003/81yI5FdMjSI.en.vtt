that edge right there okay so the bottom

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.289 
that edge right there okay so the bottom
looks<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.850> split<00:02:06.149> right

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
looks like this it's just a split right
