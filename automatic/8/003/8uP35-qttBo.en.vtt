00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
with the carbon limbs so the concept

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
with the carbon limbs so the concept
behind<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.780> obviously<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> make<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> mark

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
behind this is obviously to make a mark

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.770 
behind this is obviously to make a mark
on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> target

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
on the target

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.690 
on the target
right<00:01:39.140> exactly<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:39.890> if<00:01:39.950> retard<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.340> step<00:01:40.580> on

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
right exactly so if retard to step on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.100 
right exactly so if retard to step on
the<00:01:40.880> target<00:01:41.180> world<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.390> show<00:01:41.540> up<00:01:41.660> that<00:01:41.690> you're

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
the target world to show up that you're

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.840 
the target world to show up that you're
both<00:01:42.230> ten<00:01:42.620> can<00:01:42.830> beat<00:01:43.010> and<00:01:43.220> they<00:01:43.310> will<00:01:43.460> compete
