okay this video I'm gonna just explain

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.950 
okay this video I'm gonna just explain
to<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.550> about<00:00:08.670> these<00:00:08.910> new<00:00:09.240> by<00:00:09.389> data<00:00:09.660> link

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
to you about these new by data link

to you about these new by data link
connect<00:00:10.580> tea<00:00:11.580> harnesses<00:00:12.030> are<00:00:12.179> they<00:00:12.269> I'd

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
connect tea harnesses are they I'd

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.480 
connect tea harnesses are they I'd
coming<00:00:12.719> out<00:00:12.840> these<00:00:13.620> are<00:00:13.830> kind<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.099> similar<00:00:14.429> to

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
coming out these are kind of similar to

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.480 
coming out these are kind of similar to
me<00:00:14.969> as<00:00:15.179> far<00:00:15.420> as<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.719> think<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> Ford<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
me as far as I think like the Ford and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.970 
me as far as I think like the Ford and
Evo<00:00:17.789> series<00:00:18.150> they<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.510> Evo<00:00:18.810> CHR<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> t1

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
Evo series they have the Evo CHR the t1

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.390 
Evo series they have the Evo CHR the t1
t2<00:00:20.600> this<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:21.840> here<00:00:22.140> would<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.160> equivalent

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
t2 this one here would be the equivalent

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.269 
t2 this one here would be the equivalent
of<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.789> t1<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> newer<00:00:25.080> tip<00:00:25.470> style<00:00:25.769> keys

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
of the t1 for the newer tip style keys

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.029 
of the t1 for the newer tip style keys
and<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.420> harness<00:00:27.630> will<00:00:28.050> pretty<00:00:28.500> painlessly

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
and this harness will pretty painlessly

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.460 
and this harness will pretty painlessly
integrate<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> must<00:00:30.660> say<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> big<00:00:31.260> fan

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
integrate and I must say I'm a big fan

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.560 
integrate and I must say I'm a big fan
of<00:00:31.500> my<00:00:31.710> dad<00:00:31.949> oh<00:00:31.980> my<00:00:32.160> god<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.940> company<00:00:33.329> I

this<00:00:36.329> stuff<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> reliable<00:00:37.440> easy<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.920> program

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
this stuff is reliable easy to program

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.840 
this stuff is reliable easy to program
and<00:00:38.719> it<00:00:39.719> stalls<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.890> fast<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.489> mean<00:00:41.700> with

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
and it stalls really fast I mean with

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.760 
and it stalls really fast I mean with
this<00:00:41.940> harness<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.420> mean<00:00:42.570> how<00:00:42.660> how<00:00:43.379> much<00:00:43.530> fast

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
this harness I mean how how much fast

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.700 
this harness I mean how how much fast
can<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.100> possibly<00:00:44.550> go<00:00:44.760> look<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.590> that's<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
can you possibly go look at a that's a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.520 
can you possibly go look at a that's a
winner<00:00:47.510> that's<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.750> winner<00:00:48.960> chicken<00:00:49.379> dinner

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
winner that's a winner chicken dinner

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.270 
winner that's a winner chicken dinner
right<00:00:49.739> there<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.539> got<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:52.280> this

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
right there and we got this one this

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.139 
right there and we got this one this
here<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.699> called<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.149> CH<00:00:54.809> 5<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.710> 5<00:00:56.090> would<00:00:57.090> be

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
here is called the CH 5 the 5 would be

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.000 
here is called the CH 5 the 5 would be
again<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.050> quit<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.590> Evo<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
again that you quit one of that Evo and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
again that you quit one of that Evo and
fortin<00:00:59.609> would<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.570> their<00:01:00.809> team<00:01:01.820> two<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
fortin would be their team two to the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.899 
fortin would be their team two to the
older<00:01:04.140> type<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.559> century<00:01:04.920> keys<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.760> what

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
older type of century keys you know what

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.929 
older type of century keys you know what
the<00:01:06.060> remotes<00:01:06.689> built<00:01:07.020> into<00:01:07.350> them<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.939> keys

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the remotes built into them and keys

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.880 
the remotes built into them and keys
like<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.710> this<00:01:10.710> would<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.040> side<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
like that this would be one side of the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
like that this would be one side of the
plug<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.250> would<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> other<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.659> if

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
plug and this would be the other so if

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.460 
plug and this would be the other so if
you<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.259> long<00:01:16.500> flat<00:01:16.830> plug<00:01:17.990> then<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> CH

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you have that long flat plug then the CH

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.859 
you have that long flat plug then the CH
5<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.330> but<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.630> newer

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
5 is for you but if you have a newer

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.890 
5 is for you but if you have a newer
vehicle<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> tech<00:01:22.650> key<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> one

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
vehicle with a tech key this is the one

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.539 
vehicle with a tech key this is the one
you<00:01:25.020> want<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> pick<00:01:25.590> up

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.520 

both<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.299> them<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.570> think<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.960> great<00:01:31.170> I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
both of them I think of great I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.700 
both of them I think of great I
definitely<00:01:32.250> suggest<00:01:32.850> getting<00:01:33.299> nice<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.680> had

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
definitely suggest getting nice if I had

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.770 
definitely suggest getting nice if I had
this<00:01:35.100> type<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> scenario<00:01:36.000> my<00:01:36.450> own<00:01:36.570> car

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
this type of scenario my own car

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.740 
this type of scenario my own car
actually<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:38.369> 300<00:01:38.940> actually<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.300> would<00:01:39.450> I

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
actually I do my 300 actually I would I

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.690 
actually I do my 300 actually I would I
set<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.890> work<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.159> went<00:01:41.310> through<00:01:41.520> what

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
set up all the work I went through what

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700 
set up all the work I went through what
I<00:01:41.729> much<00:01:42.000> rather<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.720> they<00:01:43.320> just<00:01:43.560> keep

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
I much rather have this they just keep

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.719 
I much rather have this they just keep
coming<00:01:43.830> out<00:01:44.040> with<00:01:44.100> use<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.369> they<00:01:44.430> were<00:01:44.549> better

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
coming out with use and they were better

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.960 
coming out with use and they were better
Pollack<00:01:45.150> so<00:01:45.270> what's<00:01:45.450> our<00:01:46.070> but<00:01:47.070> definitely

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
Pollack so what's our but definitely

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270 
Pollack so what's our but definitely
well<00:01:48.060> worth<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> saves<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.680> time<00:01:49.860> makes

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
well worth it if it saves you time makes

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.120 
well worth it if it saves you time makes
a<00:01:50.340> job<00:01:50.550> go<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:50.880> less<00:01:51.000> painlessly<00:01:51.619> I'm<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.860> for

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
a job go or less painlessly I'm all for

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.219 
a job go or less painlessly I'm all for
it<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.090> that's<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.570> these<00:01:54.780> are<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> new<00:01:55.080> wide
