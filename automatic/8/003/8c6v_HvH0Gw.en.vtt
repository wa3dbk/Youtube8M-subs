00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hello everyone, Sanya, and today I would 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.730
 I wanted to tell you why you shouldn't 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.809
 buy iphone 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.160
 Well, any iphone at all on Ali Express 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.740
 In this case, I have an iphone 3gs 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.240
 as you can see by the box for this 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.699
 here let's start with the box to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.510
 she certainly has no complaints except 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.510
 here is the backdrop 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.039
 everything is stuck to me it seems they just 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.679
 printed out some kind of quality 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.469
 printer sting that on printing principle 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.530
 not bad here and just glued so here 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.969
 let's open this very crab 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:50.879
 plastic quality is very hard here 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:57.300
 we have a series booklet here everything is there except 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:59.940
 of course, there are stickers 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.960
 the stickers here all wo n't show everything 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.689
 that is, it is all very high quality 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.720
 everything is very good here 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.439
 european charging usb cable and 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.560
 headphones headphones are not original Well 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.189
 Quality not up a little bit not to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.740
 overlay original and remove now 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.400
 Highlander apparatus has a box in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.009
 principle is very good, it is even convex 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.020
 all is very cool here we go to the very 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.990
 the apparatus 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:39.030
 what are the shortcomings under it first is 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.590
 here it is here a chip on here is cracked here and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.509
 here, too, began to crack besides 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.820
 Headphone input is very poor quality 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.850
 for the second or third time I wanted 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.000
 I stopped listening to music 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.820
 work one ear and then and generally 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.200
 it all stopped working 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.380
 cant very powerful well what I wanted 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.570
 listen to a lot of music but i have 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.340
 it didn't work out 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.300
 here you can see the button uneven but it 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.250
 so already nagging of course 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:19.670
 the biggest cant is his screen that with 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.030
 the screen here we have these side parts they 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:28.580
 simply do not work here example 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:35.510
 the letter th thats not working erase me too 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:40.460
 I still can not pick the same numbers here 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:50.990
 I can not here this of course marriage can be seen 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:53.480
 if I get close I can 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.420
 I calmly push this here 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.990
 should not be 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:04.730
 This is of course a very big minus 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:08.360
 This unit is the main such 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.280
 vaccinations but indicate an instance can 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.600
 be something of your own 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.930
 that's exactly the way 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:21.040
 OSes are all good enough here 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:28.640
 There is no official Nikita 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:32.560
 demonstrate in this device here 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:36.320
 version 616 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.200
 everything is quite good, that is why 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.730
 everything works well and that is not yet 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.480
 it works like this it’s already native 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:52.010
 the most recent is nike + ipod 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:56.750
 it doesn't work here 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.660
 spend now is a program and computers 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.930
 we all work does not mean to earn and 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:08.480
 no but it works for us all here chassis 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:12.370
 we all work well, shows the nike 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:16.630
 + ipod of course work does not want something 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.630
 I do not use this phone now 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.270
 but you know there is such a cant what 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:29.310
 use the phone all flawlessly 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:32.820
 hear well hear it well so 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.060
 jambs no that's a good machine but 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.090
 gets dirty very quickly spoils so 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.570
 better to put on the film right away so i found 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.650
 where it is but when we walk to it like that 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:50.190
 and get settled and we should he 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.220
 activate i walked this time nothing 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.750
 it does not work like that 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.940
 maybe not either he's spoiled I don't know 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.910
 what to do here is such a joint 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.200
 that while the world and yes the camera is ok well 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.520
 as original articles say the same camera 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:17.700
 what can be done to give the same 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:24.870
 box focus here you see the text 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:27.530
 very good us we look under 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.550
 the cameras here are original 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:34.170
 a little bit not very much and can be done 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.650
 to see what the Chinese would not have camera 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.350
 was able 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.490
 name on iphone can there on others 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:45.030
 I could not have any devices but here 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:48.240
 Well, I turned it on 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:51.960
 the application does not matter here 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.300
 enough device we can it 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.270
 That my copy is so caught can 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:02.780
 other all is well well, that's mine 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:07.260
 so here is the bottom of the chips so far no 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:11.160
 but this is probably for now I don't know here 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.900
 that's all very well until the swami was 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.490
 sledge 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.950
 I hope you liked this video was 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:21.090
 informative and you will not be mistaken 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.980
 as i'm on everything until new meetings in 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.250
 new commercials 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:29.910
 so I found somewhere there but when we 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.740
 We go here to shake the device 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.110
 and we should activate it 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.320
 found note 3 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.840
 nothing works like this 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.890
 the sensor may not be or it is spoiled 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.600
 I don't know what to do with this 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.690
 here cant that while the world and yes the camera 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.230
 normal well as the original whether 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:57.320
 of course the camera is what can be done 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.320
 give the same box focus 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:09.930
 You see the text is very good 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.990
 we will look under the cameras here 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:16.980
 original 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:18.600
 a little bit not very much and can be done 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.780
 see what a chinese camera wouldn’t 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:25.920
 could name on iphone can there on others 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:29.460
 devices could but not here and here 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:32.670
 I turned it on 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:36.390
 the application does not matter here 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:38.730
 enough device we can it 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.700
 That my copy is so caught can 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:47.240
 other all is well well, that's mine 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:51.690
 so here is the bottom of the chips so far no 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:55.560
 but this is probably for now I don't know here 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:58.740
