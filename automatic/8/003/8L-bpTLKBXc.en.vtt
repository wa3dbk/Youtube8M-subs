00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
here it's going through everything is

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.030 
here it's going through everything is
going<00:01:15.270> through<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> MOT<00:01:15.869> let's<00:01:16.680> go<00:01:16.830> through

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
going through a MOT let's go through

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.999 
going through a MOT let's go through
steadyshot<00:01:18.170> it's<00:01:19.170> gonna<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.470> another<00:01:19.650> steady

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
steadyshot it's gonna do another steady

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.240 
steadyshot it's gonna do another steady
shot<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.420> there's<00:01:22.140> my<00:01:22.350> barrage<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:23.009> there

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
shot and there's my barrage right there

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.789 
shot and there's my barrage right there
and<00:01:24.210> -<00:01:25.080> another<00:01:25.290> steady<00:01:26.420> into<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.540> aimed<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and - another steady into it aimed and

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.890 
and - another steady into it aimed and
I'm<00:01:29.280> never<00:01:29.490> sitting<00:01:29.729> at<00:01:29.909> full<00:01:30.090> focus<00:01:30.299> casting

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
I'm never sitting at full focus casting

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.780 
I'm never sitting at full focus casting
steady<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.070> improvement<00:01:32.549> over

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
steady so that's one improvement over

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
steady so that's one improvement over
the<00:01:32.909> last<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:38.210> once<00:01:39.210> again<00:01:39.329> that's<00:01:39.630> going

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the last one and once again that's going

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.780 
the last one and once again that's going
to<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> popping<00:01:40.380> up

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.770 

steady<00:01:44.790> shot<00:01:45.060> steady<00:01:45.630> shot<00:01:45.900> a<00:01:46.760> barrage<00:01:47.780> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
steady shot steady shot a barrage and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.300 
steady shot steady shot a barrage and
then<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.290> as<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.799> see<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> murder

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310

of crows is going on in there so this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.690

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
kill shot in a separate macro and I will

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.729 
kill shot in a separate macro and I will
also<00:02:58.180> put<00:02:58.420> my<00:02:58.540> kill<00:02:58.780> shot<00:02:58.989> macro<00:02:59.320> there<00:02:59.560> it's

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
also put my kill shot macro there it's

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.210 
also put my kill shot macro there it's
gonna<00:02:59.830> be<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:01.360> one<00:03:01.570> right<00:03:01.690> here<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.230> like<00:03:03.070> it

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
gonna be this one right here I like it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.340 
gonna be this one right here I like it
because<00:03:03.370> it's<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:04.000> stop<00:03:04.269> casting<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:05.019> if<00:03:05.230> you're

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
because it's a stop casting so if you're

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.400 
because it's a stop casting so if you're
in<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.470> middle<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:05.890> cast<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:07.690> can<00:03:08.049> go<00:03:08.290> ahead

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
in the middle of a cast you can go ahead

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.580 
in the middle of a cast you can go ahead
and<00:03:08.860> use<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.549> so<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.750> stops<00:03:11.110> doing<00:03:11.320> whatever

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
and use that so it stops doing whatever

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.699 
and use that so it stops doing whatever
and<00:03:11.799> cast<00:03:12.489> kill<00:03:12.760> shot<00:03:13.260> alright<00:03:14.260> there<00:03:14.440> we<00:03:14.560> go

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
and cast kill shot alright there we go

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.770 
and cast kill shot alright there we go
