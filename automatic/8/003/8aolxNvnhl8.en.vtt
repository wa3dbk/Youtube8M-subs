00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
that um I don't know why we've probably

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.810

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
design I think they continued it was

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.810 
design I think they continued it was
with<00:03:10.120> others<00:03:10.989> I<00:03:11.350> don't<00:03:11.530> know<00:03:11.709> but<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.610> beak

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820
