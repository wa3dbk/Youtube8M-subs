00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.700
 What is the meaning of life 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.840
 and we do here 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.230
 because we are here 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.539
 but the most important 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.539
 why are we here 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.700
 suddenly one day we are born 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.690
 we grow 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.690
 and we die 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.450
 and it is already 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.450
 and in the middle of what 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.290
 we learn we work we love we believe 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.010
 we cry we doubt we are wrong 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.280
 but 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.820
 why 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.820
 why 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.300
 in the end we will all be a memory in the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.940
 mind of someone 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.810
 a picture 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.140
 a video 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.830
 an anecdote 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.250
 [Music] 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.860
 hundreds of billions of people have 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.909
 been before here and what 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.249
 with what purpose 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:24.270
 allow us to be more people 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:26.520
 here but for what purpose 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.229
 our function is to make sure that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.310
 someone else will stay after we 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.610
 let's go for what 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.690
 to leave others more and those to others and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.020
 then others and so on until 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.850
 we've been doing this for thousands of years and 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.800
 nothing changes 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.670
 we do not know anything 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:55.140
 we evolved, we improve or we get worse 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.040
 depending on what you look at- we live more years more 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.270
 comfortable or just the opposite 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.400
 100 years ago only 100 years a letter 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.360
 it took weeks or even months to 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.360
 get from one city to another 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.500
 today 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.160
 in a second you tell someone of 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.140
 japan hello 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.290
 is that 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:25.620
 evolve approaching us 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.660
 if that's because we destroy ourselves with 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.660
 so much ease 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.640
 [Music] 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.460
 I believe that life has no 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.830
 purpose in itself because the goal 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.180
 that we are here is casual and for 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.180
 definition something that happens by 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.730
 chance is not premeditated then no 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.320
 has no purpose or objective in itself 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.470
 same 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.510
 [Music] 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.500
 and it is already 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.660
 life is that 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.400
 a combination of circumstances that do not 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.890
 can be foreseen or avoided without any 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.650
 sense without any purpose 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.280
 I believe that there is precisely the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.700
 key 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.260
 [Music] 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.879
 the perpetuation of the species say some 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.260
 to transcend beyond the 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.900
 facts say others 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.530
 evolve seek wisdom and 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.480
 knowledge make a better world 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.370
 achieve union with God to get the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.980
 purity of the soul there are people who defend 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.890
 that the very meaning of life lies 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.739
 in trying to find it and there are people who 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.379
 says that life does not make sense because 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.510
 the world is a horrible, aggressive place and 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.420
 destructive 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.670
 the question is that we all try 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.520
 call it somehow 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.280
 [Music] 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.260
 I believe that the meaning of life is 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.590
 something that we have invented because 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.710
 as humans with abstract reasoning 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.720
 we need to understand assimilate 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:00.490
 find a meaning or purpose for 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.490
 justify our existence 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.760
 I call it that 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.829
 you call it what you want but what does not 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.270
 is going to change is that what really 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.110
 matter is the way 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.220
 where we go 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.220
 [Music] 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.120
 whatever the purpose, the objective of 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.650
 our lives 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.310
 the meaning of life 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:29.419
 is that the meaning of life does not matter 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.120
 what matters is growing to be better 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.080
 generous try to find that 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:40.600
 what we know how to do and exploit it to the fullest 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:46.010
 love to think have fun be critical 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.120
 sincere coherent proactive and always 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.090
 live according to our 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.960
 possibilities and faithful to our 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.940
 criterion 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.000
 all of that is what my parents have 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.860
 taught 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.860
 I think it 's a very good start 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.480
 and you 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.330
