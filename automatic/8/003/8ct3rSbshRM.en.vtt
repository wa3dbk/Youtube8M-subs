00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 hi everyone here is the review of 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 new iphone 5 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.400
 then we have a retina screen with 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.049
 a diagonal of 4 inches and we have 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.150
 1136 x 640 pixels 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:21.420
 the thickness is only 7.6 mm and the weight is 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.480
 of only 112 grams materials on the back 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.640
 they are aluminum and glass 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.130
 now the iphone 5 supports lte networks 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.430
 which unfortunately are not yet present 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.480
 in Italy but according to some operators 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.500
 they won't be short, the battery has one 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.350
 duration of about 8 hours so it is excellent e 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 now let's move on to the camera camera 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.750
 8 megapixel video that records video in hd 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.760
 at 1080p 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.910
 then we have the front camera from 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.820
 1.3 megapixel video recording hd a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.570
 720p 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:08.280
 let's see some photos I took 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:12.330
 first how can we see the colors are 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.900
 excellent and even if zummo the image does not 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.900
 shells 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.170
 here is a photo with panorama function 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.250
 and now we see a short video 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.859
 now we see the front camera 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.750
 this is a picture and then we see it a 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.859
 short video of the front camera in 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.859
 hd at 720p 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:18.049
 we have rear autofocus camera 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.370
 led flash and face detection 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.720
 video stabilization and mode 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.930
 panorama 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.230
 so regarding the camera 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.930
 iphone 5 is really great now we pass 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.900
 the navigation on Internet 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.900
 we look for a site such as free 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:49.760
 call and now let's go to the version 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.760
 desktop and see how long it loads 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:01.340
 as we can see it was really 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:07.410
 very fast now let's see if it's fluid yes 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:10.280
 we are also the zoom mode is a 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.280
 full screen 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.280
 therefore also with regard to the league 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.580
 but internet surfing on iphone 5 is 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.350
 great now let's move on to the music and 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.120
 we see 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.120
 the volume the quality of the device 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.900
 then we hear this song on the volume 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.900
 maximum 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.540
 at that time the volume is quite high 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:03.120
 and maintains an excellent quality now 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:06.489
 we also find the new airpod headphones 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.530
 with which it feels really good and have 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:14.349
 even the excellent bass we have now 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.180
 example a game unfortunately are not there 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.880
 still many optimized for no 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:31.470
 4-inch display 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:31.470
 we try bad pd we are against the Hon 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:52.450
 we can't see really fluid e 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:54.760
 also very fast then I can say that 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:59.080
 apple really did a great job 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:02.760
 with this iphone 5 that holds up very well 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.590
 comparison with new smartphones 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.750
