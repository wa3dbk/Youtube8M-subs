00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
okay this echoes dual impacts a place

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.660 
okay this echoes dual impacts a place
across<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.720> mixer<00:01:48.320> there<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.070> goes<00:01:49.250> again

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
across the mixer there it goes again

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.730 
across the mixer there it goes again

particles<00:01:52.370> are<00:01:52.580> so<00:01:53.120> flexible<00:01:53.800> so<00:01:54.800> where<00:01:54.950> you

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
particles are so flexible so where you

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.880 
particles are so flexible so where you
can<00:01:55.220> rule<00:01:55.340> out<00:01:55.490> for<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:57.290> same<00:01:57.530> thing<00:01:57.560> with

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
can rule out for you the same thing with

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.530 
can rule out for you the same thing with
luck<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.220> all<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.370> this<00:01:59.030> Cindy<00:01:59.420> crystal

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
luck to all of this Cindy crystal

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.080 
luck to all of this Cindy crystal
silicon<00:02:00.080> seaside<00:02:00.410> okay<00:02:00.710> now<00:02:01.090> controlling

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
silicon seaside okay now controlling

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.680 
silicon seaside okay now controlling
this<00:02:02.360> deck<00:02:03.200> with<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.620> controller<00:02:04.330> maybe<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:05.450> also

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
this deck with a controller maybe I also

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.889 
this deck with a controller maybe I also
want<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.170> control<00:02:06.620> some<00:02:06.890> other<00:02:07.070> neck<00:02:07.869> with<00:02:08.869> the

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
want to control some other neck with the

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.040 
want to control some other neck with the
same<00:02:09.200> controller

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.170 

so<00:02:13.620> then<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.220> decide<00:02:14.520> here<00:02:14.850> and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so then you can just decide here and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.080 
so then you can just decide here and
this<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.390> authority<00:02:15.930> over<00:02:16.110> here<00:02:16.940> then<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.060> can

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
this is authority over here then you can

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:29.800 
this is authority over here then you can
also<00:02:18.360> work<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.200> with

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.960 

but<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.560> really<00:02:30.709> big<00:02:30.920> big<00:02:31.310> thing<00:02:31.520> about<00:02:31.640> this

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
but the really big big thing about this

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.809 
but the really big big thing about this
is<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.180> while<00:02:33.080> I'm<00:02:33.230> playing<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:33.890> track

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
is that while I'm playing this track

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.130 
is that while I'm playing this track
here<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:36.370> can<00:02:37.370> also<00:02:37.550> call<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.330> timeline<00:02:38.780> edit

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
here I can also call the timeline edit

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.320 
here I can also call the timeline edit
