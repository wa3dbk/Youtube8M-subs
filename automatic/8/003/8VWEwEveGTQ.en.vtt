is<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.340> makes<00:00:17.520> me<00:00:17.700> very<00:00:17.940> happy

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.000 

that<00:00:48.780> car<00:00:49.050> has<00:00:49.230> been<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:50.040> a<00:00:50.070> long<00:00:50.550> time

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
that car has been here for a long time

that car has been here for a long time
here<00:00:53.010> car<00:00:53.340> got<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:54.150> subject<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.600> this

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
here car got here the subject of this

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.990 
here car got here the subject of this
came<00:00:54.900> up<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.530> too<00:00:55.710> long<00:00:55.860> ago<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.400> that<00:00:56.460> was

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
came up not too long ago and that was

came up not too long ago and that was
octane<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.710> today<00:00:59.010> we're<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.670> talk

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
octane so today we're going to talk

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.450 
octane so today we're going to talk
about<00:00:59.880> octane<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.890> how<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.040> works<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.430> your

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
about octane and how it works in your

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.549 
about octane and how it works in your
car<00:01:02.760> we're<00:01:03.150> going<00:01:03.240> to<00:01:03.330> try<00:01:03.480> something<00:01:03.750> cool

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
car we're going to try something cool

and fun so I'm going to try and explain

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.230 
and fun so I'm going to try and explain
the<00:01:07.410> principles<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> four-stroke<00:01:09.000> cycle

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the principles of the four-stroke cycle

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.510 
the principles of the four-stroke cycle
and<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> gasoline<00:01:10.050> engine<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.340> we're

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
and a gasoline engine and for that we're

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.410 
and a gasoline engine and for that we're
going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> head<00:01:11.820> back<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> studio<00:01:14.390> Hey

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
going to head back to the studio Hey

going to head back to the studio Hey
here<00:01:16.230> we<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.730> back<00:01:17.730> at<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:18.000> studio<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.570> didn't

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
here we are back at the studio I didn't

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.359 
here we are back at the studio I didn't
feel<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.140> combing<00:01:19.440> my<00:01:19.560> hair<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.950> put<00:01:20.160> on<00:01:20.250> my

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
feel like combing my hair so I put on my

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.180 
feel like combing my hair so I put on my
hat<00:01:20.580> let's<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.690> shall<00:01:21.720> we

hat let's get to it shall we

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.710 
hat let's get to it shall we
there<00:01:23.190> are<00:01:23.340> four<00:01:23.550> parts<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> combustion

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
there are four parts to the combustion

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.480 
there are four parts to the combustion
cycle<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.560> gasoline<00:01:25.979> engine

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
cycle in a gasoline engine

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.770 
cycle in a gasoline engine
there's<00:01:27.270> intake<00:01:28.550> compression<00:01:29.550> power<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
there's intake compression power and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.219 
there's intake compression power and
exhaust<00:01:31.820> there's<00:01:32.820> those<00:01:33.119> four<00:01:33.509> steps<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
exhaust there's those four steps in the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.460 
exhaust there's those four steps in the
process<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:35.090> burning<00:01:36.090> gasoline<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
process of burning gasoline in a

process of burning gasoline in a
combustion<00:01:38.250> engine<00:01:38.720> okay<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.320> come

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
combustion engine okay here we come

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.790 
combustion engine okay here we come
flying<00:01:41.160> inside<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.180> your<00:01:42.300> engine<00:01:42.660> as<00:01:42.900> if<00:01:43.619> we

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
flying inside of your engine as if we

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.650 
flying inside of your engine as if we
had<00:01:43.950> x-ray<00:01:44.490> vision<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.150> we're<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
had x-ray vision and we're going to

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.450 
had x-ray vision and we're going to
break<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.500> four<00:01:46.710> phases<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
break down the four phases of the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.390 
break down the four phases of the
combustion<00:01:47.820> process<00:01:48.650> here<00:01:49.650> for<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.190> see

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
combustion process here for you to see

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.090 
combustion process here for you to see
now<00:01:50.880> we're<00:01:51.570> gonna<00:01:51.659> stop<00:01:52.110> right<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.620> rewind

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
now we're gonna stop right there rewind

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.720 
now we're gonna stop right there rewind
a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.340> bit

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
a little bit

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.090 
a little bit
and<00:01:54.150> we're<00:01:54.870> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> start<00:01:55.260> with<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> intake

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
and we're going to start with the intake

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.940 
and we're going to start with the intake
stroke<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.840> intake<00:01:58.200> stroke<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.710> where<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
stroke the intake stroke is where the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.570 
stroke the intake stroke is where the
piston<00:01:59.159> moves<00:01:59.760> downward<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.770> as<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.800> result<00:02:02.370> it

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
piston moves downward and as a result it

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.180 
piston moves downward and as a result it
creates<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.210> negative<00:02:03.930> pressure<00:02:04.140> zone<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
creates a negative pressure zone and

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.020 
creates a negative pressure zone and
that<00:02:05.550> negative<00:02:06.000> pressure<00:02:06.030> zone<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:08.100> filled

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
that negative pressure zone is filled

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.930 
that negative pressure zone is filled
with<00:02:09.630> atmospheric<00:02:09.929> pressure<00:02:10.610> now<00:02:11.610> there<00:02:11.820> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
with atmospheric pressure now there is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.720 
with atmospheric pressure now there is
no<00:02:12.150> such<00:02:12.420> thing<00:02:12.690> as<00:02:12.720> suck<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.530> could<00:02:13.709> say<00:02:14.010> you

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
no such thing as suck you could say you

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.460 
no such thing as suck you could say you
could<00:02:14.760> say<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.450> piston<00:02:15.810> moves<00:02:15.930> down<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
could say that the piston moves down and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.860 
could say that the piston moves down and
sucks<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.160> mixture<00:02:17.519> in<00:02:17.670> that's<00:02:18.360> not<00:02:18.570> entirely

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
sucks the mixture in that's not entirely

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.280 
sucks the mixture in that's not entirely
true

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
true

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.259 
true
what<00:02:19.590> actually<00:02:19.860> happens<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.820> atmospheric

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
what actually happens is atmospheric

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.030 
what actually happens is atmospheric
pressure<00:02:22.519> forces<00:02:23.989> itself<00:02:24.989> into<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.739> empty

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
pressure forces itself into that empty

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.449 
pressure forces itself into that empty
space<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:27.600> it's<00:02:27.750> taking<00:02:28.290> fuel<00:02:28.709> along<00:02:29.010> with<00:02:29.250> it

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
space and it's taking fuel along with it

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.470 
space and it's taking fuel along with it
so<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:30.030> air<00:02:31.130> combined<00:02:32.130> with<00:02:32.310> fuel<00:02:32.580> rushes

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
so the air combined with fuel rushes

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.930 
so the air combined with fuel rushes
into<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.720> cylinder<00:02:34.250> because<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.459> created<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
into the cylinder because it created a

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.580 
into the cylinder because it created a
negative<00:02:36.120> space<00:02:36.600> there<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.410> no<00:02:37.830> suck<00:02:38.480> anyway

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
negative space there is no suck anyway

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.680 
negative space there is no suck anyway
the<00:02:40.590> next<00:02:40.890> part<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.549> what<00:02:42.239> pertains

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
the next part of this is what pertains

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.259 
the next part of this is what pertains
to<00:02:42.810> octane<00:02:43.340> what<00:02:44.340> you'll<00:02:44.459> notice<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
to octane what you'll notice is is the

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.280 
to octane what you'll notice is is the
piston<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.750> all<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.350> way<00:02:46.470> down<00:02:46.739> here<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.269> it

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
piston is all the way down here and it

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.620 
piston is all the way down here and it
has<00:02:49.290> drawn<00:02:49.799> in<00:02:50.040> as<00:02:50.220> much<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.030> mixture<00:02:51.420> that

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
has drawn in as much of the mixture that

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.630 
has drawn in as much of the mixture that
it<00:02:51.720> possibly<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.410> now<00:02:52.650> what's<00:02:53.459> going<00:02:53.610> to

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
it possibly can now what's going to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.309 
it possibly can now what's going to
happen<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.360> intake<00:02:54.690> valves<00:02:55.049> are<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.260> to

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
happen is the intake valves are going to

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.770 
happen is the intake valves are going to
close<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.250> exhaust<00:02:56.580> valves<00:02:56.910> are<00:02:57.030> also<00:02:57.360> closed

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
close the exhaust valves are also closed

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.420 
close the exhaust valves are also closed
and<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.560> piston<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:58.980> going<00:02:59.099> to<00:02:59.160> travel

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
and the piston is going to travel

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.620 
and the piston is going to travel
upwards

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
upwards

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.550 
upwards
this<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.960> important<00:03:01.440> for<00:03:01.860> octane<00:03:02.310> because

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
this is important for octane because

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.130 
this is important for octane because
this<00:03:04.560> dictates<00:03:05.160> what<00:03:05.570> compression<00:03:06.570> ratio<00:03:06.960> is

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
this dictates what compression ratio is

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.290 
this dictates what compression ratio is
and<00:03:07.380> what<00:03:07.470> compression<00:03:07.980> ratio<00:03:08.400> means<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:09.090> is

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
and what compression ratio means is is

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.040 
and what compression ratio means is is
if<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:10.170> take<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.650> volume<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:11.900> given<00:03:12.900> volume

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
if you take a volume a given volume

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.830 
if you take a volume a given volume
which<00:03:13.710> is<00:03:13.980> right<00:03:14.400> here<00:03:14.430> as<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.180> piston<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.630> all

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
which is right here as the piston is all

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.990 
which is right here as the piston is all
the<00:03:16.050> way<00:03:16.170> down<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.680> then<00:03:17.340> compress<00:03:17.790> that

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
the way down and then compress that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.040 
the way down and then compress that
mixture<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:19.940> difference<00:03:20.940> between<00:03:21.300> when<00:03:21.900> it's

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
mixture the difference between when it's

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.480 
mixture the difference between when it's
all<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.410> way<00:03:22.530> down<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.950> when<00:03:23.070> it's<00:03:23.190> all<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
all the way down and when it's all the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.100 
all the way down and when it's all the
way<00:03:23.610> up<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:24.000> referred<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.360> as<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> compression

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
way up is referred to as the compression

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.920 
way up is referred to as the compression
ratio<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.040> let's<00:03:26.910> just<00:03:27.240> say<00:03:27.420> for<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.720> sake<00:03:27.900> of

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
ratio so let's just say for the sake of

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.110 
ratio so let's just say for the sake of
argument<00:03:28.320> this<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.680> eight<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.340> one<00:03:29.520> so<00:03:29.940> this

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
argument this is eight to one so this

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.450 
argument this is eight to one so this
would<00:03:30.330> be<00:03:30.480> eight<00:03:30.930> parts<00:03:31.500> with<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.040> all<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.370> way

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
would be eight parts with it all the way

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.340 
would be eight parts with it all the way
down<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.150> will<00:03:33.270> compress<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.780> into<00:03:34.020> one<00:03:34.230> of

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
down and it will compress it into one of

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.230 
down and it will compress it into one of
those<00:03:34.470> parts<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.370> will<00:03:35.520> be<00:03:35.670> one<00:03:35.880> eighth<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
those parts so it will be one eighth the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.640 
those parts so it will be one eighth the
volume<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.840> was<00:03:37.020> when<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.260> initially

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
volume that it was when it initially

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.220 
volume that it was when it initially
started<00:03:38.390> so<00:03:39.390> that's<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.720> way<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.840> want<00:03:40.050> you<00:03:40.140> to

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
started so that's the way I want you to

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.410 
started so that's the way I want you to
think<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.800> in<00:03:41.430> higher<00:03:41.760> compression

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
think of it and in higher compression

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.020 
think of it and in higher compression
engines<00:03:42.860> it<00:03:43.860> could<00:03:44.040> be<00:03:44.160> as<00:03:44.250> high<00:03:44.280> as<00:03:44.490> eleven

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
engines it could be as high as eleven

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.350 
engines it could be as high as eleven
twelve<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.600> one<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:47.310> creates<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.910> great<00:03:47.970> deal

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
twelve to one this creates a great deal

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.420 
twelve to one this creates a great deal
more<00:03:48.900> heat<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.710> we'll<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.130> that<00:03:50.160> in<00:03:50.310> a

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
more heat and we'll get to that in a

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.070 
more heat and we'll get to that in a
little<00:03:50.670> bit<00:03:50.820> but<00:03:51.060> first<00:03:51.390> let's<00:03:51.600> finish<00:03:51.810> off

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
little bit but first let's finish off

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.710 
little bit but first let's finish off
this<00:03:52.260> cycle<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:52.970> right<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.180> piston<00:03:54.630> is

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
this cycle so right now the piston is

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.120 
this cycle so right now the piston is
all<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.050> way<00:03:55.140> down<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.470> bottom<00:03:55.590> it's

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
all the way down to the bottom it's

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.330 
all the way down to the bottom it's
going<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.370> start<00:03:56.640> traveling<00:03:56.940> upwards<00:03:57.480> and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
going to start traveling upwards and

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.160 
going to start traveling upwards and
compressing<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.520> mixture<00:03:59.910> it'll<00:04:00.840> get<00:04:01.020> all

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
compressing the mixture it'll get all

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.200 
compressing the mixture it'll get all
the<00:04:01.530> way<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.710> the<00:04:01.980> top<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.490> when<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.030> does

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
the way to the top and when it does

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.760 
the way to the top and when it does
you'll<00:04:03.480> notice<00:04:03.720> that's<00:04:03.960> when<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.290> spark<00:04:04.560> plug

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
you'll notice that's when the spark plug

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.490 
you'll notice that's when the spark plug
goes<00:04:04.980> off<00:04:05.220> just<00:04:05.730> just<00:04:06.450> before<00:04:06.990> it's<00:04:07.170> all<00:04:07.380> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
goes off just just before it's all the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.310 
goes off just just before it's all the
way<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.800> top<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.820> piston<00:04:09.270> finishes<00:04:09.810> being

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
way to the top the piston finishes being

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.670 
way to the top the piston finishes being
all<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.530> way<00:04:10.620> at<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.770> top<00:04:10.980> then<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:12.680> mixture

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
all the way at the top then the mixture

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.490 
all the way at the top then the mixture
ignites<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.610> forces<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.570> piston<00:04:15.720> downwards

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
ignites and forces the piston downwards

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.280 
ignites and forces the piston downwards
thus<00:04:16.920> producing<00:04:17.520> power<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.989> power

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
thus producing power this is the power

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.670 
thus producing power this is the power
stroke<00:04:19.710> stroke<00:04:20.700> B<00:04:20.940> or<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.180> phase<00:04:22.109> before<00:04:22.530> this

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
stroke stroke B or the phase before this

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.160 
stroke stroke B or the phase before this
was<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:22.920> compression<00:04:23.520> stroke<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:24.630> is<00:04:24.930> the

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
was the compression stroke this is the

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.740 
was the compression stroke this is the
power<00:04:25.350> stroke<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.130> piston<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:27.210> expanding

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
power stroke so the piston the expanding

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.260 
power stroke so the piston the expanding
mixture<00:04:28.230> forces<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.860> downwards<00:04:29.370> now<00:04:29.970> we've

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
mixture forces it downwards now we've

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.330 
mixture forces it downwards now we've
got<00:04:30.420> a<00:04:30.450> bunch<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.900> burned<00:04:31.290> fuel<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.740> bunch<00:04:32.250> of

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
got a bunch of burned fuel a bunch of

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.340 
got a bunch of burned fuel a bunch of
stuff<00:04:32.610> we<00:04:32.790> really<00:04:33.060> don't<00:04:33.180> need<00:04:33.510> we're<00:04:34.170> going

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
stuff we really don't need we're going

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.110 
stuff we really don't need we're going
to<00:04:34.470> get<00:04:34.650> rid<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.010> in<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.340> exhaust<00:04:35.760> stroke

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
to get rid of it in the exhaust stroke

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.910 
to get rid of it in the exhaust stroke
so<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.480> piston<00:04:36.840> then<00:04:37.050> begins<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.470> travel

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
so the piston then begins to travel

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.060 
so the piston then begins to travel
upward<00:04:38.430> again<00:04:38.930> forcing<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.020> mixture<00:04:40.410> out<00:04:40.650> of

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
upward again forcing the mixture out of

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.360 
upward again forcing the mixture out of
the<00:04:41.160> exhaust<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:43.260> exhaust<00:04:43.530> valves<00:04:43.830> open<00:04:44.220> of

the exhaust the exhaust valves open of
course<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.900> process<00:04:46.350> begins<00:04:46.530> again<00:04:47.120> to

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
course and the process begins again to

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.680 
course and the process begins again to
where<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:49.440> piston<00:04:49.830> moves<00:04:49.920> down<00:04:50.330> draws<00:04:51.330> in<00:04:51.570> the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
where the piston moves down draws in the

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.760 
where the piston moves down draws in the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.339 
and fuel now the reason why a cane is
important<00:05:20.379> is<00:05:20.500> because<00:05:21.240> octane<00:05:22.240> is<00:05:22.389> a<00:05:22.419> rating

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
important is because octane is a rating

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.339 
important is because octane is a rating
of<00:05:23.970> resistance<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.210> burning<00:05:25.599> in<00:05:25.960> other<00:05:26.139> words

of resistance to burning in other words

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.740 
of resistance to burning in other words
the<00:05:26.650> higher<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.039> octane<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.819> less<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.509> fuel

strange why would you want to put gas
that<00:05:33.069> doesn't<00:05:33.699> want<00:05:33.849> to<00:05:33.940> burn<00:05:34.090> in<00:05:34.270> your<00:05:34.360> engine

that doesn't want to burn in your engine
well<00:05:34.900> let's<00:05:35.590> go<00:05:35.740> back<00:05:35.919> to<00:05:36.099> this<00:05:36.310> part<00:05:36.639> of<00:05:36.729> the

well let's go back to this part of the

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:38.640 
well let's go back to this part of the
compression<00:05:37.360> cycle<00:05:37.900> like<00:05:38.169> say<00:05:38.349> for<00:05:38.560> instance

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
compression cycle like say for instance

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.140 
compression cycle like say for instance
it's<00:05:38.979> a<00:05:39.069> high<00:05:39.190> compression<00:05:39.580> engine

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
it's a high compression engine

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.270 
it's a high compression engine
whenever<00:05:41.080> you<00:05:41.199> compress<00:05:41.590> things<00:05:41.830> you<00:05:42.039> create

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
whenever you compress things you create

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.089 
whenever you compress things you create
Heat<00:05:42.819> you<00:05:43.120> may<00:05:43.300> create<00:05:43.539> enough<00:05:43.870> heat<00:05:44.139> to<00:05:44.889> set

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
Heat you may create enough heat to set

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.920 
Heat you may create enough heat to set
the<00:05:45.159> spark<00:05:45.490> off<00:05:45.729> before<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:46.330> piston<00:05:46.509> ever

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
the spark off before the piston ever

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.529 
the spark off before the piston ever
gets<00:05:47.259> all<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:47.830> way<00:05:47.949> to<00:05:48.009> the<00:05:48.250> top<00:05:48.460> if<00:05:48.729> that's

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
gets all the way to the top if that's

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.339 
gets all the way to the top if that's
the<00:05:49.690> case<00:05:49.930> then<00:05:50.440> what<00:05:50.590> will<00:05:50.770> happen<00:05:51.159> is<00:05:51.340> that

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
the case then what will happen is that

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.930 
the case then what will happen is that
mixture<00:05:53.349> will<00:05:53.530> ignite<00:05:53.860> and<00:05:54.130> try<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:54.460> force<00:05:54.729> the

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
mixture will ignite and try to force the

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.700 
mixture will ignite and try to force the
piston<00:05:55.330> backwards<00:05:55.840> when<00:05:56.050> it's<00:05:56.169> trying<00:05:56.470> to<00:05:56.590> go

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
piston backwards when it's trying to go

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.100 
piston backwards when it's trying to go
up<00:05:56.949> this<00:05:57.759> is<00:05:57.970> not<00:05:58.120> what<00:05:58.300> we<00:05:58.419> want<00:05:58.630> to<00:05:58.750> happen

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
up this is not what we want to happen

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.749 
up this is not what we want to happen
because<00:05:59.199> not<00:05:59.530> only<00:05:59.560> does<00:05:59.800> it<00:05:59.860> rob<00:06:00.130> power<00:06:00.460> but

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
because not only does it rob power but

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.990 
because not only does it rob power but
it<00:06:00.849> hurts<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.270> engine<00:06:01.650> so<00:06:02.650> we<00:06:02.680> put<00:06:03.130> a<00:06:03.400> higher

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
it hurts the engine so we put a higher

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.809 
it hurts the engine so we put a higher
octane<00:06:04.630> fuel<00:06:05.050> in<00:06:05.289> that<00:06:05.979> does<00:06:06.219> not<00:06:06.430> want<00:06:06.669> to

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
octane fuel in that does not want to

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.670 
octane fuel in that does not want to
burn<00:06:07.000> as<00:06:07.180> much<00:06:07.360> that<00:06:07.810> does<00:06:08.020> not<00:06:08.199> succumb<00:06:08.620> to

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
burn as much that does not succumb to

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.550 
burn as much that does not succumb to
the<00:06:08.949> extreme<00:06:09.819> heat<00:06:10.090> and<00:06:10.240> pressure<00:06:10.440> that<00:06:11.440> is

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
the extreme heat and pressure that is

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.680 
the extreme heat and pressure that is
happening<00:06:12.009> here<00:06:12.069> and<00:06:12.430> lets<00:06:12.909> the<00:06:13.120> spark<00:06:13.479> plug

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
happening here and lets the spark plug

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.600 
happening here and lets the spark plug
set<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.199> mixture<00:06:14.469> off<00:06:14.680> so<00:06:14.919> in<00:06:15.009> other<00:06:15.099> words<00:06:15.370> we

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
set the mixture off so in other words we

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.480 
set the mixture off so in other words we
tell<00:06:15.849> it<00:06:16.000> when<00:06:16.210> to<00:06:16.240> do<00:06:16.710> when<00:06:17.710> to<00:06:17.860> go<00:06:18.009> off<00:06:18.190> and

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
tell it when to do when to go off and

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.510 
tell it when to do when to go off and
when<00:06:18.729> we<00:06:18.880> want<00:06:19.120> it<00:06:19.150> to<00:06:19.300> make<00:06:19.449> some<00:06:19.630> power<00:06:19.780> not

beforehand one thing to note in this is

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.629 
beforehand one thing to note in this is
if<00:06:24.219> you<00:06:24.370> are<00:06:24.610> in<00:06:24.849> higher<00:06:25.210> altitudes<00:06:26.460> you<00:06:27.460> may

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
if you are in higher altitudes you may

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.029 
if you are in higher altitudes you may
find<00:06:27.940> that<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:29.020> highest<00:06:29.199> octane<00:06:29.710> you<00:06:29.889> can

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
find that the highest octane you can

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.640 
find that the highest octane you can
find<00:06:30.310> is<00:06:30.550> like<00:06:30.819> 89<00:06:31.330> maybe<00:06:31.990> even<00:06:32.289> less<00:06:32.469> than

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
find is like 89 maybe even less than

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.680 
find is like 89 maybe even less than
that<00:06:32.860> the<00:06:33.490> reason<00:06:33.819> for<00:06:33.849> this<00:06:34.060> is<00:06:34.120> is<00:06:34.509> because

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
that the reason for this is is because

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.649 
that the reason for this is is because
air<00:06:35.199> at<00:06:35.680> higher<00:06:36.190> altitudes<00:06:36.789> is<00:06:36.969> much<00:06:37.300> thinner

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
air at higher altitudes is much thinner

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.890 
air at higher altitudes is much thinner
than<00:06:38.020> air<00:06:38.349> say<00:06:38.800> it's<00:06:38.949> sea<00:06:39.130> level<00:06:39.430> therefore<00:06:40.270> it

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
than air say it's sea level therefore it

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.689 
than air say it's sea level therefore it
is<00:06:41.319> not<00:06:42.069> as<00:06:42.870> combustible<00:06:43.870> or<00:06:44.340> there's<00:06:45.340> not<00:06:45.580> as

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:45.699 
is not as combustible or there's not as

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.629 
is not as combustible or there's not as
much<00:06:45.880> of<00:06:46.029> it<00:06:46.120> there<00:06:46.360> to<00:06:46.630> combust<00:06:47.139> so<00:06:47.919> they<00:06:48.370> need

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 
much of it there to combust so they need

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.610 
much of it there to combust so they need
a<00:06:48.669> more<00:06:48.940> volatile<00:06:49.449> fuel<00:06:49.779> in<00:06:50.080> that<00:06:50.229> instance

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
a more volatile fuel in that instance

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.070 
a more volatile fuel in that instance
because<00:06:51.039> there<00:06:51.400> really<00:06:51.430> is<00:06:51.849> less<00:06:52.509> air<00:06:52.750> to<00:06:52.900> work

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
because there really is less air to work

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.469 
because there really is less air to work
with<00:06:53.319> and<00:06:53.620> let's<00:06:54.460> not<00:06:54.639> forget<00:06:54.909> it's<00:06:55.090> not<00:06:55.150> just

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
with and let's not forget it's not just

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.339 
with and let's not forget it's not just
about<00:06:55.599> gas<00:06:55.960> it's<00:06:56.500> also<00:06:56.740> about<00:06:57.159> air<00:06:57.870> so<00:06:58.870> fuel

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349 
about gas it's also about air so fuel

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:01.950 
about gas it's also about air so fuel
and<00:06:59.680> air<00:06:59.889> make<00:07:00.370> combustible<00:07:01.090> mixture<00:07:01.389> without

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
and air make combustible mixture without

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.640 
and air make combustible mixture without
one<00:07:02.319> or<00:07:02.440> the<00:07:02.529> other<00:07:02.710> you<00:07:02.979> don't<00:07:03.490> have<00:07:03.669> anything

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
one or the other you don't have anything

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.709 
one or the other you don't have anything
so<00:07:05.650> that<00:07:05.949> is<00:07:06.250> I'll<00:07:06.969> just<00:07:07.150> let<00:07:07.300> this<00:07:07.449> run<00:07:07.690> for

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:07.719 
so that is I'll just let this run for

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.870 
so that is I'll just let this run for
you<00:07:07.990> so<00:07:08.169> you<00:07:08.259> can<00:07:08.349> watch<00:07:08.560> how<00:07:08.800> how<00:07:09.430> nicely

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
you so you can watch how how nicely

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.360 
you so you can watch how how nicely
animated<00:07:10.029> this<00:07:10.479> whole<00:07:10.690> thing<00:07:10.900> is<00:07:11.219> now<00:07:12.219> that

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
animated this whole thing is now that

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.749 
animated this whole thing is now that
you<00:07:12.490> understand<00:07:12.969> it<00:07:13.469> that<00:07:14.469> is<00:07:14.770> the<00:07:15.069> reason<00:07:15.520> for

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 
you understand it that is the reason for

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:18.930 
you understand it that is the reason for
octane<00:07:16.630> and<00:07:16.900> or<00:07:17.590> that<00:07:17.830> is<00:07:18.009> a<00:07:18.039> an<00:07:18.430> explanation

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
octane and or that is a an explanation

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.139 
octane and or that is a an explanation
of<00:07:19.330> octane<00:07:19.690> and<00:07:20.099> how<00:07:21.099> it<00:07:21.250> pertains<00:07:21.490> to<00:07:21.880> the

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:22.149 
of octane and how it pertains to the

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:24.329 
of octane and how it pertains to the
four<00:07:22.750> phases<00:07:22.960> of<00:07:23.229> the<00:07:23.320> combustion<00:07:23.770> cycle<00:07:24.130> in<00:07:24.250> a

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:24.339 
four phases of the combustion cycle in a

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:27.670 
four phases of the combustion cycle in a
gasoline<00:07:24.789> engine<00:07:24.880> I<00:07:25.229> hope<00:07:26.229> this<00:07:26.380> was<00:07:26.560> helpful

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 
gasoline engine I hope this was helpful

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.650 
gasoline engine I hope this was helpful
and<00:07:28.240> have<00:07:29.240> a<00:07:29.270> great<00:07:29.509> day<00:07:30.970> be<00:07:31.970> safe<00:07:32.270> have<00:07:32.630> fun

and have a great day be safe have fun
and<00:07:32.930> stay<00:07:33.500> dirty<00:07:35.620> so<00:07:36.620> he<00:07:36.710> can't<00:07:37.699> play<00:07:37.850> in<00:07:37.970> there

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.150 
and stay dirty so he can't play in there

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:45.990 
and stay dirty so he can't play in there
while<00:07:38.330> daddy's<00:07:38.690> working<00:07:43.090> yes<00:07:44.090> you<00:07:45.080> were

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 
while daddy's working yes you were
