00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.890
 hello my name is David daddy 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.500
 tinkering and today I'm going to 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.860
 explain how to change a siphon or 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.200
 a universal drain flange 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.230
 so here it is actually very simple 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:24.320
 there are two plastic nuts 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:27.109
 this one that connects us to the drain and 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.970
 this one we see behind so that's 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.890
 relatively simple to change it 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.970
 simply unscrew the two nuts 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.800
 that you have there so sometimes we can 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.180
 unscrewed by hand but if we can not 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.950
 unscrew themselves by hand 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.590
 the pliers always take our 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.660
 famous thin power strip with its 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:53.200
 different settings for different 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.200
 diameters 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.950
 here we unscrew our nut it does not 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.990
 allow to clean and drain 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.659
 then, is it only remains to 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.900
 unscrew that part then the same 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.490
 either the hand if it's not too tight or 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.420
 otherwise you use as before 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.740
 the multi-socket pliers in once unscrewed 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.740
 just shoot on it 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.410
 and to jump below once 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.210
 the siphon disassemble that allows us to the 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.680
 clean to change the joints of 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.160
 so that you do not have a problem 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.030
 flight 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.610
 so this is our if they do so with the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.760
 connection level of the drain 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:53.120
 basin wash basin and connection 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:55.070
 your pipes here this part there 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:04.910
 unscrew years we will be able to 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:06.380
 clean up we'll be able now 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.580
 clean our siphon to be able to 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.580
 would have installed it cleanly 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.350
 so now that I have thoroughly clean 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.570
 my shrink bottom I'll be able to 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.300
 so reinstall in the same way as 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.590
 I was dismantling I'm going rolling tech 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.260
 I will first start with one is 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.470
 raymond pvc tubes inside the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.800
 siphon up to bring it back to lax 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.800
 my world 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.210
 once in the kz2 but hey I want 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:49.550
 to be able to tighten my leap by having 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:51.940
 first put a seal and ideally 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.940
 Teflon 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.190
 now that I have tightened 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:04.520
 monties bottom I want to be able too 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:06.770
 tightened the second crew here we have 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.050
 so disassemble the siphon back up the 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.460
 siphon clean the siphon now 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.850
 evacuation is much more 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.850
 easily 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.240
 a little advice do not hesitate to redo 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.860
 once a year this operation that you 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.110
 will allow to have just a 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.430
 evacuation without any problem and 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.770
 especially no plug in your 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.090
 pipelines that would require 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.090
 much bigger work
