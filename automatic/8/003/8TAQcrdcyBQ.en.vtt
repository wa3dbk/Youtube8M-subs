00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.450
 the iron and friends of cabbage ki-moon 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.280
 celebrated today I bring you a way that the 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.170
 truth fascinated me is something that has 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.150
 talked with him a while ago wildo be 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.920
 in the demolisher the one that broke blocks 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.320
 well they did something similar with that bike 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.119
 they made a plane as you can see here 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.439
 this that are in the bar below are 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.390
 all the objects that the modes add 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.269
 you can find them in your mind game in 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.970
 the final tab as you can see there and 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.620
 good that adds more than anything because what 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.180
 what is the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.809
 the body of the plane that is with a boat 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.790
 the tail the engine the keys this is the 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.589
 it was done and the gasoline ok 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.460
 I think that nothing they need then only 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.809
 wood iron coal all the basics no 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.640
 occupies any special item everything 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.159
 They can tinkle normally on your table 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.720
 the fret like any object but in 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.369
 this case appears all contaminate in 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.839
 France them fast because they despair 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.879
 and well let's put the plane in 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.739
 working there is 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.110
 let's use as put by the bulldozer 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.409
 but this time it's a plane we're going to use 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.810
 gasoline already has full gas and 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.830
 use the twin jockey keys below 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.830
 let's rise 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.979
 do not go 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.979
 and we are going to change the camera 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.119
 this summit we are already elevated and makes 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.770
 a strange sound like the bulldog of the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.840
 descent makes a sound like the bulldozer 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.460
 dude to the mother up upstairs 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.829
 up up to raise it 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.570
 they have to look up to 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.979
 lower it look down and good is like 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.210
 the bulldozer does that sound like 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.740
 have you about to explode but 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.990
 it works very well the truth this is 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.899
 identical to the wing 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.850
 when doing this flight is super epic 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.590
 now I loved it and well let's visit 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.049
 a little maybe but on this map because 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.580
 has aerial things here this pixelar 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.740
 iván take that visit the area where 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.149
 pelé contrajera work in one time does not have 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.430
 this book like it shakes a little and 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.310
 it also needs texture so go down 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.830
 all the necessary decision texture mod and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.970
 all all the instruction but do not 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.819
 you will see them like this you will see everything white 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.069
 and well here you can see it's a movie 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.930
 they contract and they can hurt you 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.190
 collide and as with seeing gasoline is 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.959
 ending when this starts to happen 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.709
 they have to land somewhere 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.750
 safe and recharge but if it lasts longer or 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.440
 less like to get from a place to 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.720
 other 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.970
 the maps unless they are flying very 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.260
 very far away as well as that they want 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.910
 explore everyone in fact enjoy 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.130
 the series also to see if it finds 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.200
 some village with him I'm going to move 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.090
 legally in the series obviously like that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.620
 be prepared because they have a super 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.600
 mega pack of motorcycles that I'm doing 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.769
 they were asking me I do not want 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.870
 do a couple of motorcycles because I said 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.519
 I would have to join them together and all that 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.290
 region not monster in these modes 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.299
 favorites and the texture and you do not pass it and 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.590
 well I'm going to do it for this check 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.090
 which are compatible and which ones 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.010
 also but that has not done it because 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.930
 lo blanch was very unstable recently 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.849
 but vita is better if they remember in 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.560
 white nation title class was created me 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.180
 you are better and then this one nothing 300 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.260
 with this video you enjoy so that 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.670
 I'm here like that being time to 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.440
 let them see how it works what grandma 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.120
 How is it that this can be controlled? 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.849
 I tell them they are half weird that they look 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.500
 look down and that's how one came out 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.819
 I have already uploaded the review that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.620
 it was with main karts in a flying delicacy 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.599
 and was similarly controlled but with the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.760
 main card you have to look down 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.160
 to do was climb was upside down 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.900
 the controls looked down and went up 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.310
 watched it closes and came down here if it's 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.470
 normal here it lies up and it 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.640
 elevates so that it works them better 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.010
 recommended third-person attribution 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.260
 which looks very comfortable and very nice 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.579
 the truth and well I do not think it's all 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.730
 for this video of not being the next 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.590
 put into account when writing 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.000
 enjoy is very father is that I knew 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.980
 I was going to leave when the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.630
 bulldozer I said good the plane soon and 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.860
 soon prepare for the cars that 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.220
 I'm more than likely going to do it 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.660
 and if not equal, I can see what I can 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.540
 do out there also has not had 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.670
 almost sit down but sit down 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.000
 to shrink the texture and my mods and 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.260
 see good things but what if such 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.970
 advances all this and if not equal me 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.290
 I put there full but won with 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.030
 time like I never have time but 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.500
 well I already talked too much but I want you 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.020
 see how they fly more than anything that I'm 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.670
 doing I'm going in what they see how 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.989
 It works I want it to end here 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.250
 I'm running out of gas is what 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.830
 I wanted it to happen 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.750
 I want to see how much he can hold up flying I do not know 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.340
 yes, they will watch the time in the video 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.770
 is the time plus one is that it's going to 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.350
 last a flight that makes the revelation 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.180
 more complete in that aspect and how 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.370
 I say everything you see there are some pieces are 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.650
 totally affordable to do so 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.230
 legal what I plan to do in the series 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.120
 but well let's wait for when I finish 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.520
 my house and then I want to like 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.930
 I will go to another side I will be using it but 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.060
 will be obviously drawer in the series 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.410
 you can play is talking a lot 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.370
 I want to see what happens how the 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.050
 currency you just fall ok 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.940
 he falls and hurts himself because as you know he is 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.770
 an entity 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.660
 and he does this and already nothing more than 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.180
 get off with Mr. Mainar 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.050
 we do not recharge and ready to give it 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.580
 return is very father and then nothing 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.080
 let it be everything you had if you liked my 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.900
 comment write if we see in the video 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.460
 that that kind of stones maps photo but 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.460
 maps four legs 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.009
 I can not appropriating only the 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.139
 esteem in fact the plane with the code is 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.300
 an entity so if you hurt him a lot 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.999
 is going to die as well as the aroma bulldog 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.650
 he has the radio erbol two teams 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:36.439
 new the next video we go up what 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.139
 higher up let's say let's both 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:41.689
 up arrives and we cut the video that 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:44.040
 let's go on the next video and it's going to take 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:47.650
 a little bit in climbing front 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.810
 and now I really liked this my father 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.259
 but if it is to get a little more 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.259
 speed 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.030
 he knows how high up he is 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.680
 convulsing let's see I want to see 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.220
 how much what is the height limit 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.990
 which may or may not have a limit 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.970
 I do not think there are no limits 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.500
 as high as they are interested but 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.210
 you have to be careful because if you 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.850
 they run out of gas very high then 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:17.160
 they are only going to kill themselves and then nothing 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.160
 like in the next video and bye
