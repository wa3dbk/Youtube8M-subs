00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
so let's go ahead and give it a whirl so

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.089 
so let's go ahead and give it a whirl so
let's<00:04:06.799> start<00:04:07.040> from<00:04:07.189> scratch<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:09.799> see<00:04:09.950> that

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
let's start from scratch so you see that

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.289 
let's start from scratch so you see that
symbol<00:04:10.250> right<00:04:10.519> here<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.909> means<00:04:11.060> it's

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
symbol right here that means it's

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.539 
symbol right here that means it's
disconnected<00:04:11.810> from<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:12.230> phone<00:04:12.439> so<00:04:12.709> this<00:04:13.310> is

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
disconnected from the phone so this is

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.369 
disconnected from the phone so this is
basically<00:04:14.120> working<00:04:14.359> independently<00:04:15.079> like<00:04:15.319> a

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
basically working independently like a

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.460 
basically working independently like a
mp3<00:04:15.650> player<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.340> connected<00:04:17.120> Bluetooth<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.320> my

mp3 player and connected Bluetooth to my

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.219 
mp3 player and connected Bluetooth to my
speaker<00:04:18.829> so<00:04:19.579> let's<00:04:19.699> give<00:04:19.849> it<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.030> whirl<00:04:20.229> when

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
speaker so let's give it a whirl when

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.510 
speaker so let's give it a whirl when
