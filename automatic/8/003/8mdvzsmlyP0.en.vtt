really<00:00:16.440> specific<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.850> rock<00:00:18.150> climbing<00:00:18.480> what

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
really specific for rock climbing what

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.929 
really specific for rock climbing what
one<00:00:19.140> comes<00:00:19.470> into<00:00:19.800> Boulder<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:20.760> fun

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939
