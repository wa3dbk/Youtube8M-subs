 Châteauroux 16th of the ranking with a 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.689

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.960
 12th and already saved Châteauroux who will 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.020
 have to evolve without many elements 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.860
 important to fugure ua makengo paul 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.480

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.579
 diédhiou genest or ikoko are missing 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.040
 on call 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.050
 Chateauroux who wants to quickly take 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.210
 the direction of operations and that's the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.129
 case with this huge opportunity the balloon 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.530
 who rolls in front of goal and who goes on to 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.140
 side of the goal post kept by yann 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.449
 kerboriou a good first opportunity 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.510
 and then the cristolian answer with this 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.850
 strike on the crossbar 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.710
 crinkle and released and play pretty well the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.530
 blow against pretty castelroussins 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.140
 contracted new luck but it passes 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.970
 beside 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.790
 a stopped kick can be relieved 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.940
 the castelroussins a balloon saved on 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.940
 line 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.159
 nothing happened in this first 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.320
 period and we're left with 1 0 0 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.460
 and he made a draw and a defeat 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.780
 after a series of four victories 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.770
 consecutive but this little 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.549
 slowdown is not too much 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.830
 detrimental 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.049
 the points needed to maintain 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.820
 already been taken chateauroux on his side 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.509
 is worrying about six games without 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.820
 victory 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.259
 we must find the path to success 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.399
 on this game and the return of the locker room 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.080
 jean louis garcia men speeds up 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.659
 trying to finally free himself in this 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.130
 meeting with this center and this 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.060
 possibility of resumption at close range 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.140
 but it's happening in front of everyone 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.330
 new acceleration that can be 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.800
 decisive with this possibility of 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.789
 hit it's still next to the pole 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.940
 a team of châteauroux not in 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.979
 success that insists who press on the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.170
 super parade goal of parade 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.470
 kerboriou to prevent the opening of 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.950
 score 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.660
 creteil held a cricket team that 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.900
 will score a goal five minutes from the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.390
 end thanks to jean michel lesage eighth 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.850
 goal of the season for the former 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.220
 the size of the crib it hurts a lot 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.350
 to Châteauroux who press to try 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.940
 to equalize but who gets countered 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.299
 huge new opportunity for creteil 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.440
 with Cedric collar 89th minute 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.299
 it's the coup de grace for 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.299
 châteauroux first goal of the season 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.049
 for cédric collet and it's créteil who 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.060
 will win 2-0 at the stage gaston-petit 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.310
 disaster for Châteauroux which becomes 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.470
 relegated before the last day 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.940
 it will absolutely be necessary to win the last 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.160
 match and hope for results 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.269
 favorable to other teams for 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.269
