add<00:03:57.879> a<00:03:57.909> moisturizer<00:03:58.690> see<00:03:59.349> how<00:03:59.440> that

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
add a moisturizer see how that

moisturizer<00:04:00.069> is<00:04:00.250> white<00:04:00.459> color<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.900> can<00:04:02.110> tend

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
moisturizer is white color it can tend

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.520 
moisturizer is white color it can tend
to<00:04:02.920> make<00:04:03.159> the<00:04:03.489> base<00:04:04.030> color<00:04:04.390> of<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:05.140> custom

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
to make the base color of the custom

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.170 
to make the base color of the custom
cover<00:04:05.680> drops<00:04:05.769> a<00:04:06.069> little<00:04:06.129> bit<00:04:06.310> lighter<00:04:06.579> so<00:04:07.150> I

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
cover drops a little bit lighter so I

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.789 
cover drops a little bit lighter so I
usually<00:04:07.329> tend<00:04:07.629> to<00:04:07.810> stick<00:04:08.110> with<00:04:08.140> products<00:04:08.769> that
