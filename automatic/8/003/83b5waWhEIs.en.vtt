00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.020 
obviously with the b2 logo stitched
surround<00:03:05.599> looks<00:03:06.599> like<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:07.489> pressed<00:03:08.489> paper<00:03:08.639> comb

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
surround looks like a pressed paper comb

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.830 
surround looks like a pressed paper comb
and<00:03:09.709> then<00:03:10.709> down<00:03:10.980> here<00:03:11.540> hopefully<00:03:12.540> y'all<00:03:12.690> can

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
and then down here hopefully y'all can

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.879 
and then down here hopefully y'all can
see<00:03:13.049> that<00:03:13.519> oversized<00:03:15.200> push<00:03:16.200> terminals<00:03:16.739> look

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
see that oversized push terminals look

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.270 
see that oversized push terminals look
to<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.100> about<00:03:17.329> eight<00:03:18.329> gauge<00:03:18.690> or<00:03:19.260> at<00:03:19.380> least<00:03:19.560> if

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
to be about eight gauge or at least if

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.009 
to be about eight gauge or at least if
you're<00:03:20.519> using<00:03:20.819> eight<00:03:21.090> gauge<00:03:21.359> it<00:03:21.750> would<00:03:21.870> have

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
you're using eight gauge it would have

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.789 
you're using eight gauge it would have
absolutely<00:03:22.769> no<00:03:23.160> issue<00:03:23.430> going<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.269> there<00:03:24.799> so

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
absolutely no issue going in there so

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.129 
absolutely no issue going in there so
that's<00:03:25.980> cool<00:03:26.450> I'll<00:03:27.450> show<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
that's cool I'll show this in the

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:28.789 
that's cool I'll show this in the
close-ups

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
close-ups

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.780 
close-ups
there's<00:03:29.579> dual<00:03:30.350> tensile<00:03:31.350> leads<00:03:31.560> there<00:03:32.250> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
there's dual tensile leads there the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.440 
there's dual tensile leads there the
flat<00:03:33.060> style<00:03:34.370> some<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.609> top<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.239> top

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
flat style some to the top of the top

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.220 
flat style some to the top of the top
spider<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.370> then<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.819> just<00:03:39.209> well<00:03:39.450> slide<00:03:40.019> this

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
spider and then I just well slide this

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.819 
spider and then I just well slide this
lid<00:03:41.100> over<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.290> now<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.470> can<00:03:46.620> see<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
lid over and so now you can see the

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.050 
lid over and so now you can see the
bottom<00:03:47.130> plate<00:03:47.370> it's<00:03:47.700> got<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.120> massive<00:03:50.060> pull

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
bottom plate it's got the massive pull

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.270 
bottom plate it's got the massive pull
piece<00:03:51.299> vent<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.019> then<00:03:53.359> you<00:03:54.359> know<00:03:54.480> eight

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
piece vent and then you know eight

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.140 
piece vent and then you know eight
events<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.519> gap<00:03:57.500> for<00:03:58.500> extra<00:03:58.739> cooling<00:03:59.150> to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
events in the gap for extra cooling to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.620 
events in the gap for extra cooling to
one<00:04:00.840> inch<00:04:01.130> slugs<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.700> think<00:04:03.120> it's<00:04:03.239> ten<00:04:03.389> inches

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
one inch slugs I think it's ten inches

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.870 
one inch slugs I think it's ten inches
in<00:04:03.780> diameter<00:04:06.950> really<00:04:07.950> really<00:04:08.310> thick<00:04:08.639> backs

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
in diameter really really thick backs

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.759 
in diameter really really thick backs
good<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.150> think<00:04:09.209> this<00:04:09.480> is<00:04:09.660> b-2s<00:04:10.079> basket<00:04:10.650> at

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
good I think this is b-2s basket at

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.160 
good I think this is b-2s basket at
least<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:12.030> only<00:04:12.209> subs<00:04:12.480> I've<00:04:12.569> ever<00:04:12.689> seen<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.049> on

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
least the only subs I've ever seen it on

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.150 
least the only subs I've ever seen it on
our<00:04:13.849> b2<00:04:14.849> audio<00:04:15.409> so<00:04:16.409> on

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
our b2 audio so on

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.650 
our b2 audio so on
sheriff<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.550> said<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.880> already<00:04:18.030> got<00:04:18.540> the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
sheriff I said it already got the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.490 
sheriff I said it already got the
four-inch<00:04:19.050> 4-layer<00:04:20.480> coil<00:04:21.480> ceramic-coated

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.240 

looks<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.650> have<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.770> really<00:04:26.490> really<00:04:26.670> nice

looks to have a really really nice

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.160 
looks to have a really really nice
really<00:04:29.250> really<00:04:29.610> strong<00:04:29.910> triple<00:04:30.390> joint<00:04:30.690> -<00:04:33.170> but

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
really really strong triple joint - but

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.770 
really really strong triple joint - but
other<00:04:34.320> than<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:34.560> just<00:04:34.920> wanted<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.750> like<00:04:36.750> I

said sort of get a sort of look overview
of<00:04:42.030> this<00:04:42.450> I<00:04:43.050> mean<00:04:45.110> there<00:04:46.110> isn't<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.290> whole<00:04:46.410> lot

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
of this I mean there isn't a whole lot

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.030 
of this I mean there isn't a whole lot
out<00:04:46.710> there<00:04:46.740> on<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.420> but<00:04:48.420> um<00:04:48.630> it's<00:04:49.560> it's

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
out there on it but um it's it's

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.300 
out there on it but um it's it's
definitely<00:04:50.700> um<00:04:51.350> probably<00:04:52.350> be<00:04:52.590> nicest<00:04:53.100> looking

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
definitely um probably be nicest looking

definitely um probably be nicest looking
sub<00:04:53.790> I've<00:04:53.970> ever<00:04:54.120> owned<00:04:55.790> easily<00:04:56.790> I<00:04:57.060> don't<00:04:57.720> even

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
sub I've ever owned easily I don't even

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.140 
sub I've ever owned easily I don't even
know<00:04:58.050> why<00:04:58.200> I<00:04:58.230> said<00:04:58.320> probably<00:04:59.040> but<00:04:59.670> I'm<00:05:00.030> gonna

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
know why I said probably but I'm gonna

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.810 
know why I said probably but I'm gonna
go<00:05:00.360> ahead<00:05:00.480> and<00:05:00.630> do<00:05:00.900> some<00:05:01.230> close-up<00:05:02.130> shots<00:05:02.160> and

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
go ahead and do some close-up shots and

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.740 
go ahead and do some close-up shots and
and<00:05:03.510> whatnot<00:05:04.320> um<00:05:05.120> hopefully<00:05:06.120> I'll<00:05:06.420> enjoyed

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
and whatnot um hopefully I'll enjoyed

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.260 
and whatnot um hopefully I'll enjoyed
this<00:05:06.900> video<00:05:07.140> and<00:05:07.760> hopefully<00:05:08.760> I'll<00:05:09.000> have<00:05:09.150> them

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
this video and hopefully I'll have them

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.660 
this video and hopefully I'll have them
in<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.420> truck
