acid in it so i've been using a bit of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.380 
acid in it so i've been using a bit of
my<00:02:10.289> sisters<00:02:10.739> who<00:02:11.009> actually<00:02:11.250> has<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.970> product

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
one I like a lot more because it's not

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.839 
one I like a lot more because it's not
as<00:02:33.959> slick<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.680> doesn't<00:02:35.010> leave<00:02:35.189> that<00:02:35.519> kind

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
as slick and it doesn't leave that kind

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.770 
as slick and it doesn't leave that kind
of<00:02:36.230> overly<00:02:37.230> kind<00:02:38.189> of<00:02:38.340> like<00:02:38.489> oily<00:02:39.389> type<00:02:39.629> of

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
of overly kind of like oily type of

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.929 
of overly kind of like oily type of
texture<00:02:40.109> and<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:41.010> does<00:02:41.189> give<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.549> that<00:02:41.700> same

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
texture and it does give you that same

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.550 
texture and it does give you that same
coverage<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.719> helps<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.079> don't<00:02:43.290> make<00:02:43.409> up

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
coverage and helps you don't make up

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.559

stay<00:02:43.769> on<00:02:43.889> a<00:02:43.920> little<00:02:44.189> bit<00:02:44.280> longer<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.849> I<00:02:45.299> find

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
stay on a little bit longer and I find

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.509 
stay on a little bit longer and I find
that<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.930> good<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.590> use<00:02:46.829> with<00:02:47.129> when<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
that it's good to use with when the

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.890 
that it's good to use with when the
temperature<00:02:47.970> gets<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.209> little<00:02:48.329> bit<00:02:48.540> warm<00:02:48.750> or

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
temperature gets a little bit warm or

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.920 
temperature gets a little bit warm or
two<00:02:49.109> but<00:02:49.919> a<00:02:50.370> heads<00:02:50.639> up<00:02:50.849> is<00:02:51.030> when<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.689> know<00:02:51.810> the

reading the labels and I noticed it

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.289 
reading the labels and I noticed it
everything<00:03:14.219> comes<00:03:14.340> on<00:03:14.519> backwards<00:03:15.000> because<00:03:15.269> I

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
everything comes on backwards because I

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.740 
everything comes on backwards because I
guess<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.290> camera<00:03:16.889> on<00:03:17.040> my<00:03:17.370> macbook<00:03:18.150> just

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
guess the the camera on my macbook just

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.330 
guess the the camera on my macbook just
seems<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.079> flip<00:03:19.379> all<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.650> letters<00:03:19.919> around<00:03:20.129> so

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
seems to flip all the letters around so

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.219 
seems to flip all the letters around so
I'm<00:03:20.430> really<00:03:20.699> sorry<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.060> if<00:03:21.720> you're<00:03:21.900> tuning
