of quick races like I said and I love it
it<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.200> handles<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:38.100> well<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.700> not

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
it just handles really well it's not

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.660 
it just handles really well it's not
over<00:00:39.300> exaggerating<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.290> controls<00:00:40.620> at<00:00:40.829> all

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
over exaggerating the controls at all

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.420 
over exaggerating the controls at all
I'm<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.540> barely<00:00:43.320> tilting<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.770> slamming<00:00:44.309> it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
I'm not barely tilting it slamming it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.080 
I'm not barely tilting it slamming it
into<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.730> wall<00:00:45.860> I'm<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> video<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.370> record<00:00:47.940> I

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
into the wall I'm the video I record I

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.970 
into the wall I'm the video I record I
actually<00:00:48.210> record<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> gameplay<00:00:49.230> before<00:00:49.620> this

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
actually record the gameplay before this

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
actually record the gameplay before this
I<00:00:50.160> did<00:00:50.399> do<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.820> couple<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.210> times<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.020> it's

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
I did do it a couple of times but it's

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.660 
I did do it a couple of times but it's
just<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:52.620> I'm<00:00:52.800> not<00:00:52.949> used<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> track

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
just because I'm not used to the track

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.229 
just because I'm not used to the track
yet<00:00:55.129> but<00:00:56.129> you'll<00:00:56.399> see<00:00:56.610> later<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> video

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
yet but you'll see later in the video

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.260 
yet but you'll see later in the video
that<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.629> painted<00:00:58.020> out<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:59.280> controls<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.090> lot

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that I painted out and it controls a lot

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.189 
that I painted out and it controls a lot
better<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.989> down<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:03.199> visually

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
better I get it down but visually

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.030 
better I get it down but visually
speaking<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> 360<00:01:05.670> version<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:06.150> well

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
speaking I have the 360 version as well

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.500 
speaking I have the 360 version as well
you<00:01:08.040> know<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> cars<00:01:08.930> don't<00:01:09.930> look<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.560> good<00:01:10.979> you

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
you know the cars don't look as good you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.270 
you know the cars don't look as good you
know<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> Wii<00:01:13.020> version

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
know in the Wii version

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.520 
know in the Wii version
I<00:01:14.390> really<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.050> didn't<00:01:16.290> over

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I really like that they didn't over

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.710 
I really like that they didn't over
exaggerate<00:01:17.250> again<00:01:17.550> you<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.540> motion

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
exaggerate again you know the motion

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.050

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
blur the motion blur in the 360 version

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.020 
blur the motion blur in the 360 version
just<00:01:21.870> makes<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.560> game<00:01:22.770> look<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.340> terrible<00:01:23.820> in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
just makes that game look so terrible in

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.980 
just makes that game look so terrible in
my<00:01:24.180> opinion<00:01:25.820> but<00:01:26.820> anyway<00:01:27.390> let's<00:01:27.810> get<00:01:27.930> into

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
my opinion but anyway let's get into

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.620 
my opinion but anyway let's get into
some<00:01:28.260> gameplay
