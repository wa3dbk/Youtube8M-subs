00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.520
 and 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.830
 and what a wave how welcome to this 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.550
 fourth video today we are going to 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.509
 talk about custom fonts 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.779
 there are some things that I consider that 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:28.090
 make a page look good one is 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.820
 zelaya for that bringing us trump boots 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.710
 the second sun is the typography the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.839
 sources that we use and the third one is 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.850
 the color of the last two we are going to 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:39.400
 speaking today on the part of 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.260
 sources well the web fortunately 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.210
 now it allows us to use something that is 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.960
 know as personalized sources to 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.350
 through a css rule of name 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.149
 font face vale and the easiest way to 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.500
 add a custom font is to 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.750
 through google font 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.620
 in this case they can enter 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.170
 google.com to the bottom and look for this 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.470
 navigate among the hundreds and hundreds of 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:12.140
 sources that this google font has 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.940
 depending on what your business or the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.130
 goal of your website so they can go 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.960
 choosing different sources in this 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.890
 case there is one that if I remember correctly is 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.350
 peaceful flame 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.360
 which is the one that I want to use I'm going 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.500
 to give here on the little arrow that is the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.260
 quick tour and it tells me to first choose 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.619
 the styles there is only one so only 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.380
 the one that chooses the character set 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.590
 she's only Latina so there's no problem 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.890
 third place that you add this code to 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.020
 my website that yes so we've already 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.750
 seen since we already know that basically what 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.960
 what he was doing is adding a sheet of 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.659
 styles and this one 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.200
 which goes in this case is going to add the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.130
 peaceful source then leaves there the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.730
 we have 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.400
 later here on me 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:08.000
 in my css I'm going to add a rule that 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.480
 will call peaceful to integrate the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.910
 source within my css this property 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.640
 of this rule font-family of css me 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.280
 allows you to specify what type of source 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.740
 will have the element in this case at 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.120
 to add the peaceful class and 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.490
 I say that as the name of the source to 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.330
 be peaceful and if you can not load the 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.830
 font that uses any italic goes 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.630
 then here at full ease I'm going to 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.630
 make the source easy 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.190
 so that I have something left we will wait 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.190
 to load 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.890
 something like that ok your works I already have my source 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.970
 personalized and it looks pretty good 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.970
 I have already 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.470
 loaded to my source and now I have 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.050
 integrated with my css and then it already gives 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.060
 a better a better view to my web page 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.769
 something that we can realize is that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.390
 because by the characteristic of the source 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.459
 now in my title it looks a bit more 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.380
 small that my subtitle then this one 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.800
 I'm going to do it, I'm going to win a class 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.350
 that is going to be called big 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.530
 and here I will make reference to the rule 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.930
 font-size font-size we can 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.360
 say how many pixels like in word 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.080
 let's say that in word they are 18 here 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:35.040
 we put 18 pixels because you can see this 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.300
 size but generally what is it 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.620
 that we use but that is more 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.620
 It is advisable to use 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.810
 as a unit of measurement then there already 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.180
 three in which there are four mental and 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.310
 there it is already looks much better 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.459
 saleh 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:59.989
 the rest of the one on my website has 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:02.030
 as a source this area because it's the one 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.970
 I put you this 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.580
 Helvetic woods trap in the case of 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.760
 mac 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.530
 we're also going to change that I'm going to in 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.780
 instead of using that I'm going to use a 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.970
 fountain is very fashionable especially for 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.820
 the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.790
 the flat design movement that 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.070
 called brass then here I will say 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.190
 first to choose the styles that I want 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.730
 I want like I want bold if I want 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:34.730
 normal leaves only Latin has it 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.730
 extended not and we're going to copy 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.600
 here it comes out 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.210
 and then we will integrate 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.460
 also with our css in this case what 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.000
 I'm going to put it directly in the body to 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:52.380
 that all the content of my web page 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.400
 have as silver source is to say everything 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.560
 that is inside the body that 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.260
 basically it 's all the website to 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.669
 have it then it looks like this 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:05.280
 It comes out because it looks even better and another 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.680
 thing that we are going to try to add for 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.360
 that even looks much better our 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.129
 home page is a color palette 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.800
 The choice of colors is very very 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.900
 important and especially when you're not 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.629
 designer is a bit complex to define 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.479
 the right colors that combine that 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.759
 be this modern that look good 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.520
 etc 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:32.180
 for that I use color dot adobe 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.280
 puntocom here you explore the palette 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.530
 allows you to see different palettes of 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.849
 colors the most popular for example 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.289
 are these the most used are these 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.449
 then these are color palettes 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.569
 that some designer defined 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.279
 then I think we can serve 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:52.490
 You can also search by keywords for 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:55.340
 example that they are flat as these are 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.770
 quite interesting that they represent not 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.840
 I know food food 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.460
 we have now these in my case one that 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.940
 decided to use is this that says frames 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.530
 font 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.530
 then the first thing I'm going to use 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:13.040
 is this green I'm going to select here the 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.460
 color in hexadecimal and I'll copy it 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.250
 with the green 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.860
 in the color color this rule color of 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.949
 css refers to the color of the 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:29.410
 lyrics then now that I put here 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.410
 green to the class of h1 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.650
 it's going to look green my perfect title 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:40.680
 I really like it 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.139
 Now I'm going to tell you that all the links 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.930
 have 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.590
 this other color this blue that came here 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.620
 in the facebook palette 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:53.400
 and now we see that the palette of the 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.830
 links changed color 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.169
 to finish with the home of my page 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.870
 in that this is the main page I'm going to 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:04.720
 add a new class 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.970
 that is going to be called space on the right 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.790
 and now just like we made a space 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:12.860
 up and we gave him a margin top in this 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.860
 case obviously it's going to be a kingfisher right 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.860
 m 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:27.960
 and here to these two links I'm going to put 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:30.180
 a space on the right is worth 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.870
 so that we have something like what 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.120
 go here 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.470
 I believe that with that we have ready the 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.810
 home of our website 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.660
 It looks pretty good I like it 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:44.360
 personal how it looks then this up 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.520
 here we are going to leave the tutorial of the day 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.880
 today in the next one we're going to start 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.240
 design the following many pages 

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.240
 Thank you
