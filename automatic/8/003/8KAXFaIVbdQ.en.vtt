00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.730 
start to end this is why that was the
first<00:00:08.519> Pancham<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.030> ran<00:00:09.179> due<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.740> usually

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
first Pancham I ran due to usually

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.789 
first Pancham I ran due to usually
chains<00:00:11.040> take<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> long<00:00:12.389> time<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:13.620> up<00:00:13.769> to

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
chains take a long time you know up to

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.300 
chains take a long time you know up to
like<00:00:14.070> 40<00:00:14.570> but<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.990> know<00:00:16.590> some<00:00:16.800> people<00:00:16.830> ask<00:00:17.160> me

successful chain so I want to do it on

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.890 
successful chain so I want to do it on
some<00:00:21.869> Pancham<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:23.000> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.180> watch<00:00:24.359> me<00:00:24.630> try<00:00:24.810> to

some Pancham and you can watch me try to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.060 
some Pancham and you can watch me try to
match<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.740> grasp<00:00:26.210> this<00:00:27.800> fortunately<00:00:28.800> for

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
match up to grasp this fortunately for

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.009 
match up to grasp this fortunately for
me<00:00:29.220> unfortunately<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.390> video<00:00:30.630> I

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
me unfortunately for the video I

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.930 
me unfortunately for the video I
encountered<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> shiny<00:00:32.009> pretty<00:00:32.250> fast<00:00:32.610> it's

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
encountered the shiny pretty fast it's

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.720 
encountered the shiny pretty fast it's
only<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.510> only<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.780> two<00:00:33.960> chain<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:35.579> can

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
only it's only a two chain but you can

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.470 
only it's only a two chain but you can
watch<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> process<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.960> anyway<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.620> guess

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
watch the process of it anyway I guess

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
watch the process of it anyway I guess
you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.600> see<00:00:39.719> how<00:00:39.809> super<00:00:40.559> careful<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> am<00:00:41.010> about

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
you can see how super careful I am about

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.540 
you can see how super careful I am about
making<00:00:41.760> sure<00:00:42.230> it's<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> exact<00:00:44.040> patch<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
making sure it's like the exact patch I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.170 
making sure it's like the exact patch I
want<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.149> far<00:00:45.390> enough<00:00:45.510> away<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.879> know<00:00:47.879> I

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
want it's far enough away you know I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.790 
want it's far enough away you know I
probably<00:00:48.539> could<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.050> picked<00:00:49.289> some<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.620> other

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
probably could have picked some of other

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.290 
probably could have picked some of other
pieces<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.280> grass<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:52.460> well<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.760> time<00:00:53.969> I

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
pieces of grass but well at that time I

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.849 
pieces of grass but well at that time I
always<00:00:57.300> look<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.989> hardest<00:00:58.500> shaking

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
always look for like the hardest shaking

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
always look for like the hardest shaking
grass<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.640> don't<00:00:59.789> see<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.989> not

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
grass so if I don't see it I'm just not

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:16.380 
grass so if I don't see it I'm just not
gonna<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.100 

and<00:01:16.960> I<00:01:17.020> was<00:01:17.170> pretty<00:01:17.410> satisfied<00:01:17.620> with<00:01:17.860> that<00:01:18.130> one

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and I was pretty satisfied with that one

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.380 
and I was pretty satisfied with that one
and<00:01:20.110> go<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:21.040> is<00:01:21.220> my<00:01:21.370> second<00:01:21.790> Pancham<00:01:22.150> and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
and go this is my second Pancham and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.740 
and go this is my second Pancham and
then<00:01:23.140> I<00:01:23.500> guess<00:01:24.400> that<00:01:24.430> I<00:01:24.910> guess<00:01:25.060> it's<00:01:25.240> then<00:01:25.510> so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
then I guess that I guess it's then so

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.520 
then I guess that I guess it's then so
three<00:01:27.030> chain-like<00:01:28.030> nicly<00:01:28.870> fourth<00:01:29.140> chain<00:01:29.350> can

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
three chain-like nicly fourth chain can

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.120 
three chain-like nicly fourth chain can
they<00:01:29.590> on<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.800> fourth<00:01:30.010> one<00:01:30.070> just<00:01:31.920> watch<00:01:32.920> me

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
they on the fourth one just watch me

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.890 
they on the fourth one just watch me
watch<00:01:33.490> me<00:01:33.520> really<00:01:33.940> really<00:01:34.330> matched<00:01:34.600> up<00:01:34.810> I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
watch me really really matched up I

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.820 
watch me really really matched up I
probably<00:01:35.080> could've<00:01:35.320> picked<00:01:35.410> that<00:01:35.530> one<00:01:35.680> at<00:01:35.770> the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
probably could've picked that one at the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.710 
probably could've picked that one at the
bottom<00:01:36.010> but<00:01:36.400> guess<00:01:37.120> I'll<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.330> know<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.600> was

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
bottom but guess I'll you know that was

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.800 
bottom but guess I'll you know that was
top<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.940> another<00:01:39.940> Pancham<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.479> was<00:01:40.600> good<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
top to another Pancham it was good and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.960 
top to another Pancham it was good and
then<00:01:43.870> should<00:01:44.290> I<00:01:44.350> come<00:01:44.500> out<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.620> here<00:01:44.979> oh<00:01:45.160> man<00:01:45.640> I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
then should I come out of here oh man I

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.130 
then should I come out of here oh man I
was<00:01:46.810> like<00:01:46.960> what<00:01:47.410> I<00:01:48.119> had<00:01:49.119> to<00:01:49.210> I<00:01:49.330> actually<00:01:49.479> stop

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
was like what I had to I actually stop

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.140 
was like what I had to I actually stop
the<00:01:50.290> video<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.830> played<00:01:51.580> it<00:01:51.729> on<00:01:51.790> my<00:01:51.940> camera

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
the video and played it on my camera

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.580 
the video and played it on my camera
make<00:01:52.420> sure<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.600> know<00:01:52.750> exactly<00:01:52.780> who<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.290> patch

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
make sure I know exactly who that patch

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.469 
make sure I know exactly who that patch
was<00:01:53.860> because<00:01:54.850> I<00:01:54.910> kind<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.119> wasn't<00:01:55.270> paying

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
was because I kind of wasn't paying

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.650 
was because I kind of wasn't paying
attention<00:01:55.570> because<00:01:55.930> there's<00:01:56.200> only<00:01:56.380> chain<00:01:57.220> 4

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
attention because there's only chain 4

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
attention because there's only chain 4
but<00:01:58.660> yeah<00:01:58.869> it's<00:01:59.650> pretty<00:01:59.860> sick<00:02:00.040> um<00:02:01.590> yeah<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.619> mean

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
but yeah it's pretty sick um yeah I mean

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.020 
but yeah it's pretty sick um yeah I mean
that's<00:02:02.890> where<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.160> successful<00:02:03.640> chains<00:02:03.850> gonna

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
that's where the successful chains gonna

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.249 
that's where the successful chains gonna
look<00:02:04.119> like<00:02:04.270> that's<00:02:04.479> what<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.690> shiny<00:02:04.899> patch<00:02:05.110> is

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
look like that's what the shiny patch is

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.490 
look like that's what the shiny patch is
gonna<00:02:05.440> look<00:02:05.560> like<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:07.149> pretty<00:02:07.330> exciting<00:02:07.869> to

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
gonna look like it's pretty exciting to

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.560 
gonna look like it's pretty exciting to
do<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:08.830> really<00:02:09.790> nerve-wracking<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.360> try<00:02:10.509> to

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
do it really nerve-wracking to try to

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.390 
do it really nerve-wracking to try to
catch<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:11.290> don't<00:02:11.470> want<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.709> die<00:02:11.890> or

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
catch it you don't want to die or
