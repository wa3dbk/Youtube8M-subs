00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.000
We are with Nissan Qashqai. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The Qashqai; with its first generation, which was manufactured in 2007, was the pioneer of crossover segment, became a phenomenon by selling over 2 million up to the present day. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Does the Qashqai possesses properties that will be able to consolidate its success in this segment that raised its standards considerably? 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's analyze together... 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000
The Qashqai's design has been renewed completely. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Due to the reshaping of the body with hard edges the Qashqai looks more athletic. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
As regards to its predecessor its width has been increased by 20 mm, its length by 47 mm but its height has been decreased by 15 mm.  

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The boomerang shaped LED daylights have a share in distinguishing the Qashqai easily from other vehicles.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Also at the rear of the car new and bigger and different taillights have been used. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But more important feature is hidden in the boot. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The boot offers 20-liter more volume and becomes 430-liter now. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But we come to the more important part; in the old generation the boot lid did not open very high. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In other words if you were above average in height you could have stricken your head to the lid. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But now there is a 15 cm increase. And therefore the boot has become safer and more convenient. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The interior of the Qashqai is much more of high quality. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The soft plastic materials used and the design language has a share in giving the appearance that is equal to the premium brands. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
There are also more places for your small items.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
There are two-cup holders behind the gear knob and enough space in front of the knob. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Another remarkable renewal here is that instead of the mechanical hand brake, the electrical hand brake is being utilized. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Another feature that I like in the new Qashqai is that the driving position has been lowered. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
In the old generation even at the lowest position I had a feeling that my head would be touching the roof. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But in this car better and more ergonomic sitting position can be arranged. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Due to this good sitting position you have a better command of the field of vision. Although the A column is a bit thick it is not a big problem. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The real visual problem is the C column. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The C column is so thick that the field of vision of the rear view is a bit troublesome. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
At the rear there is a good knee and fair headroom is offered.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
You can easily reach the multimedia system, navigation, telephone connection and to the Around View Monitor by this 7 inch Nissan Connect touchscreen. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But there is something odd in its application. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
When you want to increase, in other words raise the numbers of the channels in the multimedia system my logic tells me that I should press the right hand button on the steering wheel. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
As you see now I'm pressing the right hand button few times and the numbers are decreasing instead of increasing. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Clearly I had a hard time to understand its reason. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Even though I have been driving this car for a week I must honestly point out that I have not been able to get used to this system. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The new Qashqai is imported to our country by 3 different engines; one petrol and two diesels. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The petrol engine is not 1.6-liter anymore but 1.2-liter turbocharged. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The diesels are as in the old generation can be purchased as 1.5 dCi and 1.6 dCi.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The driving quality and comfort of he Qashqai has increased a lot from its previous model. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
In the car I have been driving 1.6-liter diesel engine is functioning. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This engine develops 130 HP and 320 Nm or torque. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You can buy this car if you wish with 6-speed manual gearbox or with continuously variable ratio automatic gearbox called X-tronic. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The driving feature of this engine that was developed by the Renault-Nissan alliance is very good. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000
In other words, let me give you an example; this engine with its 320 Nm of torque has a capacity of performance equal to 2.0-liter diesel engines. 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
In general terms the engine is very lively. 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
If you do not stay at low revs in other words when you reach over 1500 rpm it offers you a very good traction. 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000
In the highway for example with the sixth gear you can achieve the top speed from 80 km/h without difficulty. 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
As always you will be curious about the Qashqia's fuel consumption. 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I drove this car for a week and have covered more than 300 km's. The trip computer shows an average of 6,5 liter per 100 km. 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Clearly I have to confess due to the engines high performance I had driven it hard and didn't drive frugally. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
If you drive economically it is possible to lower the fuel consumption.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But if you want to use 320 Nm of torque to the limit you should know that it is possible to reach 8,0 liter levels.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I have mentioned that the driving comfort has been increased. I think double piston shock absorbers helps this. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Clearly it does not matter how bad the road surface is the shock absorbers do their duties very well. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Not producing unwanted sounds or rattle is a very big advantage. 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.000
The electrical steering system is better than the previous one but still not very sensitive. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You can set the new Qashqai's steering firmness as Normal or Sport.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
In the daily driving situations choosing the Sport mode is logical. 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
But in the city where you need maneuvering and want softness then Normal mode is a better choice. 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The new technologies of the Qashqai is called the Safety Shield. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:48.000
They are; Forward Emergency Braking, Driver Attention Alert, Traffic Sign Recognition, Lane Departure Warning, Moving Object Detection and High Beam Assist. 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I'll not give you details; I'll not clearly mention these because you can learn them yourselves from the Nissan's web site. 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
But it is an advantage to know that this car is more reliable due to the Safety Shield. 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.400
As you can guess you have to pay extra for almost all of these technologies. 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.000
The second generation Qashqai came to the world with a heavy load on its shoulders.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But it clearly reveals that with increased quality and comfort features and new technologies and elegant design it will take the success it already possesses a step further. 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
See you... 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.500
By the way; don't forget to leave your suggestions, views and ideas under the video as remarks...
