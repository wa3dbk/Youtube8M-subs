00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
luck so I'm going to continue heating it

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.580 
luck so I'm going to continue heating it
up<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.120> hopefully<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:20.780> get<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.260> rest<00:02:21.470> of

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
up and hopefully I can get the rest of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.860 
up and hopefully I can get the rest of
the<00:02:21.710> glass<00:02:21.920> all<00:02:22.220> right<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:22.880> now<00:02:23.150> he<00:02:23.210> did<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.720> a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
the glass all right so now he did it a

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.140 
the glass all right so now he did it a
couple<00:02:23.900> more<00:02:24.410> times<00:02:24.710> here<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.370> I'm<00:02:25.460> starting

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
couple more times here and I'm starting

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.040 
couple more times here and I'm starting
to<00:02:26.330> get<00:02:26.540> most<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.260> off<00:02:28.060> as<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.450> can<00:02:29.600> see<00:02:29.870> if

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
to get most of it off as you can see if

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.840 
to get most of it off as you can see if
it<00:02:30.200> makes<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.500> difference<00:02:30.530> depending<00:02:31.100> on<00:02:31.520> where

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
it makes a difference depending on where

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.900 
it makes a difference depending on where
your<00:02:32.260> screen<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.410> cracked<00:02:33.830> or<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.640> glass

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
your screen is cracked or the glass

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.130 
your screen is cracked or the glass
rather<00:02:35.620> there<00:02:36.620> doesn't<00:02:36.950> seem<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.130> be<00:02:37.310> any

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
rather there doesn't seem to be any

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.620 
rather there doesn't seem to be any
adhesive<00:02:39.140> down<00:02:39.680> at<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.980> bottom<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.610> just<00:02:41.450> kind

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
adhesive down at the bottom I just kind

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.680 
adhesive down at the bottom I just kind
of<00:02:41.690> along<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.170> edges<00:02:42.430> but<00:02:43.430> as<00:02:44.180> far<00:02:44.390> as<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.630> can

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
of along the edges but as far as I can

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.520 
of along the edges but as far as I can
tell<00:02:44.840> right<00:02:44.990> now<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.500> all<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.010> middle<00:02:46.480> so

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
tell right now it's all in the middle so

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.290 
tell right now it's all in the middle so
that<00:02:48.530> may<00:02:49.340> or<00:02:49.490> may<00:02:49.520> not<00:02:49.670> make<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.060> difference

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
that may or may not make a difference

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.810 
that may or may not make a difference
depending<00:02:50.720> on<00:02:51.110> where<00:02:51.350> it's<00:02:51.500> broken<00:02:51.770> all<00:02:52.580> right

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
depending on where it's broken all right

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.360 
depending on where it's broken all right
so<00:02:53.120> as<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.600> can<00:02:53.720> see<00:02:53.930> here<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.190> finally<00:02:55.190> gotten

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
so as you can see here I finally gotten

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.050 
so as you can see here I finally gotten
on<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.550> glass<00:02:55.880> off<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:57.530> will<00:02:57.980> say<00:02:58.280> this<00:02:58.790> heat

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
on the glass off I will say this heat

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.300 
on the glass off I will say this heat
gun<00:02:59.240> i<00:02:59.270> was<00:02:59.570> using<00:02:59.780> it<00:03:00.140> on<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.530> lowest<00:03:00.770> setting

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
gun i was using it on the lowest setting

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.660 
gun i was using it on the lowest setting
and<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:02.810> seemed<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.230> have<00:03:03.410> plenty<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.459> heat

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
and it seemed to have plenty of heat

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.630 
and it seemed to have plenty of heat
obviously<00:03:05.680> didn't<00:03:06.680> take<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.860> whole<00:03:06.950> lot<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.519> get

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
obviously didn't take a whole lot to get

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.690 
obviously didn't take a whole lot to get
it<00:03:07.930> loosened<00:03:08.930> up<00:03:09.050> one<00:03:09.950> thing<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.310> watch<00:03:10.459> out

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
it loosened up one thing to watch out

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.490 
it loosened up one thing to watch out
for<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:11.239> don't<00:03:11.510> know<00:03:11.600> if<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.780> can<00:03:11.959> tell<00:03:12.170> but<00:03:12.230> I

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
for I don't know if you can tell but I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.640 
for I don't know if you can tell but I
have<00:03:12.830> bent<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.550> cover<00:03:13.880> slightly<00:03:14.630> trying<00:03:15.560> to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
have bent this cover slightly trying to

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.670 
have bent this cover slightly trying to
pry<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:15.920> out<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:17.510> wider<00:03:17.930> tool<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.470> can<00:03:18.620> use

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
pry it out so the wider tool you can use

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.009 
pry it out so the wider tool you can use
the<00:03:19.130> better<00:03:19.370> they're<00:03:19.700> all<00:03:19.880> right<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.480> now<00:03:20.690> I've

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
the better they're all right so now I've

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.580 
the better they're all right so now I've
put<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.590> new<00:03:21.739> glass<00:03:22.040> on<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:23.180> casing<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:24.080> it

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
put the new glass on the casing and it

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.650 
put the new glass on the casing and it
is<00:03:24.739> still<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.040> little<00:03:25.190> bent<00:03:25.519> but<00:03:25.970> I'm<00:03:26.209> hoping

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
is still a little bent but I'm hoping

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.520 
is still a little bent but I'm hoping
that<00:03:26.989> if<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.410> heat<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.650> up<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.510> try<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.570> push<00:03:30.380> it

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
that if I heat it up and try to push it

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.570 
that if I heat it up and try to push it
all<00:03:30.650> back<00:03:30.890> together<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.510> same<00:03:33.580> adhesive

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
all back together that the same adhesive

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.850 
all back together that the same adhesive
that<00:03:34.610> was<00:03:34.880> already<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.750> going<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.560> hold

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
that was already there is going to hold

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.180 
that was already there is going to hold
it<00:03:37.010> in<00:03:37.160> place<00:03:37.630> so<00:03:38.630> just<00:03:39.560> make<00:03:39.739> sure<00:03:39.769> when<00:03:40.100> you

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
it in place so just make sure when you

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.460 
it in place so just make sure when you
put<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.459> back<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.360> directional<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.290> need

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
put it back it is directional you need

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.009 
put it back it is directional you need
to<00:03:42.650> get<00:03:42.830> it<00:03:43.120> with<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.150> camera<00:03:44.630> hole<00:03:44.840> at<00:03:44.989> the

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
to get it with the camera hole at the

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.690 
to get it with the camera hole at the
top<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:45.680> I've<00:03:45.800> already<00:03:46.010> put<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.370> on<00:03:46.489> backwards

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
top and I've already put it on backwards

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.050 
top and I've already put it on backwards
and<00:03:47.330> had<00:03:48.200> heated<00:03:48.530> up<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:48.860> get<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.070> back<00:03:49.190> off<00:03:49.459> all

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
and had heated up to get it back off all

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.180 
and had heated up to get it back off all
right<00:03:50.330> so<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:51.019> problem<00:03:51.260> I'm<00:03:51.410> having<00:03:51.440> now<00:03:51.890> and

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
right so the problem I'm having now and

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.120 
right so the problem I'm having now and
I<00:03:52.250> had<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.519> take<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.850> glass<00:03:53.090> back<00:03:53.420> off<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:54.130> as

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
I had to take the glass back off is as

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.370 
I had to take the glass back off is as
you<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.580> see<00:03:55.820> there's<00:03:56.239> lots<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.660> adhesive<00:03:57.170> in

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
you can see there's lots of adhesive in

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.789 
you can see there's lots of adhesive in
the<00:03:57.590> middle<00:03:57.920> but<00:03:58.370> none<00:03:58.970> kind<00:03:59.840> of<00:03:59.930> on<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.110> edges

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
the middle but none kind of on the edges

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.940 
the middle but none kind of on the edges
on<00:04:01.010> both<00:04:01.070> sides<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:02.299> since<00:04:02.600> my<00:04:02.690> case<00:04:03.440> was<00:04:03.650> bent

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
on both sides so since my case was bent

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.690 
on both sides so since my case was bent
a<00:04:04.100> little<00:04:04.130> bit<00:04:04.580> I<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:06.440> tried<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.160> bend<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.459> back

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
a little bit I I tried to bend it back

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.140 
a little bit I I tried to bend it back
and<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.120> seems<00:04:08.480> pretty<00:04:08.750> straight<00:04:09.260> but<00:04:10.250> just<00:04:10.700> to

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
and it seems pretty straight but just to

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.200 
and it seems pretty straight but just to
be<00:04:11.300> safe<00:04:11.330> I'm<00:04:11.930> going<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.319> put<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.800> drop<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.310> super

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
be safe I'm going to put a drop of super

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.600 
be safe I'm going to put a drop of super
hopefully<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.840> really<00:04:15.110> small<00:04:15.380> drop<00:04:15.770> right

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
hopefully a really small drop right

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.630 
hopefully a really small drop right
there<00:04:16.640> and<00:04:17.120> right<00:04:17.180> there<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:18.560> hopefully<00:04:19.310> that

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
there and right there and hopefully that

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.260 
there and right there and hopefully that
will<00:04:19.760> hold<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.360> edges<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.080> case<00:04:21.850> down<00:04:22.850> and

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
will hold the edges of the case down and

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.960 
will hold the edges of the case down and
it'll<00:04:23.600> lay<00:04:24.080> flat<00:04:24.440> all<00:04:24.710> right<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:25.430> here's<00:04:25.460> the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
it'll lay flat all right so here's the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.080 
it'll lay flat all right so here's the
finished<00:04:26.150> product<00:04:27.160> may<00:04:28.160> not<00:04:28.400> be<00:04:28.640> quite<00:04:28.940> as

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
finished product may not be quite as

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.800 
finished product may not be quite as
good<00:04:29.540> as<00:04:29.720> new<00:04:30.190> but<00:04:31.190> it's<00:04:32.120> definitely<00:04:32.390> a<00:04:32.630> lot

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
good as new but it's definitely a lot

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.390 
good as new but it's definitely a lot
better<00:04:32.870> than<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.350> cracked<00:04:33.710> one<00:04:34.420> I<00:04:35.420> did<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.400> did

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
better than a cracked one I did I did

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.600 
better than a cracked one I did I did
try<00:04:37.670> to<00:04:37.700> bend<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.270> casing<00:04:38.690> back<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:40.430> it

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
try to bend the casing back and it

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.760 
try to bend the casing back and it
worked<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.300> got<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.570> pretty<00:04:41.780> straight<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.320> so

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
worked and got it pretty straight and so

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.420 
worked and got it pretty straight and so
then<00:04:43.010> all<00:04:43.130> I<00:04:43.190> had<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.490> do<00:04:43.840> was<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.410> put<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.160> glass

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
then all I had to do was I put the glass

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.510 
then all I had to do was I put the glass
in<00:04:46.460> there<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.140> then<00:04:49.840> heated<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:50.960> up<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.520> I

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
in there and then heated it up and I

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.520 
in there and then heated it up and I
have<00:04:52.880> some<00:04:53.150> welding<00:04:53.780> gloves<00:04:53.930> here<00:04:54.350> because

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
have some welding gloves here because

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.020 
have some welding gloves here because
that's<00:04:54.710> what<00:04:54.890> I<00:04:54.920> had<00:04:55.190> but<00:04:55.430> anything<00:04:55.820> he

resistant you can just take it in your
hand<00:04:59.480> like<00:04:59.720> that<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.080> squish<00:05:00.980> it<00:05:01.010> in<00:05:01.280> together

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
hand like that and squish it in together

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.090
