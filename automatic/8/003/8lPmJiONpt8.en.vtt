00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
original suspension seat and we've

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
original suspension seat and we've
checked<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.049> unit<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.500> we've<00:01:37.829> used<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> here

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
checked this unit out we've used it here

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.630 
checked this unit out we've used it here
at<00:01:38.490> our<00:01:38.579> facility<00:01:39.530> also<00:01:40.530> these<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.400> two

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
at our facility also these have two

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.480 
at our facility also these have two
speeds<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.649> having<00:01:43.890> an<00:01:44.009> overdrive

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
speeds so it's like having an overdrive

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.899 
speeds so it's like having an overdrive
so<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.509> scoot<00:01:45.810> along<00:01:45.990> nicely<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
so they really scoot along nicely and

so they really scoot along nicely and
we've<00:01:47.909> checked<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:48.420> there's<00:01:49.049> no<00:01:49.320> leaks<00:01:50.189> or

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
we've checked it out there's no leaks or

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.520 
we've checked it out there's no leaks or
squeaks<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.270> everything<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.380> good

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
working condition and we also did a just

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.510 
working condition and we also did a just
did<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> full<00:01:57.329> service<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.369> filters<00:01:59.369> have

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
did a full service to it so filters have

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.940 
did a full service to it so filters have
all<00:01:59.670> been<00:01:59.850> changed<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.689> hydraulic<00:02:01.290> filters
