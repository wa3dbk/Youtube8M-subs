00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.930

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.670
 people in this is with one 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.960
 informative video for the somewhat experienced 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.220
 fifa player without relaxes 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.660
 probably the people for that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.610
 all english videos watch your fussells 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.840
 virgin gaming password for the 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.490
 people who do not know because it is so 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.259
 really just a competitive site 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.610
 where you call fifa or other games 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.840
 can play for money 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.550
 so if you think you are very good 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.590
 are in fifa then the appeared keypads 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.790
 destination to play for money 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.380
 so go a little bit through the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.399
 site in how you walk out how you do this 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.260
 all must set up how you 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.570
 will eventually play for money 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.950
 so after you have made narcodent 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.540
 you probably do not state money he 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.130
 cashiers is now at zero dollars 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.540
 going to do sport go to cashiers and 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.130
 then you press deep shit but there 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.840
 probably already gets up automatically 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.370
 and then you put an amount on person 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.170
 game in that camp via credit card via 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 paypal via click and buy 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.680
 most people would do it via paypal 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.850
 but if you don't have pepper skin then you would 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.320
 to make that for a while 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.240
 that in itself is not that much work 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.070
 then you put a price on a minimum 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.420
 $ 10 if you've done then go 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.640
 you to games and tournaments 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.530
 and then to browse more games we go i 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.329
 through all games with you for money 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.590
 play because it is festively supported in lommel 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.299

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.710
 play playstation 3 or xbox and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.420
 since i am on xbox i choose of course 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.740
 from eva stream 60 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.940
 so you choose all games to choose 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.850
 so on viva and then you probably go 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.350
 a few simple minutes and then comes 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.240
 probably on this screen 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.970
 so is then going to do then you press so 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.590

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.010
 then choose your own console in my 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.720
 case xbox and then you come to life 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.220
 wait you come to this screen you can 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.140
 choose play for free the sometimes you could 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.369
 can is a go to porche player so go 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.500
 but you really need a play for 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.479
 cash hit or yes when you play the game 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.920
 and the cherry on the challenge 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.930
 tropical can also be the never tournaments 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.610
 but I recommend going out 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.260
 cash challenge lobbies to do now 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.270
 smoking tournament and the people who run the 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.010
 most matches play coming two 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.180
 roads that are eligible for one 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.520
 tournament play very good tournament 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.600
 where you can play $ 500 but 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.460
 It gets to be even more on the site 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.979
 explained if interested 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.110
 because pressure is on that on that challenge 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.240
 hobby and to see here already a moby's 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.310
 which you can click on canticum on can 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.269
 choose missiles but a lobby i have i 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.560
 not once see where my and 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.900
 multiple hobbies are the click on that 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.180
 are now 124 people person game go 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.530
 play then you see versus people chat 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.629
 all advertise for how much they 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.219
 to play you see all players on the left 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.629
 so arsenal sees hello to him 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.500
 do I play look natural even 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.700
 tie the seam 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.260
 they go to a skill level a bit 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.390
 you can roughly estimate how 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.980
 how good they are that push this 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.590
 Challenger neighbor pick just there to 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.880
 someone then set and match and then tryphy 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.080
 choose the amount of football 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.880
 play after you then with that guest 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.950
 So naturally agreed for it 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.720
 For ease I make five dollars and if that 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.250
 that's just about an eight dollar tardis 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.050
 frozen game never something and so then 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.640
 you have to take that into account 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.590
 but yes if you had to pass for money 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.970
 all look around something then you press 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.260
 on his challenge nice to be below 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.580
 all instructions state how you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.140
 countergas it is all 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.020
 very easily arranged to just be 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.670
 a special option fhd 10 spots arena 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.840
 so then you will already be explained how 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.640
 still has to go is in itself 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.170
 nothing about work that stuff you 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.180

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.590
 gl plays and you win or yes you have to 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.030
