00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.080 

the<00:00:15.570> war<00:00:15.840> on<00:00:16.080> terror<00:00:16.700> did<00:00:17.700> you<00:00:17.790> know<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:17.910> in

the war on terror did you know that in

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.859 
the war on terror did you know that in
1869<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.230> they<00:00:19.820> in<00:00:20.820> 1869<00:00:21.360> when<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.690> Ku<00:00:21.840> Klux

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
1869 when they in 1869 when the Ku Klux

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.900 
1869 when they in 1869 when the Ku Klux
Klan<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:22.529> formed<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.250> sitting<00:00:23.490> president<00:00:23.610> at

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
Klan was formed the sitting president at

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.460 
Klan was formed the sitting president at
the<00:00:24.000> time<00:00:24.029> which<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.660> was<00:00:24.810> ulysses<00:00:25.260> s

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the time which I think was ulysses s

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.140 
the time which I think was ulysses s
grant<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:26.040> could<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.369> wrong<00:00:26.490> about<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.790> but<00:00:27.090> I

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
grant I could be wrong about that but I

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.210 
grant I could be wrong about that but I
think<00:00:27.240> he<00:00:27.420> was<00:00:27.540> the<00:00:27.660> 18th<00:00:27.930> president<00:00:28.410> which

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
think he was the 18th president which

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.010 
think he was the 18th president which
would<00:00:29.400> put<00:00:29.580> him<00:00:29.700> around<00:00:29.760> 1869<00:00:30.599> I'm<00:00:30.869> not

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
would put him around 1869 I'm not

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.080 
would put him around 1869 I'm not
exactly<00:00:31.380> sure<00:00:31.770> I<00:00:32.040> might<00:00:32.700> need<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.970> take

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
exactly sure I might need to take

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.020 
exactly sure I might need to take
another<00:00:33.210> adderall<00:00:34.370> which<00:00:35.370> by<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> way<00:00:35.730> I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
another adderall which by the way I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.790 
another adderall which by the way I
don't<00:00:36.390> need<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.810> take<00:00:36.989> adderall<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
don't need to take adderall because I

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.470 
don't need to take adderall because I
don't<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.310> TD<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:38.970> if<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.180> don't<00:00:39.360> have

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
don't have a TD but if you don't have

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.880 
don't have a TD but if you don't have
anything<00:00:39.720> you<00:00:39.989> take<00:00:40.200> adderall

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
anything you take adderall

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.520 
anything you take adderall
it's<00:00:41.489> excellent<00:00:41.960> but<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.079> did<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.320> hear<00:00:43.470> that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it's excellent but you did not hear that

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
it's excellent but you did not hear that
from<00:00:43.680> me<00:00:43.980> especially<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> mix<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.390> with

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
from me especially if you mix it with

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.760 
from me especially if you mix it with
meridia<00:00:45.870> which<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:46.290> appetite<00:00:46.620> suppressant

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
meridia which is an appetite suppressant

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.400 
meridia which is an appetite suppressant
and<00:00:47.310> a<00:00:47.460> couple<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.790> Red<00:00:47.940> Bulls<00:00:49.220> anywho<00:00:50.630> in<00:00:51.630> 1869

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
and a couple of Red Bulls anywho in 1869

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.500 
and a couple of Red Bulls anywho in 1869
which<00:00:52.890> i<00:00:53.010> think<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.460> KKK<00:00:53.940> formed<00:00:54.360> in

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
which i think is when the KKK formed in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.810 
which i think is when the KKK formed in
the<00:00:54.930> south<00:00:55.220> during<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:56.370> Civil<00:00:56.610> War<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the south during the Civil War in a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.260 
the south during the Civil War in a
reconstruction<00:00:58.310> ulysses<00:00:59.310> s<00:00:59.430> grant<00:00:59.490> sent

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
reconstruction ulysses s grant sent

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.590 
reconstruction ulysses s grant sent
federal<00:01:00.510> troops<00:01:00.720> down<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.920> fort<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.090> KKK

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
federal troops down to fort the KKK

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.870 
federal troops down to fort the KKK
which<00:01:04.049> would<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.350> our<00:01:04.470> first<00:01:04.769> war<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.460> terror

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
which would be our first war on terror

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.960 
which would be our first war on terror
so<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.680> believe<00:01:08.009> that<00:01:08.369> anybody

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
so are we then to believe that anybody

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.499 
so are we then to believe that anybody
who<00:01:09.420> had<00:01:09.950> ideologies<00:01:10.950> prior<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> 1869<00:01:12.150> was

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
who had ideologies prior to 1869 was

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.999 
who had ideologies prior to 1869 was
guilty<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.009> pre<00:01:14.450> 1869<00:01:15.450> thinking<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.320> now

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
guilty of pre 1869 thinking and now

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.709 
guilty of pre 1869 thinking and now
we're<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> post<00:01:17.670> 1869<00:01:18.659> world<00:01:19.159> or<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.999> when

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
we're in a post 1869 world or in when

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.080
