is<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:29.340> two

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
is as you can see we have actually two

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.190 
is as you can see we have actually two
options<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:30.900> away<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:32.360> if<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.840> click<00:01:33.990> on

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
options on right away and if we click on

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.230 
options on right away and if we click on
this<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.470> will<00:01:34.500> quickly<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> snapshot<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
this it will quickly take a snapshot and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.819 
this it will quickly take a snapshot and
if<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.630> notice<00:01:36.960> how<00:01:37.140> quickly<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.680> took

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
if you have notice how quickly it took

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.130 
if you have notice how quickly it took
this<00:01:38.040> photograph<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.060> click<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
this photograph just click on it and it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.289 
this photograph just click on it and it
takes<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> photograph<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:42.060> shutter

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
takes the photograph so the shutter

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.270 
takes the photograph so the shutter
speed<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.750> really<00:01:42.990> fast<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.100> just

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
speed is really fast and if you just

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.210 
speed is really fast and if you just
hold<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> shutter<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.329> while<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.890> can

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
hold the shutter for a while it can

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.340 
hold the shutter for a while it can
quickly<00:01:47.520> take<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.880> lot<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.210> photographs<00:01:48.509> like

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
quickly take a lot of photographs like

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.649 
quickly take a lot of photographs like
high-end<00:01:49.740> dslr's

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
high-end dslr's

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.240 
high-end dslr's
by<00:01:51.659> doing<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.470> take<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> lot<00:01:53.220> of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
by doing this you take a lot of

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.789 
by doing this you take a lot of
photographs<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.090> let's<00:01:54.780> say<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.590> choose

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
photographs and let's say you can choose

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.590 
photographs and let's say you can choose
between<00:01:55.950> which<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> best<00:01:56.670> shot<00:01:56.939> let's<00:01:57.390> say

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
between which is the best shot let's say

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.719 
between which is the best shot let's say

this is our best shot I just click here
and<00:01:59.880> say<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> best<00:02:01.020> shot<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.500> we

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and say this is the best shot and we

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.800 
and say this is the best shot and we
keep<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.219> photograph<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.210> need

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
keep that photograph and need

keep that photograph and need
the<00:02:03.899> photographs<00:02:04.439> also<00:02:05.220> another<00:02:05.579> innovative

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the photographs also another innovative

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.300 
the photographs also another innovative
thing<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.380> directly<00:02:07.740> start

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
thing is that you can directly start

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.190 
thing is that you can directly start
shooting<00:02:08.729> medium<00:02:09.030> actually<00:02:09.630> now<00:02:09.780> shooting

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
shooting medium actually now shooting

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.470 
shooting medium actually now shooting
the<00:02:10.289> video<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.950> while<00:02:11.790> shooting<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.239> video

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
the video and while shooting the video

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.870 
the video and while shooting the video
also<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.780> take<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.140> snapshot<00:02:13.530> for<00:02:14.430> example

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
also you can take a snapshot for example

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.030 
also you can take a snapshot for example
now<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.060> has<00:02:15.209> taken<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.540> photograph<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.920> is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
now it has taken a photograph so that is

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.110 
now it has taken a photograph so that is
also<00:02:17.190> pretty<00:02:17.400> unique<00:02:18.470> for<00:02:19.470> example<00:02:20.010> let<00:02:21.000> me

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
also pretty unique for example let me

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.070 
also pretty unique for example let me
show<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> same<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.470> video<00:02:24.080> but

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
show you the same this is the video but

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.410 
show you the same this is the video but
as<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.280> static<00:02:26.700> shot<00:02:27.239> that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
as you see this is the static shot that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.000 
as you see this is the static shot that
we<00:02:27.569> have<00:02:27.660> taken<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.080> video<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.860> is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
we have taken in the video so it is

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.720 
we have taken in the video so it is
again<00:02:29.430> pretty<00:02:29.700> impressive<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.459> can<00:02:32.610> see

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
again pretty impressive and you can see

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.479 
again pretty impressive and you can see
we<00:02:32.790> can<00:02:32.940> play<00:02:33.090> back<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.450> same<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:35.220> also

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
we can play back the same and it also

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.850 
we can play back the same and it also
does<00:02:35.850> auto<00:02:36.239> focusing<00:02:37.140> while<00:02:37.350> shooting<00:02:37.769> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
does auto focusing while shooting the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.210 
does auto focusing while shooting the
video<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.819> taken<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.330> bunch<00:02:39.660> of

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
video I have taken a bunch of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.370 
video I have taken a bunch of
photographs<00:02:41.220> with<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:42.060> phone<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.930> varying

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
photographs with this phone in varying

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.870 
photographs with this phone in varying
light<00:02:43.560> conditions<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.549> can<00:02:44.700> check

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
light conditions so that you can check

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.880 
light conditions so that you can check
the<00:02:45.030> performance<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> same<00:02:45.989> these<00:02:46.709> are

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
the performance of the same these are

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.259 
the performance of the same these are
some<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.250> photographs<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.150> have

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
taken with the phone and as you can see

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.250 
taken with the phone and as you can see
they<00:02:50.580> are<00:02:50.670> pretty<00:02:50.819> viable<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.569> am<00:02:51.959> just<00:02:52.140> going

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
they are pretty viable I am just going

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.380 
they are pretty viable I am just going
to<00:02:52.380> show<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.560> all<00:02:52.799> these<00:02:52.950> photographs<00:02:53.160> now<00:02:53.760> so

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
to show you all these photographs now so

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.000 
to show you all these photographs now so
that<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:54.720> can<00:02:54.750> gauge<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.200> quality<00:02:55.799> of<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
that you can gauge the quality of the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.640 
that you can gauge the quality of the
same<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.370> again<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.760> would<00:02:57.030> say<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:58.019> camera<00:02:58.470> on

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
same but again I would say the camera on

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.220 
same but again I would say the camera on
this<00:02:58.799> phone<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.160> actually<00:02:59.640> pretty<00:02:59.940> nice<00:03:00.450> we

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
this phone is actually pretty nice we

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.949 
this phone is actually pretty nice we
also<00:03:01.470> do<00:03:02.099> get<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.549> digital<00:03:03.030> zoom<00:03:03.269> if<00:03:03.630> you

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
also do get this digital zoom if you

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.210 
also do get this digital zoom if you
like<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.769> again<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:05.459> won't<00:03:06.330> go<00:03:06.829> bonkers<00:03:07.829> with

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
like but again I won't go bonkers with

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.250 
like but again I won't go bonkers with
the<00:03:08.370> same<00:03:08.549> because<00:03:08.880> again<00:03:09.209> if<00:03:09.329> you<00:03:09.359> do<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> lot

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
the same because again if you do a lot

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.520 
the same because again if you do a lot
of<00:03:10.290> zoom<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:11.130> gets<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.459> little<00:03:11.609> bit<00:03:11.790> pixelated

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
of zoom it gets a little bit pixelated

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.840 
of zoom it gets a little bit pixelated
but<00:03:13.530> again<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.859> digital<00:03:14.160> zoom<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.519> there<00:03:14.700> if

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
but again in digital zoom is there if

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.210 
but again in digital zoom is there if
you<00:03:14.880> like<00:03:15.150> again<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.049> found<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.560> camera

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
you like again I found the camera

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.770 
you like again I found the camera
performance<00:03:17.700> even<00:03:17.880> in<00:03:18.030> low-light<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.660> be

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
performance even in low-light to be

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.110 
performance even in low-light to be
above<00:03:19.079> average<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.980> do<00:03:20.190> have<00:03:20.400> flash<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.090> I

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
above average we do have flash but I

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.390 
above average we do have flash but I
have<00:03:21.390> noticed<00:03:21.780> again<00:03:21.900> standard<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.829> if<00:03:23.100> you

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
have noticed again standard that if you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.009 
have noticed again standard that if you
force<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.819> flash<00:03:24.060> for<00:03:24.299> example<00:03:24.660> I'm<00:03:24.750> going<00:03:24.900> to

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
force the flash for example I'm going to

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.580 
force the flash for example I'm going to
force<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.500> flash<00:03:25.739> now<00:03:26.030> take<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.209> photograph

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
force the flash now take this photograph

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.740 
force the flash now take this photograph
it<00:03:28.590> over<00:03:28.980> exposes<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.579> little<00:03:30.000> bit<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.420> have

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
it over exposes a little bit I have

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.690 
it over exposes a little bit I have
found<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.319> be<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.620> same<00:03:31.799> with<00:03:32.040> every

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
found this to be the same with every

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.759 
found this to be the same with every

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.240 
settings now I'm going into the shadowed
area<00:05:00.140> I'm<00:05:01.140> going<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.470> pan<00:05:01.650> around<00:05:01.860> a<00:05:02.100> little

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
area I'm going to pan around a little

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.420 
area I'm going to pan around a little
bit<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:03.600> thing<00:05:03.990> that<00:05:04.140> you<00:05:04.230> are<00:05:04.260> seeing<00:05:05.130> is<00:05:05.280> the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
bit the thing that you are seeing is the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.040 
bit the thing that you are seeing is the
blurring<00:05:05.640> is<00:05:05.880> thing<00:05:06.180> I<00:05:06.300> think<00:05:06.510> so<00:05:06.630> it's<00:05:06.780> auto

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
blurring is thing I think so it's auto

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.580 
blurring is thing I think so it's auto
focusing<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:08.660> now<00:05:11.420> I'm<00:05:12.420> going<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.720> go<00:05:12.840> back<00:05:13.140> to

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
focusing and now I'm going to go back to

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.220 
focusing and now I'm going to go back to
the<00:05:13.770> sunny<00:05:14.310> area<00:05:14.670> the<00:05:15.360> sun<00:05:15.570> is<00:05:15.690> shining<00:05:15.870> ready

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
the sunny area the sun is shining ready

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.610 
the sunny area the sun is shining ready
bright<00:05:16.560> it's<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:17.400> Indian<00:05:17.700> summer<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.630> again

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
bright it's the Indian summer and again

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.350 
bright it's the Indian summer and again
as<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:19.860> can<00:05:20.010> see<00:05:20.160> it's<00:05:20.340> blurring<00:05:20.760> so<00:05:20.970> that

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
as you can see it's blurring so that

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.570 
as you can see it's blurring so that
means<00:05:21.570> it's<00:05:21.720> auto<00:05:22.230> focusing<00:05:22.770> you<00:05:23.160> can<00:05:23.310> disable

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
means it's auto focusing you can disable

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.160 
means it's auto focusing you can disable
this<00:05:23.880> thing<00:05:24.720> in<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:24.960> settings<00:05:25.760> and<00:05:27.170> this

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
this thing in the settings and this

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.900 
this thing in the settings and this
should<00:05:28.380> hopefully<00:05:28.530> give<00:05:29.010> you<00:05:29.130> an<00:05:29.250> idea<00:05:29.550> about
