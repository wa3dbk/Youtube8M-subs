this great dynamic from the start I was

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.709 
this great dynamic from the start I was
at<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> time<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.670> kind<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.239> butch<00:00:54.510> or

and always has been remains a really
feminine<00:01:01.500> identified<00:01:02.449> woman<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.750> wasn't

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
feminine identified woman it wasn't

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.320 
feminine identified woman it wasn't
something<00:01:05.309> even<00:01:05.729> when<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.909> entered<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
something even when I entered the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.080 
something even when I entered the
relationship<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.380> was<00:01:07.590> thinking<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.939> is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
relationship that I was thinking this is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.500 
relationship that I was thinking this is
something<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.479> need<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.659> tell<00:01:09.900> her<00:01:10.140> about<00:01:10.380> me

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
something I need to tell her about me

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.480 
something I need to tell her about me
it's<00:01:12.510> hard<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.049> explain<00:01:13.409> how<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:14.220> had

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
it's hard to explain how I had

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.490 
it's hard to explain how I had
compartmentalized<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.900> part<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.229> me<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
compartmentalized that part of me and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.380 
compartmentalized that part of me and
just<00:01:16.590> put<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> somewhere<00:01:17.100> else<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:18.000> hadn't

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
just put it somewhere else and it hadn't

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.649 
just put it somewhere else and it hadn't
come<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.900> fore<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.950> several<00:01:20.310> years<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
come to the fore for several years so it

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.570 
come to the fore for several years so it
was<00:01:21.689> about<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.770> year<00:01:23.220> into<00:01:23.460> our<00:01:23.490> relationship

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
was about a year into our relationship

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.330 
was about a year into our relationship
and<00:01:24.409> I<00:01:26.810> decided<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.110> knew<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.220> was

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and I decided I just knew that it was

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
and I decided I just knew that it was
time<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.700> tell<00:01:29.880> her<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.420> she<00:01:30.509> would<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
time to tell her so she would be the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.109 
time to tell her so she would be the
first<00:01:31.650> person<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.130> had<00:01:32.280> said<00:01:32.490> those<00:01:32.670> words<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
in six years

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
in six years
that<00:01:35.340> night<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.790> knew<00:01:36.060> when<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.299> sat<00:01:36.479> down<00:01:36.630> next

to ask her will you be willing to do the
injections<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:06.570> me<00:03:06.750> because<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.290> knew<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
injections for me because I knew that it

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.470 
injections for me because I knew that it
would<00:03:08.690> probably<00:03:09.690> be<00:03:10.580> prohibitive<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:12.300> would

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
would probably be prohibitive it would

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.570 
would probably be prohibitive it would
it<00:03:12.690> would<00:03:12.810> make<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.110> really<00:03:13.890> difficult<00:03:14.040> if<00:03:14.520> not

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
it would make it really difficult if not

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.660 
it would make it really difficult if not
impossible<00:03:14.700> for<00:03:15.180> me<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:16.459> use<00:03:17.459> the

impossible for me to use the
testosterone<00:03:18.330> myself<00:03:18.810> because<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.230> would

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
testosterone myself because that would

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.870 
testosterone myself because that would
mean<00:03:19.470> I'd<00:03:19.560> have<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.769> inject<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.519> in<00:03:20.610> my<00:03:20.760> own

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880
