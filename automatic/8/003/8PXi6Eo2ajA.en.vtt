00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello to all and the gabon and for 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.810
 start this test podcast the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.450
 microphone rod video mike leigh rating 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.830
 read on looking for Annecy lake in marana 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.830
 the streets and there are more cars 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.470
 so here is theirs today if we have 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.730
 managed to avoid most cars 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.530
 that there was in the street for you 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.990
 speak 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.190
 a mytri video code then read a 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.290
 everyday what is it all 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.090
 just this little thing an abs etc which 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.760
 allows you to isolate the microphone from all 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.200
 the little vibrations that will be there 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.970
 on the camera case 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.950
 it's exactly the same video mike that 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.420
 the one that was done before exactly the 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.250
 same slice everything but a place and 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.840
 rotten support with 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.700
 elastic if you pay inelastic the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.110
 micro party on the other side and that's where 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.610
 you end up with this thing 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.320
 knitters read an abs but ankara 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.600
 it's just plastic that 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.370
 will isolate properly your microphone 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.570
 of your SLR camera or your 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.830
 camera so that the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.970
 vibration is not transmitted then 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.680
 it's more or less the same thing 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.630
 always your little jack you have 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.250
 always here the button with a 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.690
 increase 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.610
 it's always powered by the same 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.500
 small pile akissi in but suddenly 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.940
 the case are found on it so 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.140
 I was going to tell you to accept more 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.490
 convenient access but it's just that 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.940
 I do not immediately have something that I can 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.470
 not in this system so here you are 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.260
 have your stack inside it was 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.700
 plus a monoprix volt and inside 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.470
 you always have so I do not know if 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.790
 you see big thing the zeros 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.729
 decibels etc 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.369
 gnagnagna here are the settings here from 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.110
 accuracy for your little mic in this 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.460
 road video mike with support rigotte 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.079
 to read it is like I said exactly 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.219
 the same as the old version with the 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.390
 little elastics that is getting stuck is in 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.729
 all the senses and that was the right thing 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.799
 supra dog the support and contain it 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.000
 this title grosjean has bsg movie shot 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.290
 with the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.900
 videoman so the song is still 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.580
 a little bit improved normally and this 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.840
 little video marked on this medium and 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.740
 Cotignac is simply 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.560
 plastic and that will allow you 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.150
 to have to isolate your microphone from 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.560
 blow case when you ask yourself 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.000
 your microphone on your case the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.260
 case vibrations when you have 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.400
 manipulated when you go to change 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.850
 focal when you are going to trigger or 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.050
 make an opening adjustment or two 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.850
 speed shutter frequencies 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.080
 shutter the vibrations will only 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.090
 not transmitted to the microphone and suddenly it 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.350
 will be better the mike video which is a 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.850
 micro canon that is normally 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.900
 you do not hear or few cars 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.610
 who is behind me but you 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.050
 hear well or very well my voice and 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.489
 especially what's going on behind the guy 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.989
 who plays the ball and so have alain the 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.700
 kids running access and the girl who 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.260
 would be raped inside the pile 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.790
 your video guys you saw in the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.140
 side housing there are two small slider 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.390
 skeptics simply urssaf 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.680
 peeps that allow you to film in 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.540
 noisy environments typically 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.540
 in concert if you want to avoid that 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.810
 your saturated blood had the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.280
 feature 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.420
 so you can change his little ones 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.209
 slider to make a way of 10 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.770
 decibels or even less - 20 decibels and 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.420
 so have a clean and clear sound 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.220
 with very noisy situations 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.739
 the output impedance during two videos 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.700
 guy is 226 and therefore not a pledge of 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.230
 quality but it's important to 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.060
 emphasize and what do I you 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.739
 ir the battery that's in it that's 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.870
 so a little spike of 9 volts you 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.370
 will have center of autonomy 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.110
 So what to do all the 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.400
 bullshit you want with and if 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.049
 you are a little green you can 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.069
 leave on a rechargeable battery that 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.060
 you are looking for it is at home 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.069
 avoid making small waste 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.260
 when it's not recycle mike video 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.610
 that the rhode video wrote me read 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.310
 is for sale at miche digital at 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.750
 price of 119 euros 90 120 euros we are going to 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.210
 make it simple and as for me I'm done 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.890
 of this test 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.450
 which show you that normally 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.470
 will see if you hear the helicopter that 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.700
 passionate helicopter passing 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.980
 normally easter is not really 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.030
 to go do not want me I do not 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.290
 longer as a video 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.820
 short enough to get the message across 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.050
 of this eloquent for the point fr and 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.050
 I tell you very quickly when 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.900
 how is it going for the assistants 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.640
 serve him well a little one a 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.810
 little fly when the guy is drunk 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.810
 that's it they would have even if voice the 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.340
 giant has ordered a helicopter williams 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.660
 with whom play the founders and 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.710
 violaine will transmit in the bonuses of 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.710
 the video then you deserve
