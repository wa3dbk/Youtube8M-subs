00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.810
 George b both come to Nethen Boll the Lia has the classic 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.610
 yes now he has to wait with the classic variant of the pool billiards 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.759
 that's probably what most of you will know 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.249
 the Wolfgang 3 3 9 has just rejected the game but 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.109
 now we will probably 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.259
 not start 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:23.909
 and Russia 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.599
 yes then we wait a little further or 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.390
 yes now play again 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.610
 Great, now we can start again so petite the recording again 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.790
 My opponent starts the game 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.960
 So the goal of the game is clearly the 7 or the 7 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.380
 sinking old balls and then also keep the eighth in one 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.749
 given black 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.289
 Hole or if the thief between technical term for as well as the 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.040
 Billiard Schlieker did not travel Chile cheaper but 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.460
 Green or whatever 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.690
 Here the Turks have the Turks so well what we want to poke now 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.660
 I have to confess I am not a prophet, of course I do not agree with players 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.270
 and around the year here online is that even more delicate but yet another 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.250
 History because the physics of these and means Billiard 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.620
 Online billiard varieties 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.900
 always works a little differently and we have actually booked something 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.250
 of course that was planned exactly the way that other claims said 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.680
 only the truth 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.200
 around 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.170
 yes I'm here somehow 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.380
 and Alonso also works for me is probably deny natural talent 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.719
 exactly so the players hold on the heathen balls the hemispheres one recognizes 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.570
 at this white dumb Dolmar 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.310
 Percent eon in opponents has to stop the trout per cent a hole and per year 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.790
 and Hari above you can see how many balls you still open 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.170
 I still have five bullets on my opponent 7 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.110
 yes MediGene but without me so far so I do not know if the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.180
 maybe not 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.600
 is so bad 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.670
 I just played to the test against which was really good where thank God 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.080
 So the black in front of it punctuate otherwise this is not just as 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.729
 lazy but the opponent I think even won and we want that 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.880
 Everyone does not hope that this happens, that would be a shame to have it 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.269
 little formal year to express 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.120
 exactly one can stop but also 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.140
 where we are at 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.870
 Of course, that was planned as well 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.999
 where we were just fouling Warren 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.649
 I have Max Gerth 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:30.129
 and can also commit fouls either if I hold my own ball where 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.879
 I think a foreign ball two but he then my opponent is just again 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.789
 And he is happy that I just logged in a ball for him 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.649
 you can also see up here instead of the 4 they exist now gives 6 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.259
 western ball 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.489
 yes exactly hole the black yes or not 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.609
 m good 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.290
 Percent is lazy but even if I just sink the white ball Danzmann 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.819
 Opponents as Toronto or just if I sank foreign ball 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.930
 or what has also read what has totally irritated me Bene 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.790
 because four balls touch the gang 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.020
 then this is also a foul then the opponent Dayton I found very much 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.020
 Fascinating Aviv does not need Horner to reconnect with Mimi 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.869
 Jara but that was it really much more you just do not need to know just that 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.650
 one holds more of his balls to a half or full 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.030
 and then you can stop the black actually poke then what 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.789
 allowed 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.459
 and then you won the game if you did it or you did it 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.489
 lost if Mans did not manage to compensate Jo and the players Â» 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.929
 let's see if that will be that was not so bad 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:35.799
 But now I dare what to do now but you have to 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.689
 No more questions clarify I take up at this point until then until 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.569
 come to skill7 point x times
