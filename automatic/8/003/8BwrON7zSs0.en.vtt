one control freaks are not compatible
with<00:01:08.780> one<00:01:09.050> another<00:01:09.080> unlike<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.860> control

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
with one another unlike the control

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.650 
with one another unlike the control
freaks<00:01:10.490> on<00:01:10.730> last<00:01:10.970> gen<00:01:13.060> now<00:01:14.060> it's<00:01:14.240> time<00:01:14.450> that<00:01:14.479> I

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
freaks on last gen now it's time that I

show you how to put them on first you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.880 
show you how to put them on first you
need<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.660> put<00:01:17.870> one<00:01:18.050> of<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.260> three<00:01:18.500> support

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
need to put one of the three support

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.500 
need to put one of the three support
points<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:19.310> followed<00:01:19.790> by<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.270> two

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
points and followed by the two

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.350 
points and followed by the two
afterwards<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.229> there<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:21.470> go<00:01:21.560> as<00:01:22.180> you<00:01:23.180> can

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
see the add a good amount of height on

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.530 
see the add a good amount of height on
both<00:01:25.190> sticks<00:01:25.550> giving<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.150> substantial

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
both sticks giving you a substantial

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.390 
both sticks giving you a substantial
boost<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.229> range<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.440> motion<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:28.070> in<00:01:28.220> turn

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
boost and range of motion and in turn

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.770 
boost and range of motion and in turn
accuracy<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:34.790> unique<00:01:35.119> swirling<00:01:35.630> vortex

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
accuracy the unique swirling vortex

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.600 
accuracy the unique swirling vortex
design<00:01:36.320> on<00:01:36.470> top<00:01:36.649> of<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.860> thumbsticks<00:01:37.280> give

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
design on top of the thumbsticks give

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.340 
design on top of the thumbsticks give
you<00:01:37.700> added<00:01:38.000> grip<00:01:38.180> as<00:01:38.360> well<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:38.930> giving<00:01:39.140> your

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
you added grip as well as giving your

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:51.020 
you added grip as well as giving your
controller<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.800> nice<00:01:40.130> look<00:01:40.369> overall

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.020 

I<00:01:52.100> really<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.280> how<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:53.549> feels<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:53.909> hand

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I really like how it feels in your hand

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.670 
I really like how it feels in your hand
and<00:01:54.360> although<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.869> might<00:01:55.049> take<00:01:55.229> some<00:01:55.409> time<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and although it might take some time to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.680 
and although it might take some time to
get<00:01:55.830> used<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.090> there<00:01:57.330> is<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> lot

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
get used to I think that there is a lot

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.660 
get used to I think that there is a lot
of<00:01:57.720> potential<00:01:58.110> here<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.830> slowly<00:01:59.070> improve<00:01:59.490> your

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
of potential here to slowly improve your

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
of potential here to slowly improve your
name<00:01:59.790> over<00:02:00.060> time<00:02:02.450> if<00:02:03.450> you've<00:02:03.659> own<00:02:03.810> control

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
name over time if you've own control

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.810 
name over time if you've own control
sheets<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> past<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:05.250> may<00:02:05.400> have<00:02:05.520> noticed

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
sheets in the past you may have noticed

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.469 
sheets in the past you may have noticed
that<00:02:05.909> there<00:02:06.119> are<00:02:06.180> too<00:02:06.299> many<00:02:06.420> things

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that there are too many things

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.570 
that there are too many things
introduced<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> vortex<00:02:07.800> being<00:02:08.429> that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
introduced with the vortex being that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.669 
introduced with the vortex being that
now<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.759> two<00:02:09.030> sticks<00:02:09.330> are<00:02:09.509> different<00:02:09.959> that

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
now the two sticks are different that

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.710 
now the two sticks are different that
there<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:10.950> also<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.250> unified<00:02:11.910> color<00:02:12.180> scheme<00:02:12.510> on

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
there is also a unified color scheme on

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.570 
there is also a unified color scheme on
both<00:02:12.959> top<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.500> bottom<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.250> control

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
both top and bottom of the control

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.990 
both top and bottom of the control
frames<00:02:15.470> again<00:02:16.470> they<00:02:16.890> look<00:02:17.069> fantastic<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.790> both

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
frames again they look fantastic on both

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.910 
frames again they look fantastic on both
controllers<00:02:18.569> especially<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.470> ps4

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
controllers especially the ps4

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.810 
controllers especially the ps4
controller<00:02:20.280> with<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.700> glowing<00:02:20.910> light<00:02:21.150> bar
