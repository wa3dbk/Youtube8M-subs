so<00:00:02.790> this<00:00:02.940> is<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.239> gym<00:00:03.780> be<00:00:03.870> Jack<00:00:04.050> harvester

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
so this is the gym be Jack harvester

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.420 
so this is the gym be Jack harvester
we're<00:00:06.359> getting<00:00:06.720> operation

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.100 

you<00:00:10.790> can<00:00:10.940> see

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
you can see

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.630 
you can see
grabs<00:00:12.740> the<00:00:12.860> tree

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.570 

download<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:16.660> cans<00:00:16.900> in<00:00:17.110> store<00:00:17.440> zips<00:00:18.100> the<00:00:18.340> treo

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
download the cans in store zips the treo

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.430 
download the cans in store zips the treo
cut-off<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:21.160> the<00:00:21.340> ground<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.930> lift<00:00:23.140> up<00:00:23.260> the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440 
cut-off of the ground then lift up the

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.960 
cut-off of the ground then lift up the
entire<00:00:23.710> tree<00:00:24.779> drag<00:00:25.779> this<00:00:25.960> back

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
entire tree drag this back

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.770 
entire tree drag this back
and<00:00:28.449> then<00:00:28.599> you<00:00:28.779> suck<00:00:29.259> the<00:00:30.160> team<00:00:30.400> through

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
and then you suck the team through

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.230 
and then you suck the team through
measures<00:00:32.560> the<00:00:32.740> length<00:00:32.920> of<00:00:33.130> each<00:00:33.250> being<00:00:33.880> sucked

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
measures the length of each being sucked

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.450 
measures the length of each being sucked
through<00:00:34.450> cut<00:00:35.290> off<00:00:35.530> a<00:00:35.560> three<00:00:35.890> metre<00:00:36.130> lengths

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
through cut off a three metre lengths

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.530 
through cut off a three metre lengths
back<00:00:37.420> so<00:00:37.690> three<00:00:37.990> meter<00:00:38.200> length<00:00:38.470> up<00:00:39.390> leaves<00:00:40.390> the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
back so three meter length up leaves the

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.330 
back so three meter length up leaves the
branches<00:00:41.050> for<00:00:41.320> another<00:00:41.530> machine<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:42.010> come<00:00:42.160> by

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
branches for another machine to come by

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.640 
branches for another machine to come by
and<00:00:42.370> pick<00:00:42.670> up<00:00:42.820> and<00:00:43.030> burn<00:00:43.210> and<00:00:44.050> then<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.320> goes<00:00:44.440> up

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
and pick up and burn and then it goes up

00:00:44.650 --> 00:01:10.560 
and pick up and burn and then it goes up
to<00:00:44.800> do<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.040> next

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.600 

so<00:01:11.170> quick<00:01:11.440> unbelievable
