00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
interact with in this world and then

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
interact with in this world and then
that<00:01:35.159> weapon<00:01:35.579> will<00:01:35.759> disappear<00:01:36.360> well<00:01:36.659> yeah

destroyed<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.210> pretty<00:01:39.420> much<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.869> for

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
destroyed and that's pretty much it for

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.450 
destroyed and that's pretty much it for
my<00:01:40.140> two<00:01:40.200> cents<00:01:40.710> about<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> game<00:01:41.220> nothing

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
my two cents about the game nothing

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.280 
my two cents about the game nothing
really<00:01:41.759> exciting<00:01:42.180> nothing<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.049> you

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
really exciting nothing really that you

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990 
really exciting nothing really that you
haven't<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:44.070> done<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.460> experienced

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
haven't really done or experienced

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.840 
haven't really done or experienced
before<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.570> all<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.490> thing<00:01:47.670> that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
before it's all here the one thing that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.639 
before it's all here the one thing that
I<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.360> done<00:01:48.659> before<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.200> obviously<00:01:49.530> I've

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
I have not done before is obviously I've

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.410 
I have not done before is obviously I've
not<00:01:49.829> played<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.159> first<00:01:50.340> two<00:01:50.549> out<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.210> these

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
not played the first two out of these

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.690 
not played the first two out of these
games<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:52.049> seeing<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.710> many<00:01:52.950> zombies<00:01:53.490> on

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
games but seeing that many zombies on

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.330 
games but seeing that many zombies on
the<00:01:53.729> roads<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.860> everyone<00:01:55.860> else<00:01:56.040> where<00:01:56.250> you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
the roads and on everyone else where you

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.039 
the roads and on everyone else where you
look<00:01:56.490> around<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.939> hundreds<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.659> hundreds

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
look around this hundreds and hundreds

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.410 
look around this hundreds and hundreds
of<00:01:58.140> zombies<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.770> grouped<00:01:59.100> around<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.850> I

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
of zombies just grouped around and I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
of zombies just grouped around and I
think<00:02:00.689> caught<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> friend<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
think caught with a friend you get to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.560 
think caught with a friend you get to
have<00:02:02.310> quite<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> bit<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.030> fun<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.240> that

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
have quite a bit of fun with that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.969 
have quite a bit of fun with that
because<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.049> get<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.320> craft<00:02:04.530> some<00:02:04.770> sort<00:02:04.950> of

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
because you get to craft some sort of

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.419 
because you get to craft some sort of
explosives<00:02:05.610> maybe<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.600> timed<00:02:07.429> explosion

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
explosives maybe have a timed explosion

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.949 
explosives maybe have a timed explosion
or<00:02:08.550> something<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.090> taking<00:02:09.420> out<00:02:09.539> two<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:09.899> three

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
or something and taking out two or three

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.410 
or something and taking out two or three
five<00:02:10.410> hundred<00:02:10.800> zombie<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.220> same<00:02:11.459> time<00:02:11.730> I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
five hundred zombie the same time I

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.660 
five hundred zombie the same time I
that<00:02:12.599> would<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.990> pretty<00:02:13.260> pretty<00:02:13.650> cool<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.580> I'm

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
that would be pretty pretty cool so I'm

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.729 
that would be pretty pretty cool so I'm
trying<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.180> get<00:02:15.330> Alexandra<00:02:16.020> here<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.349> get<00:02:16.500> into

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
trying to get Alexandra here to get into

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.229 
trying to get Alexandra here to get into
the<00:02:16.830> car<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.040> think<00:02:17.430> things<00:02:17.700> she's<00:02:17.880> gonna<00:02:18.000> get

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
the car I think things she's gonna get

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.120 
the car I think things she's gonna get
in<00:02:18.420> because<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:18.989> well<00:02:19.410> technically<00:02:19.950> there's

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
in because it's well technically there's

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.580 
in because it's well technically there's
room<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.550> back<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.360> think<00:02:22.290> she's<00:02:22.470> just

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
room in the back but I think she's just

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.320 
room in the back but I think she's just
pissed<00:02:22.890> off<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.160> she<00:02:23.430> didn't<00:02:23.849> ride<00:02:24.030> shotgun

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
pissed off that she didn't ride shotgun

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.850 
pissed off that she didn't ride shotgun
I<00:02:24.780> think<00:02:24.989> she<00:02:25.080> wanted<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.440> ride<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.830> front

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
I think she wanted to ride in the front

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.220 
I think she wanted to ride in the front
and<00:02:26.400> Diego<00:02:27.060> kind<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.569> hopped<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:28.020> there
