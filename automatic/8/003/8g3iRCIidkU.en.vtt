00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 welcome ladies gentlemen to a brand new 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.370
 delivery of oil with straight this 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.799
 time we are going to fight three roller coasters 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.260
 against injustice and evil and 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.870
 today we are going to the first roller coaster 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.540
 and I have to tell you they are three 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 incredibly nice it or roller coasters so it 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.500
 becomes a difficult choice for you 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.720
 ultimately choose the winner from 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.380
 those three and we are immediately in the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.119
 roller coaster 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.199
 and we leave and right away from it 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:33.570
 station 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:37.020
 oh dear oh wow this is fat this is so fat 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.219
 and we go straight to it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.920
 above all, there was also fat music in it 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.510
 all getuind is it is still a 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.510
 kind of darkride when i look like that 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.650
 and we get the first on it and according to 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.650
 for me it is a spinning coaster 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.160
 exciting music also a flash board and 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.580
 a mainstage nationwide there 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.580
 exciting 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.479
 oh look at those black walls 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:17.420
 he is such a fat you happen there oh 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.950
 all cars look well we go we the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.090
 Second to be tabled up hopefully 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.310
 we go that wall harder than the first 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.030
 time I think so 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.030
 after just as exciting of course 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.290
 and then we will get another drop and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.940
 we are a little speedy 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.420
 I'm curious when our side you go 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.420
 spin around 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.320
 look at a few turns oh 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.479
 bed 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.520
 well done in this steal coast building 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.900
 made 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.730
 well it looks from the outside 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.620
 nature that looks so pretty but it 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.920
 is of course purely about the inside and 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.020
 which has done great in small 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.130
 how this has made their way but 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.800
 that's not what it's about 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.210
 in the end and it did me nice 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.220
 think it's great that your search thing 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.570
 can make it I found the beginning very much 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.060
 surprisingly I liked this 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.070
 I really loved how you get past that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.900
 Thematization went here 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.820
 yes that corner and cool this was also 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.930
 nice scene we are going to the next 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.160
 roller coaster 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.170
 the next roller coaster is the revenge god 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.959
 know that well I'm the namely we the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.030
 phantom revanche is the next roller coaster 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.050
 which we are going to fight and I think there is 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.030
 talking about the good and the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.010
 evil that this is quite a lot in terms of 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.630
 roller coaster is a bit that dark 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.030
 feelings that I get when I do 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.570
 see that photo and that sunlight just had 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.550
 dory 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.280
 well let me go we go we go him 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.320
 free and we are in the roller coaster and 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.030
 he is very nicely themed what i am 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.290
 I just saw when I looked behind me 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.060
 also notice the image what a 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.580
 little leak but we go to maybe 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.080
 I will come soon and it will fall in the dark 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.720
 which makes it very light 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.830
 I think he has done very well so far 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.480
 ok we have the first go upstairs 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.400
 so it is again such 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.350
 spinning coaster just like before 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.450
 And that makes it have fat viewers 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.519
 your company also runs very smoothly 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.320
 around actually maybe i'm not fat 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.700
 enough that we are not going to run too fast 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.100
 but it could also be that he just 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.930
 wonderfully smoothly made this roller coaster 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.630
 I also have very little noise in this 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.030
 roller coaster so well that should go with it 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.030
 do it but you can fall this roller coaster 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.799
 anyway not for noise and well we 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.390
 go nice rounds so a unique de 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.610
 long roller coaster has a very large one 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.530
 layout well actually a longer you 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.780
 actually standing and almost still and that is 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.120
 just very cool something that you naturally 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.430
 the bin it also exciting and get here 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.170
 we kinda feel like that 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.760
 we actually is so want the mouse roller coaster 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.160
 that he always go round 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.930
 which means you but he has that 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.150
 is not repeated too often so 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.320
 really just making circles and that 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.360
 makes it fat because he has whole 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.120
 sharp bends in it made faith 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.480
 especially and that the end how this is anyway 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.580
 oh shit yo that's really cool this 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.700
 we are just going to the ground he is whole 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.379
 wild but is really super dig this one 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.940
 roller coaster wow 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.830
 well a very difference with the 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.780
 first roller coaster that we did ourselves 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.780
 roller coaster type but also very beautiful 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.129
 them thematic especially outside and then 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.720
 as you can see it just looks whole 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.160
 very super good I go there for a moment 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.019
 fly over it 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.299
 look hear what seems the same 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.220
 makers so have an entrance what amusing 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.449
 well and this is the they finish when he is 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.210
 so they free 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.789
 yes crab put together but really whole 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.740
 I think I am very cool and maybe 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.300
 a salaets roller coaster not a beautiful one 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.070
 themed roller coaster 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.479
 he is just very bold in terms of layout it 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.669
 namely theirs 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.990
 flight or the eagle I have to be fine 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.120
 say natural 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.800
 flan on the entrance in dutch 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.280
 of course the flight translates 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.479
 The eagle also sounds very bold and 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.550
 also takes a lot to load 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.500
 but that doesn't matter we're in one now 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.970
 very different coaster than we just did 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.710
 have seen in the dark and too 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.389
 inside the dark rider they we actually 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.940
 also a roller coaster that is just nice 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.190
 during the day and we go over the water 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.680
 very fluent we are at the 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.389
 side and I think we will too soon 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.260
 that those carts sit loose what 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.080
 I'm not sure 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.220
 well we got up high and raised 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.289
 I'm also going through a tree one 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.490
 well a bit i might have 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.039
 what tactical my wonders in my 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.000
 face or in my mouth nature 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.669
 the can too 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.900
 and so we go up very cool with 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.130
 Support done took 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.229
 very long before there was support 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.210
 face in the loading screen before we get the 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.650
 roller coaster opened and he also hit 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.900
 my computer was three times or so okay 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.970
 thank you why or the game ran on that 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.180
 and we are going to drop the first one whole 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.820
 great out like a eagle 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.539
 dive into the with this roller coaster 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.240
 Here we go 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:46.150
 and you can also go really fast 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:48.220
 slowly turned upside down and arrived 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.990
 have a very sharp turn very 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.699
 very moat about the layout I am making 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:58.349
 very big turns and a very big one 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.349
 looping because that is what we are going to do now 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.199
 wow we that effect 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.509
 fantastic done like a bird too 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.190
 what a power has gone over the head 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.289
 this job looks so high up 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.449
 have compared with the highest point 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.909
 We have quite the momentum on this 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.719
 moment almost come to the ground 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:18.639
 half looping and then arrive at 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.930
 maybe the end you think so 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.580
 I don't think it's for my country 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.590
 shared very much whether a brake is a brake 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.810
 part and they still go very steep 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.520
 downstairs so that we can still get the father in 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.440
 for their last 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.789
 over the head experience and the kitchen 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.099
 trigger 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:36.430
 we go the so over we come to again 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.690
 the water is right and I think we are 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.740
 little come to the end because this one 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.330
 roller coaster but I liked it 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.400
 fantastically beautiful and that's it 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.690
 nice that we said some form of delivery 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.909
 I like the three 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.759
 get spicy hardcore jobs and that is 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:50.169
 now actually become that way 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.849
 it's a shame he hasn't put anything here yet 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.620
 of bushes or small trees 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:55.569
 but that might also be it again 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.699
 view a bit obstructing I think 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.300
 so maybe you are aware of that 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.370
 chosen 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.409
 well it looks like a very nice roller coaster 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.139
 nice support done very bold 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:08.680
 I think it's a very very high rating 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:10.389
 but if I had to choose then yes then would 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.250
 I go for this and why I am 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.690
 totally crazy about darkrides i love 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.779
 the second roller coaster 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.580
 but I find this very beautiful in it 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:19.900
 put together and he is real 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.789
 fantastic 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.000
 designed invention so I like this one 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:26.560
 roller coaster goes to a great deal 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.930
 subscribe follow because it became comments 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.430
 which labor law found and until the next 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.020
 times with a new no limits 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.020
 thanks for your feedback through dry
