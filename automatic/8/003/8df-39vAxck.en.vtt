00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:10.130
 hello my name is oksana i live with 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:16.199
 daughter and fandom wedding 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:19.380
 we have a cat about something unimportant working 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.970
 in a large company supervisor for 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.220
 submissions more than 10 people 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.930
 I lead my link at all in our 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.969
 water in principle 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.760
 good quality but time is coming 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:39.210
 somehow change our attitudes towards everything and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.540
 including our diet is aqua di 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.489
 first of all because all the same 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.000
 what is in the water is all laid 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.550
 our store so we had some 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.670
 health problems or acute 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.260
 chondrosis and problems were with the skin therefore 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.640
 we came to this conclusion that you 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.620
 still needed to get 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.750
 the most interesting thing my filter can do 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.420
 simple but after a while she 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.820
 I received a call from firms killed the filter and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.360
 the young man suggested we try on 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.840
 the frequency of our water in principle was not 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.330
 vs 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.830
 because they themselves were interested 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.320
 invited him 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.710
 and the whole evening we talked to him 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.500
 topic he directed our samples and our water 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.140
 These are the conclusions that were cleaned through 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.950
 filter the water that came from the screen 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.270
 simple was terribly polluted water 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.820
 which came from the filter was of course 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.200
 pure evil in this filter is a minus a 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.670
 the water was not mineralized just 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.470
 dead there was one planet 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.940
 present on one side 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.280
 give here is cleaned completely with 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.730
 the second side the water goes not dead with 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.430
 some other elements that salt 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.620
 really needed for the body 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.110
 information on interested and you know 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.830
 my thinking just decided to replace our 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.650
 filter on the filter blue filter we have it 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.810
 It is already almost a year worth 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.510
 happy takes up little space but up 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.490
 so far the water goes and i think that no 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.040
 problems from because the kettle is absolutely 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.770
 clean from the inside no caps and nothing 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.340
 there is no this one here is all the dirt that is there 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.340
 may be 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.709
 that is, it is very bad for an iron but so 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.650
 how do i have a water filter 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.870
 I fill the wasp quite calmly cleaned 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.970
 water is no longer now and no 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.760
 therefore there is no dirt left in my iron 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.100
 I can safely use 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.830
 they poured water out of there with an iron 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.470
 we use everywhere where only it is possible to 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.050
 clean i mean i mean by food 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.130
 that is, tea and coffee has a completely 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:48.840
 different taste feel taste of the drink 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.459
 there is then a gift attached two 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.390
 filter one for shower another for 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.690
 washing machine 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.580
 Well, we could not install yet 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.890
 now we will change the cartridges and very 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.130
 I would still try to 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.130
 The action of these filters is harm very well 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.640
 I love to chat with creation and taste 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.250
 so natural 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.050
 especially black currant is very tasty 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.700
 no need to boil water right 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.060
 pour it straight with extremely to and very 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.060
 yummy
