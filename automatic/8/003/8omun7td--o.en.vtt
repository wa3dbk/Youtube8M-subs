00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 they come all his friends it's for 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.210
 a crazy crazy video and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.150
 today I will explain 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.220
 how to make a success of your rodeo what 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.869
 could be very practical so everything 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.070
 first we will start with the class at 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.480
 perform so we in main you 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.800
 take what you want a number of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.090
 points that I advise you the first 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.680
 it's the best simply 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.000
 she has a lot of bullets and attracts very 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.650
 quickly so to finish the summer so much 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.360
 she is really very practical in 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.460
 tactical abilities you are forced to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.930
 take the camouflage this skill 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.969
 must allow you to reach the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.780
 titans without these you voice and 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.149
 jump on them 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.950
 quietly then you take the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.329
 bow grenade finally if you want it's 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.010
 this one that made it possible to do the most 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.600
 of damage to the machines then I you 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.129
 absolutely recommend the stealth kit because 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.719
 we do not see you dragging and you do not 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.460
 makes no noise when you ride 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.750
 on a little time so that can you 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.579
 save time and that's really 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.120
 so a very practical skill at 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.680
 Level 2 kit level you take the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.570
 advanced processor that allows your 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.890
 titans to do a lot more damage 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.479
 in duels 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.850
 if ever you are not on it and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.510
 it's the only skill and the only one that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.530
 is really practical 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.170
 we find immediately on a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.369
 gameplay or there I no longer had the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.409
 tactical skill of the coup I'm going 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.509
 like that the enemy lets go of your cloud of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.159
 smoke of the blow I retreat quickly not to 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.180
 die because this cloud of smoke tutu 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.189
 extremely fast 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.810
 I activate my tactical skill that does not 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.939
 I do not know where I am I jump on him 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.920
 I will try to open the mail module 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.200
 to this one goes out of his little time to 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.939
 kill me so I jump quickly for 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.280
 surprise the enemy hoist does not activate his 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.409
 skill but dies very quickly I 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.009
 so jump on the titan to finish it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.439
 quietly 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.600
 then in so you have to know that the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.920
 titans self finally the other titans so 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.729
 those who are not controlled by 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.710
 players are very very weak against the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.520
 rodeo because these can not do anything 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.250
 to do if they do not have the skill 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 cloud of smoke so what you need 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.759
 to do it's just to shoot it takes 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.740
 just make sure that he does not have 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.020
 deigned around who would risk you 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.659
 kill and eject you quietly and 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.340
 nothing more to do 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.920
 Then you have to know that during your 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.280
 rodeo avoid the ogres that are full 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.520
 life 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.319
 simply because you are going 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.120
 very finally the ogres 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.950
 you finally kill the other enemies of 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.450
 blow will kill very easy because 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.670
 you take time there for example I 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.599
 had a very very fast strider is at 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.969
 rodeo level 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.909
 he has very little life so you'll be there 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.549
 go really fast anyway 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.769
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.049
 I'll do other little tutorials on 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.159
 on tyson fall is in any case I hope 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.689
 that you're going to have a good time 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.670
 rodeo because it breaks me 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.180
 completely go to more people this 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.180
 enemy of 7 hours
