00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 himself and now the fault 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.360
 good to us very high quality and eyes 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.099
 I didnâ€™t believe our craft that the craft team 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.920
 turned and threatened the champion essentially 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.650
 on equal terms and second half of the moment were 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.949
 nobody was afraid your comment why 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.659
 then all the same class is class 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.409
 skill said strength wings tired you 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:32.640
 right, I think we were tired after all 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.500
 there were zones for cisco for such 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.200
 cool team like cisco when 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.780
 free space appears they 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.600
 can implement it and can implement 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.570
 moments can embody a new fact that they 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:53.370
 did so probably we got up that 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.280
 logically 60 minutes so 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.100
 Today such a correct question probably 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.760
 that sanji king though won 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.920
 played out 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.589
 maybe even worse than today 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.210
 I feel better T-shirt that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.240
 on the quality of how the franc set up 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.550
 still vice champ after henk 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.320
 Dzerzhinsk hard probably well we knew and 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.390
 against whom will we go play against 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.000
 cska therefore especially us not 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.039
 needed we played with them for the cup 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.350
 played a friendly game we knew how 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:32.880
 they will act 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.009
 knew their maneuvers but even if you know not 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.050
 sure that you do something for him 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.110
 naturally tired 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.560
 and makes mistakes where you do not reach 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.350
 shura because of fatigue therefore appear 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.460
 some moments about school 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.650
 I even want to be badly enough today well I 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.460
 want the team not enough but we have them 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.320
 replaced so everything is fine and on 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.009
 atmosphere you feel the difference between 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.630
 the fact that it was in the final on metallurgy 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.430
 today's match certainly felt 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.990
 very nice to play with this 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.600
 the number of viewers is much more 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.880
 was we feel support and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.360
 we want every match to be like this 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.360
 filled up
