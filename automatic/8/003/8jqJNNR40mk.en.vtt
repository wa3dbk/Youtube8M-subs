sandcastle
structures<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.690> feel<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.109> would<00:01:01.199> be

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
structures I feel like this would be

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.490 
structures I feel like this would be
really<00:01:01.379> good<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.719> PvP<00:01:03.719> server<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.229> PvE

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
really good on like a PvP server or PvE

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
really good on like a PvP server or PvE
cuz<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.280> sand<00:01:05.549> castle<00:01:05.970> Wars

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
cuz you can have like sand castle Wars

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.719 
cuz you can have like sand castle Wars
and<00:01:06.510> throw<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.470> snowballs<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.340> each<00:01:08.369> other<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and throw like snowballs at each other I

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.700 
and throw like snowballs at each other I
think<00:01:08.880> it'd<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.060> pretty<00:01:09.210> cool<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:10.590> gonna

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
think it'd be pretty cool but I'm gonna

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.609 
think it'd be pretty cool but I'm gonna
start<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.250> salt<00:01:11.760> or<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.290> mine<00:01:13.470> this

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
start with salt or so you can mine this

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
start with salt or so you can mine this
and<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> mind<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> wooden<00:01:14.700> pickaxe<00:01:14.939> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and you mind it with a wooden pickaxe I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.859 
and you mind it with a wooden pickaxe I
believe<00:01:16.340> or<00:01:17.340> maybe<00:01:17.729> stone<00:01:18.060> pickaxe<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
believe or maybe stone pickaxe and it

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:27.340 
believe or maybe stone pickaxe and it
gets<00:01:19.340> salt<00:01:21.080> salt<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.130> there's

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
gets salt salt and then there's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.450 
gets salt salt and then there's
seashells<00:01:28.350> which<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.130> never<00:01:29.189> pronounce

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
seashells which I can never pronounce

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.230

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
but there's she shells and those spawned

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.450 
but there's she shells and those spawned
they<00:01:34.049> spawn<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.350> everywhere<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.340> can

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
that so green one pink one what it's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.490 
that so green one pink one what it's
white<00:01:44.570> blue<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.020> red

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
white blue and red

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
white blue and red
and<00:01:46.939> which<00:01:47.939> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.240> weird<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:48.869> full

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and which kind of weird is there full

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.810 
and which kind of weird is there full
block<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.009> kind<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.399> stand<00:01:50.700> on

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
block so you can kind of like stand on

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.630 
block so you can kind of like stand on
top<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.180> them<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.659> mean<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.290> think<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:53.189> mod<00:01:53.460> is

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
top of them I mean I think this mod is

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.969 
top of them I mean I think this mod is
it<00:01:53.909> says<00:01:54.180> 100%<00:01:54.630> complete<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
it says 100% complete but the the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.469 
it says 100% complete but the the
Creator<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.670> adding<00:01:57.060> little<00:01:57.210> things

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
Creator is like adding little things

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.700 
Creator is like adding little things
here<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:57.930> that'll<00:01:58.200> probably<00:01:58.320> make<00:01:58.590> it

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
here and there that'll probably make it

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.109 
here and there that'll probably make it
better<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.130> there's<00:01:59.640> gonna<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
better and there's gonna be like a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.459 
better and there's gonna be like a
smoothie<00:02:00.659> update<00:02:01.020> where<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.350> do

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
smoothie update where you can do

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.780 
smoothie update where you can do
something<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:01.770> berries<00:02:02.340> which<00:02:02.490> i<00:02:02.579> think<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
something with berries which i think is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.880 
something with berries which i think is
gonna<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.000> pretty<00:02:03.210> cool<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:04.320> maybe<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.770> its

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
gonna be pretty cool so maybe in its

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.410 
gonna be pretty cool so maybe in its
further<00:02:05.159> release<00:02:05.430> we'll<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.700> another<00:02:05.939> one<00:02:06.210> but

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
further release we'll do another one but

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.320 
further release we'll do another one but
for<00:02:06.719> now<00:02:06.840> these<00:02:07.590> are<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.670> what<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
for now these are this is what it is and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.700 
for now these are this is what it is and
it's<00:02:09.420> just

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
it's just

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.530 
it's just
like<00:02:09.890> blocky<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.790> can<00:02:10.940> jump<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.270> top<00:02:11.480> of

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
like blocky so you can jump on top of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.930 
like blocky so you can jump on top of
these<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.830> don't<00:02:13.100> know<00:02:13.160> it's<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.670> little<00:02:13.850> bit

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
these and I don't know it's a little bit

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.050 
these and I don't know it's a little bit
weird<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:15.140> still<00:02:15.470> works<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.950> think<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.970> just

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
weird but it still works I think it just

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.570 
weird but it still works I think it just
adds<00:02:17.240> like<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.450> nice<00:02:17.630> aesthetic<00:02:18.440> appeal<00:02:18.890> to

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
adds like a nice aesthetic appeal to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.540 
adds like a nice aesthetic appeal to
your<00:02:19.820> world<00:02:20.090> or<00:02:20.270> whatever<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.070> next<00:02:22.370> part

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550

going to show you the this is a little

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.070 
going to show you the this is a little
sand<00:02:34.100> pyramid<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.210> a<00:02:35.240> cube<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.780> also

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
sand pyramid this is a cube this is also

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.190 
sand pyramid this is a cube this is also
full<00:02:36.320> block<00:02:36.560> these<00:02:37.130> are<00:02:37.340> also<00:02:37.460> full<00:02:37.880> blocks

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
full block these are also full blocks

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.270 
full block these are also full blocks
this<00:02:39.200> one<00:02:39.410> doesn't<00:02:39.650> even<00:02:39.710> count<00:02:39.980> as<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.130> full

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
this one doesn't even count as a full

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.310 
this one doesn't even count as a full
block<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:40.850> it's<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.690> little<00:02:41.900> weird<00:02:42.050> with<00:02:42.170> how

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
block so it's a little weird with how

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.090 
block so it's a little weird with how
the<00:02:42.380> blocking<00:02:42.860> is<00:02:42.980> made<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.330> window<00:02:45.230> it

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
the blocking is made this is a window it

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.290 
the blocking is made this is a window it
has<00:02:46.160> like<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> little<00:02:46.640> window<00:02:46.850> which<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.120> use

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
has like a little window which I use

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.500 
has like a little window which I use
right<00:02:47.570> here<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.460> a<00:02:49.490> sand<00:02:49.850> wall<00:02:50.150> which

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
right here this is a sand wall which

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.820 
right here this is a sand wall which
I've<00:02:50.660> used<00:02:50.900> all<00:02:51.110> over<00:02:51.440> here<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:53.570> this<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.680> a

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
I've used all over here the this is a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.610 
I've used all over here the this is a
old<00:02:55.310> set<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:56.000> cylinder<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:57.170> sand<00:02:57.440> with

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
old set it's a cylinder of sand with

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.340 
old set it's a cylinder of sand with
full<00:02:57.860> wall<00:02:58.100> okay<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.210> it's<00:02:59.420> like<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.570> full<00:02:59.900> but<00:03:00.320> I

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
full wall okay so it's like a full but I

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.260 
full wall okay so it's like a full but I
use<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.890> regular<00:03:00.950> cylinders<00:03:01.670> here<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.090> see

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
use just regular cylinders here and see

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.510 
use just regular cylinders here and see
you<00:03:02.420> can<00:03:02.480> see<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.810> little<00:03:03.020> disconnect<00:03:03.560> and

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
you can see the little disconnect and

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.100 
you can see the little disconnect and
then<00:03:04.640> these<00:03:04.760> are<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:05.000> spheres<00:03:05.600> which<00:03:05.900> are

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
then these are the spheres which are

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.860 
then these are the spheres which are
right<00:03:06.620> here<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:08.390> obviously<00:03:08.660> there's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
right here and obviously there's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.970 
right here and obviously there's
different<00:03:08.900> types<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.350> cylinders<00:03:09.740> and<00:03:09.890> the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
different types of cylinders and the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.560 
different types of cylinders and the
spheres<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.370> can<00:03:10.610> just<00:03:10.790> place<00:03:11.150> around<00:03:11.420> like

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
spheres you can just place around like

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.540 
spheres you can just place around like
little<00:03:11.810> slant<00:03:12.020> Spears<00:03:12.370> there's<00:03:13.370> also

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
little slant Spears there's also

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.010 
little slant Spears there's also
something<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:14.150> think<00:03:14.300> this<00:03:14.570> is<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.720> little<00:03:14.780> weird

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
something I think this is a little weird

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.050 
something I think this is a little weird
oh<00:03:15.140> it's<00:03:15.350> like<00:03:15.500> full<00:03:16.370> block<00:03:16.610> than<00:03:16.820> half<00:03:17.000> a

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
oh it's like full block than half a

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.670 
oh it's like full block than half a
block<00:03:17.210> half<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.480> block<00:03:17.720> than<00:03:17.960> full<00:03:18.170> block<00:03:18.410> I

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
block half a block than full block I
