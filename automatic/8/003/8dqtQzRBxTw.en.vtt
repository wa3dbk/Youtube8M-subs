not<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.340> thick<00:01:59.729> straps<00:02:00.119> which<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
not like really thick straps which I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.600 
not like really thick straps which I
really<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.960> how<00:02:01.380> much<00:02:01.500> sports<00:02:01.770> bra<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> got<00:02:02.189> is

really like how much sports bra I got is
the<00:02:03.090> same<00:02:03.540> kind<00:02:04.159> except<00:02:05.159> it

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
the same kind except it

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.180 
the same kind except it
just<00:02:06.460> black<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.150> pink<00:02:07.869> on<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.530> side<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:08.860> I

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
just black and pink on this side and I

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.070 
just black and pink on this side and I
like<00:02:09.369> how<00:02:09.520> it's<00:02:09.670> like<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.850> reversible<00:02:10.569> I'm

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
like how it's like a reversible I'm

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.320 
like how it's like a reversible I'm
pretty<00:02:11.319> sure<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.560> has<00:02:11.740> like<00:02:11.980> yeah<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.150> could

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
pretty sure it has like yeah you could

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.490 
pretty sure it has like yeah you could
reverse<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:14.319> quinine<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.260> that

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
reverse it the quinine and it's of that

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.610 
reverse it the quinine and it's of that
that<00:02:18.510> i'm<00:02:19.510> pretty<00:02:19.720> sure<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:19.989> reversible<00:02:20.380> but

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
that i'm pretty sure it's reversible but

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.440 
that i'm pretty sure it's reversible but
i<00:02:20.770> think<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:20.950> just<00:02:21.040> cut<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.640> but<00:02:22.180> yeah<00:02:22.300> this

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
i think you just cut that but yeah this

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.780 
i think you just cut that but yeah this
is<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.660> really<00:02:23.230> pretty<00:02:23.560> sports<00:02:24.100> bra<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.610> will

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
is a really pretty sports bra and I will

is a really pretty sports bra and I will
wear<00:02:24.940> all<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.390> time<00:02:25.890> cuz<00:02:26.890> for<00:02:27.040> soccer<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.520> have

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670

but it didn't just got this it's another
word<00:02:35.110> yes<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.530> reversible<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.400> salt<00:02:36.819> it<00:02:37.060> looks

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
word yes a reversible to salt it looks

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.059 
word yes a reversible to salt it looks
like<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.870> have<00:02:37.900> more<00:02:38.140> sport<00:02:38.500> bras<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.010> you

like you have more sport bras and you

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.970 
like you have more sport bras and you
actually<00:02:39.280> do<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.910> good<00:02:40.600> trick<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:41.830> is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
actually do so good trick so this is

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.160 
actually do so good trick so this is
just<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.459> purple<00:02:42.970> one<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:43.420> kind<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.720> like<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
just a purple one it's kind of like the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.229 
just a purple one it's kind of like the
when<00:02:44.709> I<00:02:44.739> see<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> bridge<00:02:45.220> like<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.850> can't

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
when I see a bridge like this I can't

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.600 
when I see a bridge like this I can't
really<00:02:46.330> describe<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.140> it's<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:48.100> reminds<00:02:48.459> me<00:02:48.489> of

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
like being like friend like environment

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.000 
like being like friend like environment
free<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.720> friendlies<00:02:53.350> oh<00:02:53.560> i<00:02:53.830> don't<00:02:53.890> know

free like friendlies oh i don't know
like<00:02:54.310> very<00:02:54.760> like<00:02:54.850> made<00:02:55.420> from<00:02:55.660> natural

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
like very like made from natural

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.900 
like very like made from natural
materials<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:57.010> just<00:02:57.250> reminds<00:02:57.610> me<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.760> that

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
materials it just reminds me of that

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.470 
materials it just reminds me of that
it's<00:02:58.299> just<00:02:58.600> reverses<00:02:59.049> to<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.319> solid<00:03:00.480> British

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
it's just reverses to a solid British

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.850 
it's just reverses to a solid British
purple<00:03:02.350> and<00:03:03.180> then<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.360> just<00:03:04.420> got<00:03:04.840> stale<00:03:05.530> exact

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
purple and then I just got stale exact

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.160 
purple and then I just got stale exact
want<00:03:06.130> except<00:03:06.519> in<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.760> bigger<00:03:06.970> size<00:03:07.209> just

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
want except in a bigger size just

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.259 
want except in a bigger size just
because<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.890> don't<00:03:09.370> know<00:03:09.549> how<00:03:09.819> that<00:03:09.850> one's

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
because I don't know how that one's

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.060 
because I don't know how that one's
going<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.600> fit<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.140> I'm<00:03:11.290> going<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.560> return<00:03:12.010> it

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
going to fit so I'm going to return it

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.699 
going to fit so I'm going to return it
if<00:03:12.370> not<00:03:13.269> ok<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.870> first<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.440> all<00:03:14.560> they're

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
if not ok the first of all they're

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.229 
if not ok the first of all they're
really<00:03:14.739> lacking<00:03:15.250> because<00:03:15.640> they're<00:03:15.970> putting

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
really lacking because they're putting

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.360 
really lacking because they're putting
the<00:03:16.299> tag<00:03:16.480> like<00:03:17.079> that<00:03:17.290> does<00:03:17.470> not<00:03:17.920> make<00:03:18.190> it

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
the tag like that does not make it

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.699 
the tag like that does not make it
reversible<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.049> guess<00:03:20.290> I'm<00:03:20.440> just<00:03:20.560> gonna

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
reversible so I guess I'm just gonna

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.560 
reversible so I guess I'm just gonna
wear<00:03:20.950> my<00:03:21.130> wife<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.549> don't<00:03:21.700> know<00:03:21.790> but<00:03:21.970> yeah<00:03:22.209> this

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
wear my wife I don't know but yeah this

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.360 
wear my wife I don't know but yeah this
is<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.780> medium<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.380> others<00:03:23.709> an<00:03:23.859> extra<00:03:24.130> small

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
is a medium in the others an extra small

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.280 
is a medium in the others an extra small
but<00:03:24.579> textured<00:03:25.299> models<00:03:25.630> were<00:03:25.750> really<00:03:26.019> small

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
but textured models were really small

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.710 
but textured models were really small
and<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.680> smell<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:26.950> tooth<00:03:27.340> like<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:28.000> don't<00:03:28.540> know

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
and the smell of tooth like I don't know

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.080 
and the smell of tooth like I don't know
so<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.200> got<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.890> might<00:03:30.100> just<00:03:30.130> keep<00:03:30.549> both<00:03:30.820> in

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
so I got this I might just keep both in

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.039 
so I got this I might just keep both in
like<00:03:31.650> just<00:03:32.650> as<00:03:32.859> an<00:03:32.980> extra<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.700> didn't<00:03:34.630> just<00:03:34.840> got

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
like just as an extra I didn't just got

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.819 
like just as an extra I didn't just got
this<00:03:35.459> white<00:03:36.459> that's<00:03:37.269> more<00:03:37.750> like<00:03:37.810> it's<00:03:38.709> a

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
this white that's more like it's a

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.410 
this white that's more like it's a
thicker<00:03:39.040> material<00:03:39.670> out<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:39.790> how<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.060> explain

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
thicker material out of how to explain

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.620 
thicker material out of how to explain
it<00:03:40.480> it's<00:03:40.840> duo<00:03:41.380> dry<00:03:41.799> max<00:03:42.209> seamless<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.450> it

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
it it's duo dry max seamless and it

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.349 
it it's duo dry max seamless and it
reduces<00:03:43.780> chafing<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.850> don't<00:03:46.000> have<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.150> use<00:03:46.329> a

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
reduces chafing so I don't have to use a
