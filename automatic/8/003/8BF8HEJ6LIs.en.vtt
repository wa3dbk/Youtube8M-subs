00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.110
 he's coming hi to all friends how 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.820
 carve you I hope to go very very 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.119
 well then today we end up 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.850
 for a new little video about fermi 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.779
 this 2013 engine then a new small 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.930
 fashion test 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.609
 so it's scania trucks 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.710
 so I know more exactly their 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.550
 success where I can you will do those 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.719
 from scania his 620 reviews to rollers so 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.149
 the costs of 320 thousand euros 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.610
 the maintenance of 1 euro per day so 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.719
 it's really cheap and it does not put 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.700
 tribute that puts a little bit of 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.719
 commission is all that but hey it's 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.480
 not too serious 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.250
 so here is also a small 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.030
 novelty from now on from you 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.260
 have to hear some music so 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.289
 now to all the videos or has 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.770
 almost everything won I will put on a 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.770
 music background 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.880
 do not worry about the funds 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.810
 for for the copyrights that that for 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.439
 copyright is weird because 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.790
 that I'm not going to stop arranging so 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.320
 like that could put more music 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.850
 without any problem for that because 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.390
 mature baptist found me some 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.009
 nice thing and we see it so 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.360
 from now on wanting to offer captives and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.340
 music and dare to find that it hurts 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.259
 sapa especially for you who look at me 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.189
 a little game of before people music 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.600
 this hooks its flavor we also see 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.560
 in the comments if you find that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.420
 flush not denied your opinion then 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.280
 frankly very little cameo if I 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.380
 find pretty good so seven o'clock 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.740
 blue trucks and 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.659
 transparent four years by mirror in 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.600
 mirror effect so it's a chrome test 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.930
 with five axles so there are five hives 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.689
 next and the first three wheels 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.579
 single and last two rounds 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.289
 championship like that these are doubles 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.840
 so you can also see here who is 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.310
 a little task is here and guides here 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.539
 also at the front 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.220
 so it's to attach for example 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.569
 any rumor including for example 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.519
 these looks and I take you the 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.819
 tournaments no for example the small plateau 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:15.250
 at bale or trailer here at craon by 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.110
 example you can the task is so that 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.849
 I find it rather its end so by 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.170
 example if you have a remark what 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.950
 in a field or what but I wanted 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.120
 also hang it there like that you are 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.160
 not always forced to take big 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.239
 this moment why not rallied to seek 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
 or 20 or if you want to go 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.930
 re-grasping speed of you can 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.019
 also take the truck to go 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.849
 take these trailers etc there so that's it 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.280
 so you have also called fasteners here 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.079
 he wanted normal trailer so a 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.959
 little bit tied their hand like a 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.140
 revenge for example tulle skirt to 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:51.030
 what am I going to take this one 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:54.260
 where is this one to take this one 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.260
 I have a little show them all this 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.230
 so frankly also see well if and 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.390
 it goes excellent easy for a first 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.020
 wheel turns so that's nice because 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.070
 that it's frank enough to do 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.180
 a maneuver but all that is enough 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.019
 cool 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.480
 how to tell all there this phase is 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.930
 quite manoeuvrable is not too much of 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:23.409
 problems and I just realized the 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:28.120
 small trailer in the front is like that 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.830
 I 'll know you show it like that 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.870
 you have all that is very very very 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.640
 well then level speed there anyway 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.920
 88 km hour so that pretty fast so 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.580
 that's cool almost almost determines 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.680
 his 106 years that m eur who appeared just 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.069
 hung on the ben you see that everything is going 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.129
 very well I have a little show you 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.329
 the options you have two cases the 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:57.819
 options do not like standing well 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:59.709
 obviously the key one to yes 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.180
 obviously for sexually tanioka touch 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.940
 a two and three of the same no for 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.489
 the flashers for that's like on 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.819
 any machine the chica for the little ones 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:16.690
 headlights at the bottom the 5 key for 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.609
 the lighthouses here above there is everything 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.590
 thing for the back lights so 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.010
 still nomadic you key 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.620
 8 to put the little ones that is 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:32.830
 dissatisfied with orange merici and the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:34.750
 key 9 no the home key 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.310
 obviously for the little day not so 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.720
 I just accelerated the drum that this 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.720
 be black at night 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.590
 so here's ops you see that there is 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.970
 quite nice effects and that is enough 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.970
 beautiful like that in the dark 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.020
 like that you 'll see it 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.659
 hooker frankly I find you enough 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.159
 go in black just a little worry it's 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.739
 that when you see here the change 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.749
 problem is that inside can be seen 

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:09.279
 behind the guy is a little bug 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:11.349
 which we did not really see inside 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:14.379
 dax really gave the big fat 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:16.629
 problem because frankly I love 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.009
 of oxidizer from the inside the cause of 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.259
 this shot of brilliance but I could not 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.999
 when he really has a beautiful view 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.739
 intervenes because keep it jal and of 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.809
 whose work has thus failed in the 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:27.339
 booth and watch a people voice you 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:29.739
 see there the little man all in white 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:31.299
 so go on that want him to his guys 

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:34.629
 and they're not the internet so to speak it's 

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:35.529
 pity that for this to happen and get 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.689
 interior bench 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.129
 but still a nice tractor 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:39.729
 has your current truck that has 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.289
 not seduced 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.659
 so there are fifteen thousand liters at 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.559
 tank so that's not bad either 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.559
 from there there is 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.520
 adie militera 8 18 years old tank 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.470
 meat season 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:57.090
 ah yes ok when you see that there are 9984 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.130
 birth because I already have one 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.460
 little bit rolled with small visions 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.110
 said it good if not and animated quickly 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.670
 watch a little bit here I money 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.370
 rolls get there always the habit of 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.420
 put in inner view breillat as well 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.420
 than 40 oc 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.730
 yeah so here and up to 80 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.129
 it's worth it it's a little bit 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.629
 but in any case I decide in all directions 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:36.559
 even I dropped label does not confront 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:41.990
 like that you'll see you go 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:44.960
 to go very very quickly in see well 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:48.020
 that he's going yeah because she does not 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.479
 leave at 90 looks at me and everything at 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.620
 time and italy when 20 90 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.240
 this way you'll see this well in 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.529
 So you are here so I hope you have 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.860
 a small video if it does not 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.759
 quoted by m in small a small I like 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.819
