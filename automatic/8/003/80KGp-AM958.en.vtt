really believe is making use of some
very<00:01:03.310> essential<00:01:04.230> stars<00:01:05.230> and<00:01:05.650> ideas<00:01:06.460> that

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
very essential stars and ideas that

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.820 
very essential stars and ideas that
Steve<00:01:08.440> I<00:01:08.590> are<00:01:08.860> making<00:01:09.280> use<00:01:09.490> up<00:01:09.730> and<00:01:10.830> it's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
Steve I are making use up and it's

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.580 
Steve I are making use up and it's
actually<00:01:12.490> quite<00:01:13.120> simple<00:01:13.210> because<00:01:13.900> what<00:01:14.440> i<00:01:14.470> do

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
actually quite simple because what i do

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.970 
actually quite simple because what i do
is<00:01:14.920> pretty<00:01:15.700> much<00:01:15.820> just<00:01:16.030> play<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:17.320> Gallo<00:01:17.560> style

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
is pretty much just play the Gallo style

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.800 
is pretty much just play the Gallo style
in<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.370> 5th<00:01:18.610> position<00:01:18.790> of<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.390> major<00:01:19.600> scale

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
in the 5th position of the major scale

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.670 
in the 5th position of the major scale
here<00:01:20.940> but<00:01:21.940> what<00:01:22.150> makes<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.600> interesting<00:01:22.960> is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
here but what makes it interesting is

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:33.270 
here but what makes it interesting is
the<00:01:24.430> use<00:01:24.700> of<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:25.000> web<00:01:25.180> our<00:01:30.270> scale<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:32.710> if

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
the use of the web our scale so and if

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.910 
the use of the web our scale so and if
you're<00:01:33.430> not<00:01:33.520> used<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.960> manipulate<00:01:35.650> the

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
you're not used to to manipulate the

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.540 
you're not used to to manipulate the
white<00:01:36.460> bar<00:01:36.760> that<00:01:37.060> in<00:01:37.270> this<00:01:37.479> way<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.770> then<00:01:39.220> it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
white bar that in this way and then it

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.670 
white bar that in this way and then it
does<00:01:40.060> take<00:01:40.330> some<00:01:40.510> some<00:01:40.930> time<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.140> get<00:01:41.350> used<00:01:41.410> to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
does take some some time to get used to

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.100 
does take some some time to get used to
and<00:01:41.860> what<00:01:42.070> I<00:01:42.100> really<00:01:42.520> encourage<00:01:43.210> people<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.869> do

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
and what I really encourage people to do

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.550 
and what I really encourage people to do
of<00:01:44.380> getting<00:01:45.100> used<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:46.119> using<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.050> is<00:01:47.290> them

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
of getting used to to using it is them

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.190 
of getting used to to using it is them
to<00:01:48.400> just<00:01:48.910> play<00:01:49.090> go<00:01:49.390> ahead<00:01:49.540> play<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:49.960> play<00:01:50.140> a

to just play go ahead play and play a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.130 
to just play go ahead play and play a
scale<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.979> sewing<00:01:51.940> with<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.479> wet<00:01:52.690> bar<00:01:52.930> in

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
scale and sewing with the wet bar in

scale and sewing with the wet bar in
your<00:01:53.259> head<00:01:53.530> but<00:01:54.400> then<00:01:54.670> making<00:01:55.420> sure<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:55.990> you

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.620 
don't manipulate the note while you're
playing<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.400> as<00:02:00.850> an<00:02:00.970> example<00:02:01.030> could<00:02:01.600> be

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
playing so as an example could be

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.720 
playing so as an example could be
something<00:02:02.050> that<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:02.770> playing<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.310> note

or<00:02:21.990> whenever<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.200> choose<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.770> can<00:02:23.920> just

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
or whenever you choose so you can just

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.030 
or whenever you choose so you can just

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
start using that way if I just go

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.940 
start using that way if I just go
vibrato<00:02:27.040> or<00:02:27.930> pitching<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.290> dough<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.770> note

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
vibrato or pitching the dough to note

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:40.050 
vibrato or pitching the dough to note
down<00:02:29.980> rough<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.410> essential<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.910> be

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
down rough this is essential to to be

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.710 
down rough this is essential to to be
able<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:41.260> play<00:02:41.610> Steve<00:02:42.610> buys<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.240> stuff<00:02:43.570> I

able to to play Steve buys that stuff I

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.760 
able to to play Steve buys that stuff I
say<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:45.330> anyway<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.480> tree<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.140> incorporate

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
say so anyway to tree to incorporate

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.680 
say so anyway to tree to incorporate
some<00:02:48.040> stuff<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:48.760> into<00:02:49.150> your<00:02:49.180> own<00:02:49.420> plane

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
some stuff like this into your own plane

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.210 
some stuff like this into your own plane
is<00:02:49.930> us<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:51.370> pretty<00:02:52.360> obtainable<00:02:52.870> because<00:02:53.320> as<00:02:53.680> I

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
is us a pretty obtainable because as I

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.420 
is us a pretty obtainable because as I
said<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.490> was<00:02:54.760> just<00:02:54.970> making<00:02:55.300> use<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.510> one<00:02:56.430> scale

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
said I was just making use of one scale

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.030 
said I was just making use of one scale
position<00:02:58.060> here<00:02:58.300> so<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:59.020> was<00:02:59.290> just<00:02:59.320> playing

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
position here so it was just playing

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:14.360 
position here so it was just playing
around

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.780 

so<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.670> next<00:03:15.700> part<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.300> just<00:03:16.530> be<00:03:17.530> sliding<00:03:18.040> back

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
so the next part is just be sliding back

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.420 
so the next part is just be sliding back
and<00:03:18.820> forth<00:03:19.060> between<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.990> Precision's<00:03:20.680> but

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
and forth between the Precision's but

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.260 
and forth between the Precision's but
the<00:03:21.790> final<00:03:22.510> part<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.170> very<00:03:23.290> interesting

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
the final part is is very interesting

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.780 
the final part is is very interesting
it's<00:03:25.270> very<00:03:25.570> much<00:03:26.410> something<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.250> would<00:03:27.400> call<00:03:27.610> it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
it's very much something I would call it

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.230 
it's very much something I would call it
effect<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.900> I<00:03:28.990> believe<00:03:29.290> Steve<00:03:30.100> Vai<00:03:30.550> dated<00:03:31.030> on

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
effect and I believe Steve Vai dated on

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.810 
effect and I believe Steve Vai dated on
on<00:03:31.990> one<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.620> songs<00:03:32.860> on<00:03:33.070> flexible<00:03:33.610> I

cannot<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.250> reproduce<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.060> sound<00:03:46.270> just<00:03:46.600> by

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
cannot to reproduce the sound just by

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.270 
cannot to reproduce the sound just by
playing<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.950> same<00:03:48.220> note<00:03:48.489> over<00:03:48.700> over<00:03:49.060> again

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
playing the same note over over again

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.550 
playing the same note over over again
just<00:03:51.280> have<00:03:51.940> to

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.699 

something<00:03:55.489> completely<00:03:55.910> different<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:57.620> is

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
something completely different and it is

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.180 
something completely different and it is
definitely<00:03:58.250> in<00:03:58.640> effect<00:03:59.170> that's<00:04:00.170> fun<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.709> play

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
definitely in effect that's fun to play

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.940 
definitely in effect that's fun to play
around<00:04:01.310> with<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.989> try<00:04:02.989> to<00:04:03.050> compose<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.680> into

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
around with and try to compose it into

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.559 
around with and try to compose it into
one<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.280> your<00:04:04.400> souls<00:04:04.700> or<00:04:05.000> something<00:04:05.330> if<00:04:05.450> you

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
one of your souls or something if you

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.330 
one of your souls or something if you
think<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:05.930> sounds<00:04:06.200> cool<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.680> most<00:04:06.890> important

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
think it sounds cool and most important

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.180 
think it sounds cool and most important
try<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.550> make<00:04:08.090> use<00:04:08.390> of<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.720> dust<00:04:09.319> of<00:04:09.590> the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
try to make use of the dust of the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.040 
try to make use of the dust of the
material<00:04:10.640> in<00:04:10.730> your<00:04:10.910> own<00:04:11.000> playing<00:04:11.330> so<00:04:11.690> it's<00:04:11.900> not

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
material in your own playing so it's not

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.729 
material in your own playing so it's not
just<00:04:12.110> another<00:04:13.099> link<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:15.440> definitely

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
just another link and this definitely

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.819 
just another link and this definitely
takes<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.700> lot<00:04:16.940> of<00:04:16.970> effort<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.389> to<00:04:18.320> start<00:04:18.560> using

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
takes a lot of effort to to start using

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.920 
takes a lot of effort to to start using
but<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.639> know<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:19.880> have<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.299> tools<00:04:20.540> to<00:04:20.660> do<00:04:20.900> it

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
but you know you have the tools to do it

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.280 
but you know you have the tools to do it
which<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.680> as<00:04:22.220> I<00:04:22.370> said<00:04:22.430> using<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.389> make<00:04:24.050> use<00:04:24.260> of

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
which is as I said using the make use of

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.000 
which is as I said using the make use of
the<00:04:24.740> scale<00:04:25.370> patterns<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.060> then<00:04:26.770> start<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.860> get

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
the scale patterns and then start to get

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.790 
the scale patterns and then start to get
used<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.930> manipulating<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.080> notes<00:04:30.350> with<00:04:30.620> the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
used to manipulating the notes with the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.280 
used to manipulating the notes with the
red<00:04:30.950> bar
