00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
pieces in a set the difference is is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
pieces in a set the difference is is
these<00:00:55.620> actually<00:00:56.010> lock<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.460> place<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.300> have

a matter of just drawing it up out of
the<00:03:36.610> fluid<00:03:38.489> say<00:03:39.489> here<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.329> will<00:03:40.420> take

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
the fluid say here and it will take

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.620 
the fluid say here and it will take
quite<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.840> capacity<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:43.360> you<00:03:43.709> can<00:03:44.709> fit<00:03:44.950> this<00:03:45.630> any

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
quite a capacity so you can fit this any

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.350 
quite a capacity so you can fit this any
angle<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.280> push<00:03:48.280> your<00:03:48.489> oil<00:03:48.700> in<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.209> only

angle and push your oil in and it only

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.690 
angle and push your oil in and it only
takes<00:03:49.780> about<00:03:49.959> three<00:03:50.769> of<00:03:50.890> these<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.340> fill<00:03:51.549> this

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700
