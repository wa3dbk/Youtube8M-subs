bit longer I would think for for a

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.319 
bit longer I would think for for a
typical<00:02:57.500> narrative<00:02:58.069> shot<00:02:58.280> but<00:02:59.000> this<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.299> a

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
it's really not encumbering his ability

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.559 
it's really not encumbering his ability
to<00:03:03.200> operate<00:03:03.500> at<00:03:03.769> all<00:03:04.129> the<00:03:04.970> configuration

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
grip to grab the sled for me because I

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.080 
grip to grab the sled for me because I
think<00:04:13.680> you've<00:04:14.280> got<00:04:14.400> about<00:04:14.490> a<00:04:14.610> block<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:15.030> a

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
think you've got about a block and a

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.690 
think you've got about a block and a
half<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.510> yeah<00:04:15.660> with<00:04:16.620> something<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.160> size<00:04:17.400> to

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
half and yeah with something the size to

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.280 
half and yeah with something the size to
be<00:04:17.820> able<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:18.090> still<00:04:18.390> operate<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.989> Steadicam

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
be able to still operate the Steadicam

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.420 
be able to still operate the Steadicam
like<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:19.920> always<00:04:20.100> have

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
like you always have

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.400 
like you always have
so<00:04:21.330> if<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.570> need<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.840> operate<00:04:22.230> on<00:04:22.350> a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
so if you need it to operate on a

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.440 
so if you need it to operate on a
feature<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.950> do<00:04:23.100> six<00:04:23.460> seven<00:04:23.910> takes<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.420> that

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
feature and do six seven takes of that

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.510 
feature and do six seven takes of that
eight<00:04:24.840> takes<00:04:25.290> seven<00:04:25.650> takes<00:04:25.830> it's<00:04:26.100> fine<00:04:26.340> as

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
eight takes seven takes it's fine as

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.610 
eight takes seven takes it's fine as
long<00:04:26.610> if<00:04:26.850> somebody<00:04:27.120> takes<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.540> camera<00:04:27.900> get<00:04:28.590> a

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
long if somebody takes the camera get a

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.110 
long if somebody takes the camera get a
little<00:04:28.890> relief<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.340> between<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:29.820> then<00:04:29.880> just

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
little relief in between and then just

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.120 
little relief in between and then just
go<00:04:30.270> back<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.480> one<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.200> idea<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.860> rolling

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
go back to one the idea of rolling

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.400 
go back to one the idea of rolling
constantly<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.420> little<00:04:34.140> bit<00:04:34.260> more

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
constantly is a little bit more

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.460 
constantly is a little bit more
difficult<00:04:34.890> with<00:04:35.010> 3d<00:04:35.430> but<00:04:35.660> so<00:04:36.660> for<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:36.900> concert

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
difficult with 3d but so for a concert

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.840 
difficult with 3d but so for a concert
or<00:04:37.590> something<00:04:37.800> how<00:04:38.400> would<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.640> feel<00:04:38.790> about

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
or something how would you feel about

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.310 
or something how would you feel about
this<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.510> would<00:04:39.600> be<00:04:39.630> tricky<00:04:40.050> I<00:04:40.080> thought

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
this that would be tricky I thought

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.620 
this that would be tricky I thought
there<00:04:40.500> would<00:04:40.620> be<00:04:40.710> hard<00:04:40.920> you<00:04:41.330> know<00:04:42.330> we<00:04:42.480> have

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
there would be hard you know we have

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.630 
there would be hard you know we have
done<00:04:42.870> stuff<00:04:44.060> with<00:04:45.230> bx-3<00:04:46.230> we<00:04:46.650> did<00:04:46.890> we<00:04:47.160> did<00:04:47.400> we

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
done stuff with bx-3 we did we did we

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.190 
done stuff with bx-3 we did we did we
had<00:04:47.970> to<00:04:48.180> steady<00:04:48.450> camera<00:04:48.690> operators

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
had to steady camera operators

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.280 
had to steady camera operators
piggybacking<00:04:49.800> about<00:04:50.340> eight<00:04:51.150> minute<00:04:51.660> little

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
piggybacking about eight minute little

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.370 
piggybacking about eight minute little
runs<00:04:52.620> with<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.010> camera<00:04:53.690> guys<00:04:54.690> are<00:04:54.930> doing<00:04:55.200> live

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
runs with the camera guys are doing live

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.610 
runs with the camera guys are doing live
shows<00:04:55.650> with<00:04:55.950> this<00:04:56.330> you<00:04:57.330> know<00:04:57.450> we<00:04:57.630> might<00:04:57.810> strip

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
shows with this you know we might strip

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.380 
shows with this you know we might strip
some<00:04:58.830> weight<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.040> think<00:04:59.190> live<00:04:59.580> cameras<00:05:00.150> might

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
some weight I think live cameras might

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.050 
some weight I think live cameras might
be<00:05:00.540> a<00:05:00.570> little<00:05:00.810> bit<00:05:00.930> lighter<00:05:01.220> then<00:05:02.220> you<00:05:02.400> might

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
be a little bit lighter then you might

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.460 
be a little bit lighter then you might
choose<00:05:03.270> different<00:05:03.690> lenses<00:05:04.080> different

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
choose different lenses different

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.260 
choose different lenses different
cameras<00:05:04.919> I<00:05:05.130> think<00:05:05.400> yeah<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.550> think<00:05:05.640> you<00:05:05.940> wind<00:05:06.180> up

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
cameras I think yeah I think you wind up

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.010 
cameras I think yeah I think you wind up
with<00:05:06.390> the<00:05:06.510> p1<00:05:06.960> with<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.010> ng<00:05:08.850> M<00:05:09.120> yeah<00:05:12.020> right

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
with the p1 with the ng M yeah right

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.960 
with the p1 with the ng M yeah right
right<00:05:13.260> so<00:05:13.950> when<00:05:14.100> we<00:05:14.220> did<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.520> Black<00:05:14.730> Eyed<00:05:14.940> Peas

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
right so when we did the Black Eyed Peas

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.000 
right so when we did the Black Eyed Peas

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
xba-4 do you remember what the weight

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.350 
xba-4 do you remember what the weight
was<00:05:21.510> on<00:05:21.540> that<00:05:22.010> no<00:05:23.010> heavier<00:05:23.550> than<00:05:23.760> this<00:05:23.910> wasn't

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
was on that no heavier than this wasn't

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.790 
was on that no heavier than this wasn't
it<00:05:24.450> it<00:05:24.600> was<00:05:24.630> heavier<00:05:24.990> than<00:05:25.169> this<00:05:25.320> but<00:05:25.590> we<00:05:25.680> were

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
it it was heavier than this but we were

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.890 
it it was heavier than this but we were
able<00:05:26.040> to<00:05:26.100> use

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
able to use

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.219 
able to use
er<00:05:27.259> right<00:05:28.150> you<00:05:29.150> know<00:05:29.270> but<00:05:29.449> the<00:05:29.540> camera<00:05:29.990> was

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
er right you know but the camera was

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.390 
er right you know but the camera was
slung<00:05:30.590> above

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
slung above

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.570 
slung above
well<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:32.210> was<00:05:32.360> less<00:05:32.600> less<00:05:33.190> less<00:05:34.190> manageable

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
well that was less less less manageable

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.439 
well that was less less less manageable
yeah<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:36.410> was<00:05:36.530> X<00:05:36.830> 3<00:05:37.100> Z<00:05:37.160> X<00:05:37.580> 3s<00:05:37.970> would<00:05:38.060> be<00:05:38.210> lighter

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
yeah it was X 3 Z X 3s would be lighter

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.510 
yeah it was X 3 Z X 3s would be lighter
than<00:05:38.600> this<00:05:38.930> right<00:05:39.860> well<00:05:40.070> I<00:05:40.100> don't<00:05:40.280> know<00:05:40.340> that
