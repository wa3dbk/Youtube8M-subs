00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.630
 supermarket that everything had marks 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.570

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.879

 How are you going to wear the skirt first? 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.619
 be a gap skirt can mask fair 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.590
 because otherwise you 'll find yourself leaving time 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.869
 Your fat that you put on the bottom is 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.670
 that the null which is exactly total then 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.640

 in and out can knit even with 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.000
 brightness helps but there is one thing that not 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.260
 sport and mexi 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.630
 who stays in the middle way 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.870
 funky funky and just I have a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.620
 slight brightness of tse is also unaffected 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.110

 botanist is forgetting that you will cut 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.640
 So remember that the overalls he will leave 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.130
 You're a person with a visual unit. 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.209
 taking more vertical you are always 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.000
 what you always imagine 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.340
 more vertical ground higher 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.050
 leaner if you put anything 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.110
 to cut in time to mark the waist 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.310
 More or less, let's go there 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.560

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.560

 You can not go on Monday. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.370
 you can consume casual but you avoid the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.400
 shoes on those occasions where you work 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.260
 in a beautiful company the most 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.360
 Disenchanting something looser there all 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.310
 well it 's a good option account is reinvested 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.840
 brazilian samba shirts also like 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.650

 Look, just grow up, like it. 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.590
 I loved its super different about the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.990
 that I never thought I would put 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.180
 a pair of pants I liked that way then 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.010
 these pants start now in summer at 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.680
 next winter we see many 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.320
 the house she has of different and put 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.910
 below as inspiration is already 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.890
 We are talking here about the inspiration of chanel 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.600
 chanel are in the showcase of rohde kambô 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.700
 main brand store 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.490
 they have a stamp of this height then 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.330
 This is softer is a reinterpretation. 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:47.150
 and she is not jeans is a social fabric 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.800
 nerd send it by mara and have a pocket with 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.650
 jeans print 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.080
 I played black red yellow and you go. 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.540
 play with the silk blouse and play sneakers 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.280
 so it's a cool thing that this 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.560
 that we already spoke so he has silk 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.970
 has tailoring fabric not to be used 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.070
 content but it has a more expensive 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.140
 sport so it combines what it is to give 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.870
 a ballad super this fine is not that 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.240
 You will use super comfortable né 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.959
 It's that ballad goes on Friday with 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:20.140
 the friends to cause times is this 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.140
 there 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.730
 then crisólia only that the miniskirt that 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.270
 people can even talk to eat that inspired 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.300
 in the game of tennis still spoke fairy 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.460
 beautiful print and then the sneakers too 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.100
 then you will notice when you go 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.860
 buy a sneaker to wear this way 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.150
 it can not be that sneakers 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.350
 you can use white and 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.930
 one that would be what we call 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.970
 middle term be the correct square 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.340
 so it's one of them that has a bit of 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.430
 he has color he is not a sneaker 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.780
 of sports understands 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.460
 and then you see that we played a 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.290
 Then the scene blouse will always 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.389
 worry about the fabrics that you will 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.040
 play containment newer fabrics for 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.020
 You give this face of chips did not vote 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.210

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.010
 run away in gay a t-shirt 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.810
 wanting in the ballad will not roll is not 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.490

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.870
