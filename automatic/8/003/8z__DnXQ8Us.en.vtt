00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
you guys might wonder why am i unboxing

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.870 
you guys might wonder why am i unboxing
a<00:00:34.230> thumb<00:00:34.440> drive<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> point<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
a thumb drive what is the point of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.420 
a thumb drive what is the point of
unboxing<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.930> thumb<00:00:37.170> drive<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:38.040> which<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.370> would

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
unboxing a thumb drive to which I would

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.450 
unboxing a thumb drive to which I would
answer<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.450> point<00:00:41.480> is<00:00:42.480> speed<00:00:43.219> because<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
answer the point is speed because this

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.880 
answer the point is speed because this
thumb<00:00:44.730> drive<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.360> capable<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.140> reading<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.829> up

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
thumb drive is capable of reading it up

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.540 
thumb drive is capable of reading it up
to<00:00:47.010> 180<00:00:47.820> megabytes<00:00:48.629> per<00:00:48.960> second<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.649> which

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
to 180 megabytes per second and which

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
to 180 megabytes per second and which
makes<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.329> hundred<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.050> twenty<00:00:52.500> percent

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
makes it a hundred and twenty percent

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.670 
makes it a hundred and twenty percent
faster<00:00:53.360> than<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.960> don't<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
faster than what I don't know but it's a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.369 
faster than what I don't know but it's a
pro<00:00:55.890> drive<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:57.000> also<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.449> very<00:00:57.660> big<00:00:58.020> look<00:00:58.260> at

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
pro drive it also is very big look at

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.470 
pro drive it also is very big look at
this<00:00:58.500> thing<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.309> very<00:00:59.670> big<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.120> way<00:01:00.239> that's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this thing but very big in a way that's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.049 
this thing but very big in a way that's
not<00:01:00.660> sort<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.199> ridiculous<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.309> this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
not sort of ridiculous like this this

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
not sort of ridiculous like this this
Drive<00:01:03.420> drives<00:01:03.719> me<00:01:03.870> crazy<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.409> look<00:01:05.220> how

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
Drive drives me crazy because look how

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.520 
Drive drives me crazy because look how
wide<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
wide it is see this is this is a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.010 
wide it is see this is this is a
kingston<00:01:08.100> drive<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.760> look<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.479> USB

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
kingston drive and like look the USB

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.140 
kingston drive and like look the USB
interface<00:01:10.710> isn't<00:01:10.920> even<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.369> centered<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.060> by

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
interface isn't even like centered so by

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910 
interface isn't even like centered so by
the<00:01:12.210> time<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> plug<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.750> into<00:01:13.020> anything<00:01:13.290> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the time you plug that into anything you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.950 
the time you plug that into anything you
can't<00:01:14.100> plug<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.400> anything<00:01:14.610> next<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.299> this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
can't plug in anything next to it this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.350 
can't plug in anything next to it this
drive<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> long<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> has

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
drive right here is long because it has

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.060 
drive right here is long because it has
to<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.720> multiple<00:01:18.960> flash<00:01:19.470> chips<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.950> it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
to have multiple flash chips on it

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.260 
to have multiple flash chips on it
there's<00:01:20.220> nothing<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:20.970> about<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
there's nothing we can do about the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.060 
there's nothing we can do about the
physics<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.470> narrow<00:01:22.770> enough

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
physics of that but it's narrow enough

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.380 
physics of that but it's narrow enough
that<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.340> should<00:01:23.520> still<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.820> able<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.150> plug

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that you should still be able to plug

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.050 
that you should still be able to plug
other<00:01:24.659> devices<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.409> nearby<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.310> has<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> cap

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
other devices in nearby it has a cap

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
other devices in nearby it has a cap
that<00:01:27.390> shouldn't<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.840> 20<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.259> only<00:01:28.380> goes<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.740> one

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that shouldn't be 20 it only goes on one

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.190 
that shouldn't be 20 it only goes on one
way<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.250> wish<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.119> reversible<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.020> it's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
way I wish it was reversible but it's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.460 
way I wish it was reversible but it's
not<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> end<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.740> world<00:01:32.210> has<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.259> spot<00:01:34.259> here

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
not the end of the world has a spot here

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.569 
not the end of the world has a spot here
for<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> queuing<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.220> what<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> whole

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
for a queuing you know what the whole

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.550 
for a queuing you know what the whole
point<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.270> basically<00:01:36.720> speed<00:01:37.079> so

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
point of this is basically speed so

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.810 
point of this is basically speed so
we'll<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.770> back<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.189> moment<00:01:38.310> we'll<00:01:38.640> show<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
we'll be back in a moment we'll show you

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
i'm using windows 8 we should actually

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.780 
i'm using windows 8 we should actually
be<00:03:02.230> able<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.470> get<00:03:02.740> a<00:03:03.010> fairly<00:03:03.640> accurate

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
be able to get a fairly accurate

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.360 
be able to get a fairly accurate

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
representation so these two files are

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.700

about<00:03:06.970> one<00:03:07.360> gig<00:03:07.690> each<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:08.320> it<00:03:08.440> looks<00:03:08.620> like

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
about one gig each so it looks like

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.280 
about one gig each so it looks like
we're<00:03:09.160> writing<00:03:09.640> at<00:03:10.060> about<00:03:10.360> eighty<00:03:10.780> five

still<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.280> sp3<00:03:33.850> it's<00:03:33.970> going<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.150> be<00:03:34.239> faster

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
still you sp3 it's going to be faster

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.250 
still you sp3 it's going to be faster

anything near as Extreme as what we just

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.350 
anything near as Extreme as what we just
saw<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.280> let's<00:03:42.459> open<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.700> folder<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.120> view<00:03:43.150> the

average<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:38.460> 175<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.999> guess<00:04:40.360> guys<00:04:40.659> it's<00:04:41.379> not

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650

aren't quite there either but I think
what<00:04:50.139> we're<00:04:50.319> about<00:04:50.409> to<00:04:50.560> see<00:04:50.949> when<00:04:51.430> we<00:04:51.580> throw
