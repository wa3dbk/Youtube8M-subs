00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.630
 Yes studless tires 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:15.830
 Of less than 10 years who is by 5 buildings end moth of 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:17.440
 This kind of rubber hardness tester can be judged whether it can be used or not 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.480
 I purchased 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.930
 I would like to measure the hardness of rubber of studless tire with this 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.930
 First of all 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.480
 Here 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.930
 Bridgestone's 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.190
 revo 2 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.270
 Yes the serial number is here 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.900
 Last 4 digits 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.770
 That two digits are this 2006 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.920
 Was made on the 30th lap of 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.660
 Day of the Son and of the office say 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.960
 As it is until 11 of 2012 today 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.520
 6 years ago 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.520
 Will be the tire of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.510
 Yes rubber hardness tester 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.510
 I will try to figure out 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.170
 You've come yellow zone 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.170
 8 Let's take a look at several places 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.590
 Here is Green Toe 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.079
 In a feeling of saying 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.079
 To the tire surface 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.290
 I press a part like this needle 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.690
 Six years have passed 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.690
 Maeda Oh 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.170
 If the rubber is not so hard 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.480
 Yes it's the last minute 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.820
 Meanwhile it is here 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.700
 I just bought the other day 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.440
 What 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.640
 It is difficult to see 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.080
 You difference of Yokohama Dechotto 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.080
 It is the same I received the poem 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.910
 Of 2012 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.430
 And I was tired in lap 23 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.390
 It is a tire made this year 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.730
 Yes is better here turned up 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.730
 I do not even use still once in something like 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.990
 I'm just headed white 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.640
 Though 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.170
 Do the Deployment 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.319
 I hit it somewhere 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.319
 2 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.950
 Yes go with something like 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.790
 By the way, this is Yokohama 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.790
 With ice guard 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:13.440
 Cormorant Yes is that abolished 30 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:17.120
 Well, if you look only at this, it will be marb-resist, but if storage is good 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.120
 Even after many years 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.150
 It says that still use likely 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.050
 It is feeling 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.920
 Well this depends on the storage situation 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.470
 Actually this kind of rubber hardness tester 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.440
 As we sell even with Rakuten, we purchase 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.050
 When I measure it 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.050
 After I think it is good, it is the depth of the groove
