00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 It would work fine, I'm already here in the kitchen. 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.629
 from my house to record a recipe 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.940
 that you asked me a lot on the day of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.219
 boyfriends and made a surprise but I prefer 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.219
 A lot of dessert rolls for me on my 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.139
 boyfriend and the possible will be everyone 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.270
 Everyone loved that recipe then 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.580
 I decided to do it for you, it's the first 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.230
 recipe video that I then record 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.869
 Sorry if the camera suddenly does not stay 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.570
 so well positioned and I go in the race 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.010
 also enter the video will also be like this. 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.740
 Do not be too good, you'll forgive me. 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.530
 pa but gave not stop talking and go 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.360
 watch this video need oil or 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.829
 sour cream and condensed milk 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.570
 margarine 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.340
 the first step is to take all 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.520
 fillings of all wafers and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.270
 separating stuffing and wafer one for each 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.129
 side 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.840
 In this case I used a spoon to 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.390
 help me because the stuffing was not 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:58.800
 Taking off alone we can draw with the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 hand in the way you think best for the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.969
 People are going to put butter to melt. 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.969
 and stir until it starts to boil 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.840
 add the two cans or boxes of 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.800
 condensed milk and stir until the 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.800
 start to boil 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.799
 when the brigadier is boiling 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.420
 degrading from the bottom of the pan 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.100
 We're going to add all that 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.780
 filling the cookies we took out 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.060
 there at the beginning of the recipe 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.930
 then just add and keep stirring until 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.930
 withholding money 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.230
 It's all pointed out, we're going to turn off the 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.080
 and will add the sour cream 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.360
 then we move and then no focus of 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.040
 new to give one that works but not 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.610
 let it boil for a long time, it fits well 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.610
 little thing 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.819
 now with the help of a glass or 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.189
 you have at home we go to but 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.170
 You will break all and biscuit 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.670
 there it is only squeezing so that they 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.640
 be very shabby and we'll go 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.230
 start putting our pie 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.930
 now you will get the shape that you have 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.790
 at home and will begin assembling the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.840
 The first part is to make a 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.299
 cream 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.109
 there we return to the conscious 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.109
 scattered 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.640
 After that we'll make a 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.230
 wafer layer 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.780
 only add in the quantity that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.780
 you want and cover all the cream 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.329
 after that the growing one more layer 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.439
 this is already the final layer you use there 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.599
 all cream 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.980
 if you make more cream you can do 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.980
 more layers is at your discretion 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.180
 now you're going to break even more that 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.519
 cookie to let her talk well 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.470
 We'll cover you and you'll 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.470
 spreading over the cake 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.700
 and ready that our final result 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.099
 now you can put it in the fridge to 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.989
 she looks good, hard and very cold and 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.090
 there after a couple of hours she 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.859
 It will get very good. 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.530

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:00.290
