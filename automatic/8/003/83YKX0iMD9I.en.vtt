00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
know what I understand that

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.960 
know what I understand that
certification<00:04:55.690> isn't<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.199> best<00:04:56.409> but<00:04:57.190> it'll

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
certification isn't the best but it'll

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.770 
certification isn't the best but it'll
allow<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.780> get<00:04:59.319> in<00:04:59.819> with<00:05:00.819> them<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.300> get

on taking this step I think it is the
best<00:05:08.470> business<00:05:08.680> in<00:05:08.979> the<00:05:09.069> world<00:05:09.310> basically
