here<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.789> Han<00:00:23.910> grounds<00:00:24.240> we<00:00:24.330> plan<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> lot<00:00:24.660> of

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
here on the Han grounds we plan a lot of

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
here on the Han grounds we plan a lot of
food<00:00:25.260> plots<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:25.980> never<00:00:26.189> go<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.580> single

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
food plots but we never go to a single

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.970 
food plots but we never go to a single
piece<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.210> property<00:00:27.599> without<00:00:28.289> considering

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
piece of property without considering

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:43.170 
piece of property without considering
planning<00:00:29.189> two<00:00:29.429> plots<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.029> property

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.430 

now<00:00:44.180> what<00:00:44.300> we<00:00:44.420> have<00:00:44.450> is<00:00:44.630> what<00:00:44.900> we<00:00:44.930> call<00:00:45.020> a

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
now what we have is what we call a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.500 
now what we have is what we call a
hunting<00:00:45.950> plot<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.850> feeding<00:00:47.150> plot<00:00:52.360> now<00:00:53.360> as

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
hunting plot and the feeding plot now as

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.180 
hunting plot and the feeding plot now as
so<00:00:53.660> many<00:00:53.780> people<00:00:53.900> do<00:00:54.290> they<00:00:54.440> get<00:00:54.590> gunned<00:00:54.800> ho<00:00:54.980> I'm

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
so many people do they get gunned ho I'm

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.070 
so many people do they get gunned ho I'm
planting<00:00:55.400> food<00:00:55.670> plots<00:00:55.730> which<00:00:56.120> is<00:00:56.270> great<00:00:56.570> but

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
planting food plots which is great but

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.390 
planting food plots which is great but
they're<00:00:57.200> going<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:57.379> plant<00:00:57.559> one<00:00:57.800> food<00:00:58.040> plot<00:00:58.280> on

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
they're going to plant one food plot on

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.830 
they're going to plant one food plot on
the<00:00:58.460> piece<00:00:58.610> of<00:00:58.640> property<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.390> they're<00:00:59.750> going

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
the piece of property and they're going

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.869 
the piece of property and they're going
to<00:00:59.930> hunt<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:00.290> so<00:01:00.590> much<00:01:00.860> that<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:01.430> pressures<00:01:01.790> the

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
to hunt it so much that it pressures the

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.850 
to hunt it so much that it pressures the
deer<00:01:02.030> off<00:01:02.210> of<00:01:02.420> them<00:01:08.200> now<00:01:09.200> by<00:01:09.350> going<00:01:09.650> and

you

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.050 

now<00:01:47.830> for<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.070> hunting<00:01:48.310> plot<00:01:48.550> it<00:01:48.760> is<00:01:48.850> going<00:01:48.970> to

now for the hunting plot it is going to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.220 
now for the hunting plot it is going to
be<00:01:49.120> a<00:01:49.150> larger<00:01:49.510> plot<00:01:49.720> which<00:01:49.960> is<00:01:50.080> going<00:01:50.170> to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
be a larger plot which is going to

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.140 
be a larger plot which is going to
provide<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.530> great<00:01:50.860> food<00:01:51.190> source<00:01:51.220> throughout

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150

the stressful winter months for the deer

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.320 
the stressful winter months for the deer
but<00:01:54.100> at<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.250> same<00:01:54.430> time<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.970> can<00:01:55.090> go<00:01:55.180> ahead

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
but at the same time you can go ahead

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.210 
but at the same time you can go ahead
and<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.660> can<00:01:55.720> pressure<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.380> hunting<00:01:57.130> as

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
and you can pressure that hunting as

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.710 
and you can pressure that hunting as
much<00:01:57.400> as<00:01:57.550> you<00:01:57.640> want<00:01:57.880> because<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.300> know<00:01:58.480> you're

with<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.790> other<00:02:00.910> food<00:02:01.150> plot<00:02:05.340> now<00:02:06.340> what<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:06.520> will

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
with the other food plot now what I will

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.040 
with the other food plot now what I will
do<00:02:06.850> with<00:02:06.940> my<00:02:07.060> feeding<00:02:07.360> plot<00:02:07.540> as<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.780> season

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
do with my feeding plot as the season

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.609 
do with my feeding plot as the season
progresses

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
progresses

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.320 
progresses
I<00:02:08.770> will<00:02:09.190> move<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.640> because<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:09.940> know<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.179> deer

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
I will move in because I know the deer

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.270 
I will move in because I know the deer
hitting<00:02:10.690> on<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.990> I'm<00:02:11.260> not<00:02:11.500> filled<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.800> tag<00:02:11.980> yet

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
hitting on it I'm not filled a tag yet

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.530 
hitting on it I'm not filled a tag yet
so<00:02:12.459> I'm<00:02:12.550> going<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.730> wait<00:02:12.850> for<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.090> right<00:02:13.270> day
