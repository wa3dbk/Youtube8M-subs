00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.429
 dangerous castro pike is 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.429
 perfectly audible 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.970
 I just want to talk to paulo paiva that 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.119
 lion eating fried time can give a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.960
 indigestion in eating fried fish is not 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.199

 here my fig tree is already bad on 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.430
 championship and to make the flag worse 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.350
 impediment that did not exist if it were 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.719
 otherwise I make a fuss 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.969
 incredible but how it is against the fig tree 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.430
 This is one of the subjects so people 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.090
 of guilt from Sunday to Monday 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.280
 it is because it sees again to see new angles and 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.809
 it seems that the figueirense was 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.250
 really hurt was thus and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.780
 he finished the ball yesterday talking about it 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.130
 and there's a palm tree fan here 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.630
 saying that he sees no problem if the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.640
 time fall for series b 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.220
 I served this but this message to 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 pass to the Corinthian, right? 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.420

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.119
 calm 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.280
 leonardo tag de são caetano do sou sou 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.900
 and I do not see any major problems 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.180
 to go to series b 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.159
 We won the cup from Brazil for what's coming. 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.070
 we will dispute the liberators and the series b 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.590
 because so much drama to the series owns it 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.400
 very good teams and the palm trees is not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.979
 best 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.100
 What is the problem of disputing series b already? 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.409
 we've been there and it's no hell see 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.630
 the purpose of gugu georgette's column in 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.540
 stance looks people reinforces exactly 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.110
 Taking off georgette is already a 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.850
 series of a certain level certain level of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.159
 speak blunt was born of the word 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.180
 sorry for the championship bankruptcy 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.280
 Brazilian 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.869
 I do not even think there is a process of 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.100
 bankruptcy of the Brazilian championship for 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.680
 Brazilian championship has a horse 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.509
 to get someone to climb up to 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.920
 make a great championship a real one 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.860
 the largest in the world 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.560
 Because you have the chance but no one comes up now. 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.500
 What you 're saying is the following if you 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.760
 I spend the whole year gear I'm near the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.920
 Liberators' area wants to stay in 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.170
 Fourth in the championship because 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.319
 The main goal is to get 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.319
 liberators
