00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
can't expect the world to me it looks

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.500 
can't expect the world to me it looks
like<00:02:56.960> a<00:02:57.320> work<00:02:57.560> train<00:02:59.140> sort<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.380> paint<00:03:00.680> job<00:03:01.510> but

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
like a work train sort of paint job but

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.620 
like a work train sort of paint job but
we'll<00:03:02.660> be<00:03:02.750> doing<00:03:03.020> like<00:03:03.200> rail<00:03:03.440> works

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
we'll be doing like rail works

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.180 
we'll be doing like rail works
perhaps<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:07.060> nice<00:03:08.060> detail<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:11.390> handrails

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
perhaps a nice detail the handrails

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.460 
perhaps a nice detail the handrails

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
the coal and the tender appears to be

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.240 
the coal and the tender appears to be
gray<00:03:17.990> though<00:03:20.230> but<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.320> can<00:03:21.500> always<00:03:21.650> swap<00:03:22.010> that

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
gray though but I can always swap that

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.510 
gray though but I can always swap that
for<00:03:22.430> one<00:03:22.520> of<00:03:22.610> my<00:03:22.730> other<00:03:22.880> James<00:03:24.250> this<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.490> a

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
for one of my other James this is a

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.130 
for one of my other James this is a
sticker<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.120> number<00:03:26.360> five<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.510> appears

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
sticker the number five and it appears

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.900 
sticker the number five and it appears
to<00:03:30.260> be<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.590> only<00:03:30.740> sticker<00:03:31.310> on<00:03:31.520> the<00:03:31.760> whole

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
to be the only sticker on the whole

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:45.880 
to be the only sticker on the whole
locomotive<00:03:37.000> hard<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.180> see<00:03:38.360> with<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.570> yellow

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.150 

so<00:03:46.890> it's<00:03:47.070> identical<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.120> 94<00:03:48.870> one<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:52.410> let's

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
so it's identical to the 94 one so let's

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.610 
so it's identical to the 94 one so let's
go<00:03:53.490> and<00:03:53.760> put<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> battery<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.390> him<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:54.930> we'll

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
go and put a battery in him and we'll

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.970 
go and put a battery in him and we'll
