platformer I've ever seen it's like your

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.170 
platformer I've ever seen it's like your
platforming<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.619> move<00:01:19.890> no<00:01:20.729> no<00:01:21.030> because

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
platforming on the move no no because

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
platforming on the move no no because
the<00:01:21.360> moon<00:01:21.509> has<00:01:21.540> less<00:01:21.930> gravity<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.830> your

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the moon has less gravity it's like your

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.820 
the moon has less gravity it's like your
platforming<00:01:23.549> somewhere<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.259> most

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
platforming somewhere with like the most

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
would want to continue me I guess but

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.670 
would want to continue me I guess but
I'm<00:02:08.850> not<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.180> my<00:02:09.300> right<00:02:09.480> mind<00:02:09.540> you<00:02:10.500> know<00:02:10.590> if

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
I'm not in my right mind you know if

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.870 
I'm not in my right mind you know if
you're<00:02:10.770> watching<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.280> gameplay<00:02:11.640> footage

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
you're watching the gameplay footage

you're watching the gameplay footage
here<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.180> might<00:02:12.330> think<00:02:12.600> that<00:02:12.660> like<00:02:13.100> that

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
here you might think that like that

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.650 
here you might think that like that
maybe<00:02:14.310> I've<00:02:14.520> sped<00:02:14.910> up<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.240> footage<00:02:15.540> or

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
maybe I've sped up the footage or

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.900 
maybe I've sped up the footage or
something<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:16.950> how<00:02:17.070> croc<00:02:17.400> jumps

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
something this is just how croc jumps

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.210 
something this is just how croc jumps
look<00:02:18.450> at<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.660> he<00:02:18.990> falls<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.650> ground<00:02:19.740> he

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
look at that he falls to the ground he

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.370 
look at that he falls to the ground he
plummets<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.000> ground<00:02:21.090> almost<00:02:21.660> like<00:02:21.780> some

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
plummets to the ground almost like some

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.070 
plummets to the ground almost like some
sort<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.590> comet<00:02:23.100> or<00:02:23.280> asteroid<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.900> just

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
sort of comet or asteroid this is just

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.620 
sort of comet or asteroid this is just
this<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.530> unbelievable<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.910> know<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.210> first<00:02:27.240> I

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
this is unbelievable you know at first I

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.420 
this is unbelievable you know at first I
thought<00:02:27.810> oh<00:02:28.080> maybe<00:02:28.410> croc<00:02:28.800> will<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.070> better<00:02:29.280> as

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
thought oh maybe croc will be better as

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.430 
thought oh maybe croc will be better as
a<00:02:29.460> 2d<00:02:29.910> platformer<00:02:30.540> because<00:02:30.960> if<00:02:31.080> I'm<00:02:31.260> not

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
a 2d platformer because if I'm not

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.680 
a 2d platformer because if I'm not
mistaken<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.340> 3d<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.180> really<00:02:33.480> lousy

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
mistaken it's a 3d it's a really lousy

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.040 
mistaken it's a 3d it's a really lousy
3d<00:02:34.320> platformer<00:02:34.920> on<00:02:34.980> on<00:02:35.340> home<00:02:35.640> causes<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:37.020> I

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
3d platformer on on home causes so I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.600 
3d platformer on on home causes so I
thought<00:02:37.230> maybe<00:02:37.380> it'll<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.710> better<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.190> Dino

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
thought maybe it'll be better to Dino

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.970 
thought maybe it'll be better to Dino
this<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.450> really<00:02:39.900> bad<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.350> know<00:02:40.740> this

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
this is really bad you know this

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.280 
this is really bad you know this
wouldn't<00:02:41.310> be<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.610> worst<00:02:41.910> platformer<00:02:42.780> ever<00:02:42.990> I

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
wouldn't be the worst platformer ever I

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.920 
wouldn't be the worst platformer ever I
mean<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:43.590> super<00:02:43.740> generic<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.690> doesn't

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
mean it's super generic and it doesn't

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.440 
mean it's super generic and it doesn't
have<00:02:46.020> really<00:02:46.350> any<00:02:46.590> identity<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.370> its<00:02:47.489> own<00:02:47.640> but

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
have really any identity of its own but

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.910 
have really any identity of its own but
it<00:02:48.540> wouldn't<00:02:48.720> be<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.870> worst<00:02:49.050> platformer<00:02:49.739> ever

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
it wouldn't be the worst platformer ever

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.199 
it wouldn't be the worst platformer ever
if<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:51.080> actual<00:02:52.080> physics<00:02:52.560> were<00:02:53.070> better<00:02:53.310> like

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
if the actual physics were better like

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.140 
if the actual physics were better like
this<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.600> ludicrous

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
this is ludicrous

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.020 
this is ludicrous
look<00:02:56.720> how<00:02:56.840> fast<00:02:57.140> he<00:02:57.379> falls<00:02:57.620> down<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.580> almost

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
look how fast he falls down it it almost

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.800 
look how fast he falls down it it almost
makes<00:02:59.450> it<00:03:00.220> if<00:03:01.220> some<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.940> was<00:03:02.120> like<00:03:02.269> it

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
makes it if some of it was like it

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.809 
makes it if some of it was like it
almost<00:03:02.959> makes<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.379> possible<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.280> Brett

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
almost makes it possible to like Brett

almost makes it possible to like Brett
for<00:03:05.060> smooth<00:03:05.390> platforming<00:03:06.110> it's<00:03:06.230> just

now<00:03:50.510> understand<00:03:51.470> us<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:52.099> I<00:03:52.159> and<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:52.549> don't<00:03:52.609> like

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
now understand us and I and I don't like

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.789 
now understand us and I and I don't like
to<00:03:53.030> waste<00:03:53.209> my<00:03:53.510> time<00:03:53.540> with<00:03:54.230> anything<00:03:54.650> that's

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
to waste my time with anything that's

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.910 
to waste my time with anything that's
anything<00:03:55.640> less<00:03:55.909> than<00:03:56.209> stellar<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.500> so

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
anything less than stellar this is so

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.099 
anything less than stellar this is so
far<00:03:58.250> less<00:03:58.549> than<00:03:58.849> stellar<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.750> you<00:03:59.930> need<00:04:00.079> a

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
far less than stellar that you need a

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.809 
far less than stellar that you need a
microscope<00:04:00.530> or<00:04:00.980> would<00:04:01.220> need<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.400> microscope

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
microscope or would need a microscope

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.000 
microscope or would need a microscope
just<00:04:02.239> to<00:04:02.450> see<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:02.750> that's<00:04:03.139> how<00:04:03.319> much<00:04:03.500> less<00:04:03.799> it

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
just to see it that's how much less it

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.879 
just to see it that's how much less it
is<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:05.150> why<00:04:05.299> waste<00:04:05.540> your<00:04:05.750> time<00:04:05.930> with<00:04:06.169> why<00:04:06.709> be

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
is so why waste your time with why be

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.979 
is so why waste your time with why be
nice<00:04:07.069> to<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.519> look<00:04:07.700> it's<00:04:08.180> not<00:04:08.359> being<00:04:08.599> nice<00:04:08.780> to

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
nice to it look it's not being nice to

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.110 
nice to it look it's not being nice to
me<00:04:09.079> and<00:04:09.319> there's<00:04:09.590> no<00:04:09.709> goddamn<00:04:09.950> checkpoint<00:04:10.760> so

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
me and there's no goddamn checkpoint so

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.150 
me and there's no goddamn checkpoint so
all<00:04:11.299> the<00:04:11.419> way<00:04:11.510> back<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:11.959> beginning

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
all the way back to the beginning

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.500 
all the way back to the beginning
there's<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:13.250> many<00:04:13.310> cool<00:04:13.669> things<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:14.209> could<00:04:14.359> do

you know we have jet skis you know like

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.909 
you know we have jet skis you know like
why<00:04:17.870> don't<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.109> waste<00:04:18.289> your<00:04:18.500> time<00:04:18.680> with<00:04:18.859> a

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
stuff you can be doing there girls you

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.779 
stuff you can be doing there girls you
know<00:04:25.250> like<00:04:26.500> they're<00:04:27.500> girls<00:04:27.860> with<00:04:28.250> who<00:04:28.520> have

know like they're girls with who have

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.930 
know like they're girls with who have
jet<00:04:29.120> skis<00:04:29.500> it's<00:04:30.500> almost<00:04:30.949> like<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:31.400> game<00:04:31.699> was

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
jet skis it's almost like this game was

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.620 
jet skis it's almost like this game was
designed<00:04:32.440> by<00:04:33.440> aliens<00:04:33.949> like<00:04:34.460> like<00:04:35.270> there's<00:04:35.479> no

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
designed by aliens like like there's no

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.330 
designed by aliens like like there's no
way<00:04:35.750> human<00:04:36.139> beings<00:04:36.169> did<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:37.010> at<00:04:37.190> least

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
way human beings did this I at least

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.700 
way human beings did this I at least
have<00:04:37.639> that<00:04:37.669> much<00:04:38.090> faith<00:04:38.360> in<00:04:38.389> humanity<00:04:39.169> that

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
have that much faith in humanity that

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.029 
have that much faith in humanity that
I'll<00:04:40.669> say<00:04:40.880> I<00:04:41.090> really<00:04:41.690> can't<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:42.500> refuse<00:04:42.889> to

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
I'll say I really can't I refuse to

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.029 
I'll say I really can't I refuse to
believe<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.550> decent<00:04:44.510> law-abiding<00:04:45.260> human

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
believe that decent law-abiding human

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.650 
believe that decent law-abiding human
beings<00:04:46.370> with<00:04:46.520> good<00:04:46.760> intentions<00:04:47.330> at<00:04:47.630> heart

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
beings with good intentions at heart

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.500 
beings with good intentions at heart
made<00:04:48.470> this<00:04:48.680> game<00:04:48.979> to<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.729> aliens<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.330> is

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
made this game to the aliens this is

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.570 
made this game to the aliens this is
probably<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:50.930> good<00:04:51.110> platformer<00:04:51.800> because<00:04:52.130> all

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
probably a good platformer because all

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.640 
probably a good platformer because all
the<00:04:52.820> physics<00:04:53.210> are<00:04:53.360> exactly<00:04:53.900> what<00:04:54.050> they<00:04:54.199> are<00:04:54.229> on

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
the physics are exactly what they are on

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.070 
the physics are exactly what they are on
their<00:04:55.099> homeworld

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
their homeworld

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.080 
their homeworld
you<00:04:56.169> know<00:04:56.259> maybe<00:04:56.410> on<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.680> alien<00:04:56.860> homeworld<00:04:57.639> if

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
you know maybe on the alien homeworld if

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.210 
you know maybe on the alien homeworld if
you<00:04:58.240> jump<00:04:58.569> into<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.900> air<00:04:59.080> you<00:04:59.530> fall<00:04:59.770> back<00:04:59.949> down

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
you jump into the air you fall back down

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.969 
you jump into the air you fall back down
at<00:05:00.789> like<00:05:01.090> 12<00:05:01.419> with<00:05:01.720> 12<00:05:01.990> times<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:02.500> force<00:05:02.770> and

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
at like 12 with 12 times the force and

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.279 
at like 12 with 12 times the force and
velocity<00:05:03.099> and<00:05:03.819> maybe<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.270> aliens<00:05:04.720> are<00:05:04.960> like

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
velocity and maybe the aliens are like

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.040 
velocity and maybe the aliens are like
oh<00:05:05.729> hey<00:05:06.729> we've<00:05:06.970> played<00:05:07.240> Sonic<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:07.960> we've

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
oh hey we've played Sonic and we've

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
I will use alien technology are you guys

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.149 
I will use alien technology are you guys
even<00:05:18.340> seeing<00:05:18.759> this<00:05:19.030> I<00:05:19.319> want<00:05:20.319> if<00:05:20.500> you<00:05:20.650> do<00:05:21.069> you
