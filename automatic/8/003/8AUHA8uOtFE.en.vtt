00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.950
 how about youtube gamers good 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.410
 welcome to this video and well then I 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.300
 I think it's time to upload it because 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.820
 well, many people have 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.010
 been asking me to upload videos about 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.110
 how to get microsoft points free and 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.689
 all that and well, I think that the 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.440
 video well I think more legal or the 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.270
 way to do it legally is only 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.489
 with the xbox live page 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.460
 ruiz words there are many pages in 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.010
 facebook that sometimes give microsoft 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.450
 points or raffle and so this but then 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.120
 well nothing else this promotion is for a 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.190
 day here on xbox live the worlds this 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.780
 we will have it then for 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.110
 life or if you register you go to 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.510
 have this promotion for a lot 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.280
 aha time then well I know that 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.710
 many are going to tell me yes and I already knew 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.300
 this method does not help me ok maybe to you 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.820
 It does not work for you, but for many 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.799
 people who are coming to xbox live and 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.170
 are new it is very important that what 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.840
 know in fact when they opened xbox live 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.939
 the words here in Mexico 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.369
 one month of a month from xbox live at 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.140
 first 10,000 or 20,000 people who 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.240
 they registered I was one of those people 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.130
 I got a one-month xbox code 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.170
 live and well they give enough 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.079
 things is just this thing to be 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.670
 active in the east bazaar either be or be 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.439
 checking that page because on that page 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.509
 many promotions come out as 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.729
 example do a survey with a 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.729
 survey you get 20 microsoft points this 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.859
 check your applications that take you give you 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.979
 100 microsoft points for being 10 hours 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.360
 in that application, this is because I do not know 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.429
 different things for example do your 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.770
 first purchase you also get 100 this 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.319
 100 microsoft points or I know they are 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.479
 very few but to whom tell me who 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.759
 he has not lacked that they are going to buy something 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.729
 and they are missing 10 microsoft points and for 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.429
 those 10 microsoft points this one they're going to 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.439
 1500 buy another card or buy 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.450
 more points not so good I think that 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.269
 this is very very easy and obviously 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.950
 is on the part of xbox is obviously legal 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.110
 and all we have to do is 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.920
 well obviously start here in our 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.470
 I am logged in to xbox.com and then 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.830
 let's go to the page that I'm going to leave 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.000
 what is the xbox live words page is 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.830

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.380

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.090

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.980

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.390
 I know him that's a good movie theater 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.360

 to deposit 100 microsoft points 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.970

 and for me to deposit the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.669
 microsoft points is not good if they want 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.229
 they remove a video from when I called 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.910
 they deposited them because it is also 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.539
 it would be very good I will lower this 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.810
 application and see what rays and bonuses to 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.130
 see says welcome world friend in this was 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.650
 what I told them that they had given me a 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.930
 month of xbox live they gave me these 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.560
 morros in 2011 or a year ago 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.810
 they gave it to me exactly 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.110
 one month of xbox live because I joined the 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.020
 first 110,000 after it is installed there 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.600
 there is the check there are the 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.300
 tests morros and then yes look here there 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.060
 more get a month of live xbox you get 10 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.450
 microsoft points 3 months give you 30 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.300
 microsoft points 12 you get 200 and the 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.030
 Family golf package also give you 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.710
 well you get 400 then a little more and 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.510
 well, the inverse is the only way 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.389
 seriously to get microsoft points 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.310
 legally free practically or 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.350
 before they gave us nothing to buy 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.790
 microsoft points or for buying 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.639
 nothing in the bazaar did not give us anything 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.070
 then use the non-gamers join and 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.510
 I hope you can serve these 1020 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.430
 microsoft points that they give us because in 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.740
 they are very useful indeed said he 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.080
 I say them because I am currently 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.310
 I need 10 microsoft points and I think 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.710
 that right now I'm going to do this so that 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.630
 give me the 100 I need 10 microsoft 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.270
 points to buy me the premium package 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.850
 the bad company novas company raise the 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.919
 fill 3 and then nothing else is that gamers 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.840
 sorry if the video was extended a little 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.900
 but it was good to explain everything very well 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.820
 this does not give 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.639
 the video so that it reaches more people 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.350
 gamers please and so good me 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.790
 they asked about this method that if 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.190
 I went back up yes yes I went back up 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.900
 now they are giving invalid codes 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.180
 but do not worry, it's just a 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.340
 update if another method already comes out 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.440
 you know that they have it here subscribe 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.449
 if they want another method and this 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.389
 so that I am here to update 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:50.229
 do not subscribe to be commented and see you in 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.229
