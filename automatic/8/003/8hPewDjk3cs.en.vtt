00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello with you pavel basmanov and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.830
 today we talk about the context menu 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.000
 you all probably wanted to add some 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.950
 additional 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.020
 you functions to your context menu 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.440
 let's say if we are just a worker 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.000
 the table 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.520
 create what you see here and the standard 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.410
 I also wanted my computer 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.600
 would some quick access be exactly 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.750
 some special utilities that well 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.559
 can i eat them from the panel 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.739
 of management 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.870
 from the settings and so on and there is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.469
 completely free program that is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.359
 it is completely in Russian which 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.820
 help us figure it out maybe 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.629
 and you've seen it somewhere on the assembly 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.659
 torrent 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.149
 And still some copyright assemblies many 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.670
 and use and even if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.979
 these similar programs were used 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.350
 previously did not even sleep and took too 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.440
 roughly and started my way that is and 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.900
 continued on to other operating 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.790
 systems and so here we are just going 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.910
 talk to the program 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.850
 actually absolutely free and that is 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.720
 context menu version 1 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.409
 5 and as we will see windows the seven can 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.240
 eight vista xp 2000 and Ghent 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.440
 that is, please no problem she 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.830
 fully working and now we download 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.330
 so that it was the way the link will be under 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.860
 video on the official website and install and 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.560
 let's see how it works 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.100
 I think it will be very 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.280
 wonderful on program to improve 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.569
 the capital of the killer on your computer here 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.229
 as you can see, I switched exactly 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.580
 characteristics that is how you see 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.899
 windows xp 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.350
 seven eight and windows 8 1 x86 x64 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.780
 by the way it is very convenient because there 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.850
 metro interface with my computer if 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.860
 add some to the guts agree 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.739
 that's great well and how do you see how 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.060
 Russian is also highlighted and enough 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:17.930
 other languages ​​are also quite well let's all 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.860
 still download that is, as they say we can 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.350
 just look 64-bit some thread 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.140
 x64 and 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.480
 just thinking just download it like this 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.190
 the machine that is here it is downloaded and 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.470
 half a megabyte just weighs happy then 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.770
 I can safely eat as I see 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.900
 open and now we choose that is 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:47.090
 or 64 bit line 32 bit remind 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.020
 who doesn't know how to see your system 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:55.130
 windows opening my computer properties 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.110
 and here we see the type of system 64 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.160
 bit operating system 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.350
 here we will see that is, we run x64 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.980
 for 64-bit 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:11.180
 pricked 32 bits polazila run x86 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.580
 just without x64 kei run like you 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.820
 see she runs easily that is she 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:22.420
 the installer may be looking for 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:25.420
 suppose if we take that is we 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.420
 badge 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.630
 let's get to the desktop after all it 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.460
 then you can separate daddy 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.040
 actually collect it specifically for 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.840
 this program but we run how you 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.530
 see the second time I launched already 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.810
 fully in Russian 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.330
 let's see what we can add 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.900
 i.e. desktop context menu 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.380
 like and type command prompt clear 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.920
 etc. 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.200
 this is very awesome by the way even very 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.950
 convenient and honest, I will use it myself 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.459
 precisely from clear tempo because very 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.130
 often i need to brush tempo as well 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.250
 indicators hidden files and folders too 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.750
 very wonderful feature 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.350
 showed hidden file extension too 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.150
 we need actually enough here 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.000
 this fix the queue manager 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.210
 tasks of course who needs it but here I am 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.080
 I think contextual for the desktop 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.360
 this is quite enough and the system 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.150
 computer that is who is already here what 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.330
 need let's say command line editor 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.200
 the registry will run scissors someone needs 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.340
 and the configuration is also in the service manager 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.480
 you 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.840
 sometimes you really well and also has 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.720
 additional functions that is here 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.760
 we have a user lock lock 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.160
 users logout this 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.530
 by the way when u punished you somewhat 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.160
 user meaning it is fast exactly 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.240
 quick access 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.400
 that is, logout and of course 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.410
 reboot and shutdown and 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.250
 of course forced shutdown 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.150
 back too 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.400
 it is necessary and well and how would he be here 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.340
 service additionally i.e. it goes 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.729
 as if for some reason a dual sit 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:32.770
 interesting of course the system is all yes 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:35.919
 okay, if only we have all this work now 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.960
 click save them as seen here 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:42.070
 mouse from delete all editor list 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.190
 clear context menu 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.820
 about the program foxes we will save 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.610
 But the sound has passed and let's see 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:55.060
 I guess I think so 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.430
 reboot and here it is hello 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.260
 that is, we have them here I 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.540
 I think the secrets of the properties of my computer 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.820
 on and out but it turns out here that is 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.660
 system tools optional 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.360
 Nagov options that is all here 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.840
 located 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.880
 let's look again maybe 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.450
 context menu here now should be here 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.940
 add again let's take 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.620
 let's see yes quite right that is 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.140
 as you see all the tools i 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.700
 simply added that is not me 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:32.970
 Exiting they also remain the 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.850
 there is this program here I am absolutely 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:39.940
 totally agree that it is not needed 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.820
 windows 7 for both xp and windows 8 dressed 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.370
 This is a very convenient program. 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:49.420
 in Russian completely free 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:53.110
 I advise you to really use someone 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:56.190
 hunt quick access to just all these 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.420
