was gonna happen as well and the only

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780 
was gonna happen as well and the only
direction<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:10.530> were<00:01:10.590> allowed<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
but you know the ones in between would

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.569 
but you know the ones in between would
probably<00:01:37.530> choose<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.920> or<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> other<00:01:38.159> so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
I'm too surprised about it yeah yeah I

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.740 
I'm too surprised about it yeah yeah I
also<00:01:43.590> think<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.220> smart<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:45.360> it's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
also think it's smart because it's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.569 
also think it's smart because it's
moving<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.530> early<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.130> year<00:01:47.369> i<00:01:47.430> think

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
moving up so early in the year i think

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.270 
moving up so early in the year i think
