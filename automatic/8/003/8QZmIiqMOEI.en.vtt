00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
destroyed so you had to put cybernetic

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
destroyed so you had to put cybernetic
implants<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:22.080> order<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> keep<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.280> in

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
order to be able to keep using those

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.340 
order to be able to keep using those
body<00:01:25.350> parts<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:27.450> he's<00:01:27.659> technically<00:01:28.049> stuck

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
body parts so and he's technically stuck

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.969 
body parts so and he's technically stuck
