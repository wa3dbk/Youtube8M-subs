food<00:00:28.390> processing<00:00:28.929> etc<00:00:30.599> they<00:00:31.599> are<00:00:31.779> actually

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
food processing etc they are actually

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.560 
food processing etc they are actually
quite<00:00:32.500> a<00:00:32.590> heavy<00:00:32.830> unit<00:00:33.130> so<00:00:33.820> they're<00:00:34.000> on<00:00:34.180> legs

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
quite a heavy unit so they're on legs

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.799 
quite a heavy unit so they're on legs
you<00:00:35.289> can<00:00:35.410> see<00:00:35.649> there<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:37.210> you<00:00:37.270> can<00:00:37.570> get<00:00:37.780> a

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
you can see there so you can get a

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.110 
you can see there so you can get a
pallet<00:00:38.170> jack<00:00:38.440> or<00:00:38.680> a<00:00:38.739> fault<00:00:39.190> with<00:00:39.280> underneath

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
pallet jack or a fault with underneath

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.779 
pallet jack or a fault with underneath
them<00:00:40.329> they've<00:00:41.110> also<00:00:41.320> got<00:00:41.680> skids<00:00:42.219> on<00:00:42.520> the

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
them they've also got skids on the

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.290 
them they've also got skids on the
bottom<00:00:43.120> of<00:00:43.420> that<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:43.930> it<00:00:43.989> doesn't<00:00:45.149> affect<00:00:46.149> the

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
bottom of that so it doesn't affect the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.090 
bottom of that so it doesn't affect the
integrity<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:47.020> structure<00:00:47.350> as<00:00:47.710> its

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
integrity of the structure as its
