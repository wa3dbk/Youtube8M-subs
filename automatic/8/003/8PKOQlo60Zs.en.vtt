00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 nobody 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:15.159
 for this is commenting the program that you chose the name he did not want 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.880
 more history 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.650
 then nothing beats getting into the mood of a weekend 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.359
 Long time ago, it's wonderful. 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.359
 Have you already decided that you are going to do this long weekend? 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.689
 and it is with help 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.820
 look at the sky the press of this Brazil I already advance that has unfortunately not 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.030
 Go to the beach and you know why. 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.879
 because of this cold front that I here in these last days 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.410
 decided to provoke storms in the southern region 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.589
 and also caused heavy rain already in the state of são paulo 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.850
 The system continues so advanced in the Brazilian Cup. 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.139
 in the coming days until the cold front loses strength 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:57.499
 only that it generates a strong maritime circulation, ie the winds 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.740
 blowing the sea 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.640
 these moist winds also 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.970
 jets must leave our extended holiday practically he has the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.660
 combatant cloudiness 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.170
 but it happens at any time and that is why 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.579
 temperature will get lower will make same beach cold 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.130
 and this mainly between cut 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.820
 suu kyi from southeastern brazil 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.899
 in these regions the good thing is to go inland a commission is guaranteed 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.469
 And the car, too, for talking about values, looks only at the heat that will fit in the 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.100
 northernmost areas of brazil 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.960
 so yes I was you, you gotta get to the beach, you know where 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.560
 in the northeast of the country 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.250
 that's why our tip today is the beach of the fort located almost 80 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.670
 kilometers of the Bahia capital with natural pools, the beautiful beaches are 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.979
 delimited by any ex and are filled with fish in its waters 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.100

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.920
 the fort beach also in sheltering the national headquarters of the ibama tamar project 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.110
 and represents the largest reproductive site of the loggerhead turtle in the country 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.010
 in addition the beach of the fort is the rudder in the place 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.369
 made to be done 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.830
