00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
very very hard to distinguish the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.410 
very very hard to distinguish the
difference<00:00:43.649> if<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.760> was<00:00:44.850> disguised<00:00:45.210> with

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
difference if it was disguised with

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.100 
difference if it was disguised with
