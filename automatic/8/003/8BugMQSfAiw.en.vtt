here there's a new item that the nether
brick<00:03:54.770> it's<00:03:55.280> an<00:03:55.430> item<00:03:55.580> that<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:55.880> get<00:03:56.240> it<00:03:56.390> from

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
brick it's an item that you get it from

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.720

smelting<00:03:57.260> netherrack<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.920> crafting<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.460> into

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
smelting netherrack and crafting it into

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.930 
smelting netherrack and crafting it into
another<00:03:58.940> brick<00:03:59.560> tile<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:01.010> says<00:04:01.430> which<00:04:01.670> means

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
another brick tile it says which means

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.330 
another brick tile it says which means
if<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.810> see<00:04:03.050> here<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.360> think<00:04:05.360> this<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.600> what<00:04:05.840> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
if you see here I think this is what the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.480 
if you see here I think this is what the
yeah<00:04:07.340> nether<00:04:07.640> brick<00:04:07.820> so<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:09.260> craft<00:04:09.560> this<00:04:09.830> with

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
yeah nether brick so you craft this with

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.760 
yeah nether brick so you craft this with
it<00:04:10.700> with<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.690> brick<00:04:12.110> which<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.380> an<00:04:12.500> item<00:04:12.680> which

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
it with the brick which is an item which

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.100 
it with the brick which is an item which
was<00:04:12.890> recently<00:04:13.340> added<00:04:13.520> into<00:04:13.910> Minecraft<00:04:14.540> just

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
was recently added into Minecraft just

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.729 
was recently added into Minecraft just
like<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.470> quartz<00:04:15.740> was<00:04:15.920> in<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.250> snapshots

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
like the quartz was in the snapshots

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.260 
like the quartz was in the snapshots
they<00:04:18.739> added<00:04:18.980> upside<00:04:19.220> down<00:04:19.340> stairs<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.000> corner

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
they added upside down stairs and corner

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.960 
they added upside down stairs and corner
stands<00:04:20.480> as<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:20.780> see<00:04:20.930> over<00:04:21.320> here<00:04:21.550> the<00:04:22.550> corner

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
stands as you see over here the corner

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.770 
stands as you see over here the corner
stairs<00:04:23.270> I<00:04:23.720> think<00:04:24.470> here<00:04:24.890> if<00:04:24.980> I<00:04:25.070> was<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:25.970> tried

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
stairs I think here if I was to I tried

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.120 
stairs I think here if I was to I tried
to<00:04:26.870> pick<00:04:27.080> block<00:04:27.320> on<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.560> that's<00:04:27.860> not<00:04:27.920> gonna

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
to pick block on that that's not gonna

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.180 
to pick block on that that's not gonna
work<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.810> corner<00:04:30.050> stairs<00:04:30.320> was<00:04:30.770> like<00:04:31.010> this

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
work the corner stairs was like this

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.440 
work the corner stairs was like this
yeah<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.610> see<00:04:34.730> this<00:04:34.820> is<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.000> corner<00:04:35.270> stair

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
yeah so you see this is the corner stair

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.570 
yeah so you see this is the corner stair
block<00:04:35.660> I

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
block I

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.130 
block I
I'm<00:04:37.910> not<00:04:38.090> sure<00:04:38.240> how<00:04:38.360> this<00:04:38.480> is<00:04:38.540> working<00:04:39.020> as<00:04:39.110> you

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
I'm not sure how this is working as you

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.470 
I'm not sure how this is working as you
see<00:04:39.380> I'm<00:04:39.470> placing<00:04:39.770> this<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.370> it's<00:04:41.030> kind<00:04:41.450> of

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
see I'm placing this and it's kind of

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.380 
see I'm placing this and it's kind of
randomizing<00:04:42.320> sort<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:43.150> randomizing<00:04:44.150> which

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
randomizing sort of randomizing which

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.920 
randomizing sort of randomizing which
one<00:04:44.780> it's<00:04:44.930> gonna<00:04:45.050> place<00:04:46.510> although<00:04:47.510> now<00:04:47.780> it's

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
one it's gonna place although now it's

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.570 
one it's gonna place although now it's
only<00:04:48.020> going<00:04:48.230> this<00:04:48.410> one<00:04:48.620> oh<00:04:50.620> wait

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.100 

very<00:04:55.580> weird<00:04:57.339> slabs<00:04:58.339> cannot<00:04:58.669> be<00:04:58.759> placed<00:04:58.999> in<00:04:59.330> up

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
very weird slabs cannot be placed in up

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.199 
very weird slabs cannot be placed in up
position<00:05:00.589> and<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:01.399> needs<00:05:01.580> testing<00:05:01.879> for

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:02.209 
position and it needs testing for

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:04.299 
position and it needs testing for
smaller<00:05:02.419> screens<00:05:02.779> apparently<00:05:03.289> so<00:05:03.529> because

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:04.309 
smaller screens apparently so because

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:06.040 
smaller screens apparently so because
what<00:05:04.429> that<00:05:04.459> means<00:05:04.789> if<00:05:04.969> I<00:05:05.029> was<00:05:05.149> to<00:05:05.269> go<00:05:05.569> in<00:05:05.689> here

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
what that means if I was to go in here

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.159 
what that means if I was to go in here
take<00:05:06.649> a<00:05:06.679> slab<00:05:08.409> they<00:05:09.409> can<00:05:09.589> be<00:05:09.679> placed<00:05:10.179> over<00:05:11.179> here

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
take a slab they can be placed over here

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:12.579 
take a slab they can be placed over here
ah

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:12.589 
ah

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:15.339 
ah
yes<00:05:13.429> okay<00:05:14.419> so<00:05:14.449> basically<00:05:14.839> there's<00:05:15.289> two

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
yes okay so basically there's two

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:16.959 
yes okay so basically there's two
different<00:05:15.679> halves<00:05:15.979> of<00:05:16.099> a<00:05:16.189> block<00:05:16.399> you<00:05:16.669> can

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:16.969 
different halves of a block you can

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:18.399 
different halves of a block you can
place<00:05:17.089> a<00:05:17.119> slab<00:05:17.389> on<00:05:17.509> the<00:05:17.629> lower<00:05:17.809> part<00:05:18.289> of<00:05:18.379> a

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
place a slab on the lower part of a

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:19.629 
place a slab on the lower part of a
block<00:05:18.589> and<00:05:18.800> on<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.039> higher<00:05:19.249> part<00:05:19.550> of<00:05:19.580> the

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
block and on the higher part of the

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.089 
block and on the higher part of the
block<00:05:19.879> so<00:05:20.719> that<00:05:20.749> makes<00:05:21.199> sense<00:05:21.289> that's<00:05:21.709> really

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
block so that makes sense that's really

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.699 
block so that makes sense that's really
cool<00:05:22.339> and<00:05:22.839> sand<00:05:23.839> and<00:05:24.139> gravel<00:05:24.469> are<00:05:24.589> not

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:24.709 
cool and sand and gravel are not

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:26.409 
cool and sand and gravel are not
affected<00:05:25.039> by<00:05:25.099> gravity<00:05:25.159> so<00:05:26.089> if<00:05:26.179> I<00:05:26.239> was<00:05:26.389> to

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
affected by gravity so if I was to

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.949 
affected by gravity so if I was to
destroy<00:05:26.899> this<00:05:27.349> it<00:05:28.189> will<00:05:28.279> fall<00:05:28.550> in<00:05:28.699> ooh<00:05:28.959> that

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:29.959 
destroy this it will fall in ooh that

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.169 
destroy this it will fall in ooh that
was<00:05:30.079> like<00:05:30.199> a<00:05:30.229> bug

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:31.179 
was like a bug

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:34.919 
was like a bug
interesting<00:05:32.209> this<00:05:32.539> happened<00:05:32.839> with<00:05:32.929> this<00:05:33.439> -

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
this video that's a bug there's some

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.809 
this video that's a bug there's some
tweaks<00:05:41.899> recipes<00:05:42.439> for<00:05:42.619> crafting<00:05:43.039> slabs<00:05:43.459> gives

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
tweaks recipes for crafting slabs gives

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.729 
tweaks recipes for crafting slabs gives
you<00:05:43.939> 6<00:05:44.209> slabs<00:05:44.419> instead<00:05:44.749> of<00:05:44.839> 3<00:05:45.079> just<00:05:45.559> like<00:05:45.649> it

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:45.739
