was<00:00:28.529> about<00:00:28.619> five<00:00:28.920> bucks<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:32.059> 250<00:00:33.059> mils<00:00:33.270> which

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
was about five bucks for 250 mils which

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.420 
was about five bucks for 250 mils which
is<00:00:33.570> more<00:00:33.780> than<00:00:33.930> enough<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.950> need<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.250> cover

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
is more than enough I just need to cover

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.750 
is more than enough I just need to cover
these<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:36.480> acetone<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.559> jar<00:00:38.010> glass<00:00:38.430> jar

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
these in acetone you know jar glass jar

these in acetone you know jar glass jar
for<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.390> few<00:00:40.140> days<00:00:40.399> put<00:00:41.399> these<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.670> there<00:00:41.850> first

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
for a few days put these in there first

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.600 
for a few days put these in there first
to<00:00:42.420> stop<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> splashing<00:00:43.040> one<00:00:44.040> thing<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.219> did<00:00:44.430> do

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
to stop the splashing one thing I did do

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.369 
to stop the splashing one thing I did do
actually<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.180> take<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> quick<00:00:45.660> look<00:00:46.050> at

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
actually is just take a quick look at

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.979 
actually is just take a quick look at
the<00:00:46.530> underside<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.010> these<00:00:47.219> chips<00:00:47.899> hold<00:00:48.899> this

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the underside of these chips hold this

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.610 
the underside of these chips hold this
steady<00:00:49.260> enough<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.960> reason<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.199> there's<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
steady enough the reason is there's a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.010 
steady enough the reason is there's a
guy<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> forums<00:00:54.120> from<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.660> while

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
guy on one of the forums from a while

guy on one of the forums from a while
ago<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.500> said<00:00:55.649> he<00:00:55.770> found<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.480> one<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
ago that said he found one one of the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660 
ago that said he found one one of the
chips<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.079> his<00:00:58.199> batch<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:59.100> actually<00:00:59.399> double

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
chips in his batch was actually double

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.720 
chips in his batch was actually double
wrapped<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.149> had<00:01:00.359> another<00:01:00.870> layer<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.730> epoxy

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
underneath the main one which proved to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.320 
underneath the main one which proved to
me<00:01:07.650> probably<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.460> off<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> he<00:01:08.909> said<00:01:09.119> that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
me probably to get off and he said that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.170 
me probably to get off and he said that
you<00:01:09.600> could<00:01:09.750> actually<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:10.400> or<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:12.060> actual

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
you could actually see or the actual

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
you could actually see or the actual
chips<00:01:12.570> were<00:01:13.080> less<00:01:13.439> prominent<00:01:13.860> through<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
chips were less prominent through the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.039 
chips were less prominent through the
packaging<00:01:14.640> than<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.360> other<00:01:15.509> ones<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.930> his

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
packaging than on the other ones in his

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.649 
packaging than on the other ones in his
Juno<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.970> doesn't<00:01:18.240> seem<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
Juno but that doesn't seem to be the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.630 
Juno but that doesn't seem to be the
problem<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:19.170> these<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:19.619> fairly<00:01:20.159> well

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
problem here these are all fairly well

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.340 
problem here these are all fairly well
defined<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.240> either<00:01:21.420> pick<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
defined you can either pick out the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.520 
defined you can either pick out the
little<00:01:22.640> surface<00:01:23.640> mount<00:01:24.020> capacitors<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.170> there

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
little surface mount capacitors in there

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:35.270 
little surface mount capacitors in there
so<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:26.340> I'll<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:33.470> circuit<00:01:34.470> boards<00:01:34.740> safely<00:01:35.130> on

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
so what I'll do circuit boards safely on

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.410 
so what I'll do circuit boards safely on
another<00:01:35.460> bench<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:37.380> avoid<00:01:38.090> splashes<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:42.119> we

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
another bench to avoid splashes and we

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.999 
another bench to avoid splashes and we
just<00:01:42.689> add<00:01:43.009> acetone<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.159> top<00:01:48.470> just<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> cover

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
just add acetone on top just to cover

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.270 
just add acetone on top just to cover
them<00:01:50.189> should<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.759> nicely<00:01:51.649> that's<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.799> time<00:01:53.009> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
them should do nicely that's a time it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.260 
them should do nicely that's a time it
does<00:01:53.490> evaporates<00:01:54.180> pretty<00:01:54.420> quickly<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.530> is

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
does evaporates pretty quickly and is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.179 
does evaporates pretty quickly and is
pretty<00:01:57.270> nasty<00:01:57.659> stuff<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.950> gonna<00:01:59.100> be

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
pretty nasty stuff so this is gonna be

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.440 
pretty nasty stuff so this is gonna be
sealed<00:02:00.619> see<00:02:01.619> how<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.820> trick<00:02:03.149> account

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
sealed see how we go the trick account

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.520 
sealed see how we go the trick account
is<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.960> give<00:02:04.799> them<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.130> 24<00:02:05.549> hours<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:07.320> then

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
is to give them about 24 hours and then

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.680 
is to give them about 24 hours and then
use<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:08.000> Stanley<00:02:09.000> knife<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.390> cut<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> edges<00:02:10.560> off

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
use a Stanley knife to cut the edges off

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.800 
use a Stanley knife to cut the edges off
down<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:13.820> sew<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.270> thing<00:02:14.330> actually

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
down so you can sew this thing actually

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.870 
down so you can sew this thing actually
get<00:02:14.930> underneath<00:02:15.200> but<00:02:16.660> yeah<00:02:17.660> voice<00:02:18.080> chip<00:02:18.350> super

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
get underneath but yeah voice chip super

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.570 
get underneath but yeah voice chip super
but<00:02:19.880> it's<00:02:19.970> now<00:02:20.150> Wednesday<00:02:21.140> evening<00:02:22.240> so<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
but it's now Wednesday evening so the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.550 
but it's now Wednesday evening so the
common<00:02:26.060> soaking<00:02:26.540> time<00:02:26.690> seems<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.050> be<00:02:27.200> two<00:02:27.410> or

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
common soaking time seems to be two or

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.450 
in but I'll leave that to you to stew I

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
just because that might help speed
