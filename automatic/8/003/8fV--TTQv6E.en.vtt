00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.840

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.199
 try one of his inventions the animus 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.630
 decades ago abstergo discovered that 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.429
 our DNA contained memories and not only 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.129
 ours but also those of 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.900
 our ancestors built the animus 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.290
 to find this genetic trace and 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.360
 relive forgotten lives there inside I had 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.420
 to face a truth of which 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.699
 I thought I had escaped a long time ago 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.260

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.790
 that protects the free will that 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.890
 try to snatch us the templars 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.850
 an organization as old as the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.100
 story that you want to control the world 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.589

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.620
 ibn throwing a stoic ace at the end of 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.390
 12th century who lived on the Holy Land 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.250
 I discovered the fruit of the ebb in a strange 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.780
 and powerful artifact that occupies a first 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.720
 flat in our war against the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.119
 Templars after I was done audited from 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.740
 an Italian of the 15th century I came to 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.350
 know him very well then live his 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.360
 broken transition for the pain this 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.250
 charismatic vividor initiated a mission of 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.350
 revenge as assassins and it's over 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.570
 becoming a legendary teacher and 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.520
 in the leader of his order after another 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.740
 encounter with the fruit its creators 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.200
 they contacted me the first 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.880
 civilization a previous advanced race 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.740
 to the history of mankind spoke 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.840
 about a great disaster that destroyed his 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.069
 people and warned that the tragedy 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.570
 would repeat in 2012 and then the 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.150
 darkness to enveloped everything 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.409
 now I'm stuck in the animus and my 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.780
 memories are fragmented 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.969
 to escape I must return to the memory 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.250

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.690
 the most important trip of his life 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.490
 confronting the Templars he seeks the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.820
 messages that altair left buried in 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.500
 the deepest too much are crucial 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.350

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.460
 that the answers are hidden in me 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.040
 lineage where these three converge 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.230
 beams I just hope to be able to 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.100
 discover them soon so that all 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.100
