there<00:00:46.710> may<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:46.890> something<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:47.969> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
there may be something to this for a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.330 
there may be something to this for a
couple<00:00:48.329> reasons<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.930> its<00:00:49.379> acidic<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.190> it's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
couple reasons that its acidic so it's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.229 
couple reasons that its acidic so it's
naturally<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.930> kill<00:00:52.140> bacteria<00:00:52.649> it

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
naturally going to to kill bacteria it

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.080 
naturally going to to kill bacteria it
actually<00:00:54.239> creates<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:55.050> moist<00:00:56.010> environment<00:00:56.910> so

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
actually creates a moist environment so

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.869 
actually creates a moist environment so
that<00:00:57.120> healing<00:00:58.050> will<00:00:58.230> take<00:00:58.440> place<00:00:58.739> quicker<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
