00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 haye I had here again and the fg 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:11.400
 Keep calm water and the uke faq 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:18.300
 xxl op ptm i can become a piece of that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:21.600
 uke faq xxl op ptm age the uke faq xxl 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.000
 ppp tm will come there is no need 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.340
 It will definitely make you think 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.309
 comes on the problem is just because 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:36.230
 the uke faq xxl ppp tm so that's unnecessary 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.230
 complicated faq 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.480
 sapporo on this nonsense notice that 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.829
 I need one more with me 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.210
 You just write in the power 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.079
 comments if you want to see that 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.649
 at youtube then I ask those times 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.299
 so just write some 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.829
 suggestions in there if you see that 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:08.119
 At any rate, you just want one 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.399
 domination a rule of domination 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.190
 a domination camp strike exactly me 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.399
 played with three impact people and 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.259
 I had at the end mega paint because 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.729
 Marcel said soja he already wanted the 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.289
 go out all the time and comes to an end 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.729
 he also out and he would not have it 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.530
 I'll see that on street if then 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.409
 who has been waiting for it from before 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.810
 I so my camp strike up and it was 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.520
 also extremely close because we currently 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.840
 It was hardly enough to have you here 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.549
 to reach because the opponents were 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.030
 because yes, you can see it here 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.979
 a little bit over 140 dominions 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.090
 Points 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.100
 and yes, of course I had to 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.630
 hurry and at the end eighth time 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.729
 to those who are wondering now 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.750
 because maps change yes if you 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.450
 knows strikes activates some maps 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.909
 and yes, if you know then activated 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.829
 and then you just stand where at one 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.079
 Do not even locate it later 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.479
 after the activation of the camp what 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.670
 then happens to me what happens there 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.399
 quite simply one gets to another 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.979
 place of the map teleportiert played 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.040
 I said with the fhdw I think so 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.359
 the map extremely corner old the more wants 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.700
 but I also think the weapon 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.049
 extremely cool I actually find so 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.750
 pretty much the hottest weapon from the 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.549
 whole game and I think also writes 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.280
 me please also in the comments how 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.660
 So you me now as a player 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.450
 because I think I am 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.560
 very, very, really, really 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.720
 very good player with grown up 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.280
 just somehow I'm not there like that 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.200
 certainly need life with that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.739
 i am looking for confirmation here 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.090
 of course, but mainly writes 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.610
 Please have a look in the comments with whom 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.900
 here is the uke faq xxl 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.830
 ppp tm are fun 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.510
 By now I can memorize 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.460
 because yes I do not know yet and 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.650
 somehow you know it on the map take 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.320
 I do not know the idea poured it 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.700
 play whether it seems to me, or if it 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.470
 in fact, actually a bug is that 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.840
 Always here if you have the supplies 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.490
 as has done on the field orders and 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.840
 then stock gets that here everyone 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.150
 Round somehow in the camp strike from the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.940
 Inventories come because I have finished 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.480
 two spare supplies left after 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.550
 kempter denis masseglia went out 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.950
 the loose at least one window 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.780
 would have come because I do not know 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.250
 somehow every time comes that and 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.320
 weird rider fights out of the stores 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.150
 and my worst dreads that 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.110
 I had the photos release was 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.510
 said that when I'm on the kent 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.400
 state street ties opponents from the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.470
 Stocks a camp strike has and me 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.209
 thus kills and then left look so 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.980
 Where it was right now I was a bit like that 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.860
 delayed which fades out 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.500
 always have the shapes which this was 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.880
 sometimes right next to something like that 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500
 I should say exactly because of that 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.120
 camp 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.830
 I could easily have had a house there 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.299
 and then I would have to find one 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:08.239
 Well, in any case, it was a 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.900
 I would like to play cool gameplay myself 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.980
 claim by me and park were opponents 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.510
 somehow yes, no cellphone 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.370
 have played real shit together 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.130
 and I also showed the camps 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.650
 that was still tight and then 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.940
 pay attention to where I suddenly there 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.380
 yes, the map or the whole 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.490
 bright screen where I suddenly 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.590
 teleported behind is really funny 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.570
 that was already the gameplay me 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.570
 then say goodbye to people until then 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:55.610
 unnecessarily complicated faq it off on this 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.610
 game
