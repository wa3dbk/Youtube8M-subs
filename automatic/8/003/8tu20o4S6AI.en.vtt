race<00:04:37.740> has<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.790> growth<00:04:39.030> stage<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:39.630> your<00:04:40.229> hair

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
race has the growth stage so your hair

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.020 
race has the growth stage so your hair
has<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.680> life<00:04:40.979> cycle<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.610> as<00:04:41.669> having<00:04:41.910> this

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
has a life cycle and as having this

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.600 
has a life cycle and as having this
three<00:04:42.330> successive<00:04:42.990> cycles<00:04:43.290> in<00:04:43.830> that<00:04:44.040> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
three successive cycles in that the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.580 
three successive cycles in that the
growth<00:04:44.850> phase<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:45.630> key<00:04:45.840> phase<00:04:46.169> and<00:04:46.500> it

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
growth phase is the key phase and it

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.530 
growth phase is the key phase and it
lasts<00:04:46.800> for<00:04:47.070> about<00:04:47.160> two<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.580> six<00:04:48.000> years<00:04:48.210> and

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
lasts for about two to six years and

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.020 
lasts for about two to six years and
it's<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.900> key<00:04:49.110> stage<00:04:49.410> for<00:04:49.919> formation<00:04:50.580> of

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
it's the key stage for formation of

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.120 
it's the key stage for formation of
healthy<00:04:51.840> air<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.320> during<00:04:52.710> this<00:04:52.830> time<00:04:52.890> the

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
healthy air and during this time the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.000 
healthy air and during this time the
metabolism<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:54.150> your<00:04:54.750> hair<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.200> very<00:04:55.260> rapid

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
metabolism of your hair is very rapid

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.460 
metabolism of your hair is very rapid
and<00:04:56.190> very<00:04:56.490> acted<00:04:57.120> i<00:04:57.270> think<00:04:57.539> i<00:04:57.690> am<00:04:57.990> in<00:04:58.260> that

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
and very acted i think i am in that

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.730 
and very acted i think i am in that
stage<00:04:58.800> right<00:04:59.430> now<00:04:59.900> because<00:05:00.900> at<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.440> previous

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
stage right now because at the previous

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.190 
stage right now because at the previous
stage<00:05:01.979> i<00:05:02.160> was<00:05:02.310> in<00:05:02.550> was<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:03.300> resting<00:05:03.690> phase<00:05:03.720> and

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
stage i was in was the resting phase and

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.600 
stage i was in was the resting phase and
i've<00:05:04.289> put<00:05:04.530> much<00:05:04.830> more<00:05:05.010> information<00:05:05.460> down

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
i've put much more information down

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.250 
i've put much more information down
below<00:05:05.640> but<00:05:06.180> this<00:05:06.330> is<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.600> phase<00:05:06.810> where

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
below but this is the phase where

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.490 
below but this is the phase where
basically<00:05:07.740> where<00:05:08.039> two<00:05:08.190> sheds<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:08.900> it's<00:05:09.900> meant

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
basically where two sheds and it's meant

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.890 
basically where two sheds and it's meant
to<00:05:10.650> make<00:05:10.830> way<00:05:11.039> for<00:05:11.070> new<00:05:11.400> hair<00:05:11.910> growth<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.750> yeah

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
to make way for new hair growth so yeah

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.080 
to make way for new hair growth so yeah
i<00:05:12.930> definitely<00:05:13.229> believe<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:13.860> i<00:05:14.039> am<00:05:14.160> in<00:05:14.640> the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
i definitely believe that i am in the

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.360 
i definitely believe that i am in the
grove<00:05:15.750> stage<00:05:16.050> athletes<00:05:16.620> on<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.860> end<00:05:17.039> of<00:05:17.280> the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
grove stage athletes on the end of the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.970 
grove stage athletes on the end of the
gross<00:05:17.550> day

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
gross day

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.210 
gross day
because<00:05:18.370> my<00:05:19.030> new<00:05:19.240> growth<00:05:19.630> is<00:05:19.870> super<00:05:20.770> thick

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
because my new growth is super thick

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.630 
because my new growth is super thick
like<00:05:22.290> it's<00:05:23.290> about<00:05:23.440> one<00:05:23.770> centimeter<00:05:24.010> at<00:05:24.520> the

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
like it's about one centimeter at the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.670 
like it's about one centimeter at the
moment<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.060> I've<00:05:25.180> been<00:05:25.300> noticing<00:05:25.750> this<00:05:26.140> for

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
moment and I've been noticing this for

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.270 
moment and I've been noticing this for
the<00:05:26.920> past<00:05:27.450> few<00:05:28.450> weeks<00:05:28.690> are<00:05:28.870> saying<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.280> it

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
the past few weeks are saying and it

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.010 
the past few weeks are saying and it
feels<00:05:30.580> like<00:05:30.760> the<00:05:30.880> time<00:05:31.090> when<00:05:31.300> I<00:05:31.360> was<00:05:31.450> relaxed

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
feels like the time when I was relaxed

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.220 
feels like the time when I was relaxed
when<00:05:32.200> I<00:05:32.230> used<00:05:32.440> to<00:05:32.590> just<00:05:32.740> feel<00:05:32.950> up<00:05:33.070> my<00:05:33.280> big<00:05:34.230> new

room<00:05:35.440> that's<00:05:35.980> how<00:05:36.190> exact<00:05:36.730> that's<00:05:36.880> exactly<00:05:37.270> how

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
room that's how exact that's exactly how

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.300 
room that's how exact that's exactly how
it<00:05:37.570> feels<00:05:37.600> and<00:05:37.990> did<00:05:38.680> you<00:05:38.800> see<00:05:38.920> that<00:05:39.040> man<00:05:39.280> stand

here that I got in when I wash him my do

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.160 
here that I got in when I wash him my do
10<00:05:41.680> min<00:05:41.860> video<00:05:42.010> that<00:05:42.760> that<00:05:43.120> used<00:05:43.510> to<00:05:43.570> be<00:05:43.660> double

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
10 min video that that used to be double

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.590 
10 min video that that used to be double
or<00:05:44.350> triple<00:05:44.560> that<00:05:44.860> so<00:05:45.250> I<00:05:45.490> noticed<00:05:46.090> that<00:05:46.240> my<00:05:46.360> hair

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
or triple that so I noticed that my hair

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.930 
or triple that so I noticed that my hair
is<00:05:46.630> in<00:05:46.870> a<00:05:46.960> gross<00:05:47.170> stage<00:05:47.470> because<00:05:47.890> my<00:05:48.550> shedding

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
is in a gross stage because my shedding

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.330 
is in a gross stage because my shedding
is<00:05:49.090> left<00:05:49.360> now<00:05:49.510> I'm<00:05:49.870> finally<00:05:50.530> going<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:50.980> have

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
is left now I'm finally going to have

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.600 
is left now I'm finally going to have
the<00:05:51.550> thickness<00:05:51.940> of<00:05:52.060> my<00:05:52.120> mum<00:05:52.510> who<00:05:53.290> does<00:05:54.160> what<00:05:54.340> my

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
the thickness of my mum who does what my

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.030 
the thickness of my mum who does what my
mom<00:05:54.820> has<00:05:55.000> really<00:05:55.390> really<00:05:55.720> thick<00:05:56.050> hair<00:05:56.290> I<00:05:56.500> made

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
mom has really really thick hair I made

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.700 
mom has really really thick hair I made
her<00:05:57.190> go<00:05:57.310> natural<00:05:57.850> and<00:05:58.170> she<00:05:59.170> just<00:05:59.350> kept<00:05:59.590> a

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
her go natural and she just kept a

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.160 
her go natural and she just kept a
really<00:05:59.920> short<00:06:00.160> because<00:06:00.640> if<00:06:01.240> she<00:06:01.540> was<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:01.990> grow

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
really short because if she was to grow

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.960 
really short because if she was to grow
up<00:06:02.200> that<00:06:02.470> hair<00:06:02.680> it'll<00:06:02.980> shorten<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.640> would<00:06:03.790> take

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
up that hair it'll shorten it would take

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.390 
up that hair it'll shorten it would take
so<00:06:04.210> much<00:06:04.330> time<00:06:04.540> like<00:06:04.810> I<00:06:05.020> tried<00:06:05.590> to<00:06:05.770> split<00:06:06.100> the

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
so much time like I tried to split the

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.860 
so much time like I tried to split the
pot<00:06:06.610> her<00:06:06.730> hair<00:06:06.970> and<00:06:07.150> you<00:06:07.270> can't<00:06:07.480> even<00:06:07.510> see<00:06:07.780> her
