00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
and you now have fixed tooling much like

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.810 
and you now have fixed tooling much like

should we put your hand on the nut which

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.709 
should we put your hand on the nut which
is<00:01:30.320> much<00:01:30.469> safer<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.450> obviously<00:01:32.450> it's<00:01:32.570> that

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
is much safer and obviously it's that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:45.249 
is much safer and obviously it's that
bad<00:01:33.789> it<00:01:34.789> comes<00:01:35.030> out<00:01:35.119> relatively<00:01:35.570> easy<00:01:35.810> as<00:01:35.990> well

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
canal you screw it into the back a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.610 
canal you screw it into the back a
little<00:02:22.440> bit<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.680> Loctite<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:25.019> your<00:02:25.260> car<00:02:25.500> light

little bit of Loctite and your car light

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:53.130 
little bit of Loctite and your car light
comes<00:02:25.799> out<00:02:26.840> looking<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.200> ours

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.760 

and<00:02:54.140> again<00:02:54.380> it's<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.800> fast<00:02:59.560> another<00:03:00.560> feature

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
and again it's that fast another feature

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.370 
and again it's that fast another feature
to<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.040> Mach<00:03:01.190> 1<00:03:01.220> system<00:03:01.840> we<00:03:02.840> come<00:03:03.020> to<00:03:03.140> doing

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
to the Mach 1 system we come to doing

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.370 
to the Mach 1 system we come to doing
larger<00:03:04.310> end<00:03:04.730> mills<00:03:05.030> from<00:03:05.810> pre<00:03:06.050> quarter<00:03:06.320> an

larger end mills from pre quarter an

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.200 
larger end mills from pre quarter an
applicator<00:03:06.740> we've<00:03:07.490> actually<00:03:07.670> applied<00:03:07.850> a

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
applicator we've actually applied a

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
applicator we've actually applied a
collar<00:03:08.480> clamp<00:03:08.810> directly<00:03:09.380> for<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.400> envelope

collar clamp directly for the envelope

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.500 
collar clamp directly for the envelope
what<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:12.410> does<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.400> allows<00:03:13.520> you<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:14.300> close

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
what this does is it allows you to close

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.870 
what this does is it allows you to close
that<00:03:14.750> on<00:03:14.990> the<00:03:15.140> nose<00:03:15.320> of<00:03:15.590> your<00:03:15.800> spindle<00:03:18.670> goes<00:03:19.670> in
