00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:14.199
 My name is Evgeny Green This video 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.930
 caste is dedicated to the question why any 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:19.210
 a person can develop their energy 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.829
 Many think that this is fantastic either there 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.759
 beyond any possibilities 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:27.070
 which are given the birth of nothing like 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:31.000
 just like we can develop our 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.219
 muscles though gym and doing regular 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.379
 some kind of physical exercise just as well 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.309
 you can and shake your energy 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.949
 field more precisely even fields because 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.589
 we are a kind of holistic 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.050
 system and this system adapts 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.809
 always under ambient condition while 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.229
 if we take the example on the muscles but because 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.469
 everyone knows that they have you have 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:58.059
 accordingly, if a person has 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.129
 some kind of physical exercise 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.679
 either he needs to carry something there 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.580
 carry on and so forth then muscles 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.200
 start to grow if there is no 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.390
 there is a need here it does not arise 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.820
 life naturally all muscles will be 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.310
 persist at a certain level for 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.100
 order to drop out only those tasks 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.690
 which he performs every day if 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.490
 need some big 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.710
 exercise then muscle 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.910
 accordingly, do not begin to grow as well 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.580
 adapt to 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.440
 environmental conditions are the same 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.770
 happens and with the energy system 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.870
 man that is every moment of time 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.840
 we constantly produce energy but 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.280
 This energy is usually a man who 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.430
 does not deal with development issues 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.680
 energy here is enough energy only 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.660
 to keep my current 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.820
 condition maintain its current 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.920
 life no extra there 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.430
 any skills ability abilities 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.910
 I personally go no everything will go to 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.810
 feed this moving object 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.690
 which performs certain functions 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:08.099
 all if the same person give the same 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:11.019
 methodically evenly gradually load 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.269
 energy plan, then the development begins 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.670
 grow more more more more more and 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.890
 more that is, it starts a different one 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.209
 performs the task 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.920
 what is there well besides for myself so let's say 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.330
 generating energy for others either 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.120
 there for some other tasks 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.010
 Accordingly, energy more and more 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.840
 more more more worked out 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.240
 but then still comes this 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.610
 moment when just pumping up 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.830
 the amount of energy is already becoming simple 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.310
 meaningless and have nowhere in such just 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.920
 volumes to spend accordingly here 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.590
 so it is clear that ordinary people field 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.050
 rather weak stagnant 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.050
 you can still break it
