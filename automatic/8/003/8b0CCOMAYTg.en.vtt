cases is always beautiful even with the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.490 
cases is always beautiful even with the
case<00:01:19.170> such<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.710> which<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> only<00:01:21.290> $99.95<00:01:22.290> I

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
case such as this which is only $99.95 I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.899 
case such as this which is only $99.95 I
say<00:01:22.950> only<00:01:23.159> because<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.729> actually

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
say only because it's actually

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.420

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
case was and as you can see the case

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.649 
case was and as you can see the case
isn't<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:29.790> we'll<00:01:29.909> come<00:01:30.060> back<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
isn't here we'll come back to that and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.530 
isn't here we'll come back to that and
why<00:01:31.170> that's<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.619> case<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.100> moment<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
why that's the case in a moment when you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.530 
why that's the case in a moment when you
take<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.900> out<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.350> get<00:01:34.530> inside<00:01:35.540> an

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
take this out you get inside an

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.420 
take this out you get inside an
instruction<00:01:37.170> manual<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.740> actually<00:01:38.100> getting

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
instruction manual for actually getting

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.840 
instruction manual for actually getting
the<00:01:38.610> case<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.930> phone<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.990> get<00:01:43.200> the

off and of course you get two extra

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.149 
off and of course you get two extra
screws<00:01:51.270> because<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.229> easy<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> lose<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
screws because it's easy to lose the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.530 
screws because it's easy to lose the
screws<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.670> come<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.119> there<00:01:54.329> little

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
screws that come with this there little

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.260 
screws that come with this there little
tiny<00:01:54.869> screws<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.130> reason<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> case<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.149> not

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
tiny screws the reason the case is not

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.300 
tiny screws the reason the case is not
in<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.540> box<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.869> for<00:01:58.200> once<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.829> actually

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
in the box is that for once I actually

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.280 
in the box is that for once I actually
couldn't<00:01:59.729> wait<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.090> get<00:02:00.180> my<00:02:00.299> hands<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.719> the
