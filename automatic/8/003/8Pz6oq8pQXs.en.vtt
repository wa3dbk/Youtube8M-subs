of concern was some people said there
may<00:03:22.129> be<00:03:22.159> problems<00:03:22.549> with<00:03:22.879> the<00:03:23.120> cable<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.720> goes

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
may be problems with the cable that goes

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.849 
may be problems with the cable that goes
between<00:03:24.639> the<00:03:26.079> earpiece<00:03:27.079> that<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.500> cable

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
between the earpiece that the cable

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.759 
between the earpiece that the cable
enters<00:03:28.190> on<00:03:28.430> over<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.180> other<00:03:29.269> side

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
enters on over to the other side

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.240 
enters on over to the other side
I<00:03:30.799> took<00:03:31.250> them<00:03:31.609> apart<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.120> little<00:03:32.239> bit<00:03:32.479> and<00:03:33.250> found

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
I took them apart a little bit and found

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.699 
I took them apart a little bit and found
that<00:03:34.609> there's<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:37.000> not<00:03:38.000> very<00:03:38.389> much<00:03:38.659> space<00:03:39.079> the

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
that there's a a not very much space the

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.270 
that there's a a not very much space the
cable<00:03:40.099> is<00:03:40.280> up<00:03:40.549> here<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:42.620> there's<00:03:43.040> not<00:03:43.220> very

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
cable is up here and there's not very

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.270 
cable is up here and there's not very
much<00:03:43.699> space<00:03:44.060> when<00:03:44.329> you<00:03:44.449> compress<00:03:44.989> this<00:03:45.349> band

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
much space when you compress this band

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.430 
much space when you compress this band
all<00:03:46.699> the<00:03:46.849> way<00:03:46.970> in<00:03:47.389> for<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.500> cable<00:03:48.979> to<00:03:50.169> live<00:03:51.169> in

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
all the way in for the cable to live in

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.789 
all the way in for the cable to live in
and<00:03:51.650> so<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:53.060> would<00:03:53.629> suggest<00:03:53.780> if<00:03:54.290> when<00:03:54.620> you're

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
and so I would suggest if when you're

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.580 
and so I would suggest if when you're
packing<00:03:55.639> these<00:03:55.970> cans<00:03:56.299> up<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.690> not<00:03:56.959> compress

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
packing these cans up to not compress

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.199 
packing these cans up to not compress
the<00:03:57.769> headband<00:03:58.159> all<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.519> way<00:03:58.639> and<00:03:58.819> that<00:03:58.970> should

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
the headband all the way and that should

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.379 
the headband all the way and that should
save<00:03:59.930> cable<00:04:00.919> life

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
save cable life

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.689 
save cable life
they<00:04:02.720> didn't<00:04:03.049> appear<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.409> be<00:04:03.439> poorly<00:04:04.069> built<00:04:04.459> it

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
they didn't appear to be poorly built it

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.339 
they didn't appear to be poorly built it
just<00:04:04.729> does<00:04:05.329> appear<00:04:05.689> that<00:04:05.720> there's<00:04:06.109> not<00:04:06.319> very

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
just does appear that there's not very

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.949 
just does appear that there's not very
much<00:04:06.769> room<00:04:06.829> up<00:04:07.280> there<00:04:07.430> for<00:04:07.699> the<00:04:07.819> cable<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:08.720> be

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
much room up there for the cable to be

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.749 
much room up there for the cable to be
when<00:04:09.229> the<00:04:09.409> headband<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.489> fully<00:04:10.729> closed

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:12.759 
when the headband is fully closed

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.520 
when the headband is fully closed
comfort<00:04:13.759> is<00:04:13.909> fairly<00:04:14.269> good<00:04:14.419> the<00:04:14.989> headphone

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
comfort is fairly good the headphone

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.960 
comfort is fairly good the headphone
cups<00:04:15.859> are<00:04:16.099> not<00:04:16.370> too<00:04:16.849> deep<00:04:18.070> they're<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.370> little

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
cups are not too deep they're a little

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.480 
cups are not too deep they're a little
bit<00:04:20.209> small<00:04:20.599> and<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:21.500> think<00:04:21.590> if<00:04:22.009> you<00:04:22.099> have<00:04:22.250> very

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
bit small and I think if you have very

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.670 
bit small and I think if you have very
large<00:04:22.729> ears<00:04:23.150> or<00:04:23.539> your<00:04:23.840> ear<00:04:24.020> stick<00:04:24.260> out<00:04:24.409> a<00:04:24.440> lot

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
large ears or your ear stick out a lot

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.080 
large ears or your ear stick out a lot
you<00:04:24.710> might<00:04:24.950> have<00:04:25.130> some<00:04:25.279> problems<00:04:25.700> with<00:04:25.969> these

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
you might have some problems with these

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.290 
you might have some problems with these
headphones<00:04:26.360> they<00:04:26.930> do<00:04:26.990> feel<00:04:27.380> a<00:04:27.409> little<00:04:27.860> bit

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
headphones they do feel a little bit

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.029 
headphones they do feel a little bit
when<00:04:28.690> you're<00:04:28.780> wearing<00:04:28.960> them<00:04:29.199> but<00:04:29.710> just<00:04:29.919> a

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
when you're wearing them but just a

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.249 
when you're wearing them but just a
little<00:04:30.160> overall<00:04:31.090> they're<00:04:31.389> they're<00:04:31.870> quite

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
little overall they're they're quite

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.850 
little overall they're they're quite
comfortable<00:04:33.660> so<00:04:34.660> on<00:04:34.870> balance<00:04:35.349> I<00:04:35.530> think<00:04:35.560> these

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
comfortable so on balance I think these

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.909 
comfortable so on balance I think these
are<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:36.160> good-looking<00:04:37.120> pair<00:04:37.270> of<00:04:37.419> headphones

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
are a good-looking pair of headphones
