00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
hi everyone today I'm going to talk to

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.139 
hi everyone today I'm going to talk to
you<00:00:01.469> guys<00:00:01.620> about<00:00:01.829> shapes<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:03.090> to

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
you guys about shapes and how to

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.059 
you guys about shapes and how to
determine<00:00:03.330> which<00:00:04.020> one<00:00:04.230> you<00:00:04.380> have<00:00:04.410> because

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
determine which one you have because

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.039 
determine which one you have because
obviously<00:00:05.250> there<00:00:05.670> are<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.420> many<00:00:06.600> different

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
obviously there are so many different

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.720 
obviously there are so many different
types<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.589> thought<00:00:07.950> I'd<00:00:08.099> do<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> video<00:00:08.490> about

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
types so I thought I'd do a video about

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.240 
types so I thought I'd do a video about
it<00:00:09.150> especially<00:00:09.269> since<00:00:09.870> my<00:00:10.170> previous<00:00:10.980> video

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
it especially since my previous video

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.190 
it especially since my previous video
which<00:00:11.429> was<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.880> kind<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.509> hard<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.780> determine

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
which was on kind of hard to determine

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.110 
which was on kind of hard to determine
your<00:00:13.290> face<00:00:13.620> shape<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.040> was<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.400> popular<00:00:14.610> and

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
your face shape that was so popular and

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.060 
your face shape that was so popular and
I<00:00:15.450> thought<00:00:16.080> you'll<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.260> appropriate<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.949> do

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
I thought you'll be appropriate to do

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.560 
I thought you'll be appropriate to do
this<00:00:17.310> one<00:00:17.550> I'm<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:17.970> gonna<00:00:18.210> tell<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.539> guys

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
this one I'm just gonna tell you guys

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.810 
this one I'm just gonna tell you guys
what<00:00:19.470> different<00:00:19.800> eye<00:00:19.890> shapes<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.369> right<00:00:20.550> how

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
what different eye shapes the right how

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.340 
what different eye shapes the right how
to<00:00:20.880> determine<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.080> have

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
to determine which one you have

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.950 
to determine which one you have
and<00:00:22.800> what<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.039> makeup<00:00:23.699> goes<00:00:24.000> best<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.570> what<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
and what of makeup goes best with what I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.960 
and what of makeup goes best with what I
shaped<00:00:25.380> I'm<00:00:25.680> gonna<00:00:25.830> start<00:00:26.099> with<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.580> almond

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
shaped I'm gonna start with the almond

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.580 
shaped I'm gonna start with the almond
shape<00:00:27.180> which<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.449> probably<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> most<00:00:28.199> popular

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
shape which is probably the most popular

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.220 
shape which is probably the most popular
and<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.250> most<00:00:29.279> well-known<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:30.960> most

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and the most well-known I think most

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.930 
and the most well-known I think most
people<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.890> type<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> eye<00:00:32.369> shape<00:00:32.700> but

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
people have this type of eye shape but

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.240 
people have this type of eye shape but
because<00:00:33.300> kind<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.079> classic<00:00:34.530> shape

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
because kind of just the classic shape

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.889 
because kind of just the classic shape
it's<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.030> kind<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.360> little<00:00:36.540> bit<00:00:36.719> uptight

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
it's just kind of a little bit uptight

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.110 
it's just kind of a little bit uptight
in<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> corners<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.070> apart<00:00:38.370> from<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.610> it's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
in the corners but apart from that it's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.880 
in the corners but apart from that it's
just<00:00:39.360> kind<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:39.690> standard<00:00:40.200> eye<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.829> I

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
just kind of your standard eye and I

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.470 
just kind of your standard eye and I
think<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.790> lot<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.149> people

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
think because of that a lot of people

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.970 
think because of that a lot of people
don't<00:00:42.600> realize<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.829> an

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
don't realize that they do have an

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.380 
don't realize that they do have an
almond<00:00:44.250> shape<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.610> mean<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.940> probably<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
almond shape I mean this is probably the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.000 
almond shape I mean this is probably the
best<00:00:45.539> eye<00:00:45.780> shape<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.200> terms<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.590> makeup<00:00:46.980> you

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
best eye shape in terms of makeup you

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.100 
best eye shape in terms of makeup you
can<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.340> away<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.910> anything<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.899> do

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
can get away with anything but if you do

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.810 
can get away with anything but if you do
find<00:00:49.320> yourself<00:00:49.440> having<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.340> really

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
find yourself having like really

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.330 
find yourself having like really
strongly<00:00:51.600> upturned<00:00:52.289> eyes<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> corners<00:00:53.219> so

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
strongly upturned eyes in the corners so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.439 
strongly upturned eyes in the corners so
the<00:00:53.489> best<00:00:53.640> thing<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.030> would<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.329> just

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the best thing to do would be to just

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.990 
the best thing to do would be to just
apply<00:00:54.989> some<00:00:55.020> eyeshadow<00:00:55.530> or<00:00:56.070> some<00:00:56.309> eyeliner<00:00:56.730> in

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
apply some eyeshadow or some eyeliner in

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.930 
apply some eyeshadow or some eyeliner in
the<00:00:57.030> outer<00:00:57.390> bottom<00:00:58.109> corners<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.460> make<00:00:59.640> sense

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the outer bottom corners that make sense

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
the outer bottom corners that make sense
the<00:01:00.480> eye<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.170> kind<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:02.489> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the eye so just kind of here because I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.860 
the eye so just kind of here because I
just<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.420> want<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.600> bring<00:01:03.809> that

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
just think you do you want to bring that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.990 
just think you do you want to bring that
down<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.890> make<00:01:05.100> your<00:01:05.280> eyes<00:01:05.430> seem<00:01:05.760> as

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
down and not make your eyes seem as

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.450 
down and not make your eyes seem as
upturned<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> corners<00:01:07.140> bur<00:01:07.380> mean<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
upturned and the corners bur mean if you

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
upturned and the corners bur mean if you
don't<00:01:08.580> find<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.330> crazy<00:01:09.900> upturned<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
don't find that it's crazy upturned you

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.960 
don't find that it's crazy upturned you
don't<00:01:10.950> need<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.250> worry<00:01:11.430> about<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.820> but

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
don't need to worry about it but

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.149 
don't need to worry about it but
obviously<00:01:12.450> doing<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.960> cat<00:01:13.170> eye<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.710> gonna<00:01:13.950> bring

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
obviously doing a cat eye is gonna bring

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.670 
obviously doing a cat eye is gonna bring
that<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.460> even<00:01:14.790> more<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.390> try<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.200> stay<00:01:16.380> away

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.080 
that out even more so try and stay away
from<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.549> kind<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.909> classic

degree<00:01:47.070> angle<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:48.119> otherwise<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:49.170> might

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
degree angle because otherwise it might

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.230 
degree angle because otherwise it might
look<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> bit<00:01:49.860> weird<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.520> wonky<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.060> next

look a bit weird and wonky so next

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.179 
look a bit weird and wonky so next
there's<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.840> closer<00:01:52.259> eye<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.979> eyes

really defined crease say with face you
always<00:03:13.599> leave<00:03:13.840> don't<00:03:14.109> really<00:03:14.470> want<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.680> define

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
always leave don't really want to define

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.280 
always leave don't really want to define
it<00:03:15.220> even<00:03:15.549> more<00:03:15.790> an<00:03:16.000> easy<00:03:16.269> way<00:03:16.479> to<00:03:16.510> hide<00:03:17.019> this

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
it even more an easy way to hide this

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.960 
it even more an easy way to hide this
and<00:03:17.349> make<00:03:17.709> your<00:03:17.889> eyes<00:03:17.919> look<00:03:18.129> not<00:03:18.790> as

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
and make your eyes look not as

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.420 
and make your eyes look not as
protruding<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.139> just<00:03:20.349> put<00:03:20.590> some<00:03:21.099> darker

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
protruding is so just put some darker

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.460 
protruding is so just put some darker
eyeshadow<00:03:21.879> all<00:03:22.209> over<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.510> lid<00:03:22.599> and<00:03:22.989> not<00:03:23.229> just

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
eyeshadow all over the lid and not just

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.080 
eyeshadow all over the lid and not just
in<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.769> crease<00:03:24.010> because<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.639> obviously

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
in the crease because that obviously

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.509 
in the crease because that obviously
will<00:03:25.329> kind<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.540> counteract<00:03:26.169> the<00:03:26.799> deep<00:03:27.040> inside

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
will kind of counteract the deep inside

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.699 
will kind of counteract the deep inside
eyes<00:03:27.699> and<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.090> shadow<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.720> make<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.139> look<00:03:29.319> not

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
eyes and the shadow and make it look not

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.229 
eyes and the shadow and make it look not
as<00:03:30.010> full<00:03:30.340> weight<00:03:30.489> if<00:03:30.639> that<00:03:30.790> makes<00:03:30.970> any<00:03:31.090> sense

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
as full weight if that makes any sense

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.270 
as full weight if that makes any sense
so<00:03:31.599> just<00:03:31.930> kind<00:03:32.079> of<00:03:32.139> put<00:03:32.379> darker<00:03:32.799> eye<00:03:32.919> shadows

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
so just kind of put darker eye shadows

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.009 
so just kind of put darker eye shadows
all<00:03:33.549> over<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.909> lid<00:03:34.030> next<00:03:34.389> we<00:03:34.599> have<00:03:34.780> hooded

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
because always see the skin kind of sags

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.039 
because always see the skin kind of sags
down<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:48.220> makes<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.209> look<00:03:49.329> like<00:03:49.389> it's<00:03:49.689> hit<00:03:49.870> it

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
down and makes it look like it's hit it

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.899 
down and makes it look like it's hit it
even<00:03:50.709> though<00:03:50.889> earlier<00:03:51.459> when<00:03:51.669> they<00:03:51.790> were

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
even though earlier when they were

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.759 
even though earlier when they were
younger<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.449> wasn't<00:03:52.659> like<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:53.379> an<00:03:53.530> easy

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
younger it wasn't like that so an easy

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.849 
younger it wasn't like that so an easy
way<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.069> hide<00:03:54.639> that<00:03:54.970> well<00:03:55.419> not<00:03:56.139> hide<00:03:56.439> it<00:03:56.680> but

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
way to hide that well not hide it but

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.280 
way to hide that well not hide it but
just<00:03:57.069> kind<00:03:57.280> of<00:03:57.340> go<00:03:57.489> against<00:03:57.939> that<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.389> to<00:03:59.019> blend

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
just kind of go against that is to blend

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.809 
just kind of go against that is to blend
the<00:03:59.409> crease<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.889> little<00:03:59.919> bit<00:04:00.250> higher<00:04:00.519> up<00:04:00.790> so

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
the crease a little bit higher up so

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.539 
the crease a little bit higher up so
don't<00:04:01.299> just<00:04:01.569> stay<00:04:01.959> in<00:04:02.379> the<00:04:02.739> crease<00:04:03.009> just<00:04:03.040> blend

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
don't just stay in the crease just blend

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.069 
don't just stay in the crease just blend
it<00:04:03.729> a<00:04:03.759> little<00:04:03.970> bit<00:04:04.090> upwards<00:04:04.509> and<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:04.930> will

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
it a little bit upwards and that will

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.990 
it a little bit upwards and that will
obviously<00:04:05.319> create<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.949> illusion<00:04:06.189> of<00:04:06.669> your

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
obviously create the illusion of your

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.819 
obviously create the illusion of your
eyes<00:04:07.150> not<00:04:07.479> being<00:04:07.689> at<00:04:07.930> hedges<00:04:08.319> it<00:04:08.530> can<00:04:08.680> also

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
eyes not being at hedges it can also

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.589 
eyes not being at hedges it can also
help<00:04:09.069> to<00:04:09.159> wear<00:04:09.400> fake<00:04:09.669> eyelashes<00:04:10.209> or<00:04:10.419> just

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
help to wear fake eyelashes or just

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.449 
help to wear fake eyelashes or just
loads<00:04:10.870> on<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:11.079> scar<00:04:11.409> because<00:04:11.799> obviously<00:04:11.979> if

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
loads on the scar because obviously if

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.210 
loads on the scar because obviously if
they<00:04:12.699> go<00:04:12.939> past<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:14.049> kind<00:04:14.259> of<00:04:14.349> hit<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.650> bit<00:04:14.919> then

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
they go past the kind of hit it bit then

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.009 
they go past the kind of hit it bit then
it<00:04:15.400> does<00:04:15.639> open<00:04:15.939> your<00:04:16.239> eyes<00:04:16.389> a<00:04:16.419> little<00:04:16.750> bit<00:04:16.900> more

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
and make them look not

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.830

and<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.370> little<00:04:19.519> bit<00:04:19.669> more<00:04:19.849> open<00:04:20.209> next<00:04:20.629> we<00:04:20.689> have

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
and a little bit more open next we have

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.659 
and a little bit more open next we have
the<00:04:21.019> monolid<00:04:21.500> which<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:21.949> really<00:04:22.250> common<00:04:22.490> in

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
the monolid which is really common in

the monolid which is really common in
Asian<00:04:23.449> women<00:04:23.629> because<00:04:24.139> obviously<00:04:24.349> they<00:04:24.770> don't

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
Asian women because obviously they don't

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.760 
Asian women because obviously they don't
have<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:25.639> really<00:04:25.939> defined<00:04:26.330> crease<00:04:26.659> and<00:04:27.020> the

have that really defined crease and the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.860 
have that really defined crease and the
way<00:04:27.949> to<00:04:28.009> really<00:04:28.430> can't<00:04:28.699> write<00:04:28.969> that<00:04:29.270> and<00:04:29.569> go

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
way to really can't write that and go

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.540 
way to really can't write that and go
against<00:04:30.319> that<00:04:30.379> and<00:04:30.740> make<00:04:30.949> it<00:04:30.979> look<00:04:31.250> like<00:04:31.310> you

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
against that and make it look like you
