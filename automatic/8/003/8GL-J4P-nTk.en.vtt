00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 we proceed directly to the layout 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.160
 before starting the coding we need to create 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.340
 such a structure 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:16.310
 daddy with c we will contain 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:21.529
 File is grit with styles 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:24.859
 framework 9 60 grid reset the file 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.010
 reset style and file style 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:33.510
 he is still clean debut contained ours 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.440
 own style sticks m all 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.129
 harvested 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.079
 previously, we are the only image 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.360
 added a couple image 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.059
 first images for slider and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.510
 Secondly 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.760
 added some more elements to the sprite 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:57.300
 there are elements that we use 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.190
 for the carousel and for the slider but I thought 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.829
 do it for the benefit but then found 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.030
 solution for 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:11.780
 our sliders for our effort decision 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.299
 called james is famous and looks 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.479
 something like this without style 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.210
 just the original version is for 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:26.330
 slider here so be 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:32.060
 Let us be used for whom 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.789
 initially copy javascript files from 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.729
 I have here our slider 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:42.950
 contains a java script file which 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:46.069
 makes us block elements those 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.610
 items that came to us with things 5 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:53.869
 for older browsers including more 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:59.440
 new there interns from tori in general well 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.440
 and here I add our polyak 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.080
 here I will call something like this 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.910
 so the door go text or yes so and 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.950
 that 's what mine looks like 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:27.000
 an index file of this kind of stub 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:32.590
 but this set another file with scripts 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.210
 ammo will be used for our 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.210
 carousel for our slider 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:49.090
 let's look at this pro called 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.090
 renowned personally saved 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.170
 let's get started you see our 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:01.990
 scripts and offer an approach which is at the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:07.480
 we are in the script demonstration files 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:16.319
 just copy to where 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:22.350
 it is necessary in the css file so this is the first I was 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.350
 slider now carousel 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.810
 done alignment remove excess 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:44.370
 comments here can be shared with 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.370
 reasonable block we will have a carousel 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.319
 so completely forgotten style 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.379
 for slider 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.110
 now let's copy it means to have 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.710
 The code for the slider immediately say that 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.710
 platoon 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.010
 slider 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.360
 further copy the carousel code 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:06.150
 decree where they call this end 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:08.300
 blocks and now let's get the java script 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.300
 file 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.840
 made a call for these things 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.390
 so create a separate file saving 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.390
 under the smoky script 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.660
 jess is here 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.670
 make designs for jack faith 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:59.110
 and so willing scripts of the same measles 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:06:09.339
 now copying the challenge for the carousel and for 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:12.550
 slider saving here save 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:16.119
 let's see what happened so on 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.489
 here still need to copy for example this 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:26.050
 line 

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:29.459
 where it loads the jack in the combo 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.459
 libraries 1 of 7 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.429
 so plus besides 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:53.909
 - duplicate another line where he 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:56.129
 our script file will be called so 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:07:00.270
 if we see for now we donâ€™t 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:04.020
 our carousel is displayed correctly 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:07.129
 let's poprad driven by styles to us 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:11.250
 for our reason therefore you need to register 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:14.419
 additional selector from here we copy 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:18.469
 insert it will change 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:20.930
 go to the browser update and see that 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:23.900
 Now to you, Syria is working normally. 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:26.520
 the slider also works fine 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:31.379
 back and everything else you can also 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:33.659
 select your java script separate 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:35.669
 blocks where is this call 

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:38.279
 separately slider and carousel to be 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.439
 were by so us too here 

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:43.879
 I finish the preparatory work and 

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:43.879
 see you in the next lesson
