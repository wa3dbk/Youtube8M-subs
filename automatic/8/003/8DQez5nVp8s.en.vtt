 Apn is set for pre-mobile This kind of feeling is set like this 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:47.180
 It seems like I was able to make settings because I was able to 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.060
 Then and then start the softbank ne of the Mail version 2.5 ever 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.810
 Help has already been installed to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.750
 Well, what do you do when you start this kind of screen comes out at the start outside the site, but this is 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:02.180
 Received Oshima such feeling This is the initial screen is so So first check for new mail 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.970

 There is no message of the 3g Economist arrow on the top and there is no message 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.630
 I was able to confirm the new mail without problems 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:19.110
 By the way, I'm in a state where this wi-fi is turned on now , but something 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.910
 The wi-fi's stable marker is a bit obscure but wi-fi is on 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.960
 As it is 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.600
 3g example can communicate 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.420
 I was able to confirm the new arrival of mail to me. Confirm the setting of wi-fi just for the moment. 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.830
 I'll leave it for some reason why what became op 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.860
 Why To wi-fi is freely off after the setting of the apn in earlier Tsuika

 I need to install it, but I have already installed it. 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.099
 Then it looks like this 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.330
 Then I will try to check the new mail as a little case. 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.140
