this<00:00:01.810> is<00:00:02.020> part<00:00:02.320> for<00:00:02.769> my<00:00:03.489> to<00:00:03.850> me<00:00:03.999> athe

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:04.990 
this is part for my to me athe

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.850 
this is part for my to me athe
conversion<00:00:05.649> to<00:00:05.919> a<00:00:05.950> Tamiya<00:00:06.430> top<00:00:06.759> force<00:00:07.060> chassis

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:07.860 
conversion to a Tamiya top force chassis

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.580 
conversion to a Tamiya top force chassis
so<00:00:08.860> I<00:00:09.160> just<00:00:10.030> finished<00:00:10.290> putting<00:00:11.290> everything

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
so I just finished putting everything

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.490 
so I just finished putting everything
together<00:00:11.860> I<00:00:12.130> took<00:00:12.460> it<00:00:12.580> out<00:00:12.670> for<00:00:13.060> a<00:00:13.360> test<00:00:13.750> run

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
together I took it out for a test run

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.670 
together I took it out for a test run
and<00:00:15.299> outside<00:00:16.299> of<00:00:16.330> racing<00:00:16.900> I<00:00:17.080> have<00:00:17.260> to<00:00:17.380> say<00:00:17.530> this

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
and outside of racing I have to say this

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.310 
and outside of racing I have to say this
is<00:00:17.830> probably<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:19.300> most<00:00:19.450> fun<00:00:19.720> I've<00:00:19.780> had<00:00:19.930> with

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
is probably the most fun I've had with

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.090 
is probably the most fun I've had with
an<00:00:20.410> RC<00:00:20.710> car<00:00:20.740> in<00:00:21.190> quite<00:00:21.640> a<00:00:21.670> long<00:00:21.850> time<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.590> a<00:00:23.619> few

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
an RC car in quite a long time so a few

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.740 
an RC car in quite a long time so a few
comments<00:00:24.310> first<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:26.250> steering<00:00:27.390> system<00:00:28.390> that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
comments first the steering system that

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.689 
comments first the steering system that
I<00:00:28.840> got<00:00:29.020> it<00:00:29.230> has<00:00:29.410> a<00:00:29.440> little<00:00:29.830> bit<00:00:30.100> of<00:00:30.190> slop<00:00:30.430> I

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
I got it has a little bit of slop I

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.840 
I got it has a little bit of slop I
think<00:00:30.940> maybe<00:00:31.379> I<00:00:32.379> need<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.829> size<00:00:33.249> up<00:00:33.429> on<00:00:33.579> the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
think maybe I need to size up on the

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.770 
think maybe I need to size up on the
bearings<00:00:34.179> a<00:00:34.210> little<00:00:34.449> bit<00:00:34.569> there's<00:00:34.719> a<00:00:34.749> little

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
bearings a little bit there's a little

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.439 
bearings a little bit there's a little
play<00:00:35.170> between<00:00:35.589> the<00:00:35.710> housing<00:00:36.460> here<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:36.909> the

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
play between the housing here and the

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.979 
play between the housing here and the
bearings<00:00:37.780> themselves<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:39.129> especially<00:00:39.489> on<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
bearings themselves so especially on the

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.959 
bearings themselves so especially on the
right<00:00:41.170> hand<00:00:41.469> side<00:00:41.559> wheel<00:00:41.949> there's<00:00:42.699> a<00:00:42.760> fair

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
right hand side wheel there's a fair

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.930 
right hand side wheel there's a fair
amount<00:00:43.059> of<00:00:43.210> slop<00:00:43.539> so<00:00:44.409> I<00:00:44.769> have<00:00:45.100> to<00:00:45.219> work<00:00:45.339> on<00:00:45.519> that

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
amount of slop so I have to work on that

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.759 
amount of slop so I have to work on that
maybe<00:00:46.329> that's<00:00:46.600> permanent<00:00:47.379> maybe<00:00:47.499> it's<00:00:47.649> not

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
maybe that's permanent maybe it's not

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.520 
maybe that's permanent maybe it's not
we'll<00:00:47.949> see<00:00:47.979> how<00:00:48.129> much<00:00:48.249> I<00:00:48.399> can<00:00:48.550> take<00:00:48.699> out<00:00:49.530> for

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
we'll see how much I can take out for

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.750 
we'll see how much I can take out for
the<00:00:50.589> shocks<00:00:50.889> I<00:00:51.309> just<00:00:51.760> want<00:00:51.909> to<00:00:51.969> mention<00:00:52.089> I<00:00:52.899> used

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the shocks I just want to mention I used

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.430 
the shocks I just want to mention I used
15<00:00:54.760> millimeters<00:00:55.210> spacing<00:00:55.719> on<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.199> front

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
15 millimeters spacing on the front

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.410 
15 millimeters spacing on the front
shock<00:00:56.679> collar<00:00:56.949> and<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.519> 13<00:00:57.879> millimeter<00:00:58.030> spacing

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
shock collar and a 13 millimeter spacing

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.779 
shock collar and a 13 millimeter spacing
on<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.959> rear<00:00:59.199> because<00:00:59.769> in<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.129> stock<00:01:00.370> setting

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
on the rear because in the stock setting

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.419 
on the rear because in the stock setting
it's<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.269> little<00:01:01.870> too<00:01:02.049> soft<00:01:02.409> so<00:01:02.649> I<00:01:02.769> just<00:01:03.010> tried

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
it's a little too soft so I just tried

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.120 
it's a little too soft so I just tried
to<00:01:03.459> stiffen<00:01:03.879> it<00:01:03.999> up<00:01:04.059> a<00:01:04.180> little<00:01:04.329> bit<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.979> other

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
to stiffen it up a little bit the other

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.569 
to stiffen it up a little bit the other
thing<00:01:06.369> is<00:01:06.549> when<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:06.880> took<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.299> out<00:01:07.420> for<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.869> run

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
thing is when I took it out for a run

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.520 
thing is when I took it out for a run
one<00:01:09.579> of<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.729> top<00:01:09.939> screws<00:01:10.270> here<00:01:10.600> came<00:01:11.049> out<00:01:11.289> and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
one of the top screws here came out and

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.120 
one of the top screws here came out and
the<00:01:11.829> other<00:01:11.979> one<00:01:12.039> is<00:01:12.310> loose<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.740> thing<00:01:14.979> is

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
the other one is loose and the thing is

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.109 
the other one is loose and the thing is
on<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.369> bottom<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.200> screw<00:01:17.740> into<00:01:18.119> this

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
on the bottom here you screw into this

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.760 
on the bottom here you screw into this
kind<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.600> nut<00:01:19.810> if<00:01:20.020> you're<00:01:20.320> familiar<00:01:20.500> with

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
kind of a nut if you're familiar with

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.410 
kind of a nut if you're familiar with
Tamiya<00:01:21.100> chassis<00:01:21.399> you<00:01:21.609> may<00:01:21.820> be<00:01:21.880> familiar<00:01:22.119> with

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
Tamiya chassis you may be familiar with

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.660 
Tamiya chassis you may be familiar with
this<00:01:22.570> type<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.840> nut<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:23.320> not<00:01:23.799> a<00:01:23.829> lock<00:01:24.189> nut<00:01:24.219> it's

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
this type of nut is not a lock nut it's

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.660 
this type of nut is not a lock nut it's
just<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.909> standard<00:01:25.299> nut<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:27.070> didn't<00:01:27.430> use<00:01:27.520> any

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
just a standard nut and I didn't use any

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.010 
just a standard nut and I didn't use any
thread<00:01:27.969> lock<00:01:28.149> or<00:01:28.329> anything<00:01:28.509> because<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.840> want

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
thread lock or anything because I want

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.319 
thread lock or anything because I want
to<00:01:29.079> be<00:01:29.170> able<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.380> take<00:01:30.340> this<00:01:30.490> off<00:01:30.700> if<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.000> need<00:01:31.030> to

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
to be able to take this off if I need to

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.969 
to be able to take this off if I need to
so<00:01:32.320> these<00:01:32.920> do<00:01:33.189> come<00:01:33.219> loose<00:01:33.719> fairly<00:01:34.719> easily<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
so these do come loose fairly easily so

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.230 
so these do come loose fairly easily so
I<00:01:36.009> just<00:01:36.219> have<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.460> figure<00:01:36.609> out<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:36.820> maybe<00:01:37.179> a

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
I just have to figure out a maybe a

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.940 
I just have to figure out a maybe a
better<00:01:37.450> way<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.780> fastening<00:01:38.259> the<00:01:38.469> back<00:01:38.649> part<00:01:38.920> of

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
better way of fastening the back part of

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.709 
better way of fastening the back part of
this<00:01:39.070> top<00:01:39.310> plate<00:01:39.490> on<00:01:39.789> to<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.920> chassis<00:01:42.159> but

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
this top plate on to the chassis but

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.899 
this top plate on to the chassis but
otherwise<00:01:43.719> it<00:01:43.899> held<00:01:44.020> together<00:01:44.109> really<00:01:44.530> well

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
otherwise it held together really well

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.120 
otherwise it held together really well
oh<00:01:46.140> another<00:01:47.140> thing<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.409> point<00:01:47.590> out<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:48.719> rear

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
oh another thing to point out the rear

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.489 
oh another thing to point out the rear
stabilizer<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.490> ball<00:01:51.999> joint<00:01:52.329> here<00:01:52.390> when<00:01:53.380> the

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:53.499 
stabilizer this ball joint here when the

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:56.700 
stabilizer this ball joint here when the
suspension<00:01:53.859> compresses<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.909> can<00:01:55.240> if<00:01:56.109> it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
suspension compresses it can if it

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.709 
suspension compresses it can if it
compresses<00:01:57.009> enough<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:57.939> ball<00:01:58.179> joint<00:01:58.479> can

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
compresses enough that ball joint can

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.090 
compresses enough that ball joint can

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
out I don't know it was just a lot of

out I don't know it was just a lot of
fun<00:03:24.099> the<00:03:25.389> suspension<00:03:26.389> setup<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.720> way<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.900> is

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
fun the suspension setup the way it is

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.110 
fun the suspension setup the way it is
it<00:03:27.470> does<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.290> outside<00:03:31.099> rear<00:03:31.370> wheel<00:03:31.609> can

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
it does the the outside rear wheel can

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.119 
it does the the outside rear wheel can
sort<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.750> pick<00:03:32.959> up<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.230> little<00:03:33.379> bit<00:03:33.590> when<00:03:33.950> you're

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
sort of pick up a little bit when you're

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.650 
sort of pick up a little bit when you're
when<00:03:34.519> you're<00:03:34.549> cornering<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.209> that's<00:03:35.389> kind<00:03:35.599> of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
when you're cornering so that's kind of

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.750 
when you're cornering so that's kind of
fun<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.290> guess

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
fun I guess

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.759 
fun I guess
the<00:03:38.329> steering<00:03:38.720> again<00:03:39.019> is<00:03:39.109> a<00:03:39.139> little<00:03:39.379> sloppy<00:03:39.590> I

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
the steering again is a little sloppy I

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.920 
the steering again is a little sloppy I
have<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.069> work<00:03:40.190> on<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.519> but<00:03:41.419> this<00:03:41.599> is<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
have to work on that but this is the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.550 
have to work on that but this is the
final<00:03:42.199> product<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.799> I<00:03:43.609> think<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.359> works<00:03:44.569> great

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
final product and I think it works great

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.960 
final product and I think it works great
for<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.859> most<00:03:46.010> part<00:03:46.250> still<00:03:46.579> a<00:03:46.609> little<00:03:46.879> bit

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
for the most part still a little bit

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.220 
for the most part still a little bit
weak<00:03:47.150> here<00:03:47.329> and<00:03:47.419> there<00:03:47.540> but<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.750> would<00:03:47.900> say<00:03:48.079> this

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
weak here and there but I would say this

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
weak here and there but I would say this
is<00:03:48.379> pretty<00:03:48.560> much<00:03:48.769> done<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.590> hope<00:03:52.069> you

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
is pretty much done so I hope you

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.960

the<00:04:01.400> parts<00:04:01.669> are<00:04:01.760> inter<00:04:01.970> compatible<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:03.230> just

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
the parts are inter compatible you just

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.259 
the parts are inter compatible you just
have<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.650> get<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:04.280> top<00:04:04.489> force<00:04:04.730> chassis<00:04:04.970> plate

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
have to get the top force chassis plate

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.599 
have to get the top force chassis plate
the<00:04:05.389> J<00:04:05.569> parts<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.680> longer<00:04:06.949> driveshaft<00:04:07.459> and

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
the J parts the longer driveshaft and

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.289 
the J parts the longer driveshaft and
everything<00:04:07.940> else<00:04:08.060> pretty<00:04:08.269> much<00:04:08.359> works<00:04:08.690> out<00:04:08.949> so

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
everything else pretty much works out so

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.050 
everything else pretty much works out so
that's<00:04:11.299> it<00:04:11.569> and<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:12.410> will<00:04:13.310> soon<00:04:13.519> be<00:04:13.669> moving<00:04:13.970> on

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
that's it and I will soon be moving on

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.590 
that's it and I will soon be moving on
to<00:04:14.180> other<00:04:14.480> projects<00:04:15.230> Assis
