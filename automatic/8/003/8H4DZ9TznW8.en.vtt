00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 ah 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.730
 from paraisopolis to the heart of são 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.460
 Paulo 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.369
 the community philharmonic orchestra 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.540
 charmed the capital's financial center 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.960
 paulista with an exciting 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.259
 This is the first time that 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.849
 the talented young people show their talent 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.100
 beyond the limits of morumbi 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.890
 What we wanted was in this first 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.170
 presentation will show the story of the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.950
 Our work, the beginning of this work was 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.410
 very hard looking a lot 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.480
 sponsorship by solving issues that 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.970
 could so we had to 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.040
 solve with space classrooms everything 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.290
 This is actually the first 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.320
 presentation outside of paraisópolis with the 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.600
 program and in the theater of this beautiful 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.270
 as here the maximum with this critique so 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.399
 good first time was a great pleasure 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.890
 a great emotion for all of us 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.140
 the philharmonic performance represents 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.210
 a milestone in the history of the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.650
 proving that art and culture are 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.090
 capable of transforming any citizen 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.370
 I think the orchestra is all about 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.440
 with our community and will help 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.620
 reinforce this moment of transformation and 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.830
 fight for a new paraisopolis a neighborhood 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.720
 It really was a very big emotion. 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.210
 because of seeing my family supporting me 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.790
 in what I do so it was very good 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.720
 was my family's veins effective if 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.270
 proud 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.610

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.170

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.170
