as<00:00:07.930> we<00:00:08.930> dig<00:00:09.230> deeper<00:00:09.680> into<00:00:09.860> the<00:00:10.010> training<00:00:10.309> scale

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
as we dig deeper into the training scale

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.420 
as we dig deeper into the training scale
we<00:00:11.360> reached<00:00:11.600> the<00:00:11.780> concept<00:00:12.350> of<00:00:12.500> straightness<00:00:13.190> a

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
we reached the concept of straightness a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.730 
we reached the concept of straightness a
horse<00:00:14.270> is<00:00:14.449> defined<00:00:14.809> as<00:00:14.990> straight<00:00:15.320> when<00:00:15.590> he

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
horse is defined as straight when he

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.710 
horse is defined as straight when he
tracks<00:00:16.039> with<00:00:16.309> his<00:00:16.460> forehand<00:00:17.030> in<00:00:17.270> line<00:00:17.480> with

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
tracks with his forehand in line with

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.660 
tracks with his forehand in line with
his<00:00:17.840> hindquarters<00:00:18.380> on<00:00:18.740> both<00:00:19.070> straight<00:00:19.520> and

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
his hindquarters on both straight and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.290 
his hindquarters on both straight and
bending<00:00:20.210> lines<00:00:20.449> and<00:00:20.779> in<00:00:21.350> all<00:00:21.500> three<00:00:21.770> gates

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
bending lines and in all three gates

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.510 
bending lines and in all three gates
you'd<00:00:23.300> expect<00:00:23.720> a<00:00:23.870> horse<00:00:24.110> to<00:00:24.350> naturally<00:00:25.040> travel

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
you'd expect a horse to naturally travel

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.580 
you'd expect a horse to naturally travel
straight<00:00:25.820> but<00:00:26.270> that<00:00:26.450> isn't<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.020> case<00:00:27.050> and

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
straight but that isn't the case and

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.220 
straight but that isn't the case and
there<00:00:27.920> are<00:00:28.010> two<00:00:28.160> reasons<00:00:28.580> why<00:00:28.850> the<00:00:29.750> first<00:00:30.020> is

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
there are two reasons why the first is

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.900 
there are two reasons why the first is
that<00:00:30.350> while<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:30.710> might<00:00:30.920> think<00:00:31.250> of<00:00:31.370> a<00:00:31.430> horse<00:00:31.670> as

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
that while you might think of a horse as

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.940 
that while you might think of a horse as
symmetrical<00:00:32.509> like<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.809> four<00:00:33.140> wheeled<00:00:33.379> vehicle

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
symmetrical like a four wheeled vehicle

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.549 
symmetrical like a four wheeled vehicle
he's<00:00:34.520> not<00:00:34.789> a<00:00:35.120> horse<00:00:35.840> is<00:00:36.050> built<00:00:36.320> with<00:00:36.530> a

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
he's not a horse is built with a

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.250 
he's not a horse is built with a
narrower<00:00:37.070> front<00:00:37.520> end<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.060> wider<00:00:38.660> back<00:00:38.989> end

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
narrower front end and wider back end

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.979 
narrower front end and wider back end
the<00:00:40.160> second<00:00:40.610> reason<00:00:40.760> is<00:00:41.060> that<00:00:41.120> like<00:00:41.510> humans

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
the second reason is that like humans

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.979 
the second reason is that like humans
horses<00:00:42.890> are<00:00:43.130> left<00:00:43.460> or<00:00:43.640> right-handed<00:00:44.300> this

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
horses are left or right-handed this

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.080 
horses are left or right-handed this
natural<00:00:45.649> one-sidedness<00:00:46.460> in<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.850> brain

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
natural one-sidedness in the brain

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.690 
natural one-sidedness in the brain
creates<00:00:47.870> stronger<00:00:48.290> muscles<00:00:48.829> on<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.160> dominant

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
creates stronger muscles on the dominant

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.910 
creates stronger muscles on the dominant
side<00:00:49.850> of<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.090> horse<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.570> weaker<00:00:51.350> muscles<00:00:51.739> on

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
side of the horse and weaker muscles on

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.220 
side of the horse and weaker muscles on
the<00:00:52.070> other<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.880> majority<00:00:53.450> of<00:00:53.540> horses<00:00:53.989> are

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
the other the majority of horses are

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.110 
the other the majority of horses are
described<00:00:54.680> as<00:00:54.860> being<00:00:55.010> crooked<00:00:55.370> when<00:00:55.850> tracking

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
described as being crooked when tracking

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.340 
described as being crooked when tracking
right<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:56.809> stiff<00:00:57.590> when<00:00:58.190> tracking<00:00:58.489> left

right and stiff when tracking left
here's<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.410> breakdown<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:00.980> what<00:01:01.219> happens<00:01:01.700> when

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
here's a breakdown of what happens when

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.959 
here's a breakdown of what happens when
a<00:01:01.850> horse<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:02.239> tracking<00:01:02.840> crooked<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.500> right

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
a horse is tracking crooked to the right

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.609 
a horse is tracking crooked to the right
notice<00:01:04.969> the<00:01:05.149> right<00:01:05.360> hind<00:01:05.719> foot<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.140> tracking

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
notice the right hind foot is tracking

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.789 
notice the right hind foot is tracking
inside<00:01:07.340> his<00:01:07.759> right<00:01:08.000> front<00:01:08.360> foot<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:09.469> means

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
inside his right front foot this means

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.069 
inside his right front foot this means
he's<00:01:10.009> not<00:01:10.219> using<00:01:10.639> his<00:01:10.819> right<00:01:11.179> hind<00:01:11.539> leg<00:01:11.659> very

training a horse to move straight is at

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.779 
training a horse to move straight is at
the<00:01:29.479> core<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.840> turning<00:01:30.469> natural<00:01:30.950> gates<00:01:31.189> into

and a crooked horse side by side really
helps<00:01:37.969> you<00:01:38.119> see<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.479> difference

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
helps you see the difference

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.620 
helps you see the difference
straightness<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.760> important<00:01:41.300> because<00:01:41.450> a

straightness is important because a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.510 
straightness is important because a
