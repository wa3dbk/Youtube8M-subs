00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.610
 hello and welcome to let's play 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.860
 together 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.279
 Today I want to show you how you are 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.140
 your android screen so the 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.439
 screen from your android device 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.329
 could transfer to your pc and also 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:34.450
 you need an app for that 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:37.680
 for smartphones so it works 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.800
 Everything is easy without courage 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.399
 you just have to playstation 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.320
 move and just stay in the android market 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.440
 investigating team and then comes here 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.670
 the teen vogue support from that could 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.070
 then click and install this 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.129
 free 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.540
 yes and then it could open already 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.130
 and then he gets an idea and yes you 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.960
 can 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.750
 only could launch now only 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.480
 need it even on the pc a one 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.720
 program that's called tim Bucher 7 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.090
 or if there is something new so who 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.970
 if this ivanchuk knows maybe 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:28.290
 There's something new so let's say 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:30.640
 topic yes and what do you do with teamwork 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.730
 You can not only do that with it 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.800
 show devices under 5 it was 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.640
 because so clearly devices with it you can 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.010
 actually every device supports 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.910
 example all windows phone linux mac 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:50.560
 actually everything so I know 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:53.480
 ios devices do not work with them because of the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.510
 I do not support songs club 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:03.590
 we are now on pc over android so 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:06.740
 yes okay then you wrap team on 7 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.070
 you just go and open it 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.110
 browser click on the link in the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.290
 description of the world I hire 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.630
 but here I have no link so 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.630
 I'm looking for 27 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.150
 every second so the link I will 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.340
 then put in the description here yes 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:40.900
 and then you can fill in or 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:47.780
 oliver kuck support hotline or manager 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.650
 Thousands of other things will be full 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.140
 the full version 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.600
 So that's actually the all-in-one 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:59.030
 recommend since all in one is in there then 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.870
 get download from us here 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.310
 beautiful secure 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.320
 whatever I was breaking off now 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.780
 because I already installed it 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.360
 I'll do it now shows it 's not like that 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.160
 it is not difficult again 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.650
 yes then you have after the installation 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.700
 a new icon on the desktop so 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.770
 theme 7 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.940
 then maybe that could open 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.480
 coming 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.810
 zeta employment is therefore in any case 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.510
 then if everything could be answered 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.220
 then then the partner would have to 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.800
 specify that is then on your android 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.230
 So in the crypt is my idea 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.850
 that would have to specify then with me that is 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:51.650
 now the idea I will now 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.650
 fade out 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:07.730
 shit really stupid now so that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.520
 I just can not demonstrate 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.440
 wanted it with me kinda no idea 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.420
 I do not know for a people it is 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.500
 not with me should actually go 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:26.860
 has worked for me 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.860
 yes and that actually already knows 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.979
 if you still have questions or with you 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.449
 something might not work then 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.800
 Write it in the comments or me 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.370
 in person, then until the next one 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.300
 times 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.300
 because the play together
