00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
while I gave it a three and a half star

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.240 
while I gave it a three and a half star
in<00:01:59.909> its<00:02:00.090> current<00:02:00.329> state<00:02:00.689> let's<00:02:01.619> say<00:02:01.770> whatever

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
in its current state let's say whatever

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.520 
in its current state let's say whatever
