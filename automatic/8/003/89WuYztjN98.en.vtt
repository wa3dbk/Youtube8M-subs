00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.100 
plate you're going to need coverage so
that<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.500> doesn't<00:02:40.800> just<00:02:40.920> run<00:02:41.130> off<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:42.180> it's

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
that it doesn't just run off but it's

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.100 
that it doesn't just run off but it's
going<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.410> be<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> lot<00:02:44.120> less<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.750> going<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.050> be

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
going to be a lot less it's going to be

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.850 
going to be a lot less it's going to be
a<00:02:46.140> lot<00:02:46.290> harder<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.620> tell<00:02:46.890> once<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.370> get<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
a lot harder to tell once I get the the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.050 
a lot harder to tell once I get the the
right<00:02:49.880> coloring<00:02:50.880> down<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:52.280> then<00:02:53.280> it'll<00:02:53.910> look

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
right coloring down and then it'll look

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.580 
right coloring down and then it'll look
really<00:02:54.360> good<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:55.019> all<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.500> you

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.500 

let<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.920> boobs<00:03:39.910> they<00:03:40.910> don't<00:03:41.090> move<00:03:41.180> too<00:03:41.480> much

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
let the boobs they don't move too much

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.390 
let the boobs they don't move too much
but<00:03:42.050> because<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.350> have<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.620> water<00:03:42.830> balloons<00:03:43.220> in

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
but because I have the water balloons in

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.580 
but because I have the water balloons in
there<00:03:43.660> you<00:03:44.660> can<00:03:44.840> move<00:03:44.990> them<00:03:45.080> around<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.470> little

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
there you can move them around a little

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.080 
there you can move them around a little
bit

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.550 

it's<00:03:53.090> just<00:03:53.360> perfect<00:03:53.540> because<00:03:54.080> then<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.380> don't

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
it's just perfect because then you don't

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.390 
it's just perfect because then you don't
need<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.860> worry<00:03:55.040> about<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.750> cleavage

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
need to worry about the cleavage

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.920 
need to worry about the cleavage
creating<00:03:58.400> your<00:03:58.550> own<00:03:58.640> footage<00:03:59.060> which<00:03:59.330> is<00:03:59.510> still

creating your own footage which is still

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
creating your own footage which is still
a<00:03:59.959> good<00:04:00.170> idea<00:04:00.230> if<00:04:00.590> you're<00:04:00.680> going<00:04:00.800> to<00:04:00.890> be

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
a good idea if you're going to be

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.260 
a good idea if you're going to be
wearing<00:04:01.100> specific<00:04:01.640> dresses

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
wearing specific dresses

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.390

you can't just wear this all the time

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.090 
you can't just wear this all the time
because<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:05.180> requires<00:04:05.630> certain<00:04:06.200> criteria<00:04:06.890> for

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
because it requires certain criteria for

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.710 
because it requires certain criteria for
the<00:04:07.220> outfit<00:04:07.490> that<00:04:07.550> you're<00:04:07.790> wearing<00:04:07.970> plush
