00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100 
is bulletproof and in my own experience
i'd<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.430> agree<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.730> them<00:00:35.969> now<00:00:36.570> first

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
thing with wireless is it obviously runs

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.030 
thing with wireless is it obviously runs
on<00:00:39.420> batteries<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.410> bearing<00:00:40.739> kanger

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
on batteries and now the bearing kanger

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
on batteries and now the bearing kanger
mechanism<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.550> actually<00:00:41.790> very<00:00:41.840> advanced<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
mechanism is actually very advanced and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.049 
mechanism is actually very advanced and
it's<00:00:43.320> pretty<00:00:44.010> smooth<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.700> click<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> button

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it's pretty smooth just click a button

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.020 
it's pretty smooth just click a button
to<00:00:45.210> take<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:46.610> click<00:00:47.610> abundance<00:00:47.820> of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to take it out click abundance of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.410 
to take it out click abundance of
Charlie<00:00:48.360> need<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> bring<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:48.960> swap<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> in

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
Charlie need to bring it out swap it in

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.490 
Charlie need to bring it out swap it in
put<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> other<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.320> ready<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
put the other one in and you're ready to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.410 
put the other one in and you're ready to
go<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.010> essentially<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.239> 10

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
go so essentially you can do that in 10

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.000 
go so essentially you can do that in 10
or<00:00:54.449> 15<00:00:54.809> seconds<00:00:55.230> while<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.530> game<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.890> know

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
or 15 seconds while in the game you know

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.189 
or 15 seconds while in the game you know
while<00:00:56.190> you're<00:00:56.309> respawning<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:57.090> whatnot<00:00:57.300> now

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
while you're respawning or whatnot now

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.319 
while you're respawning or whatnot now
I'll<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:59.309> into<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.699> performance<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
I'll get into the performance of the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.360 
I'll get into the performance of the
mouse<00:01:00.480> itself<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.289> very<00:01:01.500> smooth<00:01:01.859> it's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
mouse itself it's very smooth it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.609 
mouse itself it's very smooth it's
running<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.940> these<00:01:03.090> polytetrafluoroethylene

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
running on these polytetrafluoroethylene

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.109 
running on these polytetrafluoroethylene
feet<00:01:04.619> which<00:01:05.010> give<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> very<00:01:05.489> incredibly

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
feet which give it a very incredibly

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.660 
feet which give it a very incredibly
smooth<00:01:06.360> glide<00:01:06.600> really<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.979> plays<00:01:08.369> games

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
smooth glide really and it plays games

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760 
smooth glide really and it plays games
beautifully<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:10.140> my<00:01:10.200> own<00:01:10.350> experience<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
beautifully it's in my own experience of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.800 
beautifully it's in my own experience of
having<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.250> lag<00:01:11.460> slowdowns<00:01:12.030> cutouts<00:01:12.510> nothing

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
having in lag slowdowns cutouts nothing

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.179 
having in lag slowdowns cutouts nothing
like<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.229> plays<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> while<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
like that it plays just as a while a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
like that it plays just as a while a
whited<00:01:14.729> mouse<00:01:14.939> would<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.840> you'd<00:01:15.960> expect

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
whited mouse would what you'd expect

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.780 
whited mouse would what you'd expect
pretty<00:01:16.530> much<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:17.250> while<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> game<00:01:17.759> is

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
pretty much now while the game is

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.749 
pretty much now while the game is
loading<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.740> will<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.890> over<00:01:20.040> some<00:01:20.340> physical

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
loading I will get over some physical

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.800 
loading I will get over some physical
features<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> mouse<00:01:21.509> itself<00:01:23.659> okay<00:01:24.659> now

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
features of the mouse itself okay now

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
features of the mouse itself okay now
here<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.860> designed<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
here you can see it's designed with a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.830 
here you can see it's designed with a
carbon<00:01:26.939> fiber<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.570> body<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.049> has<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.920> settee

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
you can see changed to a dpi sensor

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.179 
you can see changed to a dpi sensor
