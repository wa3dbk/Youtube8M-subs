about giant metal men and that's pretty

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.789 
about giant metal men and that's pretty
much<00:00:12.660> confirming<00:00:13.200> all<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.320> theories<00:00:13.590> that

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
much confirming all the theories that

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.950 
much confirming all the theories that
I've<00:00:13.920> had<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.219> past<00:00:14.280> about<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:15.179> giant

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
I've had in the past about this giant

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.109 
I've had in the past about this giant
robot<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.560> basically<00:00:17.220> what<00:00:17.520> i<00:00:17.640> think<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.090> that

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
robot and basically what i think is that

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.359 
robot and basically what i think is that
this<00:00:18.570> robot<00:00:19.289> actually<00:00:19.680> originates<00:00:20.279> from

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
this robot actually originates from

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.820 
this robot actually originates from
therese<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.119> facility<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.289> map<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.680> we've

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
therese the facility the map that we've

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.759 
therese the facility the map that we've
had<00:00:23.039> at<00:00:23.250> world<00:00:23.519> at<00:00:23.699> war<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.410> if<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.590> actually

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
had at world at war and if you actually

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.620 
had at world at war and if you actually
translate<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.699> Reese<00:00:26.910> from<00:00:27.180> German<00:00:27.510> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
translate to Reese from German to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.570 
translate to Reese from German to
English<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:28.140> actually<00:00:28.500> means<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> giant<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
English it actually means the giant and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.279 
English it actually means the giant and
I<00:00:29.640> think<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:29.939> whole<00:00:30.150> facility<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:31.080> made

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
I think this whole facility was made

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.010 
I think this whole facility was made
around<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:32.730> Giants<00:00:33.270> because<00:00:33.719> they<00:00:33.960> were

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
around the Giants because they were

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
around the Giants because they were
trying<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.500> build<00:00:34.680> super<00:00:34.950> soldiers<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.520> stuff

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
trying to build super soldiers and stuff

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.069 
trying to build super soldiers and stuff
like<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.149> decided<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.690> build<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
like that and they decided to build a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.869 
like that and they decided to build a
giant<00:00:37.320> robot<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:37.980> some<00:00:38.129> odd<00:00:38.280> reason<00:00:38.309> which

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
giant robot for some odd reason which

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.850 
giant robot for some odd reason which
doesn't<00:00:39.210> seem<00:00:39.510> realistic<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.620> time

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
doesn't seem realistic in the time

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.400 
doesn't seem realistic in the time
period<00:00:40.890> they<00:00:41.340> were<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:42.110> nothing<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
period they were in but nothing in the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.260 
period they were in but nothing in the
zombies<00:00:43.800> storyline<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.430> realistic<00:00:44.789> so

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
zombies storyline is realistic so

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.200 
zombies storyline is realistic so
anyways<00:00:45.829> so<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.100> I'm<00:00:47.190> thinking<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
anyways so what I'm thinking is that the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
anyways so what I'm thinking is that the
original<00:00:48.420> characters<00:00:49.050> are<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.770> be

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
original characters are going to be

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.610 
original characters are going to be
going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.370> DLC<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.020> northern<00:00:52.020> France<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
going to DLC for northern France and

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.619 
going to DLC for northern France and
while<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.190> happening<00:00:53.480> maxxis<00:00:54.480> is

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
while that is happening maxxis is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.510 
while that is happening maxxis is
actually<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.710> facility<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
actually going to go to the facility of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.170 
actually going to go to the facility of
darice<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.320> pilots<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.590> robots<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.340> I'm<00:00:59.789> not

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
darice and pilots the robots and I'm not

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.910 
darice and pilots the robots and I'm not
sure<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.539> he's<00:01:00.600> gonna<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.050> robot<00:01:01.500> himself

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
sure if he's gonna be the robot himself

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.410 
sure if he's gonna be the robot himself
because<00:01:02.280> there's<00:01:02.789> been<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> rumor<00:01:03.149> going

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
because there's been a rumor going

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
because there's been a rumor going
around<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.870> he<00:01:04.170> might<00:01:04.350> actually<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
around that he might actually be a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.880 
around that he might actually be a
cyborg<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> next<00:01:06.270> map<00:01:06.450> from<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> prestige

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
cyborg in the next map from the prestige

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.740 
cyborg in the next map from the prestige
10<00:01:08.130> emblem<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.610> we've<00:01:08.790> seen<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
10 emblem that we've seen in the the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.170 
10 emblem that we've seen in the the
emblem<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.200> actually<00:01:10.680> hinting<00:01:11.430> towards<00:01:11.790> DLC

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
emblem is actually hinting towards DLC

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.630 
emblem is actually hinting towards DLC
for<00:01:12.210> obviously<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.979> know<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.430> shows

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
for obviously because you know it shows

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.660 
for obviously because you know it shows
max's<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> robot<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:17.040> i'm<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.280> sure<00:01:17.520> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
max's as a robot but i'm not sure it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
max's as a robot but i'm not sure it
that<00:01:18.000> he's<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> robot<00:01:19.110> himself

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that he's going to be the robot himself

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.920 
that he's going to be the robot himself
because<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.920> wouldn't<00:01:20.189> make<00:01:20.310> sense<00:01:20.930> but

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
because that wouldn't make sense but

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.390 
because that wouldn't make sense but
that<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.380> pretty<00:01:22.560> cool<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.130> could

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that would be pretty cool if we could

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.149 
that would be pretty cool if we could
actually<00:01:23.549> see<00:01:23.939> him<00:01:24.060> piloting<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> robot<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
actually see him piloting the robot and

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.230 
actually see him piloting the robot and
basically<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> purpose<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.850> robot<00:01:27.210> is

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
basically the purpose of this robot is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.910 
basically the purpose of this robot is
that<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> open<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.439> portal<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that it's going to open a portal to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
that it's going to open a portal to
agartha<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.880> i'm<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.360> sure<00:01:30.509> how<00:01:30.630> it's

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
agartha in them i'm not sure how it's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
agartha in them i'm not sure how it's
gonna<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.530> imagine<00:01:32.070> actually

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
gonna do that I imagine actually

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.190 
gonna do that I imagine actually
reaching<00:01:32.939> down<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.329> ground<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> ripping

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
reaching down to the ground and ripping

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
reaching down to the ground and ripping
up<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.409> whole<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.189> that's

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
up a whole but that's you know that's

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.910 
up a whole but that's you know that's
just<00:01:35.549> me<00:01:35.700> um<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> point<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.560> that

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
just me um but the point of that is that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.760 
just me um but the point of that is that
Maxis<00:01:38.400> wants<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.270> Samantha<00:01:39.630> back<00:01:40.079> from

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
Maxis wants to get Samantha back from

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.210 
Maxis wants to get Samantha back from
agartha<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.610> she's<00:01:41.850> been<00:01:42.090> doomed<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
agartha because she's been doomed to

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.010 
agartha because she's been doomed to
that<00:01:44.220> place<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.090> he<00:01:45.479> wants<00:01:45.780> her<00:01:45.869> back

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that place so he wants her back

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.770 
that place so he wants her back
obviously<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:48.149> robots<00:01:48.509> gonna<00:01:48.659> be

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
obviously and and this robots gonna be

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.719 
obviously and and this robots gonna be
fueled<00:01:49.079> by<00:01:49.229> orgone<00:01:49.950> energy<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.610> guys

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
fueled by orgone energy and if you guys

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.280 
fueled by orgone energy and if you guys
don't<00:01:50.880> know<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.090> Oregon<00:01:51.299> energy<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.049> it's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
don't know what Oregon energy is it's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.080 
don't know what Oregon energy is it's
the<00:01:52.439> fuel<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.920> life<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.670> zombies

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the fuel of life in the zombies

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060 
the fuel of life in the zombies
storyline<00:01:54.270> basically<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.860> back<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
storyline basically and if we go back to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.380 
storyline basically and if we go back to
the<00:01:56.280> nuke<00:01:56.430> downloading<00:01:56.939> screen<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.299> can

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the nuke downloading screen you can

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 
the nuke downloading screen you can
actually<00:01:57.570> see<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.259> were<00:01:58.520> taking<00:01:59.520> out

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
actually see that they were taking out

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.060 
actually see that they were taking out
orgone<00:02:00.119> energy<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.049> Giants<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.680> think

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
orgone energy for this Giants I think

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.609 
orgone energy for this Giants I think
that's<00:02:02.219> Max's<00:02:02.759> down<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.469> bottom<00:02:04.469> left

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
that's Max's down in the bottom left

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.319 
that's Max's down in the bottom left
corner<00:02:04.829> he's<00:02:05.189> raising<00:02:05.670> his<00:02:05.820> hands<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.210> stuff

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
corner he's raising his hands and stuff

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.850 
corner he's raising his hands and stuff
like<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.200> think<00:02:07.469> he's<00:02:07.619> actually

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
like that and I think he's actually

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.249 
like that and I think he's actually
drilling<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.209> Oregon<00:02:09.509> energy<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.989> fuel

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
drilling for that Oregon energy to fuel

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.280 
drilling for that Oregon energy to fuel
his<00:02:10.819> giant<00:02:11.819> robot<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.959> lot<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.200> people

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
his giant robot and a lot of people

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.860 
his giant robot and a lot of people
thought<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.650> would

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
thought you would

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.940 
thought you would
they<00:02:13.900> were<00:02:14.019> drilling<00:02:14.349> into<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.709> ground

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
they were drilling into the ground

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.530 
they were drilling into the ground
herself<00:02:15.069> like<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:15.819> that's<00:02:16.060> not<00:02:16.269> really

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
herself like that but that's not really

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.460 
herself like that but that's not really
what<00:02:16.659> was<00:02:16.780> going<00:02:16.989> on<00:02:17.049> they<00:02:17.230> were<00:02:17.319> actually

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
what was going on they were actually

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.289 
what was going on they were actually
pulling<00:02:17.860> something<00:02:18.159> out<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.519> ground<00:02:18.670> so

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
pulling something out of the ground so

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.030 
pulling something out of the ground so
in<00:02:19.420> terms<00:02:19.599> of<00:02:19.810> how<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.140> giant<00:02:20.590> robot<00:02:20.920> is

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
in terms of how this giant robot is

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.410 
in terms of how this giant robot is
gonna<00:02:21.190> play<00:02:21.340> out<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.670> map<00:02:21.849> i'm<00:02:22.030> not<00:02:22.180> sure

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
gonna play out in the map i'm not sure

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.210 
gonna play out in the map i'm not sure
how<00:02:22.599> it's<00:02:22.750> going<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.900> play<00:02:23.049> out<00:02:23.220> gameplay-wise

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
how it's going to play out gameplay-wise

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.369 
how it's going to play out gameplay-wise
if<00:02:24.760> it's<00:02:25.239> walking<00:02:25.480> around<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.200> earth

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
if it's walking around in the earth

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.660 
if it's walking around in the earth
shakes<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:26.980> stuff<00:02:27.099> like<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.250> that's<00:02:27.549> gonna

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
shakes and stuff like that that's gonna

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.070 
shakes and stuff like that that's gonna
be<00:02:27.819> horrible<00:02:28.030> because<00:02:28.330> if<00:02:28.720> you're<00:02:28.840> trying<00:02:28.989> to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
be horrible because if you're trying to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.380 
be horrible because if you're trying to
kill<00:02:29.230> zombies<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:30.489> going<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.760> be<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:31.090> nuisance

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
kill zombies it's going to be a nuisance

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.170 
kill zombies it's going to be a nuisance
so<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.890> definitely<00:02:33.099> want<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:33.579> kill<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:33.970> giant

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
so you definitely want to kill the giant

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.869 
so you definitely want to kill the giant
if<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.989> happens<00:02:35.230> because<00:02:35.680> there<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> way

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
if that happens because there is a way

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.250 
if that happens because there is a way
to<00:02:36.909> kill<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.239> giant<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.599> have<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.930> use<00:02:38.079> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
to kill the giant you have to use the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.259 
to kill the giant you have to use the
one<00:02:38.379> weapon<00:02:38.709> staff<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.879> has<00:02:40.000> different

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
one weapon staff and it has different

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.240 
one weapon staff and it has different
one<00:02:40.540> weapon<00:02:40.810> abilities<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.409> my<00:02:41.590> theory<00:02:42.040> here

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
one weapon abilities and my theory here

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.920 
one weapon abilities and my theory here
is<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.549> you<00:02:42.670> actually<00:02:42.909> have<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.390> get<00:02:43.569> all<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
is that you actually have to get all the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.569 
is that you actually have to get all the
wand<00:02:44.110> weapons<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.680> combine<00:02:45.010> them<00:02:45.040> all<00:02:45.310> and

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
wand weapons and combine them all and

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.869 
wand weapons and combine them all and
use<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.750> through<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.470> staff<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.950> kill<00:02:48.310> the

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
use that through the staff and kill the

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.759 
use that through the staff and kill the
giant<00:02:49.209> with<00:02:49.629> all<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.930> one<00:02:50.049> weapon<00:02:50.379> abilities

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
giant with all the one weapon abilities

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.259 
giant with all the one weapon abilities
but<00:02:51.280> that's<00:02:51.459> just<00:02:51.579> my<00:02:51.760> theory<00:02:51.970> that'd<00:02:52.150> be

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
but that's just my theory that'd be

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.819 
but that's just my theory that'd be
pretty<00:02:52.420> cool<00:02:52.540> I'm<00:02:53.109> actually<00:02:53.470> thought<00:02:53.799> about

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
pretty cool I'm actually thought about

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.729 
pretty cool I'm actually thought about
that<00:02:54.069> just<00:02:54.459> recently<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:55.510> that's<00:02:56.200> my<00:02:56.410> idea<00:02:56.680> and

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
that just recently so that's my idea and

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.789 
that just recently so that's my idea and
what<00:02:57.640> if<00:02:57.819> there<00:02:58.060> was<00:02:58.239> actually<00:02:58.720> an<00:02:58.900> option<00:02:59.500> to

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
what if there was actually an option to

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.729 
what if there was actually an option to
drive<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.430> robot<00:03:00.640> yourselves<00:03:01.599> because<00:03:01.810> let's

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
drive the robot yourselves because let's

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.069 
drive the robot yourselves because let's
say<00:03:02.859> you<00:03:02.980> take<00:03:03.069> down<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.730> robot<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.810> kill

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
say you take down the robot and you kill

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.000 
say you take down the robot and you kill
Maxis<00:03:05.590> if<00:03:06.340> he's<00:03:06.700> inside<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.299> robot<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.799> you

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
Maxis if he's inside the robot and you

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.550 
Maxis if he's inside the robot and you
actually<00:03:09.250> get<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:10.079> pilot<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.230> robot

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
actually get to pilot the robot

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.500 
actually get to pilot the robot
yourselves<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.280> would<00:03:12.400> be<00:03:12.549> immensely

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
yourselves that would be immensely

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.039 
yourselves that would be immensely
overpowered<00:03:14.670> but<00:03:15.670> you<00:03:15.940> know<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.810> seems

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
overpowered but you know that it seems

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.509 
overpowered but you know that it seems
very<00:03:17.230> impossible<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.950> it's<00:03:18.040> probably<00:03:18.370> not

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
very impossible and it's probably not

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.770 
very impossible and it's probably not
going<00:03:18.609> to<00:03:18.669> happen<00:03:18.790> but<00:03:19.090> that's<00:03:19.299> just<00:03:19.480> my<00:03:19.660> idea

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
going to happen but that's just my idea

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.140 
going to happen but that's just my idea
