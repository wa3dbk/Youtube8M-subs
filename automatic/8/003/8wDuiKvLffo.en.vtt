Survival<00:00:59.520> Series<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.780> then<00:01:01.250> we<00:01:02.250> were<00:01:02.340> like

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
Survival Series but then we were like

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.670 
Survival Series but then we were like
well<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:03.809> whole<00:01:03.930> point<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> snap<00:01:04.470> tries

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
well the whole point of the snap tries

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.080 
well the whole point of the snap tries
to<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.040> things<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.610> are<00:01:05.700> new<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to do things that are new for the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.730 
to do things that are new for the
snapshot<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> objectives

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
snapshot it's like one of the objectives

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.980 
snapshot it's like one of the objectives
and<00:01:08.159> we're<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.240> actually<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:11.299> like<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.720> snap

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and we're not actually and like the snap

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
and we're not actually and like the snap
show<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.320> kind<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.560> outdated

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
show it's kind of outdated

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.160 
show it's kind of outdated
I<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> new<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:15.990> won't

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
I think this is a new but they won't

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.539 
I think this is a new but they won't
come<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.380> two<00:01:16.770> days<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> kind<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> just

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
come in two days so it kind of just

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.890 
come in two days so it kind of just
defeats<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> object<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.540> whole<00:01:18.689> series

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
defeats the object of the whole series

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.690 
defeats the object of the whole series
if<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.259> start<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.979> every<00:01:20.100> way<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.280> well<00:01:20.549> so

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
if we start now so every way as well so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.880 
if we start now so every way as well so
this<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.270> kind<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.570> stopgap<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.619> could<00:01:22.799> be

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
this is kind of stopgap this could be

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.179 
this is kind of stopgap this could be
only<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.070> micro<00:01:23.400> flashes<00:01:24.619> but<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> push<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
only a micro flashes but you push the
