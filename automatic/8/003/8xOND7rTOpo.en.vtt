in<00:00:04.920> Mega<00:00:05.250> Man<00:00:05.460> 3<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:07.099> have<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.150> pre-recorded

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
in Mega Man 3 I have a pre-recorded

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.900 
in Mega Man 3 I have a pre-recorded
quick<00:00:09.360> kill<00:00:09.599> that<00:00:09.840> I'm<00:00:09.960> going<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.230> be<00:00:10.380> using

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.960 

start<00:00:17.910> off<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.359> fairly<00:00:18.570> simple<00:00:19.970> position

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
start off it's fairly simple position

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.120 
start off it's fairly simple position
yourself<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.900> you're<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.800> part<00:00:23.070> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
yourself so that you're on this part of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.189 
yourself so that you're on this part of
the<00:00:23.189> yellow<00:00:23.310> devil<00:00:23.580> once<00:00:24.029> his<00:00:24.269> blocks<00:00:24.660> morph

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the yellow devil once his blocks morph

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.880 
the yellow devil once his blocks morph
you<00:00:26.070> will<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:27.119> hit<00:00:27.330> by<00:00:27.480> them<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.560> this

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
you will not be hit by them so all this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.040 
you will not be hit by them so all this
part<00:00:29.189> right<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.580> won't<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.910> hit<00:00:30.090> by<00:00:30.300> but

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
part right here you won't be hit by but

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.990 
part right here you won't be hit by but
as<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.320> can<00:00:31.439> see<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.980> block<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.550> this

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
as you can see if this block is in this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.229 
as you can see if this block is in this
phase<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.440> will<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.890> hit<00:00:35.070> by<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:39.620> now<00:00:40.620> once

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
phase you will be hit by it now once

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.540 
phase you will be hit by it now once
this<00:00:42.239> block<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.469> block<00:00:43.530> form<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.399> can

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
this block and this block form you can

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.369 
this block and this block form you can
actually<00:00:44.730> move<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> bit<00:00:45.510> early<00:00:45.960> regardless

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
actually move it a bit early regardless

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.380 
actually move it a bit early regardless
of<00:00:46.500> whether<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:47.879> show<00:00:48.360> up

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
of whether this one or this one show up

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.740 
of whether this one or this one show up
but<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.379> need<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.480> block<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.379> one

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
but you need this block and this one

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.170 
but you need this block and this one
position<00:00:54.750> yourself<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.620> about<00:00:56.489> half<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
position yourself so that about half of

should<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.620> about<00:01:01.800> half<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.430> less<00:01:02.719> it<00:01:03.719> doesn't

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
should be about half or less it doesn't

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.750 
should be about half or less it doesn't
really<00:01:04.110> matter<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> don't<00:01:05.189> want<00:01:05.430> more

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
really matter but you don't want more

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to be getting hit too much now as this

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.149 
to be getting hit too much now as this
block<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.330> coming<00:01:16.170> towards<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.890> going

to<00:01:17.310> end<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.850> hitting<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.659> moving<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
to end up hitting you and moving you to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
to end up hitting you and moving you to
the<00:01:19.619> left<00:01:20.659> it's<00:01:21.659> important<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.799> part<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the left it's important for this part to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.039 
the left it's important for this part to
not<00:01:23.880> press<00:01:24.330> anything<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.290> yet<00:01:26.540> now<00:01:27.540> after

input<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.689> light<00:01:31.470> tap<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> left<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
input a light tap to the left so that

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.600 
input a light tap to the left so that
you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.659> position<00:01:33.869> yourself<00:01:34.229> facing<00:01:35.220> left

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you can position yourself facing left

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.690 
you can position yourself facing left
don't<00:01:36.090> move<00:01:36.450> left<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.799> face<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.490> way

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
don't move left but just face that way

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you get hit you're going to have just

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.240 
you get hit you're going to have just
enough<00:01:47.909> invincibility<00:01:48.750> frames<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.130> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
enough invincibility frames so that you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.100 
enough invincibility frames so that you
can<00:01:50.460> jump<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.180> start<00:01:51.390> damaging<00:01:51.720> the

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.839 

now<00:02:32.049> as<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.439> can<00:02:32.620> see<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:33.069> El<00:02:33.189> double<00:02:33.549> didn't

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
now as you can see the El double didn't

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.940 
now as you can see the El double didn't
end<00:02:34.000> up<00:02:34.120> dying<00:02:34.450> he's<00:02:34.870> still<00:02:35.079> alive<00:02:35.349> he<00:02:35.709> still

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
end up dying he's still alive he still

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.849 
end up dying he's still alive he still
has<00:02:36.599> si<00:02:37.829> roughly<00:02:38.829> half<00:02:39.189> health<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.810> using<00:02:41.739> the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
has si roughly half health but using the

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.490 
has si roughly half health but using the
positioning<00:02:42.489> before<00:02:43.239> with<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.689> two<00:02:43.930> blocks

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
positioning before with the two blocks

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.869 
positioning before with the two blocks
that<00:02:44.680> damaged<00:02:45.099> you<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.819> end<00:02:46.120> up<00:02:46.680> being

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
that damaged you you end up being

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.539 
that damaged you you end up being
generally<00:02:48.879> far<00:02:49.450> left<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.470> when<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.769> move<00:02:51.040> and

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
generally far left so when you move and

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.629 
generally far left so when you move and
get<00:02:52.090> hit<00:02:52.329> to<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.659> right<00:02:52.859> you<00:02:53.859> still<00:02:54.370> are

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
get hit to the right you still are

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.819 
get hit to the right you still are
underneath<00:02:55.060> his<00:02:55.269> eye<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.959> all<00:02:56.169> you<00:02:56.319> have<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.560> do

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
underneath his eye so all you have to do

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.770 
underneath his eye so all you have to do
is<00:02:57.069> just<00:02:57.310> jump<00:02:57.669> up<00:02:57.879> at<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.269> same<00:02:58.450> spot<00:02:58.750> again

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
is just jump up at the same spot again

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.929 
is just jump up at the same spot again
start<00:02:59.620> mashing<00:02:59.829> B<00:03:00.189> and<00:03:00.430> finish<00:03:00.669> them<00:03:00.819> off

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
start mashing B and finish them off

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.979 
start mashing B and finish them off
which<00:03:01.419> shouldn't<00:03:01.719> be<00:03:01.780> too<00:03:01.870> difficult<00:03:05.969> and

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
which shouldn't be too difficult and

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.709 
which shouldn't be too difficult and
that<00:03:07.989> really<00:03:08.469> does<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.859> so<00:03:09.639> let's<00:03:10.359> watch<00:03:10.510> in

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
that really does it so let's watch in

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:24.809 
that really does it so let's watch in
full<00:03:10.900> motion<00:03:11.109> now

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.000 

position<00:03:25.659> yourself<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.230> far<00:03:26.469> right<00:03:26.680> so

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
position yourself to the far right so

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.690 
position yourself to the far right so
you<00:03:27.069> don't<00:03:27.219> get<00:03:27.400> damaged<00:03:32.129> move<00:03:33.129> yourself<00:03:33.519> in

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
you don't get damaged move yourself in

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.610 
you don't get damaged move yourself in
between<00:03:34.090> these<00:03:34.239> two<00:03:34.510> blocks<00:03:34.840> about<00:03:35.260> half<00:03:35.590> your

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
between these two blocks about half your

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.390 
between these two blocks about half your
head<00:03:36.040> facing<00:03:36.579> right<00:03:36.849> then<00:03:37.599> turn<00:03:37.959> left<00:03:38.189> jump<00:03:39.189> up

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
head facing right then turn left jump up

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.099 
head facing right then turn left jump up
and<00:03:39.579> start<00:03:39.939> mashing<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.480> then<00:03:40.780> if<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:40.989> need

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
and start mashing and then if you need

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.009 
and start mashing and then if you need
to<00:03:41.290> jump<00:03:41.620> up<00:03:41.799> again<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.670> can<00:03:43.030> kill<00:03:43.420> him<00:03:43.659> on<00:03:43.810> the

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
to jump up again you can kill him on the

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.530 
to jump up again you can kill him on the
first<00:03:44.260> jump<00:03:44.560> but<00:03:45.129> you<00:03:45.250> have<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.730> mesh<00:03:45.939> a<00:03:46.180> lot

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
first jump but you have to mesh a lot

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.360 
first jump but you have to mesh a lot
faster<00:03:47.200> than<00:03:47.799> you<00:03:47.950> would<00:03:48.040> expect<00:03:48.189> and<00:03:50.370> that
