I am this moment but behind this

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.410 
I am this moment but behind this
building<00:01:07.159> right<00:01:07.460> here<00:01:07.750> because<00:01:08.750> they<00:01:09.229> can

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
building right here because they can

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.270 
building right here because they can
they<00:01:11.420> could<00:01:11.600> very<00:01:11.840> rarely<00:01:12.320> shoot<00:01:12.799> you<00:01:12.979> and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
they could very rarely shoot you and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.770 
they could very rarely shoot you and
kill<00:01:13.579> you<00:01:13.700> through<00:01:13.970> there<00:01:14.090> without<00:01:14.329> giving

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
kill you through there without giving

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.510 
kill you through there without giving
you<00:01:14.840> enough<00:01:14.990> time<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.380> kind<00:01:15.590> of<00:01:15.649> duck<00:01:16.340> behind

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
you enough time to kind of duck behind

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.669 
you enough time to kind of duck behind
cover<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.600> when<00:01:17.869> you're<00:01:18.020> in<00:01:18.170> this<00:01:18.289> corner

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
cover and when you're in this corner

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.499 
cover and when you're in this corner
over<00:01:18.710> here<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:22.520> makes<00:01:22.759> it<00:01:22.880> really<00:01:23.149> hard<00:01:23.270> for

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
over here it makes it really hard for

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.069 
over here it makes it really hard for
them<00:01:23.659> to<00:01:23.749> sneak<00:01:24.049> up<00:01:24.170> behind<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.920> you

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
them to sneak up behind you and you

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.139 
them to sneak up behind you and you
always<00:01:27.079> have<00:01:27.530> something<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.100> run<00:01:28.280> away<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.549> if

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
always have something to run away to if

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:36.520 
always have something to run away to if
they<00:01:29.299> throw<00:01:29.509> grenades<00:01:29.810> at<00:01:30.049> you

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.470 

that's<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.830> cool<00:01:38.070> when<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.940> take<00:01:39.120> that<00:01:39.240> first

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
that's so cool when you take that first

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.320 
that's so cool when you take that first
shot<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.560> kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:41.000> dive<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
shot they all just kind of dive to the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.480 
shot they all just kind of dive to the
ground<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:43.500> they<00:01:43.710> know<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> sniper<00:01:44.250> is

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
ground because they know a sniper is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:02:03.620 
ground because they know a sniper is
just<00:01:44.640> gonna<00:01:44.760> pick<00:01:45.150> them<00:01:45.330> off

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.539 

so<00:02:04.260> you<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:04.530> your<00:02:04.680> Claymore<00:02:05.070> start<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.460> do

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
so you see your Claymore start to do

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.570 
so you see your Claymore start to do
their<00:02:05.700> work<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.799> get<00:02:07.799> some<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.190> guys<00:02:08.340> that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
their work and get some of the guys that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:18.740 
their work and get some of the guys that
come<00:02:08.789> around<00:02:17.030> if<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.150> think<00:02:18.390> you're<00:02:18.510> getting

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
come around if you think you're getting

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.210 
come around if you think you're getting
kind<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.110> far<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.500> level<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:19.920> really

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
kind of far in this level but you really

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.800 
kind of far in this level but you really
don't<00:02:20.370> know<00:02:20.459> how<00:02:20.640> far<00:02:20.880> you're<00:02:21.030> getting<00:02:21.300> you

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
don't know how far you're getting you

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.199 
don't know how far you're getting you
know<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.380> can<00:02:22.530> take<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.739> look<00:02:22.980> at<00:02:23.940> your<00:02:24.090> little

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
know you can take a look at your little

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.240 
know you can take a look at your little
compass<00:02:24.660> on<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> bottom<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.800> tells<00:02:25.860> you

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
compass on the bottom it tells you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.670 
compass on the bottom it tells you
exactly<00:02:26.400> how<00:02:26.730> far<00:02:27.150> away<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.959> helicopter<00:02:28.560> is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
exactly how far away the helicopter is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.760 
exactly how far away the helicopter is
and<00:02:28.950> when<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.730> gets<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.970> 0<00:02:30.360> meters<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:31.350> one<00:02:31.709> it's

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
and when it gets to 0 meters is one it's

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.300 
and when it gets to 0 meters is one it's
not<00:02:34.770> necessarily<00:02:35.310> zero<00:02:35.580> meters<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:37.050> know

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
not necessarily zero meters but you know

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.009 
not necessarily zero meters but you know
15<00:02:38.310> or<00:02:38.430> 20<00:02:38.700> meters<00:02:38.819> that's<00:02:39.120> when<00:02:39.300> it's<00:02:39.450> pretty

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
15 or 20 meters that's when it's pretty

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.410 
15 or 20 meters that's when it's pretty
much<00:02:40.140> landing<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.160> that's<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.760> good<00:02:41.940> gauge<00:02:42.180> of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
much landing so that's a good gauge of

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.449 
much landing so that's a good gauge of
how<00:02:42.750> much<00:02:43.380> time<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.800> still<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.250> stay

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
how much time you still have to stay

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.080 
how much time you still have to stay
alive<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.940> standing<00:02:48.360> right<00:02:48.690> by<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.019> railing

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
alive so standing right by that railing

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.620 
alive so standing right by that railing
where<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.120> am<00:02:51.390> right<00:02:51.569> now<00:02:51.600> makes<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:53.630> pretty

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
where I am right now makes it pretty

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.100 
where I am right now makes it pretty
damn<00:02:55.110> impossible<00:02:55.830> for<00:02:55.980> them<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.130> shoot<00:02:56.430> you

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
damn impossible for them to shoot you

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.270 
damn impossible for them to shoot you
they<00:02:58.110> can<00:02:58.260> still<00:02:58.470> grenade<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.920> though

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
they can still grenade you though

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.630 
they can still grenade you though
but<00:03:00.150> unlike<00:03:00.989> multiplayer<00:03:01.590> they<00:03:02.220> don't<00:03:02.430> cook

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
but unlike multiplayer they don't cook

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.759 
but unlike multiplayer they don't cook
their<00:03:02.880> grenades<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.750> any<00:03:04.019> grenades<00:03:04.260> close

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
their grenades so any grenades close

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.890 
their grenades so any grenades close
enough<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.400> throw<00:03:05.640> back<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:06.180> highly

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
enough to you to throw back I highly

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.399 
enough to you to throw back I highly
recommend<00:03:07.319> doing<00:03:07.560> so

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.170 

quite<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:12.980> few<00:03:13.129> guys<00:03:13.280> will<00:03:13.519> group<00:03:13.760> up<00:03:13.939> over

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
quite a few guys will group up over

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.479 
quite a few guys will group up over
there<00:03:14.329> too<00:03:14.629> and<00:03:14.930> when<00:03:15.650> these<00:03:15.799> choppers<00:03:16.280> come

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
there too and when these choppers come

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.530 
there too and when these choppers come
in<00:03:18.040> if<00:03:19.040> you've<00:03:19.340> put<00:03:19.700> one<00:03:19.969> bullet<00:03:20.209> into<00:03:20.510> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
in if you've put one bullet into the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.589 
in if you've put one bullet into the
guys<00:03:20.780> as<00:03:21.109> they're<00:03:21.499> sliding<00:03:21.889> down<00:03:22.159> the<00:03:22.280> ropes

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
guys as they're sliding down the ropes

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.000 
guys as they're sliding down the ropes
that'll<00:03:23.599> just<00:03:23.780> die<00:03:24.139> instantly

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
that'll just die instantly

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.250 
that'll just die instantly
so<00:03:25.310> it's<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.639> good<00:03:25.790> way<00:03:25.909> to<00:03:25.939> take<00:03:26.209> out<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:29.260> couple

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
so it's a good way to take out a couple

00:03:30.260 --> 00:04:09.040 
so it's a good way to take out a couple
guys<00:03:30.500> pretty<00:03:30.829> quickly

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:20.020 

tango<00:04:10.050> time

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:41.159 

I<00:04:20.090> get<00:04:20.840> your<00:04:21.019> choice

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:06:59.450 

tango

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.370
