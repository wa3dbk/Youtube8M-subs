00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 these parties kickoff hit by 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.060
 wisniewski and the racing leads in 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.370
 arm of stephen armitage 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.460
 as said like halo quesada this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.690
 week it is imperative to avoid that the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.140
 machine does not start 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.550
 citing cities on hard wilkinson lens 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.529
 at stanley park and replaces the curtain 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.480
 defensive of racing mathieu bastareaud 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.769
 who profits at the fire he has the support of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.550
 Swiss he is taken back to less than five 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.830
 meters he gets up 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.269
 belted by matt anigo this is the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.369
 first test opportunity of this match 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.469
 did their job but where is the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.300
 line during a quarter lasting for masoe 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.300
 Masoero jumped on Ben Arous 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:48.010
 breakthrough rock from bastareaud and action 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:51.670
 which continues with a vintage for the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.640
 property lausanne penalty reported by 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.430
 sir lafon first big action of the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.489
 match that will escape aiming what 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 their turn of esteban a little bit 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.430
 too late and the machine that is launched 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.610
 he was going to turn his head he hesitates to 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.810
 forward his balloon while he has a 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.979
 support we can not see it but one 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.350
 support on his right 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.510
 he is finally stopped with difficulty 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.119
 and then having them then will insist 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.410
 same meaning with again this 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.390
 power characteristics to 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.140
 irish english jonny wilkinson 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.400
 cured 3 3 games ourselves censored 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.990
 garrido now the international 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.790
 Argentinean gallineau well taken by haguy 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.530
 early but open to reversal of 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.150
 machenaud with gerondeau now 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.979
 manage our legroom prices by imane 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.770
 same meaning again for the right maybe 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.869
 of jonathan wisniewski it's gone and this 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.289
 drop of wisniewski passes between 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.260
 perch 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.750

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.730
 six points everywhere 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.890
 very well and bernard laporte enjoyed 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.810
 the trajectory pole attention shoot 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.450
 after dangerous with my jar followed and 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.360
 masoe who are injured who does not concede 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.460
 not to the five fray 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.000
 with us for wisniewski on 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.680
 Outside 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.210
 esteban between them two chased by 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.009
 bastareaud and escapes him estebanez who 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.360
 pay what still escapes plating 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.820
 that he was going to score back in extremis 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.870
 for ankle support and that's it 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.459
 the test of the metro racing the 3g cashed 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.370

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.010
 is a situation of three against two there 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.840
 will try framing overflow on

 bastareaud the succeed esteban she is 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.790
 there the physical power of the old 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.100
 Brive that escapes two tackles and 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.290
 who allows himself in defense 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.610
 toulonnaise to serve beautifully his 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.570
 comrade henry chavancy there is the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.370
 departure of the action the framing 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.080
 overflow on bastareaud he escapes 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.630
 then to the life of this missile is 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.060
 recovered extremism by hermitage and 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.860

 taken by the defense of racing and 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.370
 sir lafon returns the penalty 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.720
 it will pass exactly 998 points under 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.290
 the Toulon jersey for jonny 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.959
 wilkinson 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.310
 but what's important at 7 minutes is 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.700
 know it got closer it was a 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.569

 Guyto Wilkinson Swiss to Swiss 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.590
 powerful merlot 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.840
 which gives to the rite aid which rushes 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.880
 which is echoed by veneer 2009 which has 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.520
 barely five meters from the goal 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.440
 racing metro mermoz oppression half of 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.480
 melee chase is belted by estevan and 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.120
 this while the siren sounds that 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.490
 logical sedan that ends up touching and that 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.830
 the ch has not whistled the end of the match on 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.410
 a breathtaking victory in racing 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.860
 subway 19 to 15 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.990
 toulon fell tonight at mayol for the 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.180
 first time of shiso and bernard 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.120
 Laporte has just learned in his 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.340
 cloakroom went to the end of themselves 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.419
 and an exceptional effort at the end of 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.820
 match 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.370
 in defense yes with fabrice 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.229
 estebanez completely exhausted match 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.520
 heroic on your part you did 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.870
 to fall the leader who was a lived here 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.020
 but I can not believe it with 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.380
 a real pass and difficult times 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.380
 we say 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.240
 jallet I said on arrival this potting soil 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.240
 as proof that we must be proud of this 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.440
 jersey that's for sure we have not we do not have 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.900
 what columns the pilou pilou 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.130
 we do not have this formidable formidable 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.060
 stable geo lasserre stadium I told them 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.389

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.040
 jersey the racing club and is one of 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.770
 biggest clubs the oldest club of 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.260
 France and I think we did not say anything to 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.900
 everyone was glued a president 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.520
 which is actually swirling the stage of 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.460
 doves took more and more 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.980
 leggings to tell them we're proud 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.870
 dear to all players we go racing 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.880
 fight to the end to reach 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.200
 Our goals 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.330

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.820
 rays even you made war on you 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.950
 they won the war tonight yeah 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.700
 they have they played very very good this 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:03.310
 evening with a lot of fact and it was 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.150
 hard for bare skin to these two we are 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.040
 very disappointed but 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.150
 we will work we will work 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.960
 have to win again and 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.540
 yeah we did not have to be here once so 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.120
 it's not the only one to have been hands of 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.790
 the same is waiting and it's not over for us 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.840
 definitely but congratulations to them 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.070
 they are very very good tonight thank you I 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.740
 we would be with dimitri szarzewski 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.390
 the captain of the real racing feat 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.030
 can you build 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.200
 after that kind of success you're 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.540
 went to get the most why does not want 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.440
 not at least I hope we show this 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.950
 tonight we are able to make 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.870
 beautiful things tonight there was a beautiful 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.100
 solidarity 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.360
 we knew it was difficult but we 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.220
 did it right now you do not have to 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.900
 to ignite one must try to stay a 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.790
 blog continues to train well because 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.680
 that novels being laid lapse the 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:55.620
 recipe to come win here so this is 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.820
 really to attack Toulon yes 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.900
 that's the answer to the challenge 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.190
 physical I think would go 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.020
 podium at a big defense 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.390
 we went up to get them we won 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.730
 some impacts we were disciplined 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:08.010
 so a nice conquest again tonight 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.480
 yes these ingredients to beat the 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.590
 best teams even though tonight 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.780
 Toulon can be a little bit 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.150
 in but yes we are really going 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.100
 really savor this victory and then 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.230
 here we are going to start having to go 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.820
 in the round of 16 facing us 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.560
 to Saracens for the upcoming integration 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.140
 thanks dimitri and then come because she 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.300
 risk of being complicated it was said and 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.800
 repeated huge debauchery of energy tonight 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.740
 where you have created a real feat 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.230
 you had come for that good one 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.120
 especially came to measure up to the 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.430
 most beautiful team of this championship and 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.630
 I think we did it with 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.370
 the heart we did not let go that's true 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.080
 that we did well after mid 

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.160
 time despite the fact that we bypass 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.470
 with three points behind 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.970
 I think we did not let go of his skis 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.800
 that's what has changed compared to water 

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.880
 to meet last that is the match 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.780
 back and play -off where we had 

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.070
 cracked in second half 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.510
 I think we cracked them 

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.980
 So we are very happy tonight 

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.650
 a click for racing 

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.580
 in view of this end of season ben I 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.590
 do not know if it's a click that would 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.670
 from so low we have we are 

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.600
 able to lose against the last to 

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.190
 home and we are able to go 

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.120
 win against the first to 

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.950
 outside so it's a little bit 

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.120
 paradox of racing this year but good 

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.050
 I think that's what puts us on 

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.370
 good bases in any case for the 

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.370
 second part of the season thank you
