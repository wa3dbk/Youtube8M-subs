00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.860
 a year without weird 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.480
 a long time I never had apparent and 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.640
 what happens that is a little bit going 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.950
 wearing first he had a lot of grace 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.720
 the theater read me a lot of things and 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.000
 did not come what I wanted and I found what 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.829
 I wanted to loved what this proposal 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.239
 that it was going to be and I felt that I had to 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.619
 have a break especially for the 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.140
 format that there is now nor with the only 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.579
 format that is on the strip or if not 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.720
 work for eleven or twelve of the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.190
 night with which I grew up that there is little 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.350
 solitary it is difficult to put unitar 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.960
 there is practically no vulnerable 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 wonderful resurrection because he spoke 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.980
 with alfredo but but that really is not 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.390
 there is before I remember that the format was 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.399
 the whole week is a comedy all the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.260
 days of the week a comedy and it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.809
 worked otherwise two were recorded 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.030
 days a tamper day and outside the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.440
 record dies involves 12 hours 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.989
 within the channel living by and for 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.789
 and to look with pleasure I always go out 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.469
 with pleasure because apart I can not 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.009
 work in a different way from taquito no 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:12.350
 I can do it you have to leave and be there 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:14.210
 I allow that I love what I do and also 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.119
 I think you have to do it that way 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.500
 really and that happens to me after you 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.720
 the sequels remain but phoenix with a 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.830
 palm that you can not recover and had 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.570
 a pending subject that was the 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.340
 theater also a movie on TV 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.229
 but theater and cinema that was what I wanted 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.039
 to make film a skier the man the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.039
 world ski champion 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:42.009
 with the scenes of the man that no longer 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:46.090
 we can not for people who still do not 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.090
 let's do it
