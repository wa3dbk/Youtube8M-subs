front of me this guy is a level zero his
name<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.790> Church<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:47.300> feel<00:01:48.110> really<00:01:48.260> bad

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
name is Church I feel really bad

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.500 
name is Church I feel really bad
attacking<00:01:48.890> him<00:01:49.040> but<00:01:49.460> I'm<00:01:49.670> just<00:01:49.820> I<00:01:50.090> just<00:01:50.180> want

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
attacking him but I'm just I just want

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.660 
attacking him but I'm just I just want
to<00:01:50.570> test<00:01:50.720> what<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:50.930> mechanics<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.440> this<00:01:51.530> game

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
to test what the mechanics of this game

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.640 
to test what the mechanics of this game
and<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:52.850> we<00:01:52.970> are<00:01:53.120> attacking<00:01:53.480> with<00:01:53.720> my<00:01:53.840> knife<00:01:54.020> he

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
and so we are attacking with my knife he

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.270 
and so we are attacking with my knife he
is<00:01:54.740> attacking<00:01:55.010> me<00:01:55.220> back<00:01:55.400> as<00:01:55.670> well<00:01:55.970> I<00:01:57.190> tried<00:01:58.190> to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
is attacking me back as well I tried to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.580 
is attacking me back as well I tried to
stun<00:01:58.550> him<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.820> begin<00:01:59.150> with<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.630> I<00:02:00.170> don't<00:02:00.500> know

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
stun him to begin with and I don't know

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.320 
stun him to begin with and I don't know
if<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.800> worked<00:02:00.980> I<00:02:01.250> think<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.760> does<00:02:01.940> work<00:02:02.150> though

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
if it worked I think it does work though

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.889 
if it worked I think it does work though
you<00:02:02.390> have<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.720> get<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.900> right<00:02:03.050> hit

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.690 

so<00:02:07.899> this<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.170> in<00:02:08.289> real<00:02:08.470> time<00:02:08.709> there's<00:02:09.280> no<00:02:09.429> fast

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
so this is in real time there's no fast

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.610 
so this is in real time there's no fast
forwarding<00:02:10.149> right<00:02:10.840> now<00:02:10.959> in<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.319> in<00:02:11.500> this

level three I am actually not even at a
hundred<00:05:18.159> percent<00:05:18.370> health<00:05:18.639> right<00:05:18.880> now<00:05:19.000> so<00:05:19.979> he

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
hundred percent health right now so he

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.620 
hundred percent health right now so he
might<00:05:21.280> be<00:05:21.460> attacking<00:05:21.729> me<00:05:21.909> in<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.060> second

might be attacking me in a second

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.210 
might be attacking me in a second
it<00:05:22.840> wouldn't<00:05:23.229> surprise<00:05:23.380> me<00:05:23.530> actually<00:05:23.830> if<00:05:24.099> he's

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
it wouldn't surprise me actually if he's

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.010 
it wouldn't surprise me actually if he's
gonna<00:05:24.340> attack<00:05:24.490> me<00:05:24.720> especially<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:25.780> fact<00:05:25.960> that

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
gonna attack me especially the fact that

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.050 
gonna attack me especially the fact that
he's<00:05:26.229> sitting<00:05:26.470> here<00:05:26.770> he<00:05:27.159> probably<00:05:27.400> has<00:05:27.940> the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
he's sitting here he probably has the

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.360 
he's sitting here he probably has the
opportunity<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.630> maybe<00:05:28.750> loot<00:05:29.169> this<00:05:30.159> guy's

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
opportunity to maybe loot this guy's

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.969 
opportunity to maybe loot this guy's
elude<00:05:30.760> as<00:05:30.940> well<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.389> think<00:05:32.349> after<00:05:32.710> two<00:05:32.860> minutes

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
elude as well I think after two minutes

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.219 
elude as well I think after two minutes
is<00:05:33.310> probably<00:05:33.639> lootable<00:05:33.940> to<00:05:34.150> anybody<00:05:34.539> just

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
is probably lootable to anybody just

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:36.330 
is probably lootable to anybody just
because<00:05:35.470> I<00:05:35.500> killed<00:05:35.860> him<00:05:35.919> I<00:05:36.010> don't<00:05:36.130> think<00:05:36.250> it's

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
because I killed him I don't think it's

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.879 
because I killed him I don't think it's
just<00:05:36.460> lootable<00:05:36.699> to<00:05:36.880> me

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
just lootable to me

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.559 
just lootable to me
ouch<00:05:38.639> ouch<00:05:39.150> ouch<00:05:39.419> ouch<00:05:40.969> Wow<00:05:41.969> two<00:05:42.240> hits<00:05:42.449> already

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
Wow three hits I'm down to 40% so maybe

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.360 
Wow three hits I'm down to 40% so maybe
he<00:05:45.750> has<00:05:45.780> a<00:05:45.870> higher<00:05:46.169> level<00:05:46.590> weapon<00:05:47.069> or<00:05:47.189> maybe

maybe he's attaches to more damage
because<00:05:49.319> he<00:05:49.439> is<00:05:49.560> level<00:05:49.830> 3<00:05:49.979> I'm<00:05:50.069> not<00:05:50.129> sure<00:05:50.460> yet

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:14.869 
mean at least I'm healing but it's
definitely<00:07:12.750> taking<00:07:13.139> some<00:07:13.259> time<00:07:13.409> here<00:07:13.620> I<00:07:13.879> like

definitely taking some time here I like

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:15.920 
definitely taking some time here I like
this<00:07:15.060> is<00:07:15.210> a<00:07:15.240> pretty<00:07:15.419> cool<00:07:15.569> feature

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
this is a pretty cool feature

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.290 
this is a pretty cool feature
so<00:07:16.319> to<00:07:16.379> heal<00:07:17.039> as<00:07:17.430> of<00:07:17.580> now<00:07:17.699> you<00:07:17.759> have<00:07:18.000> to<00:07:18.150> put

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 
so to heal as of now you have to put

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.790 
so to heal as of now you have to put
dance<00:07:18.599> by<00:07:18.839> a<00:07:18.870> campfire<00:07:19.229> which<00:07:19.529> is<00:07:19.650> pretty

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
dance by a campfire which is pretty

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.119 
dance by a campfire which is pretty
sweet

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:20.129 
sweet

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.619 
sweet
I<00:07:20.250> think<00:07:20.460> there's<00:07:20.610> other<00:07:20.729> ways<00:07:21.120> to<00:07:21.180> kind<00:07:21.569> of

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:21.629 
I think there's other ways to kind of

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:22.850 
I think there's other ways to kind of
regain<00:07:21.870> health<00:07:22.050> as<00:07:22.259> well<00:07:22.409> and<00:07:22.560> I<00:07:22.589> think<00:07:22.740> this

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
regain health as well and I think this

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.219 
regain health as well and I think this
might<00:07:22.949> be<00:07:23.069> the<00:07:23.159> fastest<00:07:23.900> but<00:07:24.900> long<00:07:25.169> story

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:25.229 
might be the fastest but long story

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:27.679 
might be the fastest but long story
short<00:07:25.500> guys<00:07:25.770> really<00:07:26.460> loving<00:07:27.240> this<00:07:27.300> game<00:07:27.479> so

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:29.129 
far I think it's actually pretty cool

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:30.800 
far I think it's actually pretty cool
has<00:07:29.279> a<00:07:29.310> lot<00:07:29.430> of<00:07:29.520> potential<00:07:29.759> I<00:07:30.060> do<00:07:30.330> like<00:07:30.659> the

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810
