option to protect the tones will

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.359 
option to protect the tones will
minimize<00:00:55.659> clipping<00:00:56.409> in<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.860> shadow<00:00:57.159> and

minimize clipping in the shadow and
highlight<00:00:57.670> areas<00:00:58.030> but<00:00:58.600> more<00:00:58.869> specifically

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
highlight areas but more specifically

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.979 
highlight areas but more specifically
it'll<00:01:00.010> keep<00:01:00.250> any<00:01:00.489> color<00:01:00.879> shift<00:01:01.360> from

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
it'll keep any color shift from

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.410 
it'll keep any color shift from
happening<00:01:02.500> so<00:01:03.159> because<00:01:03.879> these<00:01:04.089> are

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
happening so because these are

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.350 
happening so because these are
destructive<00:01:05.409> paint<00:01:05.830> brush<00:01:06.189> tools<00:01:06.549> i'll<00:01:07.000> go

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
destructive paint brush tools i'll go

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.750 
destructive paint brush tools i'll go
ahead<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.720> duplicate<00:01:08.260> the<00:01:09.130> background<00:01:09.159> layer

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
ahead and duplicate the background layer

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.240 
ahead and duplicate the background layer
so<00:01:10.750> i'll<00:01:11.049> just<00:01:11.080> grab<00:01:11.350> this<00:01:11.619> brush<00:01:11.920> I'm<00:01:12.189> going

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
so i'll just grab this brush I'm going

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.090 
so i'll just grab this brush I'm going
to<00:01:12.400> affect<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:13.080> mid-tones<00:01:14.080> first<00:01:14.619> I'll<00:01:14.920> set

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
to affect the mid-tones first I'll set

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.070 
to affect the mid-tones first I'll set
the<00:01:15.220> exposure<00:01:15.549> to<00:01:15.820> fifty<00:01:16.060> percent<00:01:16.420> I'm<00:01:16.990> just

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
the exposure to fifty percent I'm just

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.890 
the exposure to fifty percent I'm just
going<00:01:17.259> to<00:01:17.350> paint<00:01:17.560> here<00:01:17.950> in<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.340> clouds<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
going to paint here in the clouds and

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.920 
going to paint here in the clouds and
you<00:01:20.259> can<00:01:20.380> see<00:01:20.560> what<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.770> nice<00:01:20.979> job<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.460> does

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you can see what a nice job it does

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.650 
you can see what a nice job it does
pulling<00:01:22.930> back<00:01:23.170> some<00:01:23.470> highlight<00:01:23.890> detail<00:01:24.310> there

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
pulling back some highlight detail there

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.130

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
range to the shadow areas i'm going to

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.910 
range to the shadow areas i'm going to
drop<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.480> exposure<00:01:32.020> down<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.740> about

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
drop the exposure down to about

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.910

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
mountain region and see here in the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.680 
mountain region and see here in the
caverns<00:01:39.780> does<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.810> good<00:01:41.290> job<00:01:42.480> pulling<00:01:43.480> that<00:01:43.690> in

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.170 
caverns does a good job pulling that in
and<00:01:46.690> then<00:01:46.810> i<00:01:46.870> can<00:01:47.050> switch<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.950> my<00:01:48.159> Dodge<00:01:48.640> tool

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
and then i can switch to my Dodge tool

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.710 
and then i can switch to my Dodge tool
which<00:01:49.450> would<00:01:49.659> lighten<00:01:50.370> again<00:01:51.370> I'll<00:01:51.640> use<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
which would lighten again I'll use the

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.270 
which would lighten again I'll use the
mid-tones<00:01:53.290> I'll<00:01:53.590> drop<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.100> about

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
mid-tones I'll drop that to about

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.310 
mid-tones I'll drop that to about
twenty-five<00:01:54.700> percent<00:01:54.900> want<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:55.960> bring<00:01:56.140> back

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
twenty-five percent want to bring back

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.410 
twenty-five percent want to bring back
any<00:01:56.590> highlights<00:01:57.400> here<00:01:57.760> on<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:57.940> front<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.390> could
