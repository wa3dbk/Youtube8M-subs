00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.220
 working with novice drivers us 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.630
 necessarily need a computer and it's like 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.429
 evil out of order means of course 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.430
 the information we needed to be extracted 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.180
 then somehow fix it bring 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.670
 workshop and pay for the work 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.810
 graphics card choking toad is very expensive 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.240
 card is better to buy a computer 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.750
 as well as the hard drive you could 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.200
 download information and all the problems but we 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.379
 conducted experiments really possible 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.000
 so to say in shock 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.850
 my friends don't even believe me 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.800
 just can not believe this is so ordinary 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.300
 the griddle you think on in order to 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.610
 cook eat dima you che do it 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.879
 pan need to tell good 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.539
 to burn the video card as a video card 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.960
 fry it 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.159
 literally yes cool 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.939
 wrap paper to the gate lay and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.979
 fry salt can be sprinkled with salt after 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.549
 water supply too you then tasted better 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.380
 eat 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.400
 to color a little picture of the canvas 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:22.170
 good graphics card out of order yes then 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:28.680
 have it overheated deformed 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 was then and then the Russian peasant understood 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.659
 how to troubleshoot and he did 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.920
 The following heated pan only charge 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:45.180
 need to put in paper before to not 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.829
 transfer excess heat to not happen 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.640
 overheating who so as not to melt 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.490
 payment 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.210
 and how much time is needed for 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.869
 to heat the paper 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.330
 will darken 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.960
 just getting dark began to take off 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:05.170
 Vanyu somehow as arranged Russian people 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.520
 yet he just doesn't do the main thing so that 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:13.770
 It did not work but even lowered and show 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.510
 some working options 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.900
 Initially it already says that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.670
 cat resuscitation it was kind of understand 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.550
 probably never understand foreigners and 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:31.150
 that we will help you pay fees of course 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:33.450
 to them, it will not come never a little 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.450
 pinched 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.260
 on the one hand, they are easier for them to change 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.320
 other all but we are arranged so that we both 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.060
 would be a little bit of a movie snore pack and patient 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.290
 and we can pick on for a long time and in the spirit 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.370
 we have a lot of tolerance 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.370
 probably the most likely 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.810
 malia good workshop 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:16.019
 we'll click on the button and try 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.950
 understand whether 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:29.239
 fire in the card earned a computer and so 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:36.379
 we click on the button now we turn on 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:41.579
 charge the battery a little cheer up 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:45.239
 some light bulbs already lit up 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.030
 you know honestly i personally and here 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.170
 now in shock 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:56.150
 the picture appeared so the computer 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:04:01.099
 turns on and to this after repair in 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:05.389
 normal workshop 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.389
 which serves sheets 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.570
 once again you wonder how interesting 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.730
 Russian man and wonder how so 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:22.360
 can be wrapped in paper 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:29.650
 graphics card put on the pan 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:31.780
 turn on the tile and fix the computer this 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:39.220
 not a fairy tale and it is a true story 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:42.610
 and we will easily get as 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:47.110
 stuff and put it on this hard 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:53.290
 the disk is such an interesting situation 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:57.210
 thank you master and you do not forget about 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:01.200
 that autocad will always help you 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.200
 drive a car
