00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
look at the end title track as I see the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.160 
look at the end title track as I see the
first<00:00:05.310> track<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.730> me<00:00:05.879> where<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.480> worked<00:00:06.720> on<00:00:06.960> it

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
first track of me where we worked on it

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.660 
first track of me where we worked on it
was<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.470> reason<00:00:07.740> why<00:00:07.859> things<00:00:07.919> went<00:00:08.400> really

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
was the reason why things went really

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.919 
was the reason why things went really
smooth<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.210> reason<00:00:09.420> why<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.630> had<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.750> great

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
smooth and the reason why we had a great

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.330 
smooth and the reason why we had a great
time<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.290> because<00:00:10.440> we<00:00:10.650> crack<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> title<00:00:11.250> track

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
time is because we crack the title track

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.830 
time is because we crack the title track
it<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.820> most<00:00:12.030> difficult<00:00:12.150> track<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.719> make

it is the most difficult track to make
on<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.049> soundtrack<00:00:13.290> because<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> fact

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
on the soundtrack because of the fact

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.580 
on the soundtrack because of the fact
