00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
so I am making full on acrylic cosmos

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.330

two doors with the bend I will not be
porting<00:00:17.760> them<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.449> if<00:00:18.990> anybody<00:00:19.380> request<00:00:19.770> ports

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
porting them so if anybody request ports

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.689 
porting them so if anybody request ports
then<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:21.300> course<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.630> won't<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:21.990> doing<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.230> so
