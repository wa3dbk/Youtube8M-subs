00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hi we are all here with a new one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 video a video of black ops 2 and gods 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.889
 glitch then today for you or six glitches 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.450
 new someone found someone from us 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.029
 seen online and I want to show them to you 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.460
 first is this of the asp the cola we will have to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.939
 in fact place on this moretto the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.980
 catapult in the right way and you will succeed 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.390
 to enter the wall and you will not come 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.460
 attacked by zombies the problem is that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.710
 you probably won't be able to get out 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.780
 you will have to destroy the catapult and then 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.460
 probably and with so much luck 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.059
 you will be able to escape this is the view 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.739
 lateral 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.250
 let's see how it looks from the side like this 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.329
 you can better understand how to position 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:54.539
 the catapult here you have to have a 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.199
 piece out is a piece more or less inside 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.640
 in half and work 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.640
 you will be stuck in the new 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.790
 here are even networks 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.950
 now let's go to the test so I do 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.540
 see that what I said is not one 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.790
 crap 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.890
 here's all the zombies below 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.420
 and we can kill them now we have 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.360
 a pistolino but we can anyway 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.399
 kill them chile or even around high though 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.149
 and this glitch only works from 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:44.750
 alone so we can not bias in 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:47.450
 blue in the group now there were so many 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:53.950
 doubts and I intervened with the father 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:58.130
 leiser ok ok 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.009
 let's move on to the second glitch on 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.619
 second glitch is a bit dark then 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:09.319
 you will have great difficulty in positioning 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:13.280
 well the catapult and it is nearby 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.489
 alpaca punch is quiet sorry to which 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.980
 creval so in the beginning it is 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.769
 correctly positioned by glee 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.730
 you will find in the wall and also the zombies here 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:32.510
 not to attack and from here you will succeed 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:36.140
 to go out then we move on to the third third 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.640
 glitches that will consist in going to the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:45.049
 cell of the open giant place the 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.989
 catapult this is how a piece is 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.470
 outside and the rest is inside 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:57.769
 here you can see just some lantern 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:02.299
 so he can catapult you in now 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:04.130
 mass that you go to the disparate giant 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.970
 so he angry will close in 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.970
 cell 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.510
 here you see so at this point we can 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.340
 move to the test that consists of 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.940
 being able to enter the closed cell 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.730
 you don't do by the council giant 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.950
 like us now but first equip yourself with 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.370
 key so you can exit whenever you want 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.990
 if you do as we do now you remain closed 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.990
 you must end the game forever 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.290
 you have seen it does not always work he has it 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:43.390
 taken badly and failed to enter 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.010
 however with if you put yourself straight maybe 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.250
 you don't succeed in entering without 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.250
 problems 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:54.100
 however the problem with this glitch is 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.959
 that zombies will not attack you pines 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.580
 they will not come towards you but 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.890
 they will simply turn to the map 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.360
 so it will be very inconvenient to kill them 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.550
 you will have to kill through the windows 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.430
 or wait for the fourth bleach to pass 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.250
 has been seen online failed e 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.340
 consists of placing the catapult in 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.350
 this way is more or less successful 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.310
 enter that triangle formed by 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.430
 from the wall from the cell and from the door of the 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.430
 cell 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.900
 we did not succeed 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.900
 try it you maybe you have more luck 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.759
 eat this 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.249
 well now let's move on to the fifth glitch e 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.960
 this also failed because of 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.909
 a railing that always moved us into 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.370
 forward anyway you will have to jump on 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:58.949
 railing so to be glissato in this 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:02.479
 way and see that it keeps falling on 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:05.999
 character of my friend, however, still 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:09.029
 you have to place the catapult there 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:14.430
 when you are flying the sixth and last 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:16.860
 glik which is the best consists in 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.979
 place the catapult against the wall 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.479
 near the lantern here in the curve for 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:26.099
 go to the beginning then in one of the 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.270
 tunnels 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.210
 this is the best because you have 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.719
 possibility of movement you can 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:39.469
 take all the zombies bonuses there 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:43.710
 they will attack and you can also enter 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:47.129
 34 so you can do if you can burn 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.870
 all and pass endless rounds the 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.370
 the problem with this glitch is that it is not there 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.569
 way out then once 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:57.479
 revenue can not escape is another 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:01.919
 what it is you have to be careful to move 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:05.189
 because sometimes, running back, yes 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:08.310
 can fall down or by shooting a lot with 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:11.159
 the rai gun lag 2v will shoot back with 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.219
 the recoil so you can fall 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:17.310
 or we can you can climb on and 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:23.789
 have a broad view of the whole part 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:26.490
 of given map and there are some points 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.409
 where there is no collision then you will die 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.729
 see you all see you in a 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:31.729
 next video be fine
