reason that that's why these the

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.880 
reason that that's why these the

aluminum was cut out like that was

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.310 
aluminum was cut out like that was
because<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.460> whale<00:00:53.699> tail<00:00:53.940> right<00:00:54.180> here

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
because of this whale tail right here

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.319 
because of this whale tail right here
and<00:00:55.320> why<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.399> call<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> whale<00:00:56.879> tail<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and why they call it the whale tail the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.729 
and why they call it the whale tail the
way<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.930> aluminum<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.530> designed<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.129> it

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
way that the aluminum is designed on it
