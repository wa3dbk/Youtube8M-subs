that swims in the water column it's
pretty<00:00:47.260> much<00:00:47.350> going<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.620> be<00:00:47.800> these<00:00:48.609> little

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
pretty much going to be these little

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.720 
pretty much going to be these little
minnows<00:00:49.149> or<00:00:50.039> using<00:00:51.039> the<00:00:51.129> summer<00:00:51.340> after<00:00:51.519> the

most of what they're feeding on in the
water<00:00:58.210> column<00:00:58.449> is<00:00:58.690> probably<00:00:58.929> going<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.140> be

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
water column is probably going to be

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.110 
water column is probably going to be
small<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.550> biggest<00:01:00.699> thing<00:01:00.879> they<00:01:01.059> probably

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
small the biggest thing they probably

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.729 
small the biggest thing they probably
feed<00:01:01.449> on<00:01:01.600> our<00:01:01.749> crawdads<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.410> those<00:01:02.559> are

feed on our crawdads and those are
usually<00:01:02.859> on<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.550> bottom<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.259> have<00:01:05.530> a<00:01:05.740> few

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
usually on the bottom and I have a few

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.280 
usually on the bottom and I have a few
different<00:01:06.490> ones<00:01:06.579> that<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:06.909> use<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.840> course<00:01:08.170> I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
different ones that I use of course I

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.929 
different ones that I use of course I
have<00:01:08.409> one<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.710> looks<00:01:08.860> like<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:09.310> little

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
have one that looks like a little

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.969 
have one that looks like a little
sunfish<00:01:10.299> little<00:01:10.840> bluegill<00:01:11.079> or<00:01:11.500> green<00:01:11.710> sunfish

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
sunfish little bluegill or green sunfish

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.249 
sunfish little bluegill or green sunfish
or<00:01:12.310> something<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:13.329> it's<00:01:13.720> about<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.079> size

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
or something and it's about the size

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.950 
or something and it's about the size
they'll<00:01:14.590> be<00:01:14.850> getting<00:01:15.850> into<00:01:16.149> like<00:01:16.299> june<00:01:16.720> july

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
they'll be getting into like june july

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.289 
they'll be getting into like june july
august<00:01:17.350> when<00:01:17.890> they're<00:01:18.040> after<00:01:18.369> this<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:19.119> hatch

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
august when they're after this the hatch

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.710 
august when they're after this the hatch
they'll<00:01:19.630> start<00:01:19.869> being<00:01:20.079> about<00:01:20.259> this<00:01:20.770> size<00:01:21.720> now

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
they'll start being about this size now

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.210 
they'll start being about this size now
so<00:01:22.780> i'll<00:01:22.990> have<00:01:23.079> this<00:01:23.320> little<00:01:23.470> swim<00:01:23.770> bait<00:01:23.979> which

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
so i'll have this little swim bait which

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.160 
so i'll have this little swim bait which
very<00:01:24.729> much<00:01:24.880> mimics<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.630> looks<00:01:25.810> like<00:01:25.990> those

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
very much mimics and looks like those

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.630 
very much mimics and looks like those
little<00:01:26.350> Fathead<00:01:26.680> minnows<00:01:26.829> to<00:01:27.220> swim<00:01:27.430> around

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
little Fathead minnows to swim around

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.060 
little Fathead minnows to swim around
and<00:01:27.970> this<00:01:28.899> is<00:01:29.020> about<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.649> biggest<00:01:29.770> they'll

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
and this is about the biggest they'll

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.950 
and this is about the biggest they'll
get<00:01:30.250> using<00:01:31.030> maybe<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.299> little<00:01:31.509> smaller<00:01:31.689> than

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
get using maybe a little smaller than

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.609 
get using maybe a little smaller than
this<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.729> i<00:01:33.850> also<00:01:33.880> have<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.299> little<00:01:34.960> teeny<00:01:35.350> baby

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
this and i also have a little teeny baby

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.399 
this and i also have a little teeny baby
one<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.540> lot<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:37.960> times<00:01:38.140> you're<00:01:38.259> not

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
one now a lot of times you're not

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.380 
one now a lot of times you're not
thinking<00:01:38.770> using<00:01:39.399> something<00:01:39.610> so<00:01:39.820> small<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.270> get

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
thinking using something so small to get

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.450 
thinking using something so small to get
yourself<00:01:40.540> good<00:01:41.200> three<00:01:41.530> four<00:01:41.740> five<00:01:41.950> pound<00:01:42.219> fish

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
yourself good three four five pound fish

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.060 
yourself good three four five pound fish
but<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.960> said<00:01:44.170> in<00:01:44.259> these<00:01:44.350> ponds<00:01:44.619> that's

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
but like said in these ponds that's

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.279 
but like said in these ponds that's
pretty<00:01:45.280> much<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.460> profile<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.240> what<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:47.110> feed

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
pretty much the profile of what to feed

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.660 
pretty much the profile of what to feed
none<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:47.860> when<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.159> have<00:01:48.250> something<00:01:48.520> this

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
none so when you have something this

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.850 
none so when you have something this
size<00:01:48.850> goes<00:01:49.119> by<00:01:49.329> them<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:50.289> looks<00:01:50.500> very<00:01:50.680> natural

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
size goes by them it looks very natural

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.319 
size goes by them it looks very natural
looks<00:01:51.430> like<00:01:51.579> something<00:01:51.820> they<00:01:51.880> usually<00:01:52.149> feed

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
looks like something they usually feed

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.569 
looks like something they usually feed
on<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:52.750> you're<00:01:53.079> probably<00:01:53.229> most<00:01:53.439> likely<00:01:53.890> going

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
on and you're probably most likely going

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.700 
on and you're probably most likely going
to<00:01:54.670> catch<00:01:54.820> them<00:01:54.969> that<00:01:55.090> way<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:56.229> works<00:01:56.439> for<00:01:56.590> me<00:01:56.680> a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
to catch them that way it works for me a

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.429 
to catch them that way it works for me a
lot<00:01:56.979> on<00:01:57.280> this<00:01:58.030> pond<00:01:58.299> and<00:01:58.539> it's<00:01:59.079> fun<00:01:59.259> too

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
lot on this pond and it's fun too

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.020 
lot on this pond and it's fun too
because<00:01:59.680> you<00:02:00.070> do<00:02:00.189> catch<00:02:00.369> little<00:02:00.640> one<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:00.939> you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
because you do catch little one so you

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.340 
because you do catch little one so you
catching<00:02:01.359> more<00:02:01.450> fish<00:02:01.630> all<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.869> time<00:02:01.930> so<00:02:02.289> it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
catching more fish all the time so it
