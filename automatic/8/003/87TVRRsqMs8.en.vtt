okay<00:00:01.199> let's<00:00:01.469> share<00:00:01.709> some<00:00:01.979> some<00:00:02.790> ideas<00:00:03.179> for

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
okay let's share some some ideas for

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.230 
okay let's share some some ideas for
building<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:03.780> sort<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.110> Windows<00:00:04.410> seven

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
building this sort of Windows seven

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.330 
building this sort of Windows seven
batch<00:00:06.240> file<00:00:06.660> personally<00:00:07.410> I'm<00:00:07.470> amazed<00:00:07.770> how<00:00:08.069> I'm

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
batch file personally I'm amazed how I'm

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.030 
batch file personally I'm amazed how I'm
powerful<00:00:09.349> batch<00:00:10.349> files<00:00:10.670> are<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:12.059> grew<00:00:12.389> up<00:00:12.450> on

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
powerful batch files are I grew up on

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.279 
powerful batch files are I grew up on
DOS<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.070> UNIX<00:00:14.700> Bourne<00:00:15.030> shells<00:00:15.389> I've<00:00:15.809> long<00:00:16.049> ago

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
DOS and UNIX Bourne shells I've long ago

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.529 
DOS and UNIX Bourne shells I've long ago
forgotten<00:00:16.820> more<00:00:17.820> than<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.029> ever<00:00:18.150> knew<00:00:18.270> about

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
forgotten more than I ever knew about

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.460 
forgotten more than I ever knew about
programming<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.100> still<00:00:20.400> sometimes<00:00:20.640> enjoy

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
programming but I still sometimes enjoy

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.490 
programming but I still sometimes enjoy
writing<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> script<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.460> find<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.420> batch<00:00:25.260> file

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
writing a script and I find a batch file

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.670 
writing a script and I find a batch file
is<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.680> very<00:00:25.859> convenient<00:00:26.160> way<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
is a very convenient way to do that and

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
is a very convenient way to do that and
I'll<00:00:28.680> I'm<00:00:28.859> very<00:00:29.099> surprised<00:00:29.490> how<00:00:29.869> powerful

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
I'll I'm very surprised how powerful

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.930 
I'll I'm very surprised how powerful
they<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.130> now<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> wanted<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> share<00:00:32.759> some

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
they are now so I wanted to share some

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.220 
they are now so I wanted to share some
ideas<00:00:33.180> particularly<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.809> these<00:00:33.899> sort<00:00:34.140> of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
ideas particularly for these sort of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.970 
ideas particularly for these sort of
bouncing<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.300> bouncing<00:00:36.300> objects<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
bouncing and bouncing objects and the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
bouncing and bouncing objects and the
trick<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.730> trick<00:00:38.969> with<00:00:39.180> them<00:00:39.329> really<00:00:39.629> seems

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
trick the trick with them really seems

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.639 
trick the trick with them really seems
to<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.850> to<00:00:41.850> build<00:00:42.690> your<00:00:42.840> screen<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.559> your

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
to be to build your screen to do your

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.369 
to be to build your screen to do your
calculations<00:00:44.840> separately<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.200> to

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
calculations separately and then to

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.819 
calculations separately and then to
display<00:00:46.739> them<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.670> fast<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:49.020> fast<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> can

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
display them as fast as fast as you can

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.510 
display them as fast as fast as you can
and<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.700> good<00:00:50.879> example<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.690> these

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
and a good example of that is these

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.689 
and a good example of that is these
swarming<00:00:53.520> numbers<00:00:54.800> which<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.949> very<00:00:56.219> very

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
swarming numbers which is very very

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.910 
swarming numbers which is very very
compact<00:00:57.030> code<00:00:57.329> 25<00:00:57.930> lines<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.379> code<00:00:58.590> six

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
different commands after a bit of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.310 
different commands after a bit of
initialization<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.609> main<00:01:02.879> thing<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
initialization the main thing really is

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.950 
initialization the main thing really is
this<00:01:04.500> loop<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:06.000> you've<00:01:06.119> got<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> calculation

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this loop and you've got the calculation

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840 
this loop and you've got the calculation
of<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.140> change<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.770> each<00:01:07.799> object<00:01:08.100> after<00:01:08.670> up

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
of a change for each object after up

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.450 
of a change for each object after up
down<00:01:09.060> left<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.450> right<00:01:10.159> combining<00:01:11.159> them<00:01:11.280> into

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
down left or right combining them into

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.109 
down left or right combining them into
rows<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.320> clearing<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.950> screen<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
rows and then clearing the screen and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.440 
rows and then clearing the screen and
displaying<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.710> rows<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.280> fast<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:18.180> fast

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
displaying the the rows as fast as fast

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.649 
displaying the the rows as fast as fast
as<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.009> gives<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.340> very

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
as you can and I think that gives a very

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.810 
as you can and I think that gives a very
powerful<00:01:21.860> illusion<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.920> speed<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> bit

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
powerful illusion of speed it is a bit

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.859 
powerful illusion of speed it is a bit
of<00:01:23.939> an<00:01:24.030> illusion<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.630> look<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
of an illusion if you look at the

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.210 
of an illusion if you look at the
individual<00:01:27.869> speed<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.380> up<00:01:28.530> down<00:01:28.560> it's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
individual speed of up down it's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.560 
individual speed of up down it's
surprisingly<00:01:29.880> slow<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.890> indeed<00:01:32.570> left-right

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
surprisingly slow and indeed left-right

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.010 
surprisingly slow and indeed left-right
is<00:01:33.780> surprisingly<00:01:34.350> slow<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:35.670> well<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
is surprisingly slow as well so it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.660 
is surprisingly slow as well so it
combined<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.770> different<00:01:37.799> directions<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
combined in different directions and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.889 
combined in different directions and
bouncing<00:01:39.090> off<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> edge<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:40.560> looks

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
bouncing off the edge that looks

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.389 
bouncing off the edge that looks
amazingly<00:01:42.899> dynamic<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.740> certainly<00:01:44.100> amazed

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
amazingly dynamic that certainly amazed

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.399 
amazingly dynamic that certainly amazed
and<00:01:44.790> amazed<00:01:45.570> me<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.880> it's<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:49.170> not<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and amazed me and it's not it's not a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.950 
and amazed me and it's not it's not a
huge<00:01:49.759> leap<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.909> faith<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.479> think<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.780> using

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
huge leap of faith to think of using

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.160 
huge leap of faith to think of using
some<00:01:52.259> more<00:01:53.299> interesting<00:01:54.299> characters<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.990> move

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
some more interesting characters to move

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.670 
some more interesting characters to move
around<00:01:56.090> as<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.299> did<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> first<00:01:57.689> examples

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
around as I did in the first examples

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.620 
around as I did in the first examples
this<00:01:58.860> example<00:01:59.189> which<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.700> reading<00:02:00.299> text

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this example which is a reading text

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.539 
this example which is a reading text
from<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.840> file<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.380> can't<00:02:01.649> read<00:02:01.860> war<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.399> peace

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
from a file you can't read war and peace

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.380 
from a file you can't read war and peace
but<00:02:02.909> 100<00:02:03.240> characters

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
of the snakes and that looks good I

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.009 
of the snakes and that looks good I
wanted<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.930> also<00:03:08.050> draw<00:03:08.380> attention<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.970> the

wanted to also draw attention to the

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.979 
wanted to also draw attention to the
title<00:03:11.019> bar<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.230> think<00:03:11.590> that's<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:13.120> use<00:03:13.269> of<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
title bar I think that's the use of the

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.009 
title bar I think that's the use of the
title<00:03:14.170> command<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.739> batch<00:03:14.860> files<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:16.600> again

title command in batch files is again

title command in batch files is again
surprisingly<00:03:17.680> powerful<00:03:17.920> for<00:03:18.550> for<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.420> bit<00:03:19.540> of
