00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.999
 It is difficult to choose a vacation spot that makes the whole 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.999
 family 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.960
 that's why we decided on Madrid 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.500
 Jorge has a very complete hotel offer to go with children 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.740
 and a variety of leisure activities that is perfect for any family 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.130
 Thanks to its diversity and its eclecticism Madrid has a space 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.140
 for all 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.490
 It is a city that knows how to be quiet bustling urban natural cultural viva 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 for my daughter the perfect plan to see the zor 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.240
 so we spent the morning there enjoying its huge variety of 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 animals 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.149
 and in the afternoon he told me it was clear we could not leave madris without 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.149
 take you to the amusement park 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.489
 we had a great time 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.819
 in the end I did not know who the children were and they for the others 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.079
 we still had many things to do 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.079
 many things to discover 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.920
 but we wanted a quick dinner and spend some time having fun 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.920
 family 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.639
 the second day was calmer 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.409
 After enjoying a good breakfast we started touring the center 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.409
 from the city 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.709
 I wanted to visit the forum case because I had been told that the building 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.859
 It was spectacular and its amazing exhibitions 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:23.309
 the case of forum is in the art walk the greatest concentration of art of 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.309
 Europe 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.580
 and in its vicinity is the neighborhood of the letters 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.180
 there we all the family went to browse through its shops and galleries 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.180
 art 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.629
 the walk opened our appetite and we found a very special place to 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:18.509
 eat 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.509
 right next to the main square and the door of the sun 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.270
 in the afternoon my wife took the reins 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.449
 I wanted to give the children a detail to remind them of the trip 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.400
 and already buy some delicatessen 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.180
 Then I had a big surprise ready for everyone 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.139

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.139

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:46.729
 Awesome 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.740
 for dinner we wanted something special and after assessing a lot of 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.679
 restaurants we decided on the one that was inside the stadium itself 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.280
