this trip just to test out I just showed
you<00:00:19.340> the<00:00:19.490> first<00:00:19.670> design<00:00:20.060> of<00:00:20.210> the<00:00:20.300> focus<00:00:20.630> pan

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
you the first design of the focus pan

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.210 
you the first design of the focus pan
the<00:00:21.020> original<00:00:21.470> design<00:00:21.740> and<00:00:21.920> I<00:00:21.950> wanted<00:00:22.130> to

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220

share with you another design that's

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.890 
share with you another design that's
definitely<00:00:24.349> more<00:00:24.500> useful<00:00:25.040> this<00:00:25.550> here<00:00:25.970> is<00:00:26.090> the

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
definitely more useful this here is the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.720 
definitely more useful this here is the
second<00:00:27.410> generation<00:00:27.860> of<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.010> focus<00:00:28.369> pan<00:00:28.550> as

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
second generation of the focus pan as

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.550 
second generation of the focus pan as
you<00:00:28.760> can<00:00:29.000> see<00:00:29.150> it<00:00:29.300> just<00:00:29.330> attaches<00:00:30.020> to<00:00:30.230> a<00:00:30.259> normal

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
you can see it just attaches to a normal

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.740 
you can see it just attaches to a normal
gold<00:00:30.800> pan<00:00:31.070> here<00:00:31.400> and<00:00:31.699> it's<00:00:32.270> got<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.599> same

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
gold pan here and it's got the same

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.299 
gold pan here and it's got the same
funnel<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.290> same<00:00:33.500> screen<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.129> everything

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
funnel the same screen and everything

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.920 
funnel the same screen and everything
else<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.790> only<00:00:34.850> difference<00:00:35.300> is<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:35.600> can<00:00:35.629> see

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
else the only difference is you can see

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.410 
else the only difference is you can see
is<00:00:36.170> this<00:00:36.680> really<00:00:37.129> nice<00:00:37.280> rubber<00:00:37.699> seal<00:00:38.150> that

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
is this really nice rubber seal that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.119 
is this really nice rubber seal that
goes<00:00:38.480> all<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:38.840> way<00:00:38.989> around<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.590> edge<00:00:39.739> of<00:00:40.040> the

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
goes all the way around the edge of the

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.860 
goes all the way around the edge of the
focus<00:00:40.460> pan<00:00:40.670> it's<00:00:43.300> creating<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.360> great<00:00:44.600> seal

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
focus pan it's creating a great seal

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.900 
focus pan it's creating a great seal
between<00:00:45.080> the<00:00:45.320> focus<00:00:45.739> pan<00:00:45.980> in<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.309> lower<00:00:46.519> pan

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
between the focus pan in the lower pan

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.880 
between the focus pan in the lower pan
this<00:00:47.750> allows<00:00:48.050> for<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.379> turn<00:00:48.589> the<00:00:48.739> whole

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
this allows for you to turn the whole

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.219 
this allows for you to turn the whole
thing<00:00:48.920> over<00:00:49.309> like<00:00:49.640> this<00:00:49.850> shift<00:00:50.690> it<00:00:50.870> out<00:00:50.989> and

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
thing over like this shift it out and

out of the lower pan here let me go

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.020 
out of the lower pan here let me go
ahead<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:54.769> take<00:00:55.010> this<00:00:55.190> apart<00:00:55.309> for<00:00:55.729> you<00:00:55.850> just

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
screen off the top of the nut you can

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.230 
screen off the top of the nut you can
see<00:01:10.100> there<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.400> bolt<00:01:10.610> sticking<00:01:10.970> out<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.180> the

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.990 
to trap all that gold that makes it to
the<00:01:32.630> hole<00:01:32.810> down<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:33.619> lower<00:01:33.829> pan<00:01:34.250> that's

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
the hole down in this lower pan that's

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.310 
the hole down in this lower pan that's
going<00:01:35.179> to<00:01:35.240> make<00:01:35.359> sure<00:01:35.570> even<00:01:35.929> if<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:36.109> tip<00:01:36.289> it

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
going to make sure even if you tip it

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.840 
going to make sure even if you tip it
totally<00:01:36.770> sideways<00:01:37.009> there's<00:01:37.399> no<00:01:37.520> way<00:01:37.700> that

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
totally sideways there's no way that

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.910 
totally sideways there's no way that
gold<00:01:38.119> once<00:01:38.719> this<00:01:38.960> is<00:01:39.109> sideways<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.740> going<00:01:39.859> to

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
gold once this is sideways is going to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.349 
gold once this is sideways is going to
ride<00:01:40.130> all<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.609> way<00:01:40.640> up<00:01:40.850> towards<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.210> center

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
ride all the way up towards the center

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.060 
ride all the way up towards the center
of<00:01:41.570> that<00:01:41.689> bolt<00:01:41.929> and<00:01:42.020> then<00:01:42.200> pop<00:01:42.409> out<00:01:42.619> that<00:01:42.799> hole

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
of that bolt and then pop out that hole

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.919 
of that bolt and then pop out that hole
it<00:01:43.520> just<00:01:43.759> won't<00:01:43.909> do<00:01:44.149> it's<00:01:44.359> not<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.630> way<00:01:44.719> gold

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
it just won't do it's not the way gold

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:45.399 
it just won't do it's not the way gold
works

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
works

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.929 
works
so<00:01:45.740> all<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.009> gold<00:01:46.219> even<00:01:46.369> when<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:46.640> tilt<00:01:46.789> the

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
so all the gold even when you tilt the

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.060 
so all the gold even when you tilt the
sideways<00:01:47.329> will<00:01:47.509> get<00:01:47.630> trapped<00:01:47.960> in<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.770> side<00:01:48.950> of

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
sideways will get trapped in the side of

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.279 
sideways will get trapped in the side of
the<00:01:49.130> pan<00:01:49.310> typically<00:01:50.149> what<00:01:50.299> I<00:01:50.329> have<00:01:50.539> is<00:01:50.810> set<00:01:51.170> up

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
the pan typically what I have is set up

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.569 
the pan typically what I have is set up
so<00:01:51.469> the<00:01:51.560> riffles<00:01:51.920> are<00:01:52.009> on<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.189> side<00:01:52.369> I'm<00:01:52.490> going

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
so the riffles are on the side I'm going

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.730 
so the riffles are on the side I'm going
to<00:01:52.640> pour<00:01:52.880> out<00:01:53.060> on<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:53.869> even<00:01:54.020> when<00:01:54.259> I<00:01:54.289> go<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.530> pour

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
to pour out on so even when I go to pour

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.260 
to pour out on so even when I go to pour
the<00:01:54.890> material<00:01:55.280> out<00:01:55.369> of<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.520> pan<00:01:55.700> inside

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
the material out of the pan inside

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.819 
the material out of the pan inside
underneath<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.749> focus<00:01:57.079> pan<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.409> material<00:01:57.770> is

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
underneath the focus pan the material is

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.080 
underneath the focus pan the material is
getting<00:01:57.920> trapped<00:01:58.280> by<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.460> riffles<00:01:58.819> like<00:01:58.969> it

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
getting trapped by the riffles like it

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.090 
getting trapped by the riffles like it
naturally<00:01:59.509> would<00:01:59.689> be<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.499> once<00:02:00.679> again<00:02:00.890> we<00:02:01.009> can

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
naturally would be so once again we can

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.410 
naturally would be so once again we can
just<00:02:01.280> throw<00:02:01.399> that<00:02:01.640> on<00:02:01.670> there<00:02:01.969> and<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:02.119> can<00:02:02.210> see

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
just throw that on there and you can see

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.160 
just throw that on there and you can see
here<00:02:02.840> it's<00:02:03.469> just<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.740> rubber<00:02:03.950> seal<00:02:04.340> from<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.819> door

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
here it's just a rubber seal from a door

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.630 
here it's just a rubber seal from a door
to<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.200> vehicle<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.859> I've<00:02:07.009> used<00:02:07.219> all<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.549> way

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
to a vehicle that I've used all the way

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.309 
to a vehicle that I've used all the way
around<00:02:07.939> another<00:02:08.210> focused<00:02:08.660> pan<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:08.840> put<00:02:09.140> two<00:02:09.289> of

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
around another focused pan I put two of

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.040 
around another focused pan I put two of
these<00:02:09.530> together<00:02:09.759> in<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:10.940> shape<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:11.210> it<00:02:11.870> makes

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
these together in this shape so it makes

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.200 
these together in this shape so it makes
a<00:02:12.170> great<00:02:12.440> seal<00:02:12.710> all<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.920> way<00:02:13.040> around<00:02:13.160> there<00:02:13.700> we

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
a great seal all the way around there we

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.350 
a great seal all the way around there we
just<00:02:14.450> set<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.750> over<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.080> center<00:02:15.290> bolt<00:02:15.590> here

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
just set it over the center bolt here

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.030 
just set it over the center bolt here
line<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.390> up<00:02:18.040> we<00:02:19.040> can<00:02:19.160> take<00:02:19.370> our<00:02:19.520> screen<00:02:21.040> set

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
line it up we can take our screen set

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.309 
line it up we can take our screen set
that<00:02:22.220> down<00:02:22.460> over<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:22.970> have<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.510> washer<00:02:23.989> there<00:02:24.170> to

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
that down over it have a washer there to

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.830 
that down over it have a washer there to
set<00:02:24.530> over<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.830> bolt<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.220> this<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.299> top<00:02:26.540> nut

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
set over the bolt and this this top nut

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.020 
set over the bolt and this this top nut
here<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.920> can<00:02:28.040> screw<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.489> down

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
here so you can screw that down

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.610 
here so you can screw that down
what<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.240> does<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.720> actually<00:02:30.020> compresses

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
what this does is actually compresses

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.680 
what this does is actually compresses
the<00:02:30.740> focus<00:02:31.100> pan<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.610> makes<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.209> good<00:02:32.390> seal

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
the focus pan and makes a good seal

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.390 
the focus pan and makes a good seal
between<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.230> focus<00:02:33.530> pan<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.980> gold<00:02:34.160> pan

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
between the focus pan and the gold pan

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.520 
between the focus pan and the gold pan
down<00:02:34.610> below<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.810> helps<00:02:36.080> keep<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.290> two

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
down below and that helps keep the two

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.170 
down below and that helps keep the two
of<00:02:36.650> them<00:02:36.770> together<00:02:36.920> under<00:02:37.190> seal<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:37.910> nothing

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
of them together under seal so nothing

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.240 
of them together under seal so nothing
can<00:02:38.300> leak<00:02:38.510> out<00:02:38.660> over<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.110> edges<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.709> hope<00:02:40.100> you

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
can leak out over the edges I hope you

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.100 
can leak out over the edges I hope you
