screen<00:05:18.259> from<00:05:18.410> man<00:05:18.620> 13<00:05:19.039> so<00:05:19.220> we<00:05:19.340> get<00:05:19.550> three

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
screen from man 13 so we get three

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.300 
screen from man 13 so we get three
glitchy<00:05:21.410> plays<00:05:21.949> three<00:05:22.639> glitchy<00:05:23.030> concepts<00:05:24.310> out

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
glitchy plays three glitchy concepts out

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.300

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
concepts together the Figge draw the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.050 
concepts together the Figge draw the
come<00:05:36.770> back<00:05:36.919> quick<00:05:37.159> pass<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.699> then<00:05:37.789> you<00:05:37.880> put
