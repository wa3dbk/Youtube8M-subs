all<00:01:36.540> better<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:37.200> mean<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.470> liked<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> lot<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
all better I mean I liked it on a lot of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.920 
all better I mean I liked it on a lot of
different<00:01:39.390> levels<00:01:39.750> um<00:01:41.329> but<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.659> it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
different levels um but and it's it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.850 
different levels um but and it's it's
it's<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.380> nuance<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.610> very<00:01:44.850> nuanced

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
it's a nuance it's just so very nuanced

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.679 
it's a nuance it's just so very nuanced
