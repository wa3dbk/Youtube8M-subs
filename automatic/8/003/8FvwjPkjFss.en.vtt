00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.340
 hello welcome to planet droid and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.950
 welcome to subscribers in this video 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.560
 I will explain how to block 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.750
 become an undesirable contact 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.650
 important point of this video is that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.369
 this manipulation is not necessarily 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.320
 available on all android mobiles 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.219
 in the description I left you a 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.320
 link that explains how to block 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.630
 contacts become unwanted but at 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 way of a free application that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 you will find on google so please 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.719
 now let's move on to things 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.230
 practices so here i'm under the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.350
 version 2 of android so to block a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.210
 contact you simply enter 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.079
 your phone book 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.190
 you select the correspondent that 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.399
 you want stranded here I fall on the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.920
 sheet where are the numbers of this 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.320
 corresponding 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.280
 at the bottom of the phone there is the key 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.549
 menu so you 're pressuring 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 above 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.600
 you have a window that opens with 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.420
 many 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.369
 tab you 're pressuring 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.110
 options in this window calls 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.360
 incoming blocked incoming call 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.549
 directly when you check the box 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.259
 a small green arrow appears and 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.570
 your correspondence will be everything 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.190
 simply redirected to the mail 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.700
 your operator 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.539
 however, from your side you will receive 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.130
 a notification telling you that the 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.550
 correspondent sought to reach you 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.530
 and he could not reach you second 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.350
 part of this tutorial I changed from 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.740
 phone now I'm on a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.560
 android phone version 4 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.880
 so to create a blacklist since 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.250
 with version 4 we will be able to 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.220
 directly create a list of people 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.600
 we will say unwanted so it takes 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.790
 go to settings 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.209
 so I'm ready a shortcut 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:20.290
 on my phone settings you 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.110
 put pressure on call and you have to 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.350
 find rejection call so you do 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:32.109
 a pressure on the call and on 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:35.560
 roger list so here 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:38.920
 as you can see I already have two 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.180
 contacts that are banned we will say 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.760
 my phone 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.799
 the advantage of version 4 of android 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.690
 it allows you to reject all 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.570
 new private numbers simply 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.489
 by checking the box to add in the 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.980
 list a correspondent who would have become 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.350
 undesirable you just need 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.820
 simply to put pressure on the 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.370
 more and go get this 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.299
 corresponding in your repertoire 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.400
 phone you're pressuring 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.019
 in the case 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.920
 so I'll take the answering machine 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.609
 for example so you check the box and 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.120
 you do 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:22.739
 ok as you can see the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.489
 number has been added to the blacklist 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.190
 if you want to destroy this list you 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.400
 have 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.840
 the trash so all you need is 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.960
 simply select the numbers 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.320
 that you want to get off the blacklist 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.390

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.720
