cutting<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.450> stencil<00:01:47.900> it's<00:01:48.080> really

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
cutting the stencil it's really

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.520 
cutting the stencil it's really
important<00:01:48.830> not<00:01:49.010> to<00:01:49.810> cut<00:01:50.810> over<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.290> little

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
important not to cut over the little

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.310 
important not to cut over the little
tabs<00:01:51.800> that<00:01:52.010> hold<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.400> stencil<00:01:52.850> together<00:01:53.320> you

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
tabs that hold the stencil together you

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.080 
tabs that hold the stencil together you
just<00:01:54.560> cut<00:01:54.800> out<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.100> black<00:01:55.340> parts<00:01:55.790> of<00:01:55.940> this

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
just cut out the black parts of this

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.450 
just cut out the black parts of this
particular<00:01:56.360> stencil<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:58.130> would<00:01:58.280> be<00:01:58.310> a

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
particular stencil and it would be a

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.810 
particular stencil and it would be a
good<00:01:58.700> idea<00:01:58.910> to<00:01:59.380> do<00:02:00.380> what<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:00.979> didn't<00:02:01.369> do<00:02:01.520> on<00:02:01.670> this

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
good idea to do what I didn't do on this

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.940 
good idea to do what I didn't do on this
particular<00:02:02.119> stencil<00:02:02.690> is<00:02:02.869> work<00:02:03.229> from<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
particular stencil is work from the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.930 
particular stencil is work from the
inside<00:02:03.979> out<00:02:04.910> that<00:02:05.750> way<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.649> paper<00:02:07.130> itself<00:02:07.640> can

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
inside out that way the paper itself can

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.020 
inside out that way the paper itself can
hold<00:02:08.240> together<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.990> lot<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.560> lot<00:02:09.619> easier<00:02:10.070> often

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
hold together a lot a lot easier often

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.120 
hold together a lot a lot easier often
times<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.450> will<00:02:11.720> come<00:02:12.020> upon<00:02:12.350> little<00:02:12.890> tiny

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
times you will come upon little tiny

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.310 
times you will come upon little tiny
places<00:02:13.490> where<00:02:14.000> your<00:02:14.480> stencil<00:02:15.020> will<00:02:15.140> fall

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
places where your stencil will fall

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.310 
places where your stencil will fall
apart<00:02:15.850> masking<00:02:16.850> tape<00:02:17.090> will<00:02:17.690> cover<00:02:17.960> a<00:02:18.050> lot<00:02:18.290> of

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
apart masking tape will cover a lot of

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.260 
apart masking tape will cover a lot of
