mobile high-definition link and what it

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.279 
mobile high-definition link and what it
is<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.099> using<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.969> micro<00:00:15.330> USB<00:00:15.780> port<00:00:15.809> to

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
is is just using the micro USB port to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.609 
is is just using the micro USB port to
do<00:00:16.529> an<00:00:16.650> HDMI<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.400> video<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.850> audio<00:00:18.060> output<00:00:18.750> so

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
do an HDMI and video and audio output so

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.250 
do an HDMI and video and audio output so
what<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.130> need<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.609> obviously<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.660> an<00:00:21.779> MHL

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
what you need is obviously in an MHL

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.050 
what you need is obviously in an MHL
adapter<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.250> were<00:00:23.369> using<00:00:23.730> here<00:00:23.880> is

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
adapter and the one were using here is

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
adapter and the one were using here is
actually<00:00:24.359> gaseous<00:00:24.930> choose<00:00:26.330> HDMI<00:00:27.330> adapter<00:00:27.900> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
actually gaseous choose HDMI adapter so

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.110 
actually gaseous choose HDMI adapter so
it's<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:31.109> MX<00:00:31.410> fortunately<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:32.940> see

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
it's the MX fortunately as you can see

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.120 
it's the MX fortunately as you can see
the<00:00:33.450> adapter<00:00:33.840> itself<00:00:33.930> requires<00:00:34.710> external

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
the adapter itself requires external

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.240 
the adapter itself requires external
power<00:00:35.520> through<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> micro<00:00:36.270> USB<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.960> sadly<00:00:37.860> that

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
power through a micro USB so sadly that

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.330 
power through a micro USB so sadly that
means<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.820> need<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:40.350> handle<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.160> more

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
means you do need to handle one more

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.110 
means you do need to handle one more

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
the end of the world now as you can see
here<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.739> should<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> full<00:00:56.370> home

here it is you should get the full home
screen<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.390> get<00:00:57.600> basically<00:00:58.140> everything

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
screen you get basically everything

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.670 
screen you get basically everything
replicated<00:00:59.670> from<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.300> phone<00:01:00.570> screens<00:01:00.989> onto

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
replicated from the phone screens onto

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.329 
replicated from the phone screens onto
the<00:01:01.829> big<00:01:01.980> screen<00:01:02.899> in<00:01:03.899> terms<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.350> delay<00:01:04.830> well

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the big screen in terms of delay well

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.429 
the big screen in terms of delay well
there<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> tiny<00:01:06.030> tiny<00:01:06.360> bit<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.840> delay<00:01:07.080> from

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
there is a tiny tiny bit of delay from

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.789 
there is a tiny tiny bit of delay from
our<00:01:07.770> input<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.510> display<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> big<00:01:10.530> stream

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
our input to the display a big stream

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.480 
our input to the display a big stream
anyway<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.850> let's<00:01:12.420> give<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.159> game

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
anyway so let's give it a go with a game

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.179 
anyway so let's give it a go with a game
and<00:01:14.880> we're<00:01:15.090> gonna<00:01:15.450> check<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.869> Shadowgun<00:01:16.830> in

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and we're gonna check out Shadowgun in

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.980 
and we're gonna check out Shadowgun in
which<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:18.930> 3d<00:01:19.560> HD<00:01:20.189> video<00:01:20.729> getting<00:01:21.030> pretty

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
which is a 3d HD video getting pretty

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
which is a 3d HD video getting pretty
intense<00:01:22.049> as<00:01:22.439> well<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.950> there's<00:01:23.340> usually<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.670> bit

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
intense as well so there's usually a bit

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.780 
intense as well so there's usually a bit
now<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> problem<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.700> we're<00:01:26.700> not

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
now the problem here is that we're not

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.820 
now the problem here is that we're not
really<00:01:27.030> used<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:28.549> looking<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.140 

so<00:01:34.640> as<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:35.570> can<00:01:35.690> see<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:35.930> were<00:01:36.050> actually<00:01:36.440> a<00:01:37.150> bit

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
so as you can see it were actually a bit

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.560 
so as you can see it were actually a bit
too<00:01:38.450> close<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.050> screen<00:01:39.380> right<00:01:39.650> now<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.570> in

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
too close to the screen right now and in

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.740 
too close to the screen right now and in
fact<00:01:41.810> it's<00:01:42.710> pretty<00:01:42.860> difficult<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.640> play<00:01:44.540> this

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
fact it's pretty difficult to play this

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.410 
fact it's pretty difficult to play this
game<00:01:46.000> while<00:01:47.000> looking<00:01:48.250> about<00:01:49.270> it's<00:01:50.270> pretty

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
game while looking about it's pretty

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.150 
game while looking about it's pretty
difficult<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:50.870> look<00:01:51.140> at<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.470> big<00:01:52.130> screen

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
difficult to look at the big screen

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.460 
difficult to look at the big screen
while<00:01:52.820> trying<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:55.450> use<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.720> virtual<00:01:56.930> buttons

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
while trying to use the virtual buttons

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.750 
while trying to use the virtual buttons
at<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.680> same<00:01:57.740> time<00:01:58.220> because<00:01:58.370> you<00:01:58.550> can't

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
at the same time because you can't

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.240 
at the same time because you can't
really<00:01:58.970> see<00:01:59.450> or<00:01:59.900> feel<00:02:00.320> where<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.770> buttons<00:02:01.100> are

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
really see or feel where the buttons are

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.150 
really see or feel where the buttons are
so<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:01.700> might<00:02:01.880> need<00:02:02.090> some<00:02:02.800> things<00:02:03.800> like<00:02:03.980> the

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
so you might need some things like the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.980 
so you might need some things like the
fling<00:02:04.400> things<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:06.500> add<00:02:06.860> some<00:02:07.360> feel<00:02:08.360> oh<00:02:10.330> whoa<00:02:11.360> Oh

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
fling things to add some feel oh whoa Oh

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.530 
fling things to add some feel oh whoa Oh
easy<00:02:12.530> big<00:02:12.830> boy<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:15.470> ah<00:02:15.770> right<00:02:16.640> well<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.390> get

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
easy big boy so ah right well you get

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.950 
easy big boy so ah right well you get
the<00:02:17.630> idea

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
the idea

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.270 
the idea
um<00:02:18.970> whatever<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.150> notice<00:02:20.660> much<00:02:21.280> performance

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
um whatever you notice much performance

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.980 
um whatever you notice much performance
reduction<00:02:22.850> due<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.440> bigger<00:02:24.770> display

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
reduction due to the bigger display

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.040 
reduction due to the bigger display
however<00:02:27.130> we<00:02:28.130> think<00:02:28.460> because<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.720> doesn't

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
however we think because it doesn't

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.240 
however we think because it doesn't
actually<00:02:30.140> do<00:02:30.590> 1080p<00:02:31.150> free<00:02:32.150> output<00:02:32.480> here<00:02:33.250> you

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
actually do 1080p free output here you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.240 
actually do 1080p free output here you
can<00:02:34.400> still<00:02:34.970> see<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.630> jagged<00:02:36.080> lines<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:37.100> can

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
can still see the jagged lines you can

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.630 
can still see the jagged lines you can
look<00:02:37.400> up<00:02:37.520> close<00:02:37.730> enough<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:38.840> still<00:02:39.230> full<00:02:39.770> for

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
look up close enough but still full for

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.610 
look up close enough but still full for
3d<00:02:41.000> game<00:02:41.780> like<00:02:42.170> that

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620

MOV fibers let's have a look at many
back<00:03:05.390> black<00:03:05.870> 3<00:03:06.560> at<00:03:07.100> 1080p<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.060> as<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:08.900> can<00:03:09.020> see

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
back black 3 at 1080p and as you can see

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.740 
back black 3 at 1080p and as you can see
the<00:03:09.410> video<00:03:09.709> has<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.370> spin<00:03:10.940> on<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.570> phone

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
the video has the spin on the phone

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.350 
the video has the spin on the phone
itself<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.670> fully<00:03:13.670> focused<00:03:14.120> movie

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
itself so this fully focused movie

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.770 
itself so this fully focused movie
screen<00:03:15.580> if<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.730> look<00:03:16.880> close<00:03:17.209> enough<00:03:17.239> the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
screen if you look close enough the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:30.940 
screen if you look close enough the
framerate<00:03:18.110> is<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.080> can<00:03:30.260> see<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.830> look

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
framerate is so you can see if you look

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.810 
framerate is so you can see if you look
at<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.160> mouth<00:03:31.340> there<00:03:32.150> is<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:33.670> there<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:34.700> a

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
at the mouth there is a there is a

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.580 
at the mouth there is a there is a
significant<00:03:35.390> delay<00:03:35.510> between<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.080> audio<00:03:36.380> and

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
significant delay between the audio and

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.490 
significant delay between the audio and
video<00:03:36.650> there<00:03:37.070> so<00:03:37.340> that's<00:03:37.550> not<00:03:37.670> very<00:03:37.730> good<00:03:38.500> but

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
video there so that's not very good but

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.580 
video there so that's not very good but
then<00:03:39.650> again<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:40.489> this<00:03:41.090> 1080p<00:03:41.810> video<00:03:42.080> clip<00:03:42.350> has

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
then again the this 1080p video clip has

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.140 
then again the this 1080p video clip has
a<00:03:42.650> very<00:03:42.980> high<00:03:43.250> because<00:03:44.240> they<00:03:44.390> bring<00:03:45.520> so<00:03:46.520> we<00:03:46.970> are

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
a very high because they bring so we are

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.720 
a very high because they bring so we are
really<00:03:47.420> pushing<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.140> photo<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.800> its<00:03:49.160> limits

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
really pushing the photo to its limits

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.100 
really pushing the photo to its limits
baby<00:03:50.170> but<00:03:51.170> let's<00:03:51.680> try<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.370> 720p<00:03:53.150> version<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.990> the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
baby but let's try a 720p version of the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.340 
baby but let's try a 720p version of the
same<00:03:54.350> clip<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:59.480> look<00:03:59.600> we<00:03:59.750> see<00:03:59.810> an<00:03:59.990> athlete

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
same clip you look we see an athlete

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.700 
same clip you look we see an athlete
should<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:00.650> enough<00:04:00.860> Street

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.530 

No

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
No

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.259 
No
now<00:04:08.170> mission<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.950> again<00:04:09.220> keeping<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.819> close

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
now mission and again keeping a close

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:20.909 
now mission and again keeping a close
eye<00:04:10.480> on<00:04:10.810> Will<00:04:11.230> Smith's<00:04:11.560> mouth<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:20.620> there<00:04:20.769> is

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
eye on Will Smith's mouth so there is

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.580 
eye on Will Smith's mouth so there is
still<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.880> very<00:04:22.449> very<00:04:22.810> tiny<00:04:23.050> bit<00:04:23.260> of<00:04:23.380> delay

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
still a very very tiny bit of delay

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.560 
still a very very tiny bit of delay
between<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.949> audio<00:04:24.250> video<00:04:24.490> but<00:04:24.910> it's<00:04:25.090> not<00:04:25.389> the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
between the audio video but it's not the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.719 
between the audio video but it's not the
end<00:04:25.720> of<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.930> world<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:26.410> hopefully<00:04:27.250> major

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
end of the world and hopefully major

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.120 
end of the world and hopefully major
will<00:04:28.030> be<00:04:28.060> able<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.570> tweak<00:04:29.169> this<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.650> the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
will be able to tweak this and the

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.360 
will be able to tweak this and the
software's<00:04:30.639> in<00:04:30.729> every<00:04:31.030> port<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.930> also<00:04:32.370> we

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
software's in every port and also we

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.060 
software's in every port and also we
haven't<00:04:33.520> noticed<00:04:34.120> that<00:04:34.419> delay<00:04:35.139> when<00:04:35.710> looking

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
haven't noticed that delay when looking

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.420 
haven't noticed that delay when looking
when<00:04:37.030> watching<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:37.570> same<00:04:37.840> clip<00:04:38.139> that<00:04:38.560> 720p

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
when watching that same clip that 720p

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.800 
when watching that same clip that 720p
click<00:04:39.850> on<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.240> phone<00:04:40.419> itself<00:04:40.810> so<00:04:41.729> yes

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
click on the phone itself so yes

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.120 
click on the phone itself so yes
hopefully<00:04:43.810> it's<00:04:44.050> something<00:04:44.260> that<00:04:44.470> amazing

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
hopefully it's something that amazing

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.000 
hopefully it's something that amazing
things<00:04:45.639> but<00:04:46.139> here<00:04:47.139> you<00:04:47.229> have<00:04:47.350> it<00:04:47.500> back<00:04:47.710> that's
