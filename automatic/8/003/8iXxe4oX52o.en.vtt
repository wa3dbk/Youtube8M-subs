snow those planning travel in the warned
area<00:00:10.469> should<00:00:11.010> be<00:00:11.130> prepared<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:11.849> hazardous

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
area should be prepared for hazardous

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:23.109 
area should be prepared for hazardous
conditions<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.259> planned<00:00:13.590> accordingly<00:00:21.470> so

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
conditions and planned accordingly so

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.340 
conditions and planned accordingly so
one<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.300> things<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:24.840> that's<00:00:25.080> most

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
one of the things I think that's most

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.290 
one of the things I think that's most
common<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.189> people<00:00:26.580> start<00:00:26.820> out<00:00:26.910> doing<00:00:27.060> when

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
common that people start out doing when

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.509 
common that people start out doing when
they're<00:00:27.390> skinning<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.010> this<00:00:29.010> skin<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.369> they

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
they're skinning is this skin like they

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.849 
they're skinning is this skin like they
walk<00:00:29.730> they<00:00:30.269> lift<00:00:30.510> their<00:00:30.660> feet<00:00:30.810> up<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.289> every

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
walk they lift their feet up and every

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.110 
walk they lift their feet up and every
time<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.219> lift<00:00:32.369> your<00:00:32.550> foot<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:32.790> you're

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
time you lift your foot up you're

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.970 
time you lift your foot up you're
burning<00:00:33.690> energy<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.290> could<00:00:34.469> be<00:00:34.590> used<00:00:34.800> for

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
burning energy it could be used for

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.060 
burning energy it could be used for
turns<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> way<00:00:36.120> down<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.840> ski<00:00:37.770> touring

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
turns on the way down so a ski touring

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.920 
turns on the way down so a ski touring
is<00:00:38.160> all<00:00:38.250> about<00:00:38.489> efficiency<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.300> instead<00:00:39.870> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
is all about efficiency so instead of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.330 
is all about efficiency so instead of
lifting<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.350> feet<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.070> drag

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
lifting your feet if you can just drag

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.100 
lifting your feet if you can just drag
them<00:00:41.520> along<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.910> snow<00:00:42.149> that's<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.930> most

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
them along the snow that's the most

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.500 
them along the snow that's the most
energy<00:00:43.530> efficient<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.700> kind<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.059> nice

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
energy efficient so it's kind of a nice

00:00:45.510 --> 00:01:00.139 
energy efficient so it's kind of a nice
lazy<00:00:45.809> way<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.200> walk<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.760> one<00:01:00.000> other

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
lazy way to walk so you know one other

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.439 
lazy way to walk so you know one other
thing<00:01:00.270> that's<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.469> find<00:01:01.800> helpful<00:01:02.070> is

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
thing that's that's I find helpful is

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.179 
thing that's that's I find helpful is
when<00:01:03.449> you're<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.600> side<00:01:03.930> hill<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.559> if

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
when you're on side hill like this if

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.760 
when you're on side hill like this if
you<00:01:05.400> choke<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.450> your<00:01:06.720> uphill<00:01:06.869> pole<00:01:07.320> instead

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
you choke up on your uphill pole instead

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.320 
you choke up on your uphill pole instead
of<00:01:08.070> holding<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> grip<00:01:08.580> especially<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:09.240> it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
of holding the grip especially when it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.230 
of holding the grip especially when it
gets<00:01:09.540> cold<00:01:09.979> get<00:01:10.979> steeper<00:01:11.490> your<00:01:11.700> hands<00:01:11.939> above

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
gets cold get steeper your hands above

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.840 
gets cold get steeper your hands above
your<00:01:12.450> heart<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.780> whole<00:01:12.930> time<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.430> your<00:01:14.640> hand

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
your heart the whole time and your hand

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
your heart the whole time and your hand
will<00:01:14.970> you'll<00:01:15.360> notice<00:01:15.689> your<00:01:15.869> hand<00:01:16.049> will<00:01:16.140> get

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
will you'll notice your hand will get

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.590 
will you'll notice your hand will get
cold<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.400> also<00:01:17.549> don't<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:17.939> much<00:01:18.210> strength

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
cold you also don't have much strength

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140 
cold you also don't have much strength
when<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.229> way<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.500> high<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.729> choke<00:01:20.970> up

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
when it's way up high if you choke up

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.600 
when it's way up high if you choke up
here<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.740> could<00:01:22.950> really

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
here now I can you know you could really

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.670 
here now I can you know you could really
push<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.270> poles<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.170> some<00:01:25.350> leverage

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
push on your poles and get some leverage

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.179 
push on your poles and get some leverage
here

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
here

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:36.789 
here
so<00:01:26.520> try<00:01:26.700> choking<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.780> bit<00:01:28.049> -

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.170 

Andy<00:01:37.799> you're<00:01:37.920> asking<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:38.369> tracks<00:01:38.820> heading

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
Andy you're asking about tracks heading

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.390 
Andy you're asking about tracks heading
one<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> goals<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> track<00:01:40.680> setting<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
one of the goals the track setting is to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.760 
one of the goals the track setting is to
use<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> terrain<00:01:41.970> contours<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.710> you

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
use the terrain contours so that you

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.219 
use the terrain contours so that you
don't<00:01:43.979> again<00:01:44.340> make<00:01:44.610> any<00:01:44.820> extra<00:01:45.299> effort<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.869> lot

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
don't again make any extra effort a lot

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.020 
don't again make any extra effort a lot
of<00:01:46.290> times<00:01:46.530> you'll<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> trail<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.610> fairly

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
of times you'll see the trail go fairly

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.700 
of times you'll see the trail go fairly
flat<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.509> they<00:01:48.659> don't<00:01:48.810> hit<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> steep<00:01:49.229> section

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
flat and they don't hit a steep section

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.170 
flat and they don't hit a steep section
and<00:01:49.920> they'll<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.130> straight<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> want

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
and they'll go straight up and you want

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730 
and they'll go straight up and you want
your<00:01:51.329> heel<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:52.590> it'll

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
your heel this for that and then it'll

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.109 
your heel this for that and then it'll
flatten<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.159> again<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.759> they<00:01:53.880> want<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
flatten out again and so they want the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.179 
flatten out again and so they want the
heel<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.509> down<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.680> end<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:55.920> either

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
heel it's down so you end up either

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.639 
heel it's down so you end up either
walking<00:01:56.759> with<00:01:57.119> them<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.719> down<00:01:57.899> which

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
walking with them up or down which

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.950 
walking with them up or down which
neither<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.219> right<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.729> whole<00:01:59.909> time<00:02:00.180> or

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
neither is right the whole time or

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.510 
neither is right the whole time or
switching<00:02:01.560> them<00:02:01.649> back<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.040> forth<00:02:02.100> which<00:02:02.490> is

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
switching them back and forth which is

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.209 
switching them back and forth which is
time-consuming<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.600> if<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.799> think<00:02:04.979> about<00:02:05.159> a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
time-consuming so if you think about a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.249 
time-consuming so if you think about a
mountain<00:02:05.640> road

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
mountain road

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.469 
mountain road
the<00:02:06.649> mountain<00:02:07.219> roads<00:02:07.399> twist<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.239> turn<00:02:08.450> and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
the mountain roads twist and turn and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.240 
the mountain roads twist and turn and
follow<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.989> contours<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.619> find<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.069> easy
