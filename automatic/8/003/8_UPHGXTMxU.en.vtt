00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.460
 way to all drumsticks audited symantec and 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.760
 lex and we are in 1 channel video and 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.970
 we are in a review of a very house 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.099
 modern good modern is very cool for 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.150
 inside very cool on the outside and I'm going to 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:31.330
 teach before I start the video I want to 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.059
 warn or warn of a thing the video 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.829
 you will see it a little lacquered but I do not 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.570
 I'm seeing the doval dea minecraft 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.180
 what happens is that as the deck story 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.420
 I do not know what's wrong with the historical average 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.550
 is broken just when he finished 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.960
 recording the audio cuts me but the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 video follows and instead of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.829
 zoom out the video or I mean that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.500
 there are more videos next to everything and then 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.760
 you see the video cuts a bit to cut 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.460
 that has lengthened as if I'm 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.960
 saying but it's not my fault it's worth it guys 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.640
 so I'm going to try to teach the best 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.150
 possible this house and let's start then 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.660
 good 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.870
 and we've made some friends and I'm worth and 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.750
 the truth is that it is pretty cool by 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.160
 that I come to bring it if not it would not come like this 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.860
 that's good first thing I'm going to teach 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.950
 is what would be the top part we're going 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.380
 to climb these stairs perfect 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.660
 perfect and nothing else to raise we would have two 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.030
 doors one here and one here 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.700
 let's go through this here that 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.360
 it would be the kitchen is worth and we will have a 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.240
 super cool kitchen that as you see 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.640
 has here one thing was to hook a 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.440
 rope but it does as the tap has 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.020
 here doors have all the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.610
 bats are touching my noses 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.530
 well let's continue here I'm going to 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.080
 lower the volume because yes no 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.240
 music 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.780
 well then, just enter here from the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.030
 kitchen we would have what this would be 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.760
 shower here is worth for a shower 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.070
 pretty simple to do with your toilet 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.020
 here outside we would have a passage that 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.570
 it takes a very stupid road that we have 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.050
 done here we would have a room very 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.750
 big voucher worth 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.040
 to see the television that is door 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.189
 just age with the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.890
 another is that of prince two as this 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.480
 it's the same now I will teach it here as 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.760
 You see, you will have that room for which 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.150
 is the kitchen and here we are going to go up 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.430
 above this would be a very large room 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.980
 now I will teach everything but well 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.720
 to climb up and once from here 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.989
 up we would have a room by 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.689
 here very simple a room here 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.120
 another here very tiny a fish tank very 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.709
 cool and another bigger room here 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.230
 there is a balcony he cited there are out there 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.660
 what's out this is pretty big 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.210
 is 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.440
 the balcony comes out here, it's worth 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.410
 perfect gets out here by the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.760
 it has a balcony room pretty 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.260
 cool that I think it gives to the other 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.230
 room is perfect for the other 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.030
 room as these would be good 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.940
 three rooms upstairs now one is 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.940
 will go down more down and 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.710
 right here is a room with 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.590
 a pretty big TV this room 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.230
 it would be mine so to speak because it gives 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.880
 So the sea is pretty cool and good 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.000
 let's continue here 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.980
 Okay, we're staying, this would be 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.250
 the kitchen is part of the look at 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:41.030
 bathroom that was the lounge and we're going through here to 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.820
 this warm room is here too 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.150
 that would be super good with fire 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.130
 here sit down like this and this would be the 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.630
 you see, we have entered here and 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.730
 we have gotten ourselves into the kitchen for the 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.800
 left and this would be on the right the 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.170
 lounge is worth it because there is the kitchen and 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.850
 all good then here on the right 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.580
 we have a door that gives us a 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.340
 very cool garden that I have done this is 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.980
 made by me one hundred percent this garden 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.860
 others already helps a little but this 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.130
 garden is one hundred percent mine and as you see 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.340
 has a little plant here the trees 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.160
 here the roof is glass the stone 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.440
 it looks pretty good on white carpet 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.480
 water under a lot of things 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.580
 small details that are super good in a 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.770
 good garden let's continue here and 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.160
 here we have I think it was a toilet to not 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.170
 the room is all worth it perfect 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.740
 Check with the living room if you remember this room 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.320
 from here so cool because this we go through 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.410
 here and we have the staircase that takes us 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.600
 to other rooms is worth another 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.840
 plant here we would have a room 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.910
 quite large would this be what is the 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.930
 that we have seen is worth this we have already 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.389
 viewed 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.750
 then the climbs here would give us 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:01.720
 to this fish tank and even this toilet 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.060
 This is going to have a voucher voucher worth more 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.100
 or less we would have everything this 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.270
 room we have already seen and good 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.450
 Well now I'm going to teach you a little 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:14.189
 more on the outside what would be the house I do not know 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:17.169
 around here and around here it comes out 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:19.389
 the kitchen we'll get it 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.860
 perfect, now you see it will be a little 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.960
 house on the outside this would be the house 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.520
 the truth is that it is pretty cool 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.889
 this teaches us this would be like a 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.229
 disco or something like that there is not the dj 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:35.720
 pinching small small small small small 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:37.970
 small small small 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.890
 here would have the music discs and such 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.100
 ours would be a mini disc that gives the 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:46.010
 This house would also be the same entrance 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.950
 where we enter the bajadita is that 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.660
 takes you to the disco has no pool 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.980
 of the house is worth it because I do not 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.409
 it happened to make pool but also 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.999
 I would have a good idea 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.599
 once we go up here I'm going to 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:02.959
 teach the last thing in the house that would be 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:06.739
 but it would be like a parking for the 

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:10.039
 people who come and here there is a 

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:13.159
 path that ends here because as I think 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:16.249
 that I already told you this is a place like that 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:18.619
 as an island that we have made and then 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:20.330
 has inside the house good now 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:22.969
 well be what the house would be on the outside 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.409
 the truth is that the 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:29.830
 If the F1 is enough 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:32.439
 wow that's the word wow because the 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.129
 Real house is an asshole that we 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:36.499
 we have stuck 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:38.719
 and well, with these views I 'm not going to 

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:40.520
 dismiss the video I hope you have 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:42.830
 liked this house if you want me to do 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.619
