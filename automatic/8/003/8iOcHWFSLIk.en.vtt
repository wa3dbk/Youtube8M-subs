00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
learn one of these instruments at least

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.499 
learn one of these instruments at least
so<00:01:47.679> that<00:01:47.830> is<00:01:48.130> on<00:01:48.310> my<00:01:48.340> new<00:01:48.640> year's<00:01:48.819> resolutions

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
so that is on my new year's resolutions

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.510 
so that is on my new year's resolutions
list<00:01:49.899> and<00:01:50.140> that's<00:01:50.560> me<00:01:50.770> stepping<00:01:51.190> outside<00:01:51.310> of

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
list and that's me stepping outside of

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.559 
list and that's me stepping outside of
the<00:01:51.640> box<00:01:51.819> and<00:01:51.970> doing<00:01:52.209> something<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.509> I

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
the box and doing something that I

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.210 
the box and doing something that I
normally<00:01:52.690> wouldn't<00:01:53.289> do<00:01:53.500> I've<00:01:53.709> never<00:01:54.009> played

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
normally wouldn't do I've never played

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.889 
normally wouldn't do I've never played
an<00:01:54.399> instrument<00:01:54.670> before<00:01:54.789> and<00:01:55.209> you<00:01:55.629> know<00:01:55.720> that's

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
an instrument before and you know that's

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.389 
an instrument before and you know that's
gonna<00:01:56.020> be<00:01:56.140> something<00:01:56.379> completely<00:01:56.500> new<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.369> me

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
gonna be something completely new to me

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.490 
gonna be something completely new to me
and<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:58.000> think<00:01:58.239> that<00:01:58.390> everyone<00:01:58.810> should<00:01:58.989> do<00:01:59.379> that

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
and I think that everyone should do that

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.960 
and I think that everyone should do that
I<00:01:59.560> think<00:01:59.800> that<00:01:59.890> would<00:01:59.950> be<00:02:00.009> great<00:02:00.340> if<00:02:00.489> everyone

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
I think that would be great if everyone

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.029 
I think that would be great if everyone
learns<00:02:01.239> something<00:02:01.660> brand-new<00:02:02.229> every<00:02:02.739> single

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
learns something brand-new every single

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.760 
learns something brand-new every single
year<00:02:03.280> we<00:02:03.489> will<00:02:03.640> all<00:02:03.910> grow<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.660> become<00:02:05.229> you

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
year we will all grow and become you

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.010 
year we will all grow and become you
know<00:02:05.800> more<00:02:05.920> not<00:02:06.459> intelligent<00:02:07.149> but<00:02:07.360> more

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
know more not intelligent but more

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.330 
know more not intelligent but more
confident<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:08.950> know<00:02:08.979> there's<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.220> lot<00:02:09.310> of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
confident you know there's a lot of

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.619 
confident you know there's a lot of
different<00:02:09.610> ways<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.910> ask<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.149> girl<00:02:10.360> out<00:02:10.390> more

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
different ways of to ask a girl out more

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.300 
different ways of to ask a girl out more
confident<00:02:11.050> if<00:02:11.110> you're<00:02:11.200> learning<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.739> more<00:02:11.920> you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
confident if you're learning a more you

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.640 
confident if you're learning a more you
know<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> new<00:02:12.730> instrument<00:02:13.420> or<00:02:13.720> learning<00:02:14.290> how<00:02:14.530> to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
know a new instrument or learning how to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.890 
know a new instrument or learning how to
program<00:02:15.459> or<00:02:16.030> whatever<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.450> might<00:02:16.540> be<00:02:16.599> I<00:02:16.750> don't

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
program or whatever it might be I don't

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.720 
program or whatever it might be I don't
know<00:02:17.110> you're<00:02:17.440> gonna<00:02:17.530> be<00:02:17.620> expanding<00:02:18.430> whatever

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
know you're gonna be expanding whatever

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.979 
know you're gonna be expanding whatever
it<00:02:18.849> might<00:02:18.940> be<00:02:19.000> you're<00:02:19.239> gonna<00:02:19.300> be<00:02:19.420> expanding

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
it might be you're gonna be expanding

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.959 
it might be you're gonna be expanding
and<00:02:20.109> I<00:02:20.230> think<00:02:20.439> that<00:02:20.560> expanding<00:02:21.219> is<00:02:21.370> never<00:02:21.670> it's

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
and I think that expanding is never it's

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.210 
and I think that expanding is never it's
never<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.239> negative<00:02:22.629> thing<00:02:22.810> if<00:02:22.959> you

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
never a negative thing if you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.890 
never a negative thing if you
if<00:02:23.460> you're<00:02:23.640> always<00:02:23.910> expanding<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.450> doing<00:02:24.690> one

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
if you're always expanding you doing one

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.390 
if you're always expanding you doing one
new<00:02:25.080> thing<00:02:25.320> every<00:02:25.680> single<00:02:25.950> year<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.310> you're

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
new thing every single year and you're

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.130 
new thing every single year and you're
giving<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.760> your<00:02:26.820> all<00:02:27.000> every<00:02:27.300> single<00:02:27.750> year<00:02:27.930> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
giving it your all every single year and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.270 
giving it your all every single year and
you're<00:02:28.260> gonna<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.590> expending<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.040> become

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
you're gonna be expending here to become

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.520 
you're gonna be expending here to become
more<00:02:29.460> of<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.810> balanced<00:02:30.810> person<00:02:31.020> not<00:02:31.290> just<00:02:31.320> gonna

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
more of a balanced person not just gonna

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.110 
more of a balanced person not just gonna
be<00:02:31.590> sticking<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.100> one<00:02:32.280> thing<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.640> always<00:02:32.910> be

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
be sticking to one thing you always be

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.850 
be sticking to one thing you always be
learning<00:02:33.240> something<00:02:33.570> different<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.590> let's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
learning something different so let's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.650 
learning something different so let's
say<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.280> one<00:02:35.580> year<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.790> decide<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.090> learn<00:02:36.420> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
say that one year I decide to learn the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.990 
say that one year I decide to learn the
guitar<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:38.310> that's<00:02:38.610> all<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:38.850> do

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
guitar and I I do that that's all I do

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.450 
guitar and I I do that that's all I do
not<00:02:39.330> all<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.660> but<00:02:39.960> something<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.680> focus<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.280> lot

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
not all I do but something I focus a lot

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.570 
not all I do but something I focus a lot
of<00:02:41.610> my<00:02:41.730> time<00:02:41.760> into<00:02:42.600> then<00:02:43.290> after<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.310> years

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
of my time into then after that years

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.670 
of my time into then after that years
over<00:02:44.880> i'll<00:02:45.060> probably<00:02:45.450> be<00:02:45.750> pretty<00:02:46.080> decent<00:02:46.560> at

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
over i'll probably be pretty decent at

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.530 
over i'll probably be pretty decent at
playing<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.980> guitar<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.490> then<00:02:47.940> I'm<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.450> know

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
playing the guitar and then I'm you know

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.300 
playing the guitar and then I'm you know
no<00:02:48.750> longer<00:02:49.110> have<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.380> put<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:49.740> my<00:02:49.770> time<00:02:50.100> into

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
no longer have to put all my time into

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.770 
no longer have to put all my time into
it<00:02:50.430> just<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.970> little<00:02:51.090> bit<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.360> time<00:02:51.510> because

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
it just a little bit of time because

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.480 
it just a little bit of time because
I've<00:02:52.020> already<00:02:52.230> now<00:02:52.440> kind<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.890> mastered<00:02:53.370> it

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
I've already now kind of mastered it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.030 
I've already now kind of mastered it
sort<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.180> think<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.200> do<00:02:55.410> you

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
sort of and I think that if you do you

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
sort of and I think that if you do you
know<00:02:56.130> something<00:02:56.340> different<00:02:56.730> every<00:02:57.030> single

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
know something different every single

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.630 
know something different every single
year<00:02:57.510> you'll<00:02:57.720> constantly<00:02:58.200> expand<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.310> with

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
year you'll constantly expand so with

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.490

people hot or not and there's actually a
hot<00:04:24.540> or<00:04:24.660> not<00:04:24.690> app<00:04:24.930> now<00:04:25.229> but<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.680> wasn't

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
hot or not app now but it wasn't

affiliate<00:04:26.250> with<00:04:26.370> him<00:04:26.520> at<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.729> time<00:04:26.790> he

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
affiliate with him at that time he

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.640 
affiliate with him at that time he
created<00:04:27.450> this<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:28.050> can<00:04:28.169> see<00:04:28.290> their<00:04:28.440> face

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
created this and you can see their face

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.990 
created this and you can see their face
then<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:28.950> just<00:04:29.160> rate<00:04:29.340> if<00:04:29.490> they're<00:04:29.640> hot<00:04:29.820> or<00:04:29.970> not

the first thing he created and from

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.700 
the first thing he created and from

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
there he realized that this was kind of

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.770 
there he realized that this was kind of
like<00:04:34.860> profiling<00:04:35.610> people<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:36.120> he<00:04:36.300> created
