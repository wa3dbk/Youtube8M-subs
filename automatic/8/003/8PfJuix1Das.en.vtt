the draw one and then you could use its

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.620 
the draw one and then you could use its
own<00:01:53.310> effect<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.939> draw<00:01:54.090> another<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.509> it's

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
own effect and draw another one so it's

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.360 
own effect and draw another one so it's
like<00:01:54.750> two<00:01:54.930> cards<00:01:55.259> per<00:01:55.470> turn
