00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
can see it's almost like a house shape

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.080 
can see it's almost like a house shape
and<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.289> reason<00:01:52.590> why<00:01:52.709> I<00:01:53.009> told<00:01:53.489> you<00:01:53.610> guys<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.789> do

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and the reason why I told you guys to do

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.850 
and the reason why I told you guys to do
this<00:01:54.239> because<00:01:54.450> when<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.929> put<00:01:55.259> your

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
this because when you put your

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.699 
this because when you put your
background<00:01:56.459> in<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:57.060> bag<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.810> close<00:01:58.470> it

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
background in the bag and you close it

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.010 
background in the bag and you close it
the<00:01:58.950> paper<00:01:59.250> itself<00:01:59.849> will<00:02:00.179> not<00:02:00.420> fold<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.959> I

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the paper itself will not fold so I

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.199 
the paper itself will not fold so I
thought<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.349> was<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:01.920> cute<00:02:02.310> tip<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
thought this was a really cute tip so

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.059 
thought this was a really cute tip so
just<00:02:03.390> make<00:02:03.539> sure<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.810> cut<00:02:04.170> those<00:02:04.379> two<00:02:04.649> corners

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
just make sure you cut those two corners

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.490 
just make sure you cut those two corners
of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.489> square<00:02:05.789> okay<00:02:06.660> so<00:02:06.720> once<00:02:07.020> you've<00:02:07.229> cut

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
of the square okay so once you've cut

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.139 
of the square okay so once you've cut
your<00:02:07.679> background<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.610> want<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.940> get
