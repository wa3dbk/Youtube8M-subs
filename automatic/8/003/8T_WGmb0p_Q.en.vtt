00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
different stats so for example here I've

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.510 
different stats so for example here I've
got<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.350> option<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:29.649> fear<00:01:29.799> attack<00:01:30.130> defense

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
got the option to fear attack defense

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.580 
got the option to fear attack defense
and<00:01:30.580> speed<00:01:31.060> however<00:01:31.750> I<00:01:31.960> don't<00:01:32.080> necessarily

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
and speed however I don't necessarily

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.780 
and speed however I don't necessarily
wanna<00:01:32.710> sort<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:32.920> go<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.130> like<00:01:33.369> balance<00:01:33.670> out

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
wanna sort of go and like balance out

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.399 
wanna sort of go and like balance out
the<00:01:33.909> stats<00:01:34.119> evenly<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:34.659> do<00:01:34.899> want<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.229> sort<00:01:35.380> of

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
the stats evenly I do want to sort of

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.600 
the stats evenly I do want to sort of
wait<00:01:35.560> him<00:01:35.710> in<00:01:35.830> a<00:01:35.860> slightly<00:01:36.070> more<00:01:36.190> sort<00:01:36.520> of<00:01:36.549> like

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
wait him in a slightly more sort of like

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.249 
wait him in a slightly more sort of like
unique<00:01:36.970> weight<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:37.659> I'm<00:01:37.780> always<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:38.020> speed

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
unique weight so I'm always a speed

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.630 
unique weight so I'm always a speed
fighter<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:38.680> I'm<00:01:38.740> gonna<00:01:38.860> give<00:01:39.039> him<00:01:39.159> speed<00:01:39.490> and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
fighter so I'm gonna give him speed and

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.740 
fighter so I'm gonna give him speed and
I'm<00:01:39.700> also<00:01:39.820> gonna<00:01:39.970> give<00:01:40.090> him<00:01:40.299> attack<00:01:40.539> but<00:01:40.690> I'm

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
I'm also gonna give him attack but I'm

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
I'm also gonna give him attack but I'm
actually<00:01:40.840> gonna<00:01:41.049> keep<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.320> defense<00:01:41.500> pretty

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
actually gonna keep the defense pretty

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.380 
actually gonna keep the defense pretty
low<00:01:41.979> it<00:01:42.369> might<00:01:42.580> not<00:01:42.729> necessarily<00:01:42.759> seem<00:01:43.240> like<00:01:43.360> a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
low it might not necessarily seem like a

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.940 
low it might not necessarily seem like a
clever<00:01:43.600> idea<00:01:43.690> for<00:01:44.080> now<00:01:44.229> but<00:01:44.530> for<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.799> time

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
clever idea for now but for the time

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.080 
clever idea for now but for the time
being<00:01:44.979> that's<00:01:45.310> how<00:01:45.490> I'm<00:01:45.549> gonna<00:01:45.670> go<00:01:45.820> with<00:01:46.000> it

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
being that's how I'm gonna go with it

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.550 
being that's how I'm gonna go with it
and<00:01:46.210> then<00:01:46.720> as<00:01:46.810> when<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.110> get<00:01:47.229> more<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.440> these

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
and then as when you get more of these

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.840 
and then as when you get more of these
you<00:01:47.649> can<00:01:47.740> feed<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.009> more<00:01:48.159> equipment<00:01:48.369> later<00:01:48.610> on

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
you can feed the more equipment later on

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.430 
you can feed the more equipment later on
when<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.450> done<00:01:49.569> that<00:01:49.690> you<00:01:49.750> can<00:01:49.810> go<00:01:49.899> back<00:01:50.289> to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440

but if you have an empty slot to be with

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.990 
but if you have an empty slot to be with
then<00:02:44.410> fill<00:02:44.650> their<00:02:44.829> space<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.640> didn't<00:02:45.820> go<00:02:45.880> into

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
then fill their space you didn't go into

battle<00:02:46.180> I'm<00:02:46.630> not<00:02:46.750> going<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.930> show<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.079> this

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170

battle I'm not going to show you this
whole<00:02:47.350> fight<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:47.769> I<00:02:47.799> cut<00:02:48.070> between<00:02:48.190> different

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
whole fight but I cut between different

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.650 
whole fight but I cut between different
sections<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.030> see<00:02:49.209> as<00:02:49.390> or<00:02:49.510> when<00:02:49.600> he

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
sections and you see as or when he

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.509 
sections and you see as or when he
fights<00:02:49.900> he<00:02:50.350> levels<00:02:50.650> off<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.859> other<00:02:50.980> battle<00:02:51.310> so

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
fights he levels off the other battle so

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.500 
fights he levels off the other battle so
you<00:02:51.579> know<00:02:51.700> at<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.850> end<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.120> sketch<00:02:52.359> she

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
you know at the end of this sketch she

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.910 
you know at the end of this sketch she
ends<00:02:52.660> up<00:02:52.720> at<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> pretty<00:02:53.049> decent<00:02:53.109> level<00:02:53.590> for<00:02:53.799> you

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
ends up at a pretty decent level for you

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.380 
ends up at a pretty decent level for you
know<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.100> first<00:02:54.280> battle<00:02:54.609> that's<00:02:55.120> probably<00:02:55.329> a

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
know the first battle that's probably a

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.310 
know the first battle that's probably a
mixture<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.630> him<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:55.989> off<00:02:56.049> four<00:02:56.170> gates

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
mixture of him going off four gates

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.750 
mixture of him going off four gates
level<00:02:56.590> nine<00:02:56.709> at<00:02:56.859> me<00:02:56.980> fighting<00:02:57.250> alongside<00:02:57.430> him

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
level nine at me fighting alongside him

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.640 
level nine at me fighting alongside him
but<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.299> point<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:59.200> is<00:02:59.350> what<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.500> want

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
but the point is this is what you want

but the point is this is what you want
to<00:02:59.709> do<00:02:59.769> you<00:02:59.890> can<00:03:00.010> they<00:03:00.100> level<00:03:00.340> them<00:03:00.430> up<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:00.730> can

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
to do you can they level them up you can

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.130

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
if you so wish just let them fight other

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.750 
if you so wish just let them fight other
CPUs<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.709> just<00:03:02.859> sit<00:03:02.980> back<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.190> watch<00:03:03.370> or

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
CPUs and just sit back to watch or

that<00:03:27.310> way<00:03:27.489> if<00:03:27.549> you<00:03:27.639> do<00:03:27.760> have<00:03:27.910> multiple<00:03:28.030> people

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
that way if you do have multiple people

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.220 
that way if you do have multiple people
deal<00:03:28.790> with<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.390> can<00:03:29.599> then<00:03:29.720> cater<00:03:29.959> for<00:03:30.140> all

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.839 
deal with you can then cater for all
over<00:03:30.440> there<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.800> then<00:03:30.950> when<00:03:31.489> you<00:03:31.580> do<00:03:31.670> finish

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
over there and then when you do finish

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.250 
over there and then when you do finish
fighting<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.360> can<00:03:32.510> then<00:03:32.599> back<00:03:32.720> out<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.110> then

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
fighting you can then back out and then

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.240 
fighting you can then back out and then
afterwards<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.709> will<00:03:33.769> then<00:03:33.890> ask<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.099> if<00:03:34.190> you
