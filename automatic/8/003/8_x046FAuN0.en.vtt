00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
which you ever know it could be a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.460 
which you ever know it could be a
problem<00:01:13.880> I<00:01:14.210> know<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.390> had<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.660> problem<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.410> i

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
problem I know I had that problem and i

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.070 
problem I know I had that problem and i
have<00:01:15.650> since<00:01:16.100> updated<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:16.760> so<00:01:17.510> what<00:01:17.990> you're

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
have since updated it so what you're

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.170 
have since updated it so what you're
going<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.230> need<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.500> do<00:01:18.800> you<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.700> will<00:01:19.850> need<00:01:19.940> I

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
going to need to do you you will need I

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.990 
going to need to do you you will need I
file<00:01:20.510> for<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:20.810> method<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.520> think<00:01:22.520> there<00:01:22.790> is<00:01:22.820> an

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
file for this method I think there is an

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.280 
file for this method I think there is an
alternative<00:01:23.150> method<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:24.020> will<00:01:24.200> be

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
alternative method that I will be

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.800 
alternative method that I will be
searching<00:01:24.650> into<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.190> i<00:01:25.610> will<00:01:25.820> put<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.300> link<00:01:26.330> on

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
searching into and i will put a link on

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.440 
searching into and i will put a link on
the<00:01:26.960> screen<00:01:27.080> somewhere<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:28.970> will<00:01:29.120> link

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
the screen somewhere and that will link

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.750 
the screen somewhere and that will link
to<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.780> alternative<00:01:30.290> method<00:01:30.590> but<00:01:31.490> for<00:01:31.670> now

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
to the alternative method but for now

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.130 
to the alternative method but for now
we're<00:01:31.940> going<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.090> go<00:01:32.150> for<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.360> iphone<00:01:32.870> roots

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
we're going to go for the iphone roots

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.020 
we're going to go for the iphone roots
so<00:01:33.380> if<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:34.010> don't<00:01:34.220> have<00:01:34.370> AI<00:01:34.400> file<00:01:34.760> because

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
so if you don't have AI file because

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.430 
so if you don't have AI file because
your<00:01:35.180> city<00:01:35.390> recently<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:35.900> download<00:01:36.260> it

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
your city recently and you download it

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.800 
your city recently and you download it
or<00:01:36.590> if<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.220> didn't<00:01:37.940> have<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.180> all<00:01:38.479> ready<00:01:38.570> for

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
or if you didn't have it all ready for

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.330 
or if you didn't have it all ready for
some<00:01:38.960> reason<00:01:39.290> but<00:01:39.500> for<00:01:39.530> those<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:39.860> you<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.190> do

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
some reason but for those of you that do

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.670 
some reason but for those of you that do
have<00:01:40.520> AI<00:01:40.640> file<00:01:40.940> then<00:01:41.570> this<00:01:42.080> is<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.229> method<00:01:42.409> for

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
have AI file then this is the method for

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.730 
have AI file then this is the method for
you<00:01:42.850> simply<00:01:43.850> go<00:01:43.970> over<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.180> safari<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.870> then

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
you simply go over to safari and then

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.719 
you simply go over to safari and then
you<00:01:45.830> need<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.040> search<00:01:46.310> on<00:01:46.610> google<00:01:47.030> cydia<00:01:48.729> 1.0

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729
