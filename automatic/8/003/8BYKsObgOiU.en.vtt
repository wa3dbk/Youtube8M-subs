had<00:05:06.930> issues<00:05:07.140> with<00:05:07.500> that<00:05:07.680> when<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:07.890> game<00:05:08.040> was

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
had issues with that when the game was

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.740 
had issues with that when the game was
released<00:05:08.370> but<00:05:08.970> if<00:05:09.090> you're<00:05:09.210> playing<00:05:09.570> a<00:05:09.720> game

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
released but if you're playing a game

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.680 
released but if you're playing a game
for<00:05:09.960> what<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:10.530> is<00:05:10.680> Dark<00:05:11.370> Souls<00:05:11.430> 2<00:05:11.820> one<00:05:12.450> of<00:05:12.480> the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
for what it is Dark Souls 2 one of the

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.600 
for what it is Dark Souls 2 one of the
best<00:05:12.870> games<00:05:13.140> of<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.410> year<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.770> really<00:05:14.280> enjoyed

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
best games of the year I really enjoyed

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.400 
best games of the year I really enjoyed
it<00:05:14.640> despite<00:05:15.150> its<00:05:15.300> difficulty<00:05:15.780> factor<00:05:16.200> I

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
it despite its difficulty factor I

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.230 
it despite its difficulty factor I
actually<00:05:16.770> think<00:05:17.100> it<00:05:17.280> probably<00:05:17.729> ranks<00:05:18.090> in

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
actually think it probably ranks in

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.640 
actually think it probably ranks in
