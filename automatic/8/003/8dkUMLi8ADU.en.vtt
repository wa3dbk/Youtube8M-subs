00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.420
 ESPCH 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.190
 to the budget two years ago a military pilot 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.049
 Maxim Shcherbakov openly declared 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.059
 that he had contact with one 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.709
 risking to be in a difficult situation 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.159
 Chumakov nevertheless decided to talk about 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:17.559
 tom unbelievable case which 

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.119
 happened to him clearly speaking in fact 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.839
 this is already 19 years old maximus priests 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.739
 rising star part time military 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.869
 air force becomes precipitated 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.570
 Tobakov Flight Journal was 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.930
 flawless until August 1999 when 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.680
 two strange cases occurred 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.870
 there were problems in the engine 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.059
 his plane as a result he was 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.399
 forced to eject 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.030
 pounds investigation of this case showed 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.839
 that the shuttles acted calmerly 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.560
 than their rational 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.010
 then after 12 days the third case 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
 Chumakov's life changed forever 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.280
 twenty eighth of august 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.990
 second shift 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.700
 I made two sorties to my commanders and 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.420
 third self 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.120
 I gained 3 thousand 900 meters 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.830
 from the hands of the video in front of Charles about 20 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.290
 degrees to the right of the board 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.420
 and almost no he watched him in 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.830
 for a few seconds after 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.740
 I became and pressed th 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.240
 churbakov tried to contact the base 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.750
 funds from which will be blinding 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.590
 he says he has not been embraced 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.030
 expert explained 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.340
 nape foe feel the heat i 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.250
 would feel the bills presence 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.280
 watched the carrot movement 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.420
 controlled but controlled by 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.510
 something else 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.290
 Marchuk Shcherbakov say that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.500
 glowing the same 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.700
 started maneuvering around the plane 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.420
 a few minutes treatment course he 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.300
 flew at the same speed as 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.360
 the plane imitating all this decision is all this 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.610
 Maxim time had no opportunity 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.450
 contact your commander at the base in 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.150
 parade gone sound understand 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.320
 ii what testimony Shcherbakov 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.020
 regarding boat behavior 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.730
 quite recognizable 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.960
 gold mining in the vaults 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.370
 documented about three thousand 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.120
 evidence of these pilots 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.240
 I have thousands of cases 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.919
 the pilots 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.919
 who watched in broad daylight 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.689
 similar greenhouse real objects 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.509
 three-dimensional structural reform and 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:17.159
 definite a and dynamic 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.229
 behavioral characteristics and then 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.539
 what he describes here and 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.709
 completely coincides with my 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.149
 the testimony of hundreds of other pilots with 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.149
 of the whole world 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:32.870
 again strange friends began to happen 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.580
 things 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.630
 suddenly a chubakov plane generator 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.020
 failed such devices 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.079
 recorded a fire on board 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.719
 from the base chumakov received an order 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.719
 commander to eject 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.419
 I told the commander that the plane was still 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.989
 is within a living desire radius 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.609
 appointed disastrously 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.299
 lose height but i needed 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.649
 first go beyond residential areas 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:58.740
 and at a height of a thousand meters 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.040
 i finally brought out the planes and with that 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.320
 eject after going through four 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.320
 seconds after that my plane exploded 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.819
 rbk fishermen was not injured and 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.680
 landed on school and very often got 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.300
 helicopter 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.010
 he while military commanders 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.410
 carefully investigated the remains 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.760
 fisherman's aircraft is aimed at 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.800
 examination to the hospital where and then 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.520
 followed by a three-day interrogation and 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.730
 further decline during interrogation was 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.489
 it is clear that they do not believe 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.710
 they warned the very beginning 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.880
 that this is not the first case of the second and 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.339
 the third occurred through my fault 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.659
 slightly worse Kurbakov also interrogated in 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:36.489
 kgb 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.749
 they didnâ€™t believe what he was saying 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.569
 you regarded his actions as 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:41.340
 insubordination 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.560
 sabotage within the international 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.409
 of terrorism 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.499
 we study the question says that the KGB 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:47.390
 warned 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.010
 if he doesn't tell the truth 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.769
 the case will go to court where he will be charged with 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.090
 making a critical 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.659
 quality, taking into account economic sciences 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.799
 along with that, cloze thinks that 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.360
 maxim has a perfectly healthy 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.279
 psyche and there is no reason to consider 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:03.369
 that he or she will understand 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:05.859
 woman as chumakova pleased 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.269
 in a state of hypnosis 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.290
 he turned from intimidated 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.900
 all pilots have inventory 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.469
 sitting in their cabinets 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:14.610
 in its place 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.390
 control device series 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.859
 set memory all Celsius coming 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:19.359
 with him 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.359
 with ordinary lats 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.809
 hair than 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:29.579
 have fallen anyone able to compose 

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:29.880
 poems 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.340
 the whole question is composed and Omsk he 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.440
 gives the impression of a man 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.270
 which the 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.220
 in this particular situation is not fiction 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.230
 lest he speak he really believes 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.539
 that this is exactly what happened he 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.720
 deeply convinced in what did not 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.620
 nothing wrong even the opposite 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.300
 right 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.110
 u want 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.499
 solve this problem as soon as possible 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.309
 glory 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:53.789
 cup in spite of what to do 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.179
 it was closed the court still accused him 

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:59.019
 the destruction of the aircraft but as stated by the military 

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:01.619
 the bailiff is all he has 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:02.739
 facts in favor of innocence 

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:05.879
 packages with more than convincing 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:06.800
 Help 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.879
 at first I doubted that chumakov 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:10.069
 tells the truth 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.179
 but after I asked his friends 

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:13.960
 help the team rub talked with his 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.309
 mother deeply studied the situation I 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:18.360
 came to the conclusion that Maxim Chumakov 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.029
 really had contact 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.729
 full of taxes 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.029
 and start movies in January 1992 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.319
 a case against a maxim forelock 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.689
 who was finally closed
