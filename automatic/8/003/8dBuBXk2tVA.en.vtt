I<00:02:01.979> mean<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.430> comparable<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.969> when<00:02:03.329> Tiger

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
I mean it's comparable to when Tiger

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
I mean it's comparable to when Tiger
Woods<00:02:03.899> changed<00:02:04.290> his<00:02:04.380> swing<00:02:04.680> totally<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
Woods changed his swing totally and the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.459 
Woods changed his swing totally and the
way<00:02:05.700> he<00:02:05.790> says<00:02:06.030> what<00:02:06.240> what<00:02:06.659> did<00:02:06.810> he<00:02:07.049> change<00:02:07.079> in

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
way he says what what did he change in

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.979 
way he says what what did he change in
his<00:02:07.590> swing<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.039> then<00:02:08.879> he<00:02:08.970> was<00:02:09.119> shooting

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
his swing but then he was shooting

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.010 
his swing but then he was shooting
farther<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.679> everything<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.280> mean<00:02:11.430> so

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
farther and everything so I mean so

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.240 
farther and everything so I mean so
it's<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.140> bit<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.380> same<00:02:12.530> thing<00:02:12.770> nobody's<00:02:13.130> gonna
