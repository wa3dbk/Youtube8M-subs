north<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.350> 3<00:00:25.590> peopIe<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.640> that's<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.000> idea

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
north of 3 peopIe so that's the idea

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.830 
north of 3 peopIe so that's the idea
something<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> meter<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.970> 4<00:00:30.599> feet

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
something like that or a meter to 4 feet

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.380 
something like that or a meter to 4 feet
so<00:00:31.170> three<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.590> four<00:00:31.800> feet<00:00:31.830> or<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.730> when<00:00:33.360> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
so three to four feet or and when I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
so three to four feet or and when I
exact<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> ID<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.440> planting<00:00:34.890> well<00:00:35.430> because<00:00:35.790> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
exact the ID in planting well because it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
exact the ID in planting well because it
does<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.570> easiest<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.230> plant<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.829> size

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
does it's easiest to plant at that size

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.220 
does it's easiest to plant at that size
and<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> does<00:00:38.700> best<00:00:39.000> at<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.329> size<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.020> can

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and it does best at that size you can

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.840 
and it does best at that size you can
get<00:00:40.559> them<00:00:40.739> much<00:00:40.890> bigger<00:00:43.370> if<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.520> want<00:00:44.700> an

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
get them much bigger if you want an

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.400 
get them much bigger if you want an
instant<00:00:45.300> page<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.660> course<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.989> can't<00:00:46.200> get

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
instant page of course you can't get

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.830 
instant page of course you can't get
them<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.710> six<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.129> eight<00:00:47.250> feet<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.629> want

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
doing so for something now to see the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.939 
doing so for something now to see the
wavy<00:00:56.250> pattern<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> bundles<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.690> 25<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.739> yes

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
wavy pattern and bundles for 25 for yes

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.889 
wavy pattern and bundles for 25 for yes
it's<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.820> can<00:01:00.000> violation<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> air

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
it's here you can violation the air

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.599 
it's here you can violation the air
pockets<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.649> more<00:01:01.829> expensive<00:01:02.070> because

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
pockets but it's more expensive because

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.189 
pockets but it's more expensive because
somebody's<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> use<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> labor<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
somebody's have to use the labor and the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.320 
somebody's have to use the labor and the
compost<00:01:04.650> reporter<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> ICU<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
compost reporter so this is the ICU I

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.980 
compost reporter so this is the ICU I
very<00:01:06.689> time<00:01:07.580> get<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> rills<00:01:08.970> well<00:01:09.360> settled<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
very time get the rills well settled in

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.929 
very time get the rills well settled in
before<00:01:10.200> growth<00:01:10.650> starts<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> spring
