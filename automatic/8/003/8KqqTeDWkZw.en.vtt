a<00:00:44.170> non<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.480> know<00:00:46.570> active<00:00:46.960> pickup<00:00:47.290> has<00:00:47.739> a<00:00:47.770> lot

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
a non you know active pickup has a lot

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.040 
a non you know active pickup has a lot
more<00:00:48.309> turn<00:00:48.580> so<00:00:48.970> the<00:00:49.090> more<00:00:49.300> turns<00:00:49.540> you<00:00:49.809> have

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
more turn so the more turns you have

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.170 
more turn so the more turns you have
you're<00:00:50.230> more<00:00:50.410> susceptible<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:51.340> picking<00:00:52.120> up

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
you're more susceptible of picking up

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.869 
you're more susceptible of picking up
all<00:00:52.360> kinds<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.750> RF<00:00:53.080> refuse<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.739> come<00:00:53.950> in<00:00:54.129> so

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
all kinds of RF refuse to come in so

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.040 
all kinds of RF refuse to come in so
with<00:00:55.059> active<00:00:55.480> pickup<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:55.960> can<00:00:56.110> use<00:00:56.290> less<00:00:56.910> oil

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
with active pickup you can use less oil

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.869 
with active pickup you can use less oil
just<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.140> get<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.350> signal<00:00:59.620> from<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.309> string<00:01:00.610> and

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
just to get a signal from the string and

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.850 
just to get a signal from the string and
then<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.570> preamplifiers<00:01:02.290> that<00:01:02.559> are<00:01:02.620> inside

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
then the preamplifiers that are inside

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.730 
then the preamplifiers that are inside
an<00:01:03.040> active<00:01:03.370> pickup<00:01:03.760> can<00:01:04.330> enhance<00:01:04.750> you<00:01:05.680> can

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
an active pickup can enhance you can

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.350 
an active pickup can enhance you can
change<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.280> signal<00:01:06.640> for<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.850> tone<00:01:07.120> that<00:01:07.300> you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
change the signal for the tone that you

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.840 
change the signal for the tone that you
want<00:01:07.659> so<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:07.870> actually<00:01:08.080> use<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.070> circuit<00:01:09.490> to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
want so you actually use the circuit to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.550 
want so you actually use the circuit to
determine<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.510> type<00:01:10.690> of<00:01:10.720> output<00:01:11.050> that<00:01:11.409> you

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
determine the type of output that you

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.140 
determine the type of output that you
want<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.860> clean<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.280> want<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.610> or<00:01:12.730> how<00:01:12.880> bright

with<00:01:15.040> an<00:01:15.130> accurate<00:01:15.520> i<00:01:15.640> pick<00:01:15.970> up<00:01:16.090> huh<00:01:16.390> and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
with an accurate i pick up huh and

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.410 
with an accurate i pick up huh and
sometimes<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.380> can<00:01:17.500> use<00:01:17.680> a<00:01:17.710> 9<00:01:18.640> volt<00:01:18.670> system

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
sometimes you can use a 9 volt system
