00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
so there's no complicated steps or

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.050 
so there's no complicated steps or
anything<00:01:57.470> like<00:01:57.650> that<00:01:57.729> first<00:01:58.729> you<00:01:58.909> have<00:01:58.940> to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
anything like that first you have to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.390 
anything like that first you have to
open<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.420> app<00:01:59.570> on<00:01:59.810> your<00:02:00.020> smartphone<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.740> then

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
if you're using the micro USB cable go

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.340 
if you're using the micro USB cable go
ahead<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.100> plug<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.370> into<00:02:04.729> your<00:02:04.909> computer

ignore any kind of autoplay stuff just

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.510 
ignore any kind of autoplay stuff just
like<00:02:13.220> this

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
like this

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.100 
like this
where<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:13.940> pops<00:02:14.090> up<00:02:14.300> for<00:02:14.450> me<00:02:14.570> when<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.810> plug<00:02:15.020> in

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
where it pops up for me when I plug in

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
my phone we're not going to do any of

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.970 
my phone we're not going to do any of
that<00:02:16.610> doesn't<00:02:17.030> matter<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:18.200> here<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.800> Jory

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
that doesn't matter so here in the Jory

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.470 
that doesn't matter so here in the Jory
camp<00:02:19.190> program<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.670> can<00:02:19.760> see<00:02:19.910> there<00:02:20.060> are<00:02:20.180> four

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
camp program you can see there are four

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.590 
camp program you can see there are four
tabs<00:02:20.750> now<00:02:21.530> unfortunately<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:23.240> is<00:02:23.390> not<00:02:23.570> a

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
tabs now unfortunately this is not a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.060 
tabs now unfortunately this is not a
complete<00:02:23.990> in-depth<00:02:24.470> look<00:02:24.710> at<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.860> app

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
complete in-depth look at the app

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.160 
complete in-depth look at the app
because<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.760> have<00:02:25.910> not<00:02:26.060> used<00:02:26.300> any<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.960> tabs

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
because I have not used any of the tabs

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.520 
because I have not used any of the tabs
except<00:02:27.500> for<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.740> over<00:02:28.640> USB<00:02:28.910> tab<00:02:29.270> but<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.930> guess

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
except for the over USB tab but I guess

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.590 
except for the over USB tab but I guess
it's<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.830> brief<00:02:31.100> synopsis<00:02:31.370> here<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
it's like a brief synopsis here so the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.840 
it's like a brief synopsis here so the
first<00:02:32.810> tab<00:02:33.050> is<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.350> Wi-Fi<00:02:33.920> connect<00:02:34.640> over

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
first tab is the Wi-Fi connect over

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.850 
first tab is the Wi-Fi connect over
Wi-Fi<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.480> just<00:02:36.080> judging<00:02:36.290> by<00:02:36.470> this<00:02:36.530> it's

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
Wi-Fi and just judging by this it's

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.370 
Wi-Fi and just judging by this it's
saying<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.340> need<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.610> device<00:02:37.790> IP<00:02:38.380> now

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
saying that you need the device IP now

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.560 
saying that you need the device IP now
again<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.710> have<00:02:40.040> not<00:02:40.250> used<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.850> Wi-Fi<00:02:41.210> so<00:02:41.480> I'm

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
again I have not used the Wi-Fi so I'm

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.810 
again I have not used the Wi-Fi so I'm
not<00:02:41.720> exactly<00:02:42.380> sure<00:02:42.560> everything<00:02:43.400> about<00:02:43.580> that

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
not exactly sure everything about that

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.280 
not exactly sure everything about that
how<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.030> can<00:02:44.210> find<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.510> IP<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.930> whatnot<00:02:45.260> but

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
how you can find the IP and whatnot but

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.290 
how you can find the IP and whatnot but
it<00:02:45.560> should<00:02:45.830> be<00:02:45.980> noted<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.580> fourth<00:02:46.970> and

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
it should be noted that the fourth and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.320 
it should be noted that the fourth and
the<00:02:47.900> third<00:02:48.140> tab<00:02:48.410> here<00:02:48.800> or<00:02:49.160> create<00:02:49.880> Wi-Fi

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
the third tab here or create Wi-Fi

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.900 
the third tab here or create Wi-Fi
server<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:51.020> create<00:02:51.380> bluetooth<00:02:51.920> server<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.880> I

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
server and create bluetooth server so I

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.700 
server and create bluetooth server so I
am<00:02:53.150> sure<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.600> they're<00:02:53.750> all<00:02:53.900> intertwined

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
am sure that they're all intertwined

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.670 
am sure that they're all intertwined
with<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.100> Wi-Fi<00:02:55.670> here<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:57.200> let's<00:02:57.410> go<00:02:57.530> ahead

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
with this Wi-Fi here but let's go ahead

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.620 
with this Wi-Fi here but let's go ahead
to<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.890> second<00:02:58.250> tab<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.850> de<00:02:59.120> tab<00:02:59.300> that<00:02:59.450> I'm

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
to the second tab this de tab that I'm

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.900 
to the second tab this de tab that I'm
familiar<00:02:59.900> with<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:00.800> I<00:03:01.160> can<00:03:01.190> go<00:03:01.460> ahead<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.790> tell

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
familiar with so I can go ahead and tell

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.540 
familiar with so I can go ahead and tell
you<00:03:01.970> all<00:03:02.060> about<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.480> it's<00:03:03.320> very<00:03:03.380> simple<00:03:04.010> this

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
you all about this it's very simple this

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.060 
you all about this it's very simple this
droid<00:03:05.000> can<00:03:05.240> port<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.840> didn't<00:03:06.320> touch<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.980> do

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
droid can port I didn't touch and do

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.950 
droid can port I didn't touch and do
anything<00:03:07.460> it<00:03:07.670> just<00:03:07.700> took<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.120> by<00:03:08.300> itself<00:03:08.600> so

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
anything it just took that by itself so

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.960 
anything it just took that by itself so
you'll<00:03:09.530> have<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.740> change<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.160> there<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.760> no

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
you'll have to change that there is no

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.250 
you'll have to change that there is no
IP<00:03:11.180> because<00:03:11.570> you're<00:03:11.690> not<00:03:11.750> using<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.110> Wi-Fi

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
IP because you're not using the Wi-Fi

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.350 
IP because you're not using the Wi-Fi
right<00:03:13.130> here<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.550> can<00:03:13.670> choose<00:03:13.910> if<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.150> want

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
right here you can choose if you want

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.460 
right here you can choose if you want
the<00:03:14.480> video<00:03:14.720> and/or<00:03:15.560> audio<00:03:15.620> from<00:03:16.610> your<00:03:16.670> webcam

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
the video and/or audio from your webcam

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.440 
the video and/or audio from your webcam
again<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.500> would<00:03:19.070> say<00:03:19.280> just<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.670> video<00:03:19.970> because

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
again I would say just the video because

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.240 
again I would say just the video because
the<00:03:20.570> audio<00:03:20.930> would<00:03:21.140> be<00:03:21.260> absolutely<00:03:21.890> terrible

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
the audio would be absolutely terrible

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.880 
the audio would be absolutely terrible
seeing<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.270> a<00:03:23.300> phone<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.590> several

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
doing which I didn't touch anything it

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.190 
doing which I didn't touch anything it
just<00:04:06.770> went<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.790> quick<00:04:08.030> all<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.870> was<00:04:08.959> doing

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
just went that quick all it was doing

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.900 
just went that quick all it was doing
was<00:04:09.350> trying<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.890> see<00:04:10.100> if<00:04:10.130> your<00:04:10.489> theme<00:04:10.820> was

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
was trying to see if your theme was

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.400 
was trying to see if your theme was
connected<00:04:11.330> which<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.660> was<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.110> then<00:04:12.260> it

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
connected which it was and then it

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.800 
connected which it was and then it
showed<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:13.040> image<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:14.090> that<00:04:14.390> simple<00:04:14.750> to

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
showed the image so is that simple to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.289 
showed the image so is that simple to
connect<00:04:15.200> over<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.830> USB<00:04:16.100> again<00:04:16.880> I<00:04:16.910> have<00:04:17.150> not

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
connect over the USB again I have not

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.659 
connect over the USB again I have not
used<00:04:17.419> a<00:04:17.630> Wi-Fi<00:04:17.989> myself<00:04:18.440> so<00:04:18.799> I'm<00:04:19.040> sorry<00:04:19.310> that

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
used a Wi-Fi myself so I'm sorry that

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.490 
used a Wi-Fi myself so I'm sorry that
it's<00:04:19.910> not<00:04:20.030> we<00:04:20.150> in-depth<00:04:20.780> look<00:04:20.989> at<00:04:21.049> that<00:04:21.230> port

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
it's not we in-depth look at that port

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.140 
it's not we in-depth look at that port
but<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.100> think<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.580> should<00:04:22.610> probably<00:04:22.910> be<00:04:23.090> able

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
but I think you should probably be able

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.490 
but I think you should probably be able
to<00:04:23.270> figure<00:04:23.390> that<00:04:23.570> part<00:04:23.750> out<00:04:23.930> if<00:04:24.110> you<00:04:24.320> wouldn't

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
to figure that part out if you wouldn't

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.580 
to figure that part out if you wouldn't
use<00:04:24.680> that

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
use that

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.140 
use that
now<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:26.830> should<00:04:26.980> also<00:04:27.130> be<00:04:27.250> noted<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.760> you<00:04:27.880> use

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
now it should also be noted that you use

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.750 
now it should also be noted that you use
the<00:04:28.300> front<00:04:28.630> or<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.900> back<00:04:29.110> facing<00:04:29.800> cam<00:04:30.040> all<00:04:30.430> you
