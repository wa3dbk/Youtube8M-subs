 Continuum mode mode in which you are windows 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.500
 10 goes from working with the keyboard and 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.270
 mouse to touch in water and back 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.880
 following the transformation device but the most 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.890
 intriguing novelty and turned out to be microsoft 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.630
 hololens 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.210
 if in short it is a helmet augmented 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.189
 reality hololens complements reality 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.900
 holographic elements allowing 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.079
 interact with these ephemeral 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.970
 objects it is completely independent 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.880
 the device is equipped with and many 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.680
 Sensors 4 cameras glass display 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.310
 and a special processor which 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.900
 handles a huge array of data 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.790
 microsoft announced that the device will start 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.130
 do developers roughly 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.840
 In the summer, in particular, it was about space 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.150
 nasa agency that can 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.280
 use such helmets for your own purposes 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.490
 and here about consumer 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.409
 there is no information segment yet 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.450
 software giant really up 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.659
 leads up to the promised level 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.740
 it will be a kind of revolution 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.630
 technology can be used in 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.399
 any areas since 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.530
 corporate segment and medicine 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.420

 has limited mobility 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.769
 it works from the network but maybe 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.000
 mounted on a stand with wheels but 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.810
 it has an 84 inch 4- screen screen and a screen 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.489
 sensory 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.310
 and the computer itself is designed to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.720
 the price of new items until there is no data yet 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.920
 the manufacturer promises that the fsh will appear in 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.900
 on sale this year on the site kickstarter 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.019
 There is a fundraising for the release of the device 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.940
 3d doubler 20 who are its creators 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.850
 called the new version of the world's first 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.650
 pens for 3d printing versus 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.410
 the first version of the device has become smaller 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.530
 lighter and stronger, it looks like 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.480
 fountain pen in 3d understudy 20 used 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.519

 calculated for two hours of work and foot 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.829
 control panel company nederman 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.170
 offered a product that does not have 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.209
 nothing to do with the electronics it 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.400
 talking about a metal bracelet squad 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.409
 each of which is the embodiment 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.319
 at least two tools this and 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:02.049
 screwdrivers and wrenches and glass cutter and 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.000
 something else is just twenty five 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.310
 tool maker accents 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.780
 attention to the trend 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.000
 kind of masculine brutal 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.790
 An accessory worth noting is that the bracelet 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.340
 made of high strength steel grade 17 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.320
 4 separate modification will be able 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.449
 boast a black coating 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.099
 bracelet will be available not only in 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.599
 as a separate product by me together 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.550
 with specially designed 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.039
 mechanical watches that can 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.500
 boast sapphire crystal 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.539
 the cost of the bracelet will be equal to 150 and 200 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.460
 dollars depending on the version of 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:37.510
 the cost of hours of data is not yet scientists 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.430
 rochester university 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.800
 demonstrated their newest 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.139
 development of metal with hydrophobic 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.690
 properties that is such a metal which 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.580
 repel water metal is not covered 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.620
 by any substance by itself 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.169
 acquires hydrophobic properties due to 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.060
 on the laser pattern on 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.460
 currently the technology is in 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.590
 stages of refinement so one of hers 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.599
 features is very low 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.639
 coating creation performance 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.360
 in order to appropriately 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.390
 process 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.190
 one square 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.800
 the surface takes about an hour of time 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.970
 scientists are also looking for ways to endow 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.730
 hydrophobic properties of other 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.760
 materials use cases such 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.950
 metals hundreds ranging from cars 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.900
 aircraft ships and other equipment and 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.810
 ending medical field 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.210
 building segment and so on also 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.010
 don't forget that similar properties 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.260
 metal will protect it from corrosion and 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.120
 icing 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.770
 it was the most interesting news 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.470
