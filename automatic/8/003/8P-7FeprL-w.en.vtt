00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.449
 ah 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.070
 good friends, where are you and how are you? 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.140
 I'm back with our 7 twin2 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.860
 this time what we are going to do is 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.619
 small performance test with the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.349
 unknown tester this is a score 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.980
 what he gave me before is very important that 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.739
 know that the scores will vary 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.030
 as you go installing 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.500
 applications and have them running on 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.199
 background 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.250
 let's see how our progress marks 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.250
 this time 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.690
 This phone has very good performance 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.030
 It has four 1.3 megahertz cores each 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.289
 one has a gigabyte of ram 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.060
 used in all versions has 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:13.200
 an 8-megapixel rear camera 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:16.440
 Mark 8 points and 1.3 front of the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.409
 speakers are not very good and maybe 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.899
 those points 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.079
 but with hearing aids on good lips 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.079
 quality 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.240
 This is a very good phone for networks 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.120
 you can have all your networks at 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.600
 same time and we no kind of 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.240
 relationship 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.460
 a little problem that you have in the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.549
 memory but this is arranged after 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.820
 a very personal tracking and customization 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.409
 basic phone is very easy and it is 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.409
 worth it for the price it costs 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.160
 and let's let them finish 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.930
 he came back 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.240
 well this time it gave me lower score already 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:36.120
 that at the same time he was recording 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.200
 I'm doing the fish you could 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.030
 see the main one that I took a while ago and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.570
 Well let's see a bit of the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.540
 specifications we are hungry 4.2 in 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:54.270
 all and possibly an update 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:57.800
 of 4.4 point 4 the model of the cpvg mt 65 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:02.500
 82 mt here 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:07.970
 a rendering card in mali 400 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.400
 small resolution of 480 x 854 what 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.920
 I told them the rear camera 8.3 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.980
 megapixels 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.430
 Access 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.970
 of ram are they say always marked a 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.970
 little down
