00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
Newcombe has installed a nitrous oxide

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.929 
Newcombe has installed a nitrous oxide
injection<00:00:20.640> kit<00:00:21.390> which<00:00:22.580> we're<00:00:23.580> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.760> see

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
injection kit which we're going to see

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.429 
injection kit which we're going to see
some<00:00:24.180> pretty<00:00:24.300> good<00:00:24.510> gains<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.960> horsepower

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
some pretty good gains of horsepower

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.300 
some pretty good gains of horsepower
once<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.920> engage<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.630> boondock<00:00:28.590> kit<00:00:29.130> is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
once we engage that the boondock kit is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.929 
once we engage that the boondock kit is
cool

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
cool

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.830 
cool
because<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> ways<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:32.059> that<00:00:33.059> it's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
because one of the ways that that it's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.740 
because one of the ways that that it's
it's<00:00:34.200> self<00:00:35.130> adjusts<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.000> mixture<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it's self adjusts the mixture in the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
it's self adjusts the mixture in the
carburetor<00:00:37.110> by<00:00:37.530> having<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.920> manifold<00:00:38.460> attached

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
carburetor by having a manifold attached

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.690 
carburetor by having a manifold attached
to<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> intake<00:00:40.200> right<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.070> this

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
to the intake right here and this

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.900 
to the intake right here and this
manifold<00:00:42.649> puts<00:00:43.649> pressure<00:00:44.070> when<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.489> open<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
manifold puts pressure when you open the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880 
manifold puts pressure when you open the
when<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> nitrous<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.870> running<00:00:46.320> it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
when the nitrous is running it

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.410 
when the nitrous is running it
pressurizes<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.760> float<00:00:47.969> Bowl<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
pressurizes the float Bowl of the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.299 
pressurizes the float Bowl of the
carburetor<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> carburetor<00:00:49.950> self

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
carburetor so that the carburetor self

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.490 
carburetor so that the carburetor self
adjusts<00:00:50.850> itself<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> somewhat<00:00:51.809> make<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.230> for

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
adjusts itself to somewhat make up for

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.549 
adjusts itself to somewhat make up for
the<00:00:52.699> additional<00:00:53.930> nitrous<00:00:54.930> being<00:00:55.199> sprayed

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the additional nitrous being sprayed

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.680 
the additional nitrous being sprayed
into<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> motor<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.329> kind<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
into the motor so this is kind of a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.750 
into the motor so this is kind of a
safety<00:00:58.109> feature<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.280> don't<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
safety feature and you don't have to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.939 
safety feature and you don't have to
have<00:00:59.969> an<00:01:00.149> external<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.530> don't<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.859> have

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
have an external you don't have to have

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
have an external you don't have to have
another<00:01:02.190> fuel<00:01:02.520> pump<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.149> don't<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
another fuel pump and you don't have to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.410 
another fuel pump and you don't have to
pump<00:01:04.439> fuel<00:01:05.100> into<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.760> motor<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.270> it's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pump fuel into the motor so it's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.149 
pump fuel into the motor so it's
probably<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.900> little<00:01:06.990> simpler<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> little

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
probably a little simpler and a little

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.429 
probably a little simpler and a little
bit<00:01:08.280> more<00:01:08.430> reliable<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> clever

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
bit more reliable so this is a clever

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.649 
bit more reliable so this is a clever
system<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.280> we're<00:01:12.000> looking<00:01:12.240> forward<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
system and we're looking forward to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
system and we're looking forward to
putting<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> dyno<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.280> doing<00:01:14.490> some

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
putting it on the dyno and doing some

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
putting it on the dyno and doing some
testing<00:01:15.150> some<00:01:15.390> tuning<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.990> getting<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
testing some tuning and getting the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.859 
testing some tuning and getting the
jetting<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.310> squared<00:01:17.759> away<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:18.750> we

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
jetting all squared away and see if we

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:28.720 
jetting all squared away and see if we
can<00:01:18.990> make<00:01:19.170> some<00:01:19.320> real<00:01:19.500> horsepower<00:01:19.650> today

so<00:05:20.110> now<00:05:20.260> I'm<00:05:20.410> going<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.680> run<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.010> cursor<00:05:21.400> so

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
so now I'm going to run the cursor so

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.150 
so now I'm going to run the cursor so
that<00:05:21.880> you<00:05:21.970> can<00:05:22.150> see<00:05:22.560> how<00:05:23.560> the<00:05:23.620> horsepower

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
that you can see how the horsepower

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.290 
that you can see how the horsepower
gains<00:05:24.610> are<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.960> if<00:05:26.169> you<00:05:26.290> look<00:05:26.470> at<00:05:26.650> it<00:05:26.860> at<00:05:27.300> 4000

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
gains are so if you look at it at 4000

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.640 
gains are so if you look at it at 4000
rpm<00:05:29.160> without<00:05:30.160> nitrous<00:05:30.729> it<00:05:30.910> makes<00:05:31.229> 22.4<00:05:32.229> with

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
rpm without nitrous it makes 22.4 with

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.640 
rpm without nitrous it makes 22.4 with
nitrous<00:05:33.540> 34.7<00:05:34.540> that's<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.960> pretty<00:05:35.169> nice<00:05:35.410> little

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
falling off this is with us this is

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.469 
falling off this is with us this is
what's<00:06:44.810> with<00:06:45.199> a<00:06:45.229> stock<00:06:45.919> CDI<00:06:46.340> box<00:06:46.760> so<00:06:47.060> of<00:06:47.240> course

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 
what's with a stock CDI box so of course

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:48.790 
what's with a stock CDI box so of course
there's<00:06:47.660> not<00:06:47.780> a<00:06:47.840> whole<00:06:47.990> lot<00:06:48.139> of<00:06:48.169> Rev<00:06:48.410> out<00:06:48.590> but

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
there's not a whole lot of Rev out but

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.200 
there's not a whole lot of Rev out but
doesn't<00:06:49.039> have<00:06:49.099> a<00:06:49.160> lot<00:06:49.310> of<00:06:49.340> cams<00:06:49.699> so<00:06:49.910> some

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
doesn't have a lot of cams so some

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.550 
doesn't have a lot of cams so some
doesn't<00:06:50.570> need<00:06:50.660> to<00:06:50.780> rev<00:06:50.990> a<00:06:51.020> whole<00:06:51.229> lot<00:06:51.380> further

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
doesn't need to rev a whole lot further

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.120 
doesn't need to rev a whole lot further
than<00:06:51.740> that<00:06:51.889> anyway<00:06:53.110> so<00:06:54.110> I<00:06:54.139> would<00:06:54.530> say<00:06:54.800> that

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
than that anyway so I would say that

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.969 
than that anyway so I would say that
that's<00:06:55.880> a<00:06:56.060> pretty<00:06:56.240> substantial<00:06:56.509> gain<00:06:57.289> and<00:06:57.680> a

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
that's a pretty substantial gain and a

00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:59.770 
that's a pretty substantial gain and a
huge<00:06:58.280> gain<00:06:58.490> in<00:06:58.520> acceleration<00:06:59.389> because<00:06:59.630> the

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
huge gain in acceleration because the

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.129 
huge gain in acceleration because the
power<00:06:59.960> starts<00:07:00.410> it<00:07:01.400> starts<00:07:01.820> gaining<00:07:02.090> at<00:07:02.419> 4,000

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:03.139 
power starts it starts gaining at 4,000

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:05.469 
power starts it starts gaining at 4,000
rpm<00:07:03.560> there's<00:07:03.860> a<00:07:03.919> huge<00:07:04.160> games<00:07:04.490> and<00:07:04.910> all<00:07:05.180> the<00:07:05.330> way

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 
rpm there's a huge games and all the way

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:10.930 
rpm there's a huge games and all the way
through<00:07:05.930> so<00:07:07.870> there<00:07:08.870> it<00:07:09.050> is<00:07:09.310> boom<00:07:10.310> dr.<00:07:10.699> kit

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
through so there it is boom dr. kit

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.180 
through so there it is boom dr. kit
