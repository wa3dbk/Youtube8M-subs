00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
of the TV so the posture gets bad the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.410 
of the TV so the posture gets bad the
muscles<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> back<00:00:31.560> become<00:00:32.130> weaker<00:00:32.730> they

become coach for dentists in Somalia and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.850 
become coach for dentists in Somalia and
then<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.719> posture<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.840> bad<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.559> not

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
then the posture is bad but this is not

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.280 
then the posture is bad but this is not
very<00:00:38.040> bad<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.510> easily<00:00:39.690> corrected<00:00:39.989> by

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
very bad this can be easily corrected by

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.880 
very bad this can be easily corrected by
this<00:00:40.440> thing<00:00:41.600> developmentally<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.290> bones<00:00:43.620> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
this thing developmentally the bones of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.330 
this thing developmentally the bones of
the<00:00:44.040> spine<00:00:44.239> can<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.350> malformed<00:00:46.350> where<00:00:47.100> each

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the spine can be malformed where each

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.260 
the spine can be malformed where each
bond<00:00:48.149> must<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:49.260> angle<00:00:49.649> marine<00:00:49.890> level

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
bond must be at angle marine level

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.639 
bond must be at angle marine level
sometimes<00:00:51.270> they<00:00:51.390> are<00:00:51.480> formed<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> trapezoid

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
sometimes they are formed as a trapezoid

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.670 
sometimes they are formed as a trapezoid
then<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:53.910> some<00:00:54.180> hunchback<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.500> can

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
then they get some hunchback or it can

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
then they get some hunchback or it can
be<00:00:55.829> even<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> triangle<00:00:56.820> which<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.510> call<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
be even as a triangle which we call the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
be even as a triangle which we call the
semi<00:00:58.260> vertebral<00:00:58.710> body<00:00:59.190> vertebral<00:00:59.699> and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
semi vertebral body vertebral and

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.810 
semi vertebral body vertebral and
developer<00:01:00.559> developmentally<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.579> called

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
developer developmentally this is called

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.450 
developer developmentally this is called
congenital<00:01:03.180> kyphosis<00:01:03.930> from<00:01:04.650> birth<00:01:04.890> itself<00:01:05.250> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
congenital kyphosis from birth itself it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.850 
congenital kyphosis from birth itself it
is<00:01:05.580> dead<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.540> grows<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.960> becomes<00:01:07.530> worse

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
is dead and as it grows it becomes worse

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.609 
is dead and as it grows it becomes worse
and<00:01:08.100> worse<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> developmental

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and worse so this is a developmental

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.640 
and worse so this is a developmental
problem<00:01:10.820> but<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> worst<00:01:12.299> problem<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:13.409> men

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
problem but the worst problem which men

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.120 
problem but the worst problem which men
do<00:01:13.860> raise<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.280> very<00:01:14.610> severe<00:01:14.970> hunchbacks

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
do raise to very severe hunchbacks

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.410 
do raise to very severe hunchbacks
especially<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.220> our<00:01:17.310> country<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.970> developing

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
especially in our country and developing

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
especially in our country and developing
countries<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.770> infections<00:01:20.460> of

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
countries is because of infections of

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.730 
countries is because of infections of
the<00:01:20.759> spinal<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> childhood<00:01:22.710> daimler<00:01:23.250> when

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
the spinal so childhood daimler when

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.280 
the spinal so childhood daimler when
this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> either<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.430> tuberculosis<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.450> some

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
this is either like tuberculosis or some

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.069 
this is either like tuberculosis or some
other<00:01:28.470> infection<00:01:28.829> they<00:01:29.820> eat<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.390> bone<00:01:30.630> and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
other infection they eat the bone and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.710 
other infection they eat the bone and
also<00:01:31.439> eat<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.799> growth<00:01:32.009> plate<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.420> bone

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
also eat the growth plate so the bone

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.840 
also eat the growth plate so the bone
does<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:34.110> grow<00:01:34.380> after<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.490> segment

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
does not grow after that on the segment

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.940 
does not grow after that on the segment
level<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> whole<00:01:37.049> thing<00:01:37.259> collapses

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
level so the whole thing collapses

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.999 
level so the whole thing collapses
precipitously<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.509> over<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.290> period<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.710> 10

precipitously and over a period of 10

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.370 
precipitously and over a period of 10
years<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.970> starts<00:01:42.390> off<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.750> small<00:01:42.990> thing

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
years what starts off as a small thing

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.080 
years what starts off as a small thing
becomes<00:01:43.710> worse<00:01:43.979> worse<00:01:44.310> worse<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.820> becomes

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
becomes worse worse worse and becomes

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.679 
becomes worse worse worse and becomes
terribly<00:01:45.479> bad<00:01:46.399> when<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.520> crosses<00:01:47.820> 90<00:01:48.360> degrees

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
terribly bad when it crosses 90 degrees

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.590 
terribly bad when it crosses 90 degrees
it<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.140> produce<00:01:49.920> such<00:01:50.310> severe<00:01:50.610> stretching<00:01:51.479> of

it can produce such severe stretching of

sneak<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.720> they<00:02:03.720> get<00:02:03.900> paralysis<00:02:04.280> or<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> is

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
sneak and they get paralysis or if it is

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.900 
sneak and they get paralysis or if it is
around<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.300> chest<00:02:06.870> then<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:08.040> chest<00:02:08.369> volume

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
around the chest then the chest volume

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.760 
around the chest then the chest volume
becomes<00:02:09.300> very<00:02:09.509> less<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.410> they<00:02:10.590> get<00:02:10.710> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
becomes very less so they get a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.100 
becomes very less so they get a
restrictive<00:02:11.490> lung<00:02:11.970> disease<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.930> lungs

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
restrictive lung disease the lungs

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.590 
restrictive lung disease the lungs
cannot<00:02:13.470> expand<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.190> heart<00:02:14.430> cannot<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.970> faster

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
cannot expand the heart cannot be faster

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.380 
cannot expand the heart cannot be faster
and<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:16.680> by<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.920> time<00:02:17.130> they're<00:02:17.310> 30<00:02:17.580> or<00:02:17.910> 40<00:02:18.240> they

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
and so by the time they're 30 or 40 they

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.290 
and so by the time they're 30 or 40 they
become<00:02:18.660> breathless<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.820> longer<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.000> also

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
become breathless and longer it is also

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.070 
become breathless and longer it is also
reduced<00:02:22.430> number<00:02:23.430> Orla<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.270> commonest<00:02:24.690> causes

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
reduced number Orla the commonest causes

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.300 
reduced number Orla the commonest causes
tuberculosis<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.130> spine<00:02:26.330> very<00:02:27.330> very<00:02:27.540> good

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
tuberculosis of the spine very very good

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.410 
tuberculosis of the spine very very good
and<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.700> one<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:29.970> gives<00:02:30.180> rise<00:02:30.330> to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
and this is the one that gives rise to

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:39.530 
and this is the one that gives rise to
worst<00:02:31.260> form<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.570> hunchbacks<00:02:38.360> effect<00:02:39.360> being

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
worst form of hunchbacks effect being

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.480 
worst form of hunchbacks effect being
affected<00:02:39.990> by<00:02:40.080> tuber<00:02:40.350> clauses<00:02:40.860> will<00:02:41.250> not<00:02:41.340> beat

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
affected by tuber clauses will not beat

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.060 
affected by tuber clauses will not beat
it<00:02:41.520> across<00:02:42.470> many<00:02:43.470> cases<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:45.650> silent<00:02:46.650> Tommo<00:02:46.920> it

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
it across many cases the silent Tommo it

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.699 
it across many cases the silent Tommo it
can<00:02:47.280> affect<00:02:47.660> but<00:02:48.660> by<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.900> time<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.500> patient

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
can affect but by the time the patient

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.170 
can affect but by the time the patient
even<00:02:50.130> knows<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.400> they<00:02:50.760> have<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.970> major

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
even knows that they have a major

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.510 
even knows that they have a major
problem<00:02:51.570> many<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.770> ones<00:02:52.980> might<00:02:53.220> have<00:02:53.370> been

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
problem many of the ones might have been

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.199 
problem many of the ones might have been
already<00:02:53.840> eaten<00:02:54.840> off<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:56.040> what<00:02:56.310> was<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.940> main

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
already eaten off but what was the main

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.720 
already eaten off but what was the main
problem<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.810> initially<00:02:58.800> doctors<00:02:59.280> also<00:02:59.610> were

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
problem is initially doctors also were

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.000 
problem is initially doctors also were
treating<00:03:00.150> tuberculosis<00:03:00.390> as<00:03:01.050> an<00:03:01.440> infectious

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
treating tuberculosis as an infectious

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.920 
treating tuberculosis as an infectious
disease<00:03:02.040> only<00:03:02.610> when<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.120> affected<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.690> spine

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
disease only when it affected the spine

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.259 
disease only when it affected the spine
so<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.590> start<00:03:05.130> them<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.430> anti-tuberculosis

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
so you start them on anti-tuberculosis

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.190 
so you start them on anti-tuberculosis
drugs<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.470> disease<00:03:07.830> got<00:03:08.100> cured<00:03:08.550> in<00:03:09.239> about<00:03:09.570> one

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
drugs the disease got cured in about one

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.440 
drugs the disease got cured in about one
year<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.590> 18<00:03:10.890> months<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.370> then<00:03:11.880> we<00:03:12.060> followed

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
year to 18 months and then we followed

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.420 
year to 18 months and then we followed
the<00:03:12.570> children<00:03:12.750> for<00:03:13.140> two<00:03:13.290> years<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.980> then<00:03:14.190> said

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
the children for two years and then said

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.290 
the children for two years and then said
okay<00:03:14.730> you're<00:03:14.880> fine

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
okay you're fine

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.479 
okay you're fine
I<00:03:15.330> will<00:03:15.480> discharge<00:03:15.750> her<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.170> know<00:03:16.280> we<00:03:17.280> didn't

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
I will discharge her you know we didn't

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.180 
I will discharge her you know we didn't
realize<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:17.850> many<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.630> these<00:03:18.930> people<00:03:19.200> get

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
realize that many of these people get

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.880 
realize that many of these people get
the<00:03:20.459> worst<00:03:20.790> kind<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.269> deformity<00:03:21.750> after<00:03:22.680> ten

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
the worst kind of deformity after ten

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.430 
the worst kind of deformity after ten
years<00:03:23.750> because<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.110> spine<00:03:25.440> was<00:03:27.440> spine

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
years because the spine was spine

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.310 
years because the spine was spine
doesn't<00:03:28.680> grow<00:03:28.950> linearly<00:03:29.910> every<00:03:30.390> year<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:31.290> just

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
doesn't grow linearly every year it just

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.190 
doesn't grow linearly every year it just
grows<00:03:31.769> very<00:03:32.160> tall<00:03:32.550> within<00:03:33.480> three<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.900> five

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
grows very tall within three to five

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.350 
grows very tall within three to five
years<00:03:34.500> up<00:03:35.040> no<00:03:35.220> more<00:03:35.280> small<00:03:35.640> because<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.209> have

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
years up no more small because you have

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.350 
years up no more small because you have
one<00:03:36.750> another<00:03:36.989> up<00:03:37.650> from<00:03:38.190> ten<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.790> 14<00:03:39.180> years

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
one another up from ten to 14 years

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.880 
one another up from ten to 14 years
again<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.780> will<00:03:39.840> grow<00:03:40.050> very<00:03:40.200> fast<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:40.769> is

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
again it will grow very fast this is

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.850 
again it will grow very fast this is
called<00:03:41.100> growth<00:03:41.340> spurts<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:43.110> even<00:03:43.410> if<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
called growth spurts so even if the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.960 
called growth spurts so even if the
child<00:03:44.100> has<00:03:44.280> been<00:03:44.400> affected<00:03:44.850> with

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
child has been affected with

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.670 
child has been affected with
tuberculosis<00:03:45.300> in<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.750> age<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:46.019> five<00:03:46.350> and

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
tuberculosis in the age of five and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.610 
tuberculosis in the age of five and
completely<00:03:47.670> cured<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.150> tuberculosis<00:03:48.620> but

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
completely cured of tuberculosis but

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.530 
completely cured of tuberculosis but
when<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.950> growth<00:03:50.190> spurt<00:03:50.400> comes<00:03:50.850> there<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.450> a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
when the growth spurt comes there is a

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.380 
when the growth spurt comes there is a
lot<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.750> growth<00:03:52.080> anomalies<00:03:52.650> in<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.920> spine<00:03:53.640> so

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
lot of growth anomalies in the spine so

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.000 
lot of growth anomalies in the spine so
a<00:03:54.420> child<00:03:54.810> which<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:54.989> completely<00:03:55.620> cured<00:03:55.890> the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
a child which is completely cured the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.500 
a child which is completely cured the
six<00:03:56.220> years<00:03:56.459> ago<00:03:56.610> are<00:03:56.760> never<00:03:57.000> seeing<00:03:57.300> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
six years ago are never seeing the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.740 
six years ago are never seeing the
doctor<00:03:58.040> suddenly<00:03:59.040> becomes<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.459> hunchback<00:03:59.970> at

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
doctor suddenly becomes a hunchback at

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.020 
doctor suddenly becomes a hunchback at
the<00:04:00.989> age<00:04:01.110> of<00:04:01.260> thirteen<00:04:01.920> or<00:04:02.010> fourteen<00:04:02.070> this<00:04:02.820> we

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
the age of thirteen or fourteen this we

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.690 
the age of thirteen or fourteen this we
did<00:04:03.209> not<00:04:03.330> really
