00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:08.620
 hi my name is guillermo zermeÃ±o 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.590
 and today I'm going to talk about melasma 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.040
 or the cloth that are spots especially 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.130
 that are done in most of the 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.920
 after women especially when 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.349
 they are in pregnancy and there are many 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.930
 causes to which this is called 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.809
 problem one is for the replacement 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.270
 hormonal or use of contraceptives 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:34.840
 hormones and another is 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.840
 x 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:42.280
 stress that is affecting the thyroid other 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.850
 it's been for the sun that is the one 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.390
 more is blamed 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.120
 I'm going to say that in alternative medicine 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.860
 The main cause for us is not 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.379
 it would be the sun 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.989
 Maybe the sun helps the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.030
 spots but not because it's the cause 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.000
 main sun 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.589
 contraceptives or hormones if 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.380
 It could be a cause I'll explain 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.110
 why 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.710
 for alternative medicine the spots 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.520
 in the face 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.299
 especially the melasma or the cloth there is 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.430
 several types of more melodies or spots and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.000
 it depends on the spots is the kind of 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.690
 problem that we are having 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.340
 you're going to be the kind of spots good this 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.619
 for alternative medicine comes 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.070
 mainly because the liver is 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.409
 affecting what does this mean that the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.750
 liver can be affected by the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.030
 or can be affected by the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.540
 emotions 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 in this case if the illness is for a 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.100
 emotional problem this is for courage is 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.190
 for feelings then if you 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.500
 You expose yourself to the sun because you will be more 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.680
 spots depends on the type of problems 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.840
 that you have for example a woman who 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.459
 has the butterfly-shaped stain 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.410
 Well, it's a woman that maybe has 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.090
 much courage with the man a lot 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.209
 resentment for the damage that has 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.090
 made by cheating then the woman 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.459
 it begins to stain at best if it 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.980
 put in the sun because it will go wrong 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.080
 stain but it's not because the fault is 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.660
 of the sun is by herself for her 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.970
 emotions because she is leaving 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.980
 delude with that kind of resentment 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.920
 with the hatred he has towards man 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.450
 that's why his problem is getting dirty 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.720
 comes from the liver because that's where it 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.870
 save the information 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.629
 of this kind of courage that they already have 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.370
 for this the solution would be to see a 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.640
 homeopath to see the situation 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.980

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.760
