00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.580
 [Music] 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.650
 Welcome to the new app review with pole 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:15.129
 Today I'll show you a little tweet 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:20.620
 with which you can improve your iphone 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:22.810
 and that's sensational and that's why 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.950
 he has a German for us 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.890
 translate 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.270
 I wish a lot of fun with video and at 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.679
 the best to the atx ever 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.019
 please little fun I have one 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.129
 little bit drunk 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:39.039
 yes, I will start with them 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:42.519
 atx I have already quit and 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:46.059
 Although we start with the innovation center 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:49.179
 the track and settings are free 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.489
 can charge and with this 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.769
 Application has the possibility over the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.379
 notification center about settings 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:00.370
 say we can wireless 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.579
 lan on and off sees first 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.130
 of course super cool and does too 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.540
 a little something and above all 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.670
 free now shows sometimes like that 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.050
 whole works when it is 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.740
 all a bit different at high and 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.960
 pull down 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.670
 that equates said then also noticed 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.620
 I can show you right here 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.590
 the internet wlan on and off 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.570
 yes works great you see you are working 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.030
 immediately so that does not delay 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.130
 or something is a great thing 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.490
 you can do all sorts of things 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.740
 volume et cetera pp really one 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.380
 really really cool thing and can 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.120
 I just really want to put my heart first 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.740
 super tweak mobile data can be synonymous with it 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.150
 Issue 3g and issue the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.060
 vibrations would be the ringing tone 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.940
 actually on the left on the iphone use 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.230
 we can even park here 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.390
 should that be broken then you have the 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.920
 possibility that there is a and 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.140
 also turn off the nice thing for 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.659
 one or the other we come to the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.670
 next tweet 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.989
 there we have a few apps 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:15.459
 for opening the do now times just so 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:18.819
 where still open with and then I show 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.200
 something is really cool you know the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.660
 if you are from one app to the other 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.880
 wanted to jump that works yes 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.130
 unfortunately not with the simple finger 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.530
 back and forth vision already like us 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.590
 We can now see with you 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.350
 a finger set by default 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.480
 Skip to another app without 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.069
 that we have the homebutton twice 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.880
 and then and then 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:46.319
 to be able to jump so a great thing 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.519
 only is the problem, of course, doing the 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.890
 with the first finger straight if you 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:55.480
 has now pictures in it is no longer 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.670
 it works so well I show what 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.519
 I mean by that I 'm going in 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.640
 the photos in here if I'm here now 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.860
 want to look at the photos 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.069
 Let's take this from pippi 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.690
 I want the album then foto except when 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.890
 I am still here, I am switche 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.220
 again in nowo in there though me 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.690
 actually wanted to see the next picture 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.239
 so to speak a bit against 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.880
 Of course you can continue to tackle 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.290
 in the picture switching yes then that happens 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.390
 not then you can the photos as synonymous 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.500
 easy to move 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.880
 but there is still a possibility with it 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.950
 that did not happen then you in 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.209
 An app can land in the 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.900
 attitudes there we go now too 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.840
 take a look 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:47.739
 completely change the whole and z4 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.640
 That is called and here you can under mamba 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:55.180
 on singles the whole switch to one 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.079
 two three four and have it now times on 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.760
 tour and then it works 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.040
 Of course, only with two fingers 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.620
 and since you can now stop in a fancy 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.239
 and as much back and forth there must switchen 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.910
 Now you use two fingers with it 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.290
 jumping off to the next one can be awesome 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.480
 So I definitely recommend something 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.060
 switch to at least two fingers 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.150
 We'll come to it to work well 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:20.060
 my last favorite trick 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.230
 austria and that is complicated me 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.970
 do you need someone from me? 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.830
 I hope I write myself 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.980
 somebody that happens very seldom 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.440
 and this tweet is currently 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.840
 free because they are still in the beta 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:38.180
 phase is and she calls herself quick quick 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:41.210
 Replay whatsapp for whats app and 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.470
 allows us that if we now the 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.850
 get news like for example from 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.070
 agnieszka that we immediately 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.300
 we can now answer 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.200
 that also open as can 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.360
 now but also about the notification 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.760
 center that again open and we see 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.400
 aha we can go right here now 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.680
 Write without us, so to speak 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.139
 are like whatsapp is not synonymous 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.729
 indicated that we opened the open 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.340
 So there is no online whatsapp 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.990
 yes is a great thing here you can see 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.880
 it again that really 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.840
 works if we have the iphone 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.610
 have locked 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.680
 even then there will be the news 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.770
 displayed a super nice thing or 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.380
 like to be able to thumb my thumb for it 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.570
 then we even answer directly 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.330
 the option to add smileys to the 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.850
 to go really right yes if he does this 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.630
 tweets also finds so awesome times 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.430
 thumbs up 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.840
 I thank you for this job 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.260
 watch and say goodbye and watch 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:06:00.789
