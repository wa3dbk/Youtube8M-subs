00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.830
 square and make fatal download 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.470
 now you see a window opens 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.670
 where then you will download the setup the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.480
 classic setup if it did anything 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.450

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.630
 you will install it in your own 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.910
