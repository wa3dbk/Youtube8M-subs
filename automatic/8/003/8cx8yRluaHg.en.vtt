sports<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.230> we<00:00:10.320> are<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.889> product

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
sports and we are in the product

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.370 
sports and we are in the product
development<00:00:11.580> lab<00:00:11.840> very<00:00:12.840> cool<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.259> we've

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
development lab very cool and so we've

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.220 
development lab very cool and so we've
got<00:00:13.500> some<00:00:13.679> some<00:00:14.009> footballs<00:00:14.429> here<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.139> some<00:00:16.139> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
got some some footballs here and some of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.130 
got some some footballs here and some of
them<00:00:16.350> are<00:00:16.500> pumped<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.420> 12.5<00:00:18.420> that's<00:00:18.869> right

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
them are pumped to 12.5 that's right

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.769 
them are pumped to 12.5 that's right
here<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.500> we've<00:00:19.980> got<00:00:20.160> four<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> them<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:21.210> well

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
here so we've got four of them here well

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.540 
here so we've got four of them here well
three<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.050> them<00:00:22.320> are<00:00:22.439> 12<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> half<00:00:23.010> psi

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
three of them are 12 and a half psi

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.670 
three of them are 12 and a half psi
which<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> minimum<00:00:24.439> inflation<00:00:25.439> pressure

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
which is the minimum inflation pressure

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.009 
which is the minimum inflation pressure
for<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> NFL<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.880> then<00:00:27.330> we've<00:00:27.480> got<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> couple

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
for the NFL and then we've got a couple

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.470 
for the NFL and then we've got a couple
that<00:00:28.349> are<00:00:28.560> at<00:00:29.010> ten<00:00:29.310> point<00:00:29.580> five<00:00:29.760> which<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.179> what

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
that are at ten point five which is what

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.479 
that are at ten point five which is what
the<00:00:30.720> Patriots<00:00:31.349> allegedly<00:00:31.769> deflated<00:00:32.340> their

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the Patriots allegedly deflated their

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.410 
the Patriots allegedly deflated their
balls<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:34.350> first<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.090> want<00:00:36.360> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
balls to so first of all I just want to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540 
balls to so first of all I just want to
show<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> sort<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.680> measure<00:00:38.309> air

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
show you sort of how we measure air

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.190 
show you sort of how we measure air
pressure<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:39.030> use<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.329> little<00:00:39.660> device<00:00:39.780> here

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
pressure we use this little device here

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.860 
pressure we use this little device here
it's<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.500> digi-gate<00:00:41.360> this<00:00:42.360> ball<00:00:42.600> has<00:00:42.719> been<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it's a digi-gate this ball has been a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.630 
it's a digi-gate this ball has been a
little<00:00:43.110> overinflated<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.309> stick

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
little overinflated but you just stick

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.670 
little overinflated but you just stick
it<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.840> get<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> pressure<00:00:46.350> then

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it in and you get the pressure then

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
it in and you get the pressure then
there's<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> easy<00:00:47.129> button<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.610> top<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.420> lets

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
there's a easy button on top that lets

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.209 
there's a easy button on top that lets
you<00:00:48.809> deflate<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
you deflate it so that you can get it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.910 
you deflate it so that you can get it
down<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.610> pressure<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.120> want<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.739> can

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
down to the pressure you want so you can

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.500 
down to the pressure you want so you can
see<00:00:53.160> I'm<00:00:53.460> dropping<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> pressure<00:00:54.059> pretty

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
see I'm dropping the pressure pretty

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.200 
see I'm dropping the pressure pretty
quick<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.530> pretty<00:00:55.739> small<00:00:55.860> device<00:00:56.430> just

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
quick it's a pretty small device just

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.270 
quick it's a pretty small device just
fits<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.539> your<00:00:57.660> hand<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.100> very

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
fits in your hand and you can very

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.700 
fits in your hand and you can very
easily<00:00:59.340> just<00:01:00.000> stick<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.629> valve<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
easily just stick the valve or the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.500 
easily just stick the valve or the
device<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.399> ball<00:01:02.640> take<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.030> pressures

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
device into a ball take the pressures

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450 
device into a ball take the pressures
down<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> want<00:01:04.199> maybe<00:01:04.650> five<00:01:04.949> seven

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
down to what you want maybe five seven

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.060 
down to what you want maybe five seven
seconds<00:01:05.970> pull<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.600> out<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.200> toss<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
seconds pull it out and then toss the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.530 
seconds pull it out and then toss the
ball<00:01:08.220> back<00:01:08.430> into<00:01:08.700> play<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.119> would<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.330> very

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
ball back into play it would be very

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.190 
ball back into play it would be very
easy<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.939> are<00:01:12.180> advantages<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
easy to do so there are advantages to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.740 
easy to do so there are advantages to
having<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.799> deflated<00:01:14.280> ball<00:01:14.490> we've<00:01:15.330> done<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> lot

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
having a deflated ball we've done a lot

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.200 
having a deflated ball we've done a lot
of<00:01:15.810> work<00:01:16.490> developing<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.700> grip<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.060> our

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
of work developing the grip of our

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.230 
of work developing the grip of our
leather<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.290> use<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:20.189> grip<00:01:20.909> test

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
leather and for that we use a grip test

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
leather and for that we use a grip test
and<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.840> discovered<00:01:22.560> very<00:01:22.799> early<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.490> using

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and we discovered very early in using

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.730 
and we discovered very early in using
this<00:01:24.180> grip<00:01:24.420> test<00:01:24.659> how<00:01:24.810> important<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.500> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
this grip test how important it was that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770 
this grip test how important it was that
every<00:01:25.979> ball<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.369> tested<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> same<00:01:27.330> psi

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
every ball we tested be at the same psi

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.020 
every ball we tested be at the same psi
because<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> dramatically<00:01:28.920> impacted<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
because it dramatically impacted the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.399 
because it dramatically impacted the
grip<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.630> were<00:01:30.689> trying<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> measure<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
grip and we were trying to measure the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.270 
grip and we were trying to measure the
leather<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.009> ball<00:01:32.570> but<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.130> reason<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
leather not the ball but the reason that

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.300 
leather not the ball but the reason that
that<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.670> true<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.570> softer<00:01:37.290> ball<00:01:37.530> allows

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that is true is a softer ball allows

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
that is true is a softer ball allows
your<00:01:38.460> finger<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.119> depress<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.900> leather<00:01:40.110> more

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
your finger to depress the leather more

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.080 
your finger to depress the leather more
easily<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> depress<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> leather

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
easily and when you depress the leather

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.760 
easily and when you depress the leather
you<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.329> more<00:01:42.540> surface<00:01:42.899> area<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.560> more

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
you get more surface area you get more

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
you get more surface area you get more
grip<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.880> also<00:01:45.030> makes<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> ball<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> bit

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
grip and it also makes the ball a bit

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.030 
grip and it also makes the ball a bit
smaller<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> hands<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> can

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
smaller in the hands so you can

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.649 
smaller in the hands so you can
definitely<00:01:47.280> squeeze<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.090> hang<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
definitely squeeze it and hang on to the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.649 
definitely squeeze it and hang on to the
ball<00:01:48.840> better<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.320> exact<00:01:49.920> greater<00:01:50.390> force<00:01:51.390> on

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
ball better and exact greater force on

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.850 
ball better and exact greater force on
the<00:01:51.780> leather<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.140> keep<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> from<00:01:52.500> pulling<00:01:52.560> out

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the leather to keep it from pulling out

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.389 
the leather to keep it from pulling out
of<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.040> hand

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
of your hand

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.149 
of your hand
well<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.790> found<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:55.439> adjusting<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
well we found is that just adjusting the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.260 
well we found is that just adjusting the
RPMs<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.060> ball<00:01:57.270> from<00:01:57.869> 7,200<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> 5400<00:01:59.820> you

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
RPMs of a ball from 7,200 to 5400 you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300 
RPMs of a ball from 7,200 to 5400 you
know<00:02:00.390> which<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.710> within<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.130> range

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
know which is you know within the range

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.469 
know which is you know within the range
of<00:02:02.430> what<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> quarterback<00:02:03.090> could<00:02:03.240> put<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
of what a quarterback could put on a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.719 
of what a quarterback could put on a
ball<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.350> deep<00:02:04.649> pass<00:02:04.920> cannot<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
ball on a deep pass cannot be the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.240 
ball on a deep pass cannot be the
difference<00:02:06.119> between<00:02:06.570> four<00:02:07.079> feet<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.069> can

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
difference between four feet so you can

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.859 
difference between four feet so you can
actually<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.849> ball<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.090> travel<00:02:09.390> further

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
actually get that ball to travel further

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.690 
actually get that ball to travel further
and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.369 
and
accurately<00:02:11.180> in<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.450> air<00:02:11.599> by<00:02:11.840> spinning<00:02:12.319> it

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
accurately in the air by spinning it

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.580 
accurately in the air by spinning it
faster<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.129> when<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.819> throw<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> football<00:02:14.590> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
faster so when you throw a football the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.930 
faster so when you throw a football the
last<00:02:15.830> thing<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.190> make<00:02:16.340> contact<00:02:16.790> with<00:02:16.879> that

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
last thing to make contact with that

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.940 
last thing to make contact with that
ball<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.450> index<00:02:17.810> finger<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.349> he<00:02:18.800> would

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
ball is the index finger and he would

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.800 
ball is the index finger and he would
tell<00:02:19.129> us<00:02:19.160> from<00:02:19.459> his<00:02:19.760> playing<00:02:20.060> days<00:02:20.209> when<00:02:20.690> he

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
tell us from his playing days when he

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.479 
tell us from his playing days when he
wanted<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.260> throw<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.530> really<00:02:21.860> deep<00:02:22.010> accurate

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
wanted to throw a really deep accurate

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.280 
wanted to throw a really deep accurate
pass<00:02:22.700> he<00:02:23.330> wouldn't<00:02:23.540> think<00:02:23.569> about<00:02:23.840> throwing<00:02:24.050> a

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
pass he wouldn't think about throwing a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.020 
pass he wouldn't think about throwing a
harder<00:02:24.680> he<00:02:24.830> think<00:02:25.010> about<00:02:25.040> snapping<00:02:25.700> his<00:02:25.819> wrist

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
harder he think about snapping his wrist

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.250 
harder he think about snapping his wrist
harder<00:02:26.360> because<00:02:26.780> what<00:02:26.930> he<00:02:26.989> was<00:02:27.019> actually

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
harder because what he was actually

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.440 
harder because what he was actually
doing<00:02:27.470> was<00:02:27.680> spinning<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.370> ball<00:02:28.550> faster<00:02:29.150> and

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
doing was spinning the ball faster and

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.150 
doing was spinning the ball faster and
that's<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:30.019> gave<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.410> further<00:02:30.650> distance

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
that's what gave it the further distance

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.400 
that's what gave it the further distance
and<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.370> more<00:02:31.519> accuracy<00:02:31.970> well<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:33.200> know<00:02:33.260> we

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
and the more accuracy well you know we

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.320 
and the more accuracy well you know we
put<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.680> race<00:02:33.920> team<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.459> our<00:02:34.489> ball<00:02:34.819> because<00:02:35.180> we

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
put a race team on our ball because we

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.940 
put a race team on our ball because we
know<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.510> index<00:02:35.989> finger<00:02:36.080> has<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.560> hook<00:02:36.739> on

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
know that index finger has to hook on

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.070 
know that index finger has to hook on
something<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.790> get<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.120> good<00:02:38.390> spin<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.930> that

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
something to get that good spin of that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.050 
something to get that good spin of that
last<00:02:39.290> point<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.680> contact<00:02:39.739> we<00:02:40.640> need<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.879> flay

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
last point of contact we need to flay

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.880 
last point of contact we need to flay
the<00:02:41.090> ball<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.959> allow<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.319> finger<00:02:42.769> to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
the ball you allow that finger to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.890 
the ball you allow that finger to
depress<00:02:43.220> even<00:02:43.640> warn<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.239> ball<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.750> get

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
depress even warn to the ball so you get

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.229 
depress even warn to the ball so you get
an<00:02:45.080> even<00:02:45.260> more<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.830> Ridge<00:02:46.099> so<00:02:47.030> for<00:02:47.209> a

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
an even more of a Ridge so for a

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.030 
an even more of a Ridge so for a
quarterback<00:02:47.660> having<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.349> deflated<00:02:48.829> ball

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
quarterback having a deflated ball

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.370 
quarterback having a deflated ball
you're<00:02:49.579> able<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.940> spin<00:02:50.299> it<00:02:50.420> faster<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:50.930> throw

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
you're able to spin it faster and throw

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.380 
you're able to spin it faster and throw
it<00:02:51.530> deeper<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.069> accurately<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:53.180> there's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
it deeper and more accurately so there's

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.420 
it deeper and more accurately so there's
obvious<00:02:53.780> reasons<00:02:54.650> why<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:54.950> would<00:02:55.250> definitely

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
obvious reasons why you would definitely

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.340 
obvious reasons why you would definitely
want<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.000> have<00:02:56.299> a<00:02:56.630> slightly<00:02:57.590> deflated<00:02:57.890> ball
