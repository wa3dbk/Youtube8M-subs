00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.090
 we are ferdinando 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.100
 and oscar manara 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.100
 the 3d modeling 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.360
 of course we have built and designed 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.290
 able to reuse life on 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.290
 ground plastic caps 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.230
 in practice us by shredding 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.450
 of these simple caps that they are 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.350
 available at home either domestically or 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:38.019
 with a door-to-door collection system 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.610
 we create this ground now 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.040
 this moment is ground and of 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.699
 different types of data and inserting it into 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:50.409
 this machine through a system that 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:52.540
 we designed is precisely marched 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:56.379
 in this thread that right now is 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.449
 a wire that has a diameter of 175 mm which 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.309
 then it will be used for 3d printers 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.799
 that is, we have invented a machine 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.960
 which serves to produce the raw material 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.119
 for 3d printing it can be used 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.330
 for many uses since installation 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.950
 artistic from 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.450
 for the installation of works 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.400
 contemporary use of these 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.400
 Today filaments are at the peak of fashion 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.109
 currently we have 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.240
 a series from reggio calabria in via ca 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.670
 all at the intersection with via mazzini 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.200
 we are in the process of restructuring given 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.030
 that we are doing everything ours 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.030
 forces with those four bucks we have 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.420
 we wanted to open last week then 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.159
 for garbage problems for 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.409
 pose many other problems and there 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.549
 we still find ourselves still and we hope to 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.549
 leave to take place 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.920
 when we are 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:57.020
 that our work could be useful 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.570
 to the company we started precisely 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.670
 to our research on reuse 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.370
 of domestic plastics that 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.570
 they come just to experiment 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.060
 daily basis 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.250
 we have made some hardware changes and 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.950
 therefore physical to our machinery in 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.780
 so that this could spin this 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.090
 kind of plastik so start 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.870
 finally a speech to be able to render 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.870
 to the royal channel
