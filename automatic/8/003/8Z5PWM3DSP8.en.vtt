00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 happy child because we like to be parents 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.950
 Now I stand here while stopping is apps 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.040
 and I'm not sure what 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.170
 that is a new development in 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.020
 Germany since april on the on the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.150
 market so what's new is one 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.430
 combination of high chair and baby rocker 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.210
 We know that 70 percent of all parents 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.300
 to buy a high chair will be around 60 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.929
 percent of all parents also a seesaw 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.450
 Now we have both 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.890
 combined the vip works first 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.120
 times like a seesaw or if 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.000
 English is also spoken for a few days 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.879
 a better if I hold them together 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 that is similar to the triptrap have 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.530
 I in this constellation one 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.800
 newborn seat we from 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.149
 at the beginning sit right at the table 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.829
 So for the phase for the first three 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.320
 until six months if the child is still 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.360
 can not sit independently 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.129
 ok and if the baby is not in this anymore 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 shell suits comes the next shock if 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.640
 the next step a few if it 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.559
 Now we can sit all the time 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.560
 a babysitter after six o'clock 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.930
 six months in the babies there are 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
 another tray first two sticks 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.500
 That's why we did that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.880
 It's nice when we're all together 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.799
 is sitting in the meals but 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.600
 However, more notice that one 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.159
 baby needs to be fed much more often 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.659
 as three times a day and where this 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.909
 between meals so we have this 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.970
 trailer where it developed course 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.860
 pretty good for play etc 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.620
 he is also very handy if something 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.170
 Environment can be so very 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.540
 hold it horizontally without taking out anything 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.540
 to spill that too very important and 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.610
 Also this baby set grows with us 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.060
 several phases until it is not 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.660
 needs more and then as a full-grown 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.110
 child from three years about no 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.120
 In addition to hearing more needs and here 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.820
 is however so here we have such a 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.100
 a weight limit of 85 kilo das 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.540
 We say roughly until the tenth 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.610
 year of life this chair is suitable 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.250
 okay I like this color very well 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.790
 I see there are other colors as well 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.610
 So that the sound noises as in the 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.660
 So a mixture of gray and beige 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.730
 then break this red and blue 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.170
 orange so we start now completely on 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.090
 beginning to market launches with these 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.780
 four colors 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.400
 possibly come later 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.320
 We will then add other designs 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.940
 if you see then 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.230
 to the other colors it is with the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.530
 plastic parts we will stay first 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.560
 in white wooden parts either in book 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.440
 nature or walnut so a dark wood 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.209
 what synonymous with youtube would be quite 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.040
 important, what does it cost me if i do 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.700
 this chair in our dining room 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.239
 would like to have 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.250
 The chair costs 179 again 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.130
 euro the rocker you also individually 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.060
 can buy is 169 and then 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:58.760
