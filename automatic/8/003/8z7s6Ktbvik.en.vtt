00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
never out of it until this thing's over

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.920 
never out of it until this thing's over
you<00:04:13.950> know<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.820> just<00:04:15.030> look<00:04:15.269> at<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.420> game<00:04:15.750> you

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
you know you just look at that game you

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.810 
you know you just look at that game you
think<00:04:16.140> at<00:04:16.320> what<00:04:16.769> point<00:04:17.100> did<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.430> Nuggets

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
think at what point did the Nuggets

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.880 
think at what point did the Nuggets
think<00:04:18.030> oh<00:04:18.150> because<00:04:18.660> we<00:04:18.780> hear<00:04:18.989> Carl<00:04:19.260> Malone<00:04:19.590> say

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
think oh because we hear Carl Malone say

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.289 
think oh because we hear Carl Malone say
okay<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.519> point<00:04:20.790> I<00:04:20.820> realize<00:04:21.060> we<00:04:21.180> had<00:04:21.269> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
okay this point I realize we had a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.850 
okay this point I realize we had a
chance<00:04:21.540> but<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.959> know<00:04:22.200> at<00:04:22.350> some<00:04:22.530> point<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
chance but you know at some point the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.020 
chance but you know at some point the
Nuggets<00:04:23.130> started<00:04:23.430> looking<00:04:23.669> over<00:04:23.880> their

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
Nuggets started looking over their

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.360 
Nuggets started looking over their
shoulder<00:04:24.630> checking<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.440> clock<00:04:25.740> checking<00:04:26.310> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
shoulder checking the clock checking the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.969 
shoulder checking the clock checking the
score<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:26.880> then<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.690> think<00:04:28.320> as<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> player<00:04:28.740> you

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
score and then I think as a player you

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.530 
score and then I think as a player you
can<00:04:29.160> feel<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.370> momentum<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:29.970> switch<00:04:30.360> it

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
can feel that momentum to switch it

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.909 
can feel that momentum to switch it
doesn't<00:04:30.810> matter<00:04:30.930> if<00:04:31.050> it's<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.229> point<00:04:31.590> or<00:04:31.770> two

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
doesn't matter if it's a point or two

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.080 
doesn't matter if it's a point or two
and<00:04:32.190> then<00:04:32.280> sometimes<00:04:32.610> you're<00:04:32.760> thinking<00:04:32.970> it

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
and then sometimes you're thinking it

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.610 
and then sometimes you're thinking it
all<00:04:33.390> we<00:04:33.510> need<00:04:33.630> is<00:04:33.720> a<00:04:33.750> couple<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.110> jumpers<00:04:34.440> to

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
all we need is a couple of jumpers to

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.290 
all we need is a couple of jumpers to
fall<00:04:34.800> but<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.490> ball<00:04:35.669> gets<00:04:35.850> a<00:04:35.910> little<00:04:36.000> heavier

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
fall but that ball gets a little heavier

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.570 
fall but that ball gets a little heavier
things<00:04:36.900> get<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.140> little<00:04:37.380> tougher<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.370> Jazz

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
things get a little tougher and the Jazz

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.980 
things get a little tougher and the Jazz
made<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.850> great<00:04:39.150> run<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.510> that's<00:04:39.720> where<00:04:39.900> they

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
made a great run that that's where they

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.390 
made a great run that that's where they
did<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.350> you've<00:04:40.470> got<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.710> team<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.250> the

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
did and you've got a team like the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.820 
did and you've got a team like the
Nuggets<00:04:41.760> at<00:04:41.910> some<00:04:42.150> point<00:04:42.450> saying<00:04:43.200> hey<00:04:43.440> we<00:04:43.590> got

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
Nuggets at some point saying hey we got

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.250 
Nuggets at some point saying hey we got
this<00:04:44.070> we're<00:04:44.669> up<00:04:44.820> by<00:04:44.970> this<00:04:45.030> much<00:04:45.479> 30-some

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
this we're up by this much 30-some

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.279 
this we're up by this much 30-some
points<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:48.360> know<00:04:48.450> let's<00:04:48.660> just<00:04:48.870> cruise

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
points and you know let's just cruise

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.350 
points and you know let's just cruise
from<00:04:49.530> here<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.010> that's<00:04:50.460> when<00:04:50.700> that's<00:04:51.120> which

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
from here and that's when that's which

from here and that's when that's which
happens
