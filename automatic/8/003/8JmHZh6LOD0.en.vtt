00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
really at that point was just getting it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.170 
really at that point was just getting it
right<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.500> finding<00:02:26.459> someone<00:02:26.730> who<00:02:26.970> could

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:04.729 
actually didn't like the idea of me
raising<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:03.870> she<00:04:03.930> said<00:04:04.049> oh<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.139> like<00:04:04.379> my<00:04:04.409> little

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
raising it she said oh I like my little

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.190 
raising it she said oh I like my little
nose<00:04:04.920> but<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:05.849> used<00:04:06.180> computer<00:04:06.569> imaging<00:04:07.019> and

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
nose but I used computer imaging and

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.020 
nose but I used computer imaging and
with<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.739> computer<00:04:08.159> imaging<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.669> actually<00:04:08.790> was

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
with the computer imaging I actually was

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.580 
with the computer imaging I actually was
able<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.299> demonstrate<00:04:09.480> her<00:04:09.900> what<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.500> would

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
able to demonstrate her what it would

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.939 
able to demonstrate her what it would
look<00:04:10.709> like<00:04:10.769> if<00:04:11.190> we<00:04:11.340> raise<00:04:11.669> this<00:04:11.970> up<00:04:12.239> for<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.569> more

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:12.949 
look like if we raise this up for a more

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.890 
look like if we raise this up for a more
to<00:04:13.949> me<00:04:14.069> it<00:04:14.190> dignified<00:04:14.699> a<00:04:14.730> stronger<00:04:15.449> profile

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
to me it dignified a stronger profile

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.900 
to me it dignified a stronger profile
than<00:04:16.289> the<00:04:16.320> little<00:04:16.709> nose<00:04:16.919> she<00:04:17.130> had<00:04:17.340> which<00:04:17.789> I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
than the little nose she had which I

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.339 
than the little nose she had which I
thought<00:04:18.090> was<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.299> little<00:04:18.479> too<00:04:18.570> scooped<00:04:18.900> out<00:04:19.079> and

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
thought was a little too scooped out and

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.650 
thought was a little too scooped out and
she<00:04:19.889> actually<00:04:19.979> agreed<00:04:20.160> that<00:04:20.519> she<00:04:21.299> wanted<00:04:21.599> me

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
she actually agreed that she wanted me

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.879 
she actually agreed that she wanted me
to<00:04:21.690> do<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.079> if<00:04:22.199> she<00:04:22.320> didn't<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.710> would<00:04:22.860> have

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
to do that if she didn't I would have

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.860 
to do that if she didn't I would have
left<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.340> lower<00:04:23.580> but<00:04:23.849> people<00:04:24.479> often<00:04:24.599> don't

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
left it lower but people often don't

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.110 
left it lower but people often don't
like<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.199> idea<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.530> making<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.550> nose<00:04:26.760> bigger

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
like the idea of making a nose bigger

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.180 
like the idea of making a nose bigger
when<00:04:27.419> actuality<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.080> really<00:04:28.349> to<00:04:28.770> me<00:04:28.860> makes<00:04:29.070> it

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
when actuality it really to me makes it

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.939 
when actuality it really to me makes it
much<00:04:29.340> prettier<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:31.110> procedure<00:04:31.620> was

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
much prettier the procedure was

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.110 
much prettier the procedure was
complicated<00:04:32.699> and<00:04:33.030> difficult<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:34.910> think<00:04:35.910> my

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
complicated and difficult I think my

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.330 
complicated and difficult I think my
nose<00:04:36.180> right<00:04:36.690> now<00:04:36.840> looks<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.440> best<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:38.130> it's

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
nose right now looks the best that it's

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.909 
nose right now looks the best that it's
ever<00:04:38.610> going<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:38.940> look<00:04:39.180> I'm<00:04:40.139> very<00:04:40.470> very<00:04:40.680> happy

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
ever going to look I'm very very happy

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.000 
ever going to look I'm very very happy
and<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:42.240> think<00:04:42.570> this<00:04:42.750> this<00:04:43.110> is<00:04:43.289> the<00:04:43.440> nose<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:43.979> I

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
and I think this this is the nose that I

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.770 
and I think this this is the nose that I
would<00:04:44.250> have<00:04:44.370> wanted<00:04:44.580> after<00:04:44.910> my<00:04:45.210> first<00:04:45.449> surgery

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
would have wanted after my first surgery

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.530 
would have wanted after my first surgery
you

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.600 

you
