 [Music] 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.380
 how about friends welcome to another video 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.160
 more my name is ml or milk and I am mk iii 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.599
 of tiger's and good kids the best 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.570
 you also face and I'm seeing 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.490
 a shrimp a small lobster and good 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.309
 It's real about my water tank 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.320
 salted already go 15 days since the last 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.559
 Once I put the first vial and 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.110
 will remember in the first video where this one 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.390
 I taught them how to make it prepare with the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.149
 ampolleta and everything but good a 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.680
 little unexpected I bought two 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.080
 ampoules because we could leave 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.230
 in bacteria which generate 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.750
 artificially 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.520
 for the bacteria that they must carry in 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.200
 the fish tank without needing to do it 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.750
 natural way in the sea there is a lot of weight 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.699
 dead a lot of dead thing and that has what 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.800
 which is the good bacteria as it turns out 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.320
 that after putting the first 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.900
 bacterium the first is the first poet 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.870
 of bacteria 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 mysteriously like who knows why 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.810
 the other bacterium to another ampules no longer 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.610
 I found him disappeared and it turns out 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.800
 they threw it in the trash thinking that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.410
 I do not know what it was and well they did not know what 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.290
 it was that good shot nor way not then 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.770
 so as not to interrupt the process I had to 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.890
 buy this little lobster this 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.360
 small lobster we're going to have to 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.730
 throw to the fish tank where inevitably 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.190
 Well, he's going to have to die for us 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.780
 artificially generate the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.520
 bacteria 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.510
 what was the bulb doing 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.460
 then this because 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.760
 we have to give it a name before 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.060
 throw them out and well as we know that gift 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.850
 dies in the software this lobster is 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.340
 He will Call 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.060
 here they greet the lobster 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.900
 that we are going to throw to the fish tank for this and 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.450
 this is lobster is going to die in 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.420
 and will generate the bacteria to be able 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.850
 have the fish tank room a bit cruel 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.140
 but well, well, this is not the way 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.780
 I've already tired of looking for 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.280
 ampolleta I did not find it and I did not want 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.520
 interrupt the process because I 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.050
 It would take another 8 days and there would be no 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.790
 served everything I did 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.280
 so this I had to go and throw a 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.739
 little fish but this fish have this 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.500
 lobster has more bacteria than the 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.440
 same weight then let's get zealous and 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.660
 well we're going to this one I'm going to interrupt 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.239
 so much the video to get so much water 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.080
 and now we put what follows 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.810
 goodbye 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.330
 bye by the time we removed the water and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.730
 well, it's not going to help me to throw it out and 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.890
 say goodbye to don the truth is nothing 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.170
 nice this you do not like it is totalero 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.269
 it's like the video because the truth is not 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.410
 nothing nice but good talk without 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.360
 fear 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.760
 then we are going to throw it into the fish tank 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.240
 they already have very little water and are going to go 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.240
 to the fish tank 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.800
 [Music] 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.690
 since marine help then obviously 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.810
 the reaction that will have then it will be 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.460
 very bad and that because I'm not going to go there 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.130
 we're going to let this one happen what 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.560
 that has to happen there is does not know what 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.110
 sorry for him and if all this and good 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.820
 kids in case you guys when 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.010
 They want to build your fish tank something happens to them 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.470
 very similar because that is what they are going to have 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.780
 to do pause are going to have to put 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.080
 is 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.870
 is supplying the bacteria then there 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.700
 let's rest in peace 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.860
 and having us will help us have our 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.120
 salted fish bowl beautiful and keep walking not 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.750
 he knows that poor sun 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.950
 then this and capable of not dying 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.200
 and it becomes a super fucking 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.700
 such a man and they passed me the homer 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.159
 simpson that later I'll call her at 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.250
 lobster but good there is the lobster 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.680
 see the truth I for more than I have 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.169
 looked for bacteria to look at you are 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.500
 forming little things and there are the 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.090
 white balls there goes and goes the fish tank 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.110
 but well, this is going to help more 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.030
 still to generate bacteria and well 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.570
 nor did I really want to do it 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.479
 I did not want to, but that has to be if 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.889
 I want to have my abbas fish tank to that of 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.820
 Click and hold sand Sunday 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.850
 resistant to ice ivÃ¡n 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.770
 obviously fight against the current 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.810
 [Music] 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.310
 but good 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.310
 I did not know in what pex 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.180
 good good, we'll leave you this 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.909
 it was another video blog already going 15 days 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.820
 since the last time you start the fish tank 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:04.920
 located as we are 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:07.140
 21 April 21 and well there we will leave 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.940
 that weight of that the anguish to die and 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.280
 because there it is going to be ugly and you will be able to 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.230
 and things are going to happen and then we go 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.660
 to put the living stone but that's going to 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.520
 be in another video and that surely 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.930
 I will also pass them to you because then if 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.170
 they want to make their saltwater fish tank 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.030
 this is the best way to do it and 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.670
 well I leave my name is mail yamil and 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.530
 I am mk iii of traitor and this marcus 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.020
 seeing how his friend is going to die where in 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.230
 the fish tank had been and good glued 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.820
 of the next video goodbye chaos goes and if 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.190
 you did not like to see dom here die 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.360
 please give dislike to the video and give me 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.500
 your comment 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.860
 I know it's cruel but in a lemon goodbye 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.710
 drooling do not go to the light and do not walk 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.010
 towards the light and walk towards the light 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.310
 bye
