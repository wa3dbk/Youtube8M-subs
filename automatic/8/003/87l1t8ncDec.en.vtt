Luigi<00:01:07.580> but<00:01:08.450> this<00:01:08.630> one<00:01:08.869> is<00:01:09.050> done<00:01:09.500> very<00:01:09.950> very

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
Luigi but this one is done very very

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.420 
Luigi but this one is done very very
well

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.830 

typically<00:01:15.210> speaking<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.720> are<00:01:15.750> two

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
typically speaking there are two

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
typically speaking there are two
different<00:01:16.290> kinds<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.620> nindroid<00:01:17.070> bodies<00:01:17.430> one

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
different kinds of nindroid bodies one

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.520 
different kinds of nindroid bodies one
which<00:01:18.150> focuses<00:01:18.630> more<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.230> different

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
which focuses more so on different

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.990 
which focuses more so on different
display<00:01:19.830> values<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.490> other<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:20.970> has

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
display values the other which has

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.260 
display values the other which has
articulation<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.070> luigi<00:01:23.070> has<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.640> former<00:01:24.090> of

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
articulation and luigi has the former of

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.860 
articulation and luigi has the former of
the<00:01:24.450> two<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.290> he<00:01:25.800> is<00:01:26.010> a<00:01:26.070> bit<00:01:26.550> articulated<00:01:27.420> but

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
the two so he is a bit articulated but

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.440 
the two so he is a bit articulated but
there<00:01:28.260> really<00:01:28.410> isn't<00:01:28.680> too<00:01:29.010> much<00:01:29.190> there<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
there really isn't too much there so to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.120 
there really isn't too much there so to
start<00:01:30.660> with<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> articulation<00:01:31.110> Luigi's<00:01:31.920> neck

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
start with the articulation Luigi's neck

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.920 
start with the articulation Luigi's neck
is<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> typical<00:01:32.730> men<00:01:32.880> droid<00:01:33.180> style<00:01:33.450> joint<00:01:33.750> which

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
is a typical men droid style joint which

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.480 
is a typical men droid style joint which
is<00:01:34.050> basically<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.710> double<00:01:34.920> swivel<00:01:35.310> which

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
is basically a double swivel which

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.800 
is basically a double swivel which
allows<00:01:35.730> you<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.940> move<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> head<00:01:36.330> forward<00:01:36.690> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
allows you to move the head forward and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
allows you to move the head forward and
back<00:01:37.470> along<00:01:37.950> with<00:01:37.980> swiveling<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> around<00:01:38.640> some

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
back along with swiveling it around some

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
back along with swiveling it around some
I<00:01:39.300> can<00:01:39.420> refer<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.660> this<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> ball<00:01:40.230> hinge<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
I can refer to this as a ball hinge the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.090 
I can refer to this as a ball hinge the
shoulders<00:01:41.670> are<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.360> swivel<00:01:42.570> joints<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:44.040> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
shoulders are on a swivel joints so you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.120 
shoulders are on a swivel joints so you
can<00:01:44.370> move<00:01:44.460> them<00:01:44.670> forward<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.270> back<00:01:45.979> same<00:01:46.979> with

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
can move them forward and back same with

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.219 
can move them forward and back same with
the<00:01:47.250> wrists<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.690> spin<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.960> hands

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the wrists so you can spin the hands
