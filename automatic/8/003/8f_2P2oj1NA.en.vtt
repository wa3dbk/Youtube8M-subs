00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.440
 what's up with gamers I'm here with everyone 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.320
 you again in a battle of two 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.260
 against two in the total napoleon war 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.789
 and against some kids that I met yesterday 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.710
 in the bar good not the truth is that no 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.349
 It's clear that a fucking shit but I'm going to 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.200
 play with them equally so 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.880
 we are in a place that I do not know what is not 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.220
 I have not seen the name of the map 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.780
 I have only gotten my army 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.760
 with the rules of nothing of artillery and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.640
 only four infantry units 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.150
 light that I'm going to put on the front for 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.010
 that shoot better to see that is I think that 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.500
 they have also put maximum numbers is 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.770
 say of units to do the battle 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.469
 wind cha we have 160 in the units 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.410
 bigger and good he also asked me two 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:00.430
 cavalry units of by itself 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.690
 the emergency flies to take care of 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.790
 flanks etc. 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.950
 and also two balona guard units 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.590
 which is the cucumber guard that the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.070
 Spaniards in this era 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.829
 so nothing to wait I'm already 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.649
 ready so the battle starts at 60 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.840
 seconds I like to make huge blocks 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.569
 they like to make several lines and 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.060
 all the cock but I'm pretty 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.450
 rather more basic these have been caught 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.090
 here to the Prussian riflemen I would 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.750
 they are putting in larger groups 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.000
 to get more performance so that 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.069
 shoot everything thing that maybe 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.399
 I should do it also now that I've 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.759
 seen should be a good idea so 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.739
 I'm going to take it and I'm going to put 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:56.569
 light infantry behavior that 

00:01:51.739 --> 00:02:00.289
 is and now may I suppose let's see 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:03.050
 get well in all the army well 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.670
 perfect spacing 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.619
 this is over here 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:13.319
 so that they take one more step behind 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:17.160
 just behind the light infantry or 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.330
 be a perfect line and super clean 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.190
 which, as I understand it, is 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.770
 training allows the infantry of 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.790
 line shoot from behind that the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.299
 light infantry 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.069
 so let's see and then I'll do 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.909
 what I 'm going to do is set these 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.290
 lines 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.170
 I'm going to take a little higher 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.750
 laguardia balona 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.580
 I will put next to the general and the 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.680
 good cavalry for now 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.990
 the other has extended much more his 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.600
 army so I guess from now 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.080
 I am already on the defensive however my 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.480
 front is much harder than yours so 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.920
 what I have to do is try 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.930
 break it from the center with these 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.170
 solid and complete formations 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.489
 and hope that I'm worth breaking it 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.739
 morale and send him to take it in the ass 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.349
 so let's see if I can good if I do not 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.670
 I take from here again this you too 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.620
 treatment also you too 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.730
 and now that they're together I'm going to 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.730
 send to the front 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.670
 come and you are already moving good 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.620
 I do not know if I just shitting now if 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.879
 move in the groups of before I hope that 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.879
 do not go rolling 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.790
 to see what the hell they are doing now 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.320
 no no no I did not say no no I have 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.320
 Faced with children of the great whore 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.230
 fuck what a holy mess they have already screwed up 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.190
 they have fucked up the formations is that 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.019
 you are a bunch of bastards 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.110
 fuck with the artificial intelligence that 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.170
 fucking cracks 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.910
 of mother of God anda anda anda anda 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.750
 Put on a fucking time and stop 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.750
 make scripts 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.350
 and if you run better 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.229
 you are already taking or good 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.240
 I'm going to move forward with all the troops now 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.710
 let no one leave me behind 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.150
 I do not like having flanks 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.979
 unprotected but the truth is that 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.900
 I always play like that because they are armies 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.030
 very big and I do not like having to 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.910
 be in looking through all the 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.729
 screen to handle them well then 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.380
 what I do is let's say to mark the 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.720
 to have them controlled at all 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.090
 visually on just one screen 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.630
 the others are already advancing we are 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.980
 brush and how I think we are Austrians and 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:58.090
 Spanish against Spanish and Prussia us 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.460
 to see Germans are exactly Prussians 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.260
 Well, I'm going to make it move here 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.870
 a little more to the left the 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.320
 guard ball to the general more towards the 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.320
 center 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.490
 and this cavalry that gives me that is not going to 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.860
 do not even egg because on the right 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.470
 heroic victory balls touches you not 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.750
 I fought and I won well this has been 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.850
 amazing for you to see what happens 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.790
 in some battles total war in the 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:32.830
 multiplayer so nothing more here 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.830
 I even shit on another bitch 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.979
 yes
