no<00:00:51.949> why<00:00:52.070> is<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.309> first<00:00:53.239> of<00:00:53.420> all<00:00:53.480> sugar<00:00:53.899> and

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
no why is that first of all sugar and

flour<00:00:54.469> two<00:00:54.980> things<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.280> are<00:00:55.399> very<00:00:55.460> process

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
flour two things that are very process

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.639 
flour two things that are very process
they've<00:00:56.449> been<00:00:56.600> bleached<00:00:56.899> in<00:00:57.199> order<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:57.530> be

they've been bleached in order to be
white<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.100> they<00:00:58.609> also<00:00:58.820> produce<00:00:59.269> a<00:00:59.570> lot<00:00:59.870> of

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
white and they also produce a lot of

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.619 
white and they also produce a lot of
insulin<00:01:00.530> in<00:01:00.649> your<00:01:00.769> body<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.460> process<00:01:01.640> them<00:01:02.239> it

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
insulin in your body to process them it

insulin in your body to process them it
raises<00:01:03.019> your<00:01:03.469> blood<00:01:03.620> sugar<00:01:04.010> level<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.519> when

raises your blood sugar level and when

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.570 
raises your blood sugar level and when
your<00:01:05.089> body<00:01:05.330> has<00:01:05.840> a<00:01:05.870> raise<00:01:06.470> blood<00:01:07.010> sugar<00:01:07.070> when

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
it produces too much insulin the body

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.010 
it produces too much insulin the body
automatically<00:01:10.220> stores<00:01:10.610> that<00:01:10.790> is<00:01:10.939> fat<00:01:11.180> a<00:01:11.450> lot

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
automatically stores that is fat a lot

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.960 
automatically stores that is fat a lot
of<00:01:12.200> products<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:12.740> have<00:01:12.950> sugar<00:01:13.310> in<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:13.520> things

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
of products that have sugar in it things

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.410 
of products that have sugar in it things
like<00:01:14.149> soda<00:01:14.540> or<00:01:15.759> bakery<00:01:16.759> products<00:01:17.149> that<00:01:17.329> are

like soda or bakery products that are

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.480 
like soda or bakery products that are
really<00:01:17.720> high<00:01:17.930> in<00:01:17.960> starch<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:18.680> sugar<00:01:18.950> what

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
really high in starch and sugar what

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.550 
really high in starch and sugar what
happens<00:01:19.850> is<00:01:20.030> your<00:01:20.240> body<00:01:20.390> doesn't<00:01:20.689> have<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
happens is your body doesn't have the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.580 
happens is your body doesn't have the
capacity<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:22.280> burn<00:01:23.210> all<00:01:23.509> of<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.750> sugar<00:01:23.899> off<00:01:24.140> so

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
capacity to burn all of the sugar off so

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.230 
capacity to burn all of the sugar off so
it<00:01:24.680> has<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:24.890> hold<00:01:25.310> on<00:01:25.549> to<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:25.700> somewhere<00:01:26.060> it<00:01:26.119> has

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
it has to hold on to it somewhere it has

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.510 
it has to hold on to it somewhere it has
to<00:01:26.420> put<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:26.899> somewhere<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.649> it<00:01:27.740> stores<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.159> fat

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
to put it somewhere so it stores is fat

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.910 
to put it somewhere so it stores is fat
