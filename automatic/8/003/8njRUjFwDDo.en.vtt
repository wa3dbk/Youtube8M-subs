00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.509
 Now sit around the middle of the e3 violence 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.250
 12 our thoughts occasionally 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.970
 off to a nice moments from it 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.070
 past 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.750
 we had quite a bit in the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.099
 definitely enough year over the years 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.330
 experienced scholarships 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.240
 the e3 is always a whole 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.689
 special but what it saved for me 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.220
 This has two sides, one side what ghana 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.140
 one for the one of the most special 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.960
 moments have always been for me 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.970
 is just the first time at all 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.399
 I set foot on the e3 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.410
 because I myself before I started with 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.079
 write and and of course in 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.540
 video form talking about games 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.309
 I have always read the magazines and the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 fair we made it a highlight and 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.879
 it used to be asia's 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.590
 that you have the winter and summer edition and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.570
 then suddenly the e3 arrived 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.969
 and then yes you want to get into it yourself 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.489
 that work and the first moment you 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.070
 go there and that you have foot set there 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.539
 jazz that I wrap reading in those leaves 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.800
 and that me that purse has come here 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.989
 was always one of one of the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.219
 Highlights of the year and then Ben 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.110
 the first time you really have it 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.270
 something that you like that is what you always do 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.520
 wanted that is what you romanticized 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.310
 and then you have some sort of group of yours 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.080
 skin with that i'm there so this heard there 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.430
 almost and then did not agree 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.009
 man probably that was because of myself 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.810
 one of the very first dutch de 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.369
 game journalists was the gona die 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.530
 I was still flying at the time 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.750
 then head director Marc Freed 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.369
 to the right of the power unlimited that was 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.439
 for me to be with two according to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.600
 me gone and then it was then had it 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.009
 even though that grandeur but not 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.159
 so that there is a whole dutch enclave 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.259
 a no and you do a 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.640
 agree on one thing nowadays you 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.280
 have so many different kinds with you 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.259
 Media now so many websites go so many 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.179
 People also go there from Netherlands 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.090
 but at the time it was indeed still 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.679
 a bit magical that you went there 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.380
 going to the e3 is still special 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.810
 but certainly at the time you went the he 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.569
 that made a very big impression though 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.689
 how apart from the stock market itself i want i have 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:03.649
 experienced so many things on game 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.439
 area all previous generation consoles 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.179
 to be announced and just as well 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.879
 still go there and find a new one 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.950
 see games for the playstation 2 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.349
 For example you know now we are at 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.360
 number 4 on your blown cut yes yes 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.720
 definitely it being fun of course 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.430
 things but of course 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.799
 thereby not my son 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.049
 press conferences are so many years 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.959
 ago and uncharted first went 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.069
 as an important title for the 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.200
 playstation 3 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.269
 she was fed up with the nori doki anyway 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.359
 love colorful platforms and now you see 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.560
 then yes the uncharted 4 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:43.290
 to send and 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.849
 then you just realize that you were there too 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.430
 from the beginning 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.200
 but apart from those games I think 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.530
 just what it is for me 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.630
 it always makes is just with one 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.700
 group of friends to a body 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.660
 because the stock market is great but it is 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.269
 it is only 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.709
 is a special is that it is ten times 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.910
 so nice in only if you are there with one 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.349
 purpose are 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.599
 us it is easy to then little round 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.300
 wander but you are there as allez 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.760
 ordinary Dutch farmer's dick and you go 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.860
 to know your fancy parties in in chic 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.900
 avenue because let's face it is l1 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.660
 none is the dough stand up to a new york 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.370
 and Seattle's and frame no buzzing 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.600
 city anyway it won't be a normal city ​​it 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.209
 is not a normal state they are all 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.160
 areas linked to each other 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.769
 by many highways 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.060
 yes it did not know any real city in it 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.040
 Or there is something to do if you just have it 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.950
 have a plan and of course you are there 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.720
 every time with about six people and we 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.580
 Have it all cozy and genuinely 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.660
 your I say all those parties the de 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.000
 setting 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.410
 the environment it is always such 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.870
 experiences for sure 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.269
 as you get older it is too 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.250
 every time a kind of it is one 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.109
 old-fashioned school trip with a fun 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.000
 small group and I think that's it anyway 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.989
 Not with what most remember just 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.170
 the 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.180
 the the bullshit the laughing beer 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.410
 drink and have fun parties so they him 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.700
 motel boys in July and and that and that 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.489
 also all combined once again 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.440
 with a lot of cool stuff to see with 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.269
 in in in in the theme of one of the 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.799
 he likes the things you like best 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.579
 you do your favorite hobbies 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.340
 activities 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.900
 games call it how you want yes that is 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.419
 a very special one every time 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.729
 week and a half week of course and that 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.229
 I think it's not the hand every e3 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.450
 you are blown away by thing is right 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.000
 I don't have the one moment of a game 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.919
 or and this or a cat you really know me 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.990
 what an unforgettable moment it is 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.510
 the the the trip you know it 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.620
 total package what yes every e3 side needs 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.660
 remember that well then you know 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.000
 we sat there and then we sat there 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.229
 everything is just complete sets 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.270
 memories or something 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.430
 yes and it is not only the e3 that then 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.740
 cornflower provides those memories 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.289
 with me again all kinds of calling 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.900
 ringing korea japan 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.260
 no but just the goal anyway 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.880
 but also just the days after the every 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.979
 the the periods have been that we 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.349
 just stayed there for a few more days or 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.270
 That decided whether to go to Las Vegas 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.479
 go or something up and down afterwards you already had 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.229

 one room per stay at there we 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.060
 always neatly under the pans 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.070
 and we have to 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.800
 Really like that to an impressive we 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.030

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.190
 moments that are also in the episode of

 let's stand still let's just let that 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.830
 not doing this was just an ordinary van 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.449
 the small selection 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.639
 but it is primarily the overall feeling 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.379
 what they before and after which you free 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.939
