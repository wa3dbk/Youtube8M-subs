00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.350 
was where I did that 660 pounds squat
with<00:01:50.700> no<00:01:50.909> sleeves<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.110> rafts<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.180> was<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
with no sleeves the rafts and I was the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.719 
with no sleeves the rafts and I was the
craziest<00:01:54.750> grandeur<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.200> my<00:01:55.350> life<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
craziest grandeur of my life so that

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.450 
craziest grandeur of my life so that
mean<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.119> was<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> hell<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.750> trip<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.460> then

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
mean that was a hell of a trip and then

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.050 
mean that was a hell of a trip and then
I<00:01:59.490> think<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.030> next<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.450> was<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.909> few<00:02:02.909> months

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I think the next one was a few months

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.340 
I think the next one was a few months
later<00:02:03.420> April<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:05.540> well<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.570> think<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.110> think

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
later April of well I think that I think

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.889 
later April of well I think that I think
the<00:02:07.409> supertrain<00:02:07.770> me<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.280> November<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.030> 2012

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the supertrain me was November of 2012

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.820 
the supertrain me was November of 2012
and<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.679> next<00:02:10.950> meet<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.160> did

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
and the next meet I did

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.960 
and the next meet I did
well<00:02:12.640> as<00:02:12.760> April<00:02:13.240> of<00:02:13.330> 2013<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.680> got<00:02:15.220> invited<00:02:15.640> up

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970

to do a meet in Amherst Nova Scotia and
this<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.680> mean<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> real<00:02:21.460> small<00:02:21.730> town

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
this is I mean this is a real small town

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.230 
this is I mean this is a real small town
like<00:02:22.960> I<00:02:23.230> don't<00:02:24.040> even<00:02:24.130> think<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.460> is<00:02:24.550> 5,000

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
like I don't even think it is 5,000

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.240 
like I don't even think it is 5,000
people<00:02:25.390> but<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:26.560> where<00:02:26.740> basically<00:02:26.950> all

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
people but this is where basically all

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.190 
people but this is where basically all
the<00:02:27.520> powerlifting<00:02:28.030> meets<00:02:28.270> are<00:02:28.570> in<00:02:28.900> Nova

Scotia and the entire province this is

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.140 
Scotia and the entire province this is
worrying<00:02:32.530> you'll<00:02:32.740> find<00:02:33.040> them<00:02:33.250> like<00:02:33.700> Amherst

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
worrying you'll find them like Amherst

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.690 
worrying you'll find them like Amherst

would get off off the plane outside of
the<00:03:13.660> plane<00:03:13.930> like<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:14.950> didn't<00:03:15.190> go<00:03:15.310> through<00:03:15.340> a

around<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.709> little<00:03:50.830> bit<00:03:51.070> see<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.940> lot<00:03:52.120> of

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
around a little bit see a lot of

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.990 
around a little bit see a lot of
Fredericton<00:03:52.920> which<00:03:53.920> sits<00:03:54.220> in<00:03:54.430> like<00:03:54.550> a<00:03:54.580> valley

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
Fredericton which sits in like a valley

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.240 
Fredericton which sits in like a valley
like<00:03:55.420> there's<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.260> river<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.680> splits<00:03:56.950> the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
like there's a river that splits the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.780 
like there's a river that splits the
town<00:03:57.550> and<00:03:58.770> there's<00:03:59.770> just<00:03:59.950> nothing<00:04:00.340> like<00:04:00.489> it

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
town and there's just nothing like it

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.360 
town and there's just nothing like it
like<00:04:01.000> along<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.630> highway<00:04:02.140> there<00:04:02.830> were<00:04:02.920> fences

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
like along the highway there were fences

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.470 
like along the highway there were fences
that<00:04:03.489> were<00:04:03.580> gone<00:04:03.790> forever

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
that were gone forever

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.479 
that were gone forever
because<00:04:05.260> they<00:04:05.470> didn't<00:04:05.620> want<00:04:05.650> moose<00:04:06.070> coming

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
because they didn't want moose coming

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.759 
because they didn't want moose coming
onto<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.850> road<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.270> killing<00:04:07.780> people<00:04:08.140> like

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
onto the road and killing people like

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.020 
onto the road and killing people like
people<00:04:09.160> hitting<00:04:09.340> them<00:04:09.550> with<00:04:09.580> their<00:04:09.820> cars

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
people hitting them with their cars

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.520 
people hitting them with their cars
because<00:04:10.239> your<00:04:10.510> dad<00:04:10.750> something<00:04:11.050> could<00:04:11.290> be<00:04:11.380> here

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
because your dad something could be here

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.710 
because your dad something could be here
we're<00:04:12.250> gonna<00:04:12.400> like<00:04:12.610> damage<00:04:13.180> your<00:04:13.330> car<00:04:13.510> if<00:04:13.660> you

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
we're gonna like damage your car if you

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.840 
we're gonna like damage your car if you
had<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:13.959> moose<00:04:14.170> you're<00:04:14.500> dead<00:04:14.680> so<00:04:15.610> there<00:04:15.760> were

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
had a moose you're dead so there were

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.610 
had a moose you're dead so there were
just<00:04:15.910> fences<00:04:16.570> lining<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.019> entire<00:04:17.049> highway

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
just fences lining the entire highway

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.279 
just fences lining the entire highway
and<00:04:18.010> so<00:04:18.940> that<00:04:19.180> was<00:04:19.390> probably<00:04:19.600> one<00:04:20.020> of<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.140> most

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
and so that was probably one of the most

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.320

life away it's it's about enjoying life

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.270 
life away it's it's about enjoying life
it's<00:05:23.370> not<00:05:23.550> all<00:05:23.730> about<00:05:23.880> just<00:05:24.300> lifting<00:05:24.780> like<00:05:25.650> it

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
it's not all about just lifting like it

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.390 
it's not all about just lifting like it
should<00:05:26.790> be<00:05:27.210> equally<00:05:27.600> important<00:05:28.260> about<00:05:29.220> the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
should be equally important about the

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.010 
should be equally important about the
other<00:05:29.550> experiences<00:05:29.970> to<00:05:30.450> go<00:05:30.570> along<00:05:30.780> with<00:05:30.810> the

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
other experiences to go along with the

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.270 
other experiences to go along with the
lifting<00:05:31.320> that's<00:05:31.500> why<00:05:31.650> I<00:05:31.680> think<00:05:31.770> it's<00:05:32.040> fun<00:05:32.250> to

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
lifting that's why I think it's fun to

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.060 
lifting that's why I think it's fun to
travel<00:05:32.820> for<00:05:32.970> meats<00:05:33.210> I<00:05:33.500> think<00:05:34.500> it's<00:05:34.590> awesome<00:05:34.740> I
