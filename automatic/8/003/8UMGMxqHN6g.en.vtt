00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.919
 followed an accessible phase we want that 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:06.350
 what makes companies return to the 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:11.019
 victory for now the mechanics for 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.019
 you not too much definition also criminal 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.180
 companions 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:32.430
 the five parties 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.890
 but I hope to get there 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:01:03.220
 for us he will be a tough opponent and 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.960
 we will analyze at some point as I said 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.960
 I was always very interested in the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.170
 school and have it always 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.819
 and it gave me the idea to try to learn not 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.859
 I started looking in words to try 

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:26.719
 put something together is more the girl in my house 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:29.899
 some practical things then never 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:32.659
 I could never get out there because of the 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:36.409
 moment but it is very complicated 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.979
 the opponent at the end that they are going to play the 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.560
 next Thursday from peru Bolivia maybe the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.600
 great surprise to have happened to this 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.850
 instance we have to forget 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.429
 quickly from 50 the last game 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.219
 but really the two encounters 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.140
 bolivia officials of our football by 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.869
 moments of good soccer passages we go to 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.340
 listen to pablo escobar escobar canon and 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.340
 to marcela morelo more 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.760
 we have the step by step to be 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.960
 here 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.000
 in this phase the competition is already 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.220
 obviously seen as a surprise 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.110
 but we want to give even more 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.970
 steps forward and obviously from 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.069
 get a pass of the game would be very 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.069
 important we have to 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.959
 the chances are equal for the two that 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.719
 is going to be a very contested match the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.719
 surely round trip 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.770
 we have great possibilities 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.040
 as well 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.470
 to depend on what I do that says the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.530
 vacant one day you can 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.140
 I think that the one that is finest can give 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.070
 an important step in this tournament 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.030
 we want to be us of course 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:56.960
 selection that has surprised by 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.890
 for passing the next phase by 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.970
 on a level 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.000
 more advanced and it's normal that they talk about 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.700
 the Bolivian team because they are due to 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.580
 an incredible improvement does not make it easy 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.270
 we know that to fix what 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.140
 we have to educate him the court so that 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:23.190
 that can be achieved and we know that 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.950
 we have a good job and practice 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.709
 inside the court and 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.319
 and be able to spend in a dream that everyone 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.590
 we have and hopefully it 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.590
 I can give 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.790
 the
