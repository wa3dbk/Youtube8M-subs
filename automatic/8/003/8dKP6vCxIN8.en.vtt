00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
like a couple of teams like the main

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.070 
like a couple of teams like the main
as<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:07.960> guess<00:04:08.280> had<00:04:09.280> like<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.460> half<00:04:09.760> collar<00:04:10.120> like

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
as I guess had like a half collar like

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.770 
as I guess had like a half collar like
color<00:04:11.470> or<00:04:12.100> whatever<00:04:12.430> like<00:04:12.670> it<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:13.300> went<00:04:13.540> orange

to<00:04:14.140> about<00:04:14.590> right<00:04:14.620> here<00:04:14.800> so<00:04:15.340> then<00:04:15.520> it<00:04:15.610> was<00:04:15.670> black

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
to about right here so then it was black

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.880 
to about right here so then it was black
or<00:04:16.390> whatever<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:18.600> you<00:04:19.600> know<00:04:19.720> oh<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:20.829> think
