00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.429
 hello everyone i want to tell my 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.139
 sound generator 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:15.269
 did so much casing from the old 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:19.380
 the remote control made it possible to ring 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.060
 for example , we take wires 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.420
 produce that is one by construction sites 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:31.199
 Here is the post that I wanted to put this 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:37.700
 Now I do not know the transmitter of the element 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:45.960
 her blood regulator 100 so 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:47.670
 look like this 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.770
 shows inside i won't because u 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:58.280
 so everything is clear here is such a scheme here 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:01:01.829
 This vt1 used transistor mp 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.680
 37 vt2 is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.100
 mp3 c9 do not confuse here the capacitor 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:18.140
 used used now with us 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.140
 Cook now 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.149
 I do not remember exactly how much I use 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.520
 well on for 10 microfarad yes for 10 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.689
 microfarad 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.689
 here is c1 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.539
 the gate 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:57.320
 everything is clear 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:01.369
 someone on the brains drip one curl 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.220
 I'll show you how it works 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:09.060
 made it so that you just manually sound you 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:22.890
 producer yourself in here you can sound 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:27.480
 this change savage rendered to that 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:31.049
 don't even know how much more disgusting 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.160
 a sound you want to feed there 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:39.030
 you can do this thing already 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.930
 Five minutes here's what you can comfortably 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.930
 ring the wires 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.600
 Well that's all I wanted to say is, 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.520
 some questions seem to me here 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:58.860
 questions should not arise here all 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.860
 thank you all bye
