00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
repetitions I pretty much stuck to the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.920 
repetitions I pretty much stuck to the
basics<00:01:26.189> since<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.090> beginning<00:01:27.270> okay

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
basics since the very beginning okay

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
basics since the very beginning okay
everything's<00:01:28.350> based<00:01:28.590> off<00:01:28.829> core<00:01:29.159> movements

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
everything's based off core movements

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
yeah pretty much build as much size as

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.640 
yeah pretty much build as much size as
possible<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.329> don't<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.659> don't<00:01:36.869> focus<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
possible I don't I don't focus on the

week<00:01:50.100> okay<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.180> that's<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.659> most

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
week okay that's that's what most

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.200 
week okay that's that's what most
bodybuilders<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.070> may<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:53.970> train

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
bodybuilders do I may not train

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.389 
bodybuilders do I may not train
specifically<00:01:54.750> every<00:01:55.020> day<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.500> row<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
specifically every day in a row but I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.899 
specifically every day in a row but I
will<00:01:56.670> train

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
will train

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.450 
will train
at<00:01:58.210> least<00:01:58.450> my<00:01:59.290> body<00:01:59.500> part<00:01:59.770> once<00:01:59.950> every<00:02:00.220> five<00:02:00.430> to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
at least my body part once every five to

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.929 
at least my body part once every five to
seven<00:02:00.820> days<00:02:01.000> so<00:02:01.659> how<00:02:01.869> I<00:02:01.900> group<00:02:02.229> them<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.850> know

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
seven days so how I group them you know

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.030 
seven days so how I group them you know
I'll<00:02:04.060> talk<00:02:04.270> about<00:02:04.299> that<00:02:04.810> but<00:02:05.140> at<00:02:05.500> least<00:02:05.740> one

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
I'll talk about that but at least one

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.059 
I'll talk about that but at least one
large<00:02:06.280> body<00:02:06.670> part<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.030> day<00:02:07.180> okay<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.950> know

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
large body part a day okay so you know

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.030 
large body part a day okay so you know
the<00:02:09.280> chest<00:02:09.550> one<00:02:09.789> day<00:02:10.000> back<00:02:10.360> one<00:02:10.630> day<00:02:11.040> shoulders

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
the chest one day back one day shoulders

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.850 
the chest one day back one day shoulders
a<00:02:12.069> day<00:02:12.310> legs<00:02:13.209> another<00:02:13.540> day<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.500> think<00:02:14.620> it's

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
a day legs another day so I think it's

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.350 
a day legs another day so I think it's
pretty<00:02:14.980> much<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> standard<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.090> mean<00:02:16.270> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
pretty much to the standard I mean you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.570 
pretty much to the standard I mean you
read<00:02:16.540> different<00:02:16.930> different<00:02:17.470> topics<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:18.010> you

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
read different different topics on you

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.740 
read different different topics on you
know<00:02:18.670> what<00:02:18.850> people<00:02:19.000> believe<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.540> best

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
know what people believe the best

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.540 
know what people believe the best
training<00:02:20.020> regimen<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.590> how<00:02:20.920> many<00:02:21.069> days<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.489> a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
training regimen is how many days in a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.280 
training regimen is how many days in a
row<00:02:21.700> certain<00:02:22.330> days<00:02:22.480> off<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.900> find<00:02:23.170> that

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
row certain days off I find that

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.720 
row certain days off I find that
sometimes<00:02:23.500> more<00:02:23.860> arrest<00:02:24.160> works<00:02:24.400> better<00:02:24.610> for

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
sometimes more arrest works better for

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.280 
sometimes more arrest works better for
me<00:02:24.880> especially<00:02:25.000> training<00:02:25.569> for<00:02:25.690> competition

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
me especially training for competition

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.960 
me especially training for competition
when<00:02:26.410> I'm<00:02:26.500> adding<00:02:26.650> cardiovascular<00:02:27.610> into<00:02:27.880> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
when I'm adding cardiovascular into the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.150 
when I'm adding cardiovascular into the
weight<00:02:28.120> training<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.620> think<00:02:29.890> we<00:02:30.010> pretty

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
weight training but I think we pretty

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.759 
weight training but I think we pretty
much<00:02:30.310> can<00:02:30.610> agree<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:30.959> it's<00:02:31.959> more<00:02:32.290> volume

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
much can agree that it's more volume

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.170 
much can agree that it's more volume
training<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:33.489> more<00:02:33.670> getting<00:02:33.910> time

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
training and it's more getting time

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.449 
training and it's more getting time
resting<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.930> muscle<00:02:35.500> group<00:02:35.650> every<00:02:35.920> 72<00:02:36.280> hours

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
resting a muscle group every 72 hours

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.220 
resting a muscle group every 72 hours
and<00:02:37.420> that's<00:02:37.600> where<00:02:37.780> you're<00:02:37.900> gonna<00:02:37.959> have<00:02:38.110> the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
probably the best clean energy you're

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.870 
probably the best clean energy you're
gonna<00:03:22.780> feel<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:23.440> I've<00:03:24.220> said<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.549> before<00:03:24.579> and

I'll<00:03:25.000> say<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.180> again<00:03:25.299> it's<00:03:25.600> very<00:03:25.870> clean<00:03:26.230> energy

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
I'll say it again it's very clean energy
