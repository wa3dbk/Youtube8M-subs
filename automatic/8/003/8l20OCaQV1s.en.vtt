got a prosthetic hand afterwards and he

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.330 
got a prosthetic hand afterwards and he
says<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.960> course<00:00:13.170> it's<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.620> amazing

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
says that of course it's this amazing

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.529 
invention that allows you to have a hand
when<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.590> don't<00:00:16.740> really<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.250> hand<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:18.480> he

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
when you don't really have a hand but he

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.970 
when you don't really have a hand but he
says<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> main<00:00:18.960> problem<00:00:19.439> with<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.830> that

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
says the main problem with it is that

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.099 
says the main problem with it is that
you<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.369> no<00:00:20.699> feel<00:00:21.029> with<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.390> whatsoever<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
you have no feel with it whatsoever and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.380 
you have no feel with it whatsoever and
you<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.350> kind<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.670> crush<00:00:23.670> something<00:00:24.000> very

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
you can kind of crush something very

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.480 
you can kind of crush something very
easily<00:00:24.810> if<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.529> go<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> pick<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.310> grab

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
easily if you go to pick it up or grab

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.450 
easily if you go to pick it up or grab
it<00:00:26.730> because<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.810> any<00:00:28.340> concept<00:00:29.340> of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
it because you don't have any concept of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.310 
it because you don't have any concept of
how<00:00:29.609> light<00:00:29.970> or<00:00:30.210> hard<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.480> you<00:00:33.480> know<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
how light or hard it is so you know as a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.590 
how light or hard it is so you know as a
result<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.280> there's<00:00:35.700> researchers<00:00:36.360> who

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
result of that there's researchers who

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.299 
result of that there's researchers who
have<00:00:37.500> been<00:00:37.649> working<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.450> better<00:00:39.450> newer<00:00:40.440> types

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
have been working on better newer types

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.470 
have been working on better newer types
of<00:00:41.520> prosthetic<00:00:42.059> limbs

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
of prosthetic limbs

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.500 
of prosthetic limbs
well<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:43.730> researchers<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:44.850> Switzerland

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
well now researchers from Switzerland

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.000 
well now researchers from Switzerland
and<00:00:45.570> Italy<00:00:45.890> just<00:00:46.890> created<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.789> prosthetic<00:00:48.360> hand

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
and Italy just created a prosthetic hand

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.200 
and Italy just created a prosthetic hand
that<00:00:50.010> has<00:00:50.399> feel<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.399> other<00:00:53.520> words<00:00:53.760> they've

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that has feel so in other words they've

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.770 
that has feel so in other words they've
created<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.960> fake<00:00:55.260> hand<00:00:56.120> that<00:00:57.120> feels<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
created a fake hand that feels like a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.189 
created a fake hand that feels like a
real<00:00:57.930> hand<00:00:58.730> this<00:00:59.730> absolutely<00:01:00.660> blew<00:01:00.840> my<00:01:00.989> mind

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
real hand this absolutely blew my mind

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.470 
real hand this absolutely blew my mind
first<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.859> even<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.399> other<00:01:02.609> technology

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
first of all even the other technology

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.899 
first of all even the other technology
seems<00:01:03.989> impossible<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> me<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
seems impossible to me you know what I

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
seems impossible to me you know what I
mean<00:01:06.119> even<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> prosthetic<00:01:07.439> technology

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
mean even the prosthetic technology

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.289 
mean even the prosthetic technology
where<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> don't<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.640> field<00:01:08.970> just

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
where you don't have field just

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.600 
where you don't have field just
attaching<00:01:09.869> something<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.470> nub<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.310> your

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
attaching something to this nub on your

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.719 
attaching something to this nub on your
arm<00:01:11.880> where<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.900> still<00:01:13.260> move<00:01:14.040> move<00:01:14.580> it

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
arm where you can still move move it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.890 
arm where you can still move move it
even<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.090> can't<00:01:15.150> feel<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.720> could

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
even if you can't feel it you could

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.499 
even if you can't feel it you could
still<00:01:16.110> move<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:17.400> already<00:01:17.790> lost<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.330> was

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
still move it I'm already lost I was

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.330 
still move it I'm already lost I was
lost<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> primitive<00:01:19.500> technology<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.250> don't

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
lost at the primitive technology I don't

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.740 
lost at the primitive technology I don't
know<00:01:20.490> how<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> hell<00:01:20.820> they<00:01:20.909> did<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.390> would

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
know how the hell they did that I would

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.060 
know how the hell they did that I would
love<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> talk<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.530> these<00:01:22.650> guys<00:01:22.740> figure

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
love to talk to one of these guys figure

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.530 
love to talk to one of these guys figure
out<00:01:23.189> how<00:01:23.310> did<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.850> even<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> older

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
out how did you do that even the older

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
out how did you do that even the older
one<00:01:24.689> how<00:01:24.810> did<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.409> that's<00:01:26.310> not

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
one how did you do that that's not

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.929 
one how did you do that that's not
possible

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
possible

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.300 
possible
but<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> newer<00:01:28.320> one<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.100> only

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
but now the newer one you can not only

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.109 
but now the newer one you can not only
move<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:31.020> feel<00:01:31.820> how<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.030> you

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
move it you can have feel how can you

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.050 
move it you can have feel how can you
have<00:01:33.299> how<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:35.310> apparently

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
have how do you do that so apparently

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.600 
have how do you do that so apparently
what<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.390> did<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:37.790> they<00:01:38.990> they<00:01:39.990> took<00:01:40.799> sensors

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
what they did is they they took sensors

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.760 
what they did is they they took sensors
and<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.210> these<00:01:42.360> different<00:01:42.509> wires<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.680> all

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and all these different wires and all

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.660 
and all these different wires and all
these<00:01:43.860> different<00:01:44.009> things<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.549> can

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
these different things that can

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.460 
these different things that can
stimulate<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.509> guess<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.899> region<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.350> your

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
stimulate I guess that region of your

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.889 
stimulate I guess that region of your
hand<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.740> there<00:01:47.130> right<00:01:48.030> before<00:01:48.630> where<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
hand right there right before where the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.780 
hand right there right before where the
hand<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.680> give<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> illusion<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
hand is to give you the illusion of the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.940 
hand is to give you the illusion of the
feel<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.079> also<00:01:52.320> transition<00:01:52.860> it

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
feel and then you can also transition it

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.350 
feel and then you can also transition it
where<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.310> move<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> hand<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.970> way<00:01:54.090> too

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
where you can move the hand that way too

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.069 
where you can move the hand that way too
so<00:01:55.280> as<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.610> right<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> only<00:01:57.149> problem<00:01:57.930> with

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
so as of right now the only problem with

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.109 
so as of right now the only problem with
it<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.680> technology<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.670> still<00:01:59.790> kind

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
it is that the technology is still kind

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.300 
it is that the technology is still kind
of<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.479> its<00:02:00.630> atari<00:02:01.049> phase<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.009> they<00:02:02.130> can

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
of like in its atari phase so they can

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.459 
of like in its atari phase so they can
do<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:03.750> these<00:02:03.930> sensors<00:02:04.439> and

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
do it but there are these sensors and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.440 
do it but there are these sensors and
these<00:02:04.860> wires<00:02:05.219> all<00:02:05.579> hooked<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.210> big

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
these wires all hooked up to this big

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.540 
these wires all hooked up to this big
machine<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.619> can't<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.369> that

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
machine and you can't really have that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.100 
machine and you can't really have that
and<00:02:08.729> walk<00:02:08.849> around<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.929> they're

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and walk around with it so they're

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.530 
and walk around with it so they're
working<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.530> taking<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.610> technology<00:02:12.030> and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
working on taking the the technology and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.640 
working on taking the the technology and
making<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.020> micro

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
making it micro

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.170 
making it micro
making<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.040> small<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.760> actually

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
making it small so you can actually

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.539 
making it small so you can actually
attach<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.049> still<00:02:16.349> have<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.560> ability

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
attach it and still have that ability

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.339 
attach it and still have that ability
without<00:02:17.700> all<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.120> wires<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.900> bells<00:02:19.110> and

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
without all the wires and the bells and

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.869 
without all the wires and the bells and
the<00:02:19.409> whistles<00:02:19.439> and<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.069> big<00:02:20.220> machines<00:02:20.640> and

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
the whistles and the big machines and

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.780 
the whistles and the big machines and
this<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:22.019> it's<00:02:22.650> an<00:02:22.829> amazing

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
this and that so it's an amazing

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.970 
this and that so it's an amazing
breakthrough<00:02:24.060> man<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.409> all<00:02:25.590> legit

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
breakthrough man and it's all legit

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.259 
breakthrough man and it's all legit

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
like I say every time we cover a story

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.809 
like I say every time we cover a story
like<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.230> whether<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.799> harvesting<00:02:35.459> ears

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
like this whether it's harvesting ears

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.940 
like this whether it's harvesting ears
you<00:02:36.480> know<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.780> how<00:02:37.019> they<00:02:37.140> say<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.409> can<00:02:37.590> create

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
you know that how they say it can create

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.520 
you know that how they say it can create
a<00:02:38.310> new<00:02:38.730> body<00:02:39.030> part<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.720> grow<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.079> on<00:02:40.170> an<00:02:40.319> other

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
a new body part and grow it on an other

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.000 
a new body part and grow it on an other
body<00:02:40.859> part<00:02:41.189> of<00:02:41.280> yours<00:02:41.989> how<00:02:42.989> again<00:02:43.470> how<00:02:43.739> do<00:02:43.799> you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
body part of yours how again how do you

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.410 
body part of yours how again how do you
do<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.489> it's<00:02:44.760> insane

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
do that it's insane

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
or whether it's just you know the idea

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.940 
or whether it's just you know the idea
of<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.519> bypass<00:02:48.090> surgery<00:02:48.470> we're<00:02:49.470> gonna<00:02:49.560> open<00:02:49.769> up

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
of a bypass surgery we're gonna open up

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.319 
of a bypass surgery we're gonna open up
your<00:02:50.010> chest<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.639> take<00:02:50.819> these<00:02:50.970> clogged

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
your chest and take these clogged

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.149 
your chest and take these clogged
arteries<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.139> we're<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.349> gonna<00:02:52.470> de<00:02:52.829> clog

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
arteries and we're just gonna de clog

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.740 
arteries and we're just gonna de clog
them<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.670> then<00:02:53.760> we're<00:02:53.879> gonna<00:02:53.970> make<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.299> seem

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
them and then we're gonna make it seem

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.479 
them and then we're gonna make it seem
like<00:02:54.870> your<00:02:55.049> heart<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.349> new<00:02:55.560> again<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.069> it'll

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
like your heart is new again and it'll

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.030 
like your heart is new again and it'll
run<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:56.909> normal<00:02:57.269> like<00:02:58.260> did<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.769> treat

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
run like normal like did you just treat

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.890 
run like normal like did you just treat
that<00:02:59.159> guy<00:02:59.370> like<00:02:59.549> he<00:02:59.670> was<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.849> car<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.420> fix<00:03:00.659> him

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
that guy like he was a car and fix him

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.080 
that guy like he was a car and fix him
because<00:03:01.739> that's<00:03:01.829> incredible<00:03:02.370> why<00:03:02.819> are<00:03:02.879> these

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
because that's incredible why are these

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.300 
because that's incredible why are these
why<00:03:03.480> are<00:03:03.540> we<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.139> know<00:03:04.260> worshipping<00:03:05.220> at

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
why are we not you know worshipping at

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.369 
why are we not you know worshipping at
the<00:03:05.340> altar<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.790> doctors<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.750> medicine<00:03:07.200> and

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
the altar of doctors and medicine and

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.589 
the altar of doctors and medicine and
science<00:03:07.859> and<00:03:08.069> empiricism<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.269> I'll<00:03:09.389> say<00:03:09.569> it

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
science and empiricism so I'll say it

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.059 
science and empiricism so I'll say it
again<00:03:09.720> like<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.109> say<00:03:10.260> every<00:03:10.500> time<00:03:10.530> we<00:03:10.769> discuss

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
again like I say every time we discuss

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.580 
again like I say every time we discuss
this<00:03:11.220> stuff<00:03:11.340> man<00:03:11.670> there's<00:03:12.359> no<00:03:12.720> there's<00:03:13.530> no

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
this stuff man there's no there's no

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.149 
this stuff man there's no there's no
reason<00:03:14.189> to<00:03:14.989> spend<00:03:15.989> your<00:03:16.260> life<00:03:16.470> worrying<00:03:16.889> about

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
reason to spend your life worrying about

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.589 
reason to spend your life worrying about
what<00:03:17.730> what's<00:03:17.910> gonna<00:03:18.060> happen<00:03:18.359> in<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.510> next

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
what what's gonna happen in the next

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.599 
what what's gonna happen in the next
life<00:03:18.840> or<00:03:19.169> what's<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.829> purpose<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.280> all<00:03:20.400> this

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
life or what's the purpose of all this

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.300 
life or what's the purpose of all this
or<00:03:20.849> all<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.120> no<00:03:21.629> make<00:03:22.109> make<00:03:22.530> your<00:03:22.739> meaning<00:03:23.099> in

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
this life and the way to do that is to

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.759 
this life and the way to do that is to
put<00:03:26.940> your<00:03:27.239> not<00:03:27.780> your<00:03:27.930> faith<00:03:28.199> because<00:03:28.560> faith<00:03:28.590> is
