when<00:00:01.800> you're<00:00:01.979> working<00:00:02.220> on<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.610> project<00:00:03.380> it's

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
when you're working on a project it's

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.320 
when you're working on a project it's
very<00:00:04.529> important<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.279> add<00:00:05.609> additional

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
very important that you add additional

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.059 
very important that you add additional
data<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.930> your<00:00:07.109> rendering<00:00:07.470> steering

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
data to your rendering steering

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.589 
data to your rendering steering
especially<00:00:08.610> during<00:00:08.790> their<00:00:09.000> test<00:00:09.150> renewing

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
especially during their test renewing

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.350 
especially during their test renewing
phase<00:00:09.800> like<00:00:10.800> for<00:00:11.130> example<00:00:11.160> render<00:00:11.670> time<00:00:11.910> or<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
phase like for example render time or a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.450 
phase like for example render time or a
frame<00:00:12.870> number<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.679> when<00:00:13.830> you're<00:00:13.950> Fugees<00:00:14.130> on

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
frame number so when you're Fugees on

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.460 
frame number so when you're Fugees on
you<00:00:14.820> see<00:00:14.969> exactly<00:00:15.240> like<00:00:15.540> oh<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:16.020> room<00:00:16.199> has<00:00:16.350> an

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
you see exactly like oh this room has an

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.920 
you see exactly like oh this room has an
issue<00:00:16.619> did<00:00:17.130> render<00:00:17.400> very<00:00:17.580> long<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.060> oh<00:00:18.330> it's

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
issue did render very long and oh it's

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.740 
issue did render very long and oh it's
this<00:00:19.170> exact<00:00:19.590> frame<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:21.359> usually

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
this exact frame and for this we usually

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.740 
this exact frame and for this we usually
had<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> stamp<00:00:22.800> feature<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.390> gone<00:00:24.689> now

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
had the stamp feature but it's gone now

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.140 
had the stamp feature but it's gone now
as<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.380> can<00:00:25.500> see<00:00:25.560> instead<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.519> reads<00:00:26.730> meter

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
as you can see instead it reads meter

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.320 
as you can see instead it reads meter
data<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.779> when<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> opened<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.179> stamp<00:00:30.179> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
data and when I opened this stamp is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.170 
data and when I opened this stamp is
still<00:00:30.539> there<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.289> let<00:00:31.830> me<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.189> use<00:00:32.430> stamp<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
still there but let me not use stamp I

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.990 
still there but let me not use stamp I
won't<00:00:33.540> click<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.989> instead<00:00:34.829> let<00:00:35.190> me<00:00:35.340> select

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
won't click this instead let me select

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.220 
won't click this instead let me select
everything<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.899> add<00:00:37.590> even<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> note<00:00:39.230> like

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
everything here add even at a note like

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.729 
everything here add even at a note like
for<00:00:40.410> example<00:00:40.969> when<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.180> cookie<00:00:43.050> folks<00:00:43.590> are

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
for example when the cookie folks are

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.080 
for example when the cookie folks are
awesome<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.910> now<00:00:50.910> let

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
awesome and you really are and now let

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.450 
awesome and you really are and now let
me<00:00:51.120> hit<00:00:51.360> render<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.440> render<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> image<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
me hit render and render the image you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.439 
me hit render and render the image you
see<00:00:54.360> nothing<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.219> usually<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:57.000> I

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
see nothing is there usually there if I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.209 
see nothing is there usually there if I
had<00:00:57.600> used<00:00:57.780> stamp<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.559> would<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.829> text

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
had used stamp there would be a text

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.819 
had used stamp there would be a text
written<00:00:59.520> exactly<00:01:00.090> into<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> image<00:01:00.829> reading

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
written exactly into the image reading

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.740 
written exactly into the image reading
all<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> information<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.480> not

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
all the information here but it's not

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.300 
all the information here but it's not
here<00:01:04.189> instead<00:01:05.189> let<00:01:05.549> me<00:01:05.729> save<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.689> image<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
here instead let me save the image is a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.410 
here instead let me save the image is a
PNG<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:09.299> example<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:10.560> he<00:01:11.310> run<00:01:11.549> few<00:01:11.970> let

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
PNG for example and now he run few let

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.070 
PNG for example and now he run few let
me<00:01:12.540> select<00:01:12.720> show<00:01:13.260> meter<00:01:13.860> data<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.540> have

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
me select show meter data and now I have

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.810 
me select show meter data and now I have
all<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.560> meter<00:01:16.710> data<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.130> selected<00:01:17.670> here

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
all the meter data I have selected here

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.929 
all the meter data I have selected here
and<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.930> read<00:01:19.170> from<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> file<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.640> rare<00:01:20.909> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and it's read from the file it's rare I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.270 
and it's read from the file it's rare I
writing<00:01:21.270> them<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.600> exif<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.350> if<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.070> using

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
writing them to exif and if you're using

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.850 
writing them to exif and if you're using
openexr<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.540> writing<00:01:24.780> them<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> header

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
openexr it's writing them to the header

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.640 
openexr it's writing them to the header
of<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> file<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.869> everything<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.470> had

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
of the file so I have everything I had

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
of the file so I have everything I had
here<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> render<00:01:29.430> time<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.030> date<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
here like the render time the date and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.690 
here like the render time the date and
everything<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.960> below<00:01:31.710> also<00:01:32.310> things<00:01:32.610> like

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
everything and below also things like

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.530 
everything and below also things like
the<00:01:33.180> time<00:01:33.990> which<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.770> by<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.310> not<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the time which is by the way not the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.450 
the time which is by the way not the
time<00:01:36.750> when<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.350> rendered<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.310> up

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
time when this was rendered that is up

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.300 
time when this was rendered that is up
here<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.790> date<00:01:39.210> instead<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> time

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
here and date instead this is the time

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.980 
here and date instead this is the time
in<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> time<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.450> frame<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
in the time of the frame in the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.770 
in the time of the frame in the
animation<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.040> at<00:01:44.310> 24<00:01:44.850> frames<00:01:44.880> per<00:01:45.180> second<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
animation so at 24 frames per second the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
animation so at 24 frames per second the
frame<00:01:46.380> number<00:01:46.680> 52<00:01:47.070> would<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.520> two<00:01:47.909> seconds<00:01:48.329> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
frame number 52 would be two seconds and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.660 
frame number 52 would be two seconds and
four<00:01:48.840> frames<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.770> here's<00:01:50.070> also<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> frame

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
four frames like here's also the frame

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.880 
four frames like here's also the frame
number<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.320> really<00:01:52.649> awesome

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
number so this is really awesome

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
number so this is really awesome
especially<00:01:53.340> because<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.240> view<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
especially because we can now view the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
especially because we can now view the
meta<00:01:55.020> data<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.710> attached<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> images

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
meta data that is attached to the images

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.109 
meta data that is attached to the images
and<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.659> an<00:01:58.140> april<00:01:58.409> by<00:01:58.530> default<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.640> you

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
and it's also an april by default so you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.690 
and it's also an april by default so you
don't<00:02:00.299> need<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.630> add<00:02:00.780> stamp<00:02:01.140> anymore<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.740> you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
don't need to add stamp anymore and you

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.389 
don't need to add stamp anymore and you
can<00:02:02.909> read<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.299> from<00:02:03.329> inside<00:02:03.840> blender<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.340> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
can read it from inside blender so you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.219 
can read it from inside blender so you
don't<00:02:05.759> need<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.030> use<00:02:06.299> stamp<00:02:06.630> anymore<00:02:07.049> because

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
don't need to use stamp anymore because

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.360 
don't need to use stamp anymore because
if<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.890> did<00:02:08.190> when<00:02:08.849> what<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.000> will<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.420> now<00:02:10.370> let

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
if I you did when what I will do now let

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.450 
if I you did when what I will do now let
me<00:02:11.400> show<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.730> how<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.209> will<00:02:12.360> look<00:02:12.390> down

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
me show you how it will look down

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.190 
me show you how it will look down
you<00:02:13.520> see<00:02:13.700> then<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.210> will<00:02:14.360> be<00:02:14.510> written<00:02:14.870> directly

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
you see then it will be written directly

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.280 
you see then it will be written directly
into<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.160> image<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.630> obviously<00:02:17.780> not

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
into the image and this is obviously not

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.470 
into the image and this is obviously not
good<00:02:18.770> for<00:02:19.040> final<00:02:19.490> renderings<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.120> with

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
good for final renderings and with

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.750 
good for final renderings and with
enable<00:02:21.050> meter<00:02:21.200> data<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:22.280> even<00:02:22.580> get

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
enable meter data you can now even get

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.360 
enable meter data you can now even get
all<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.000> data<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:23.900> your<00:02:24.110> finals<00:02:24.890> which<00:02:25.220> is

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
all this data for your finals which is

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.330

really really cool add you can also view

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.780 
really really cool add you can also view

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
is e let me show you by adding an image

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.910 
is e let me show you by adding an image
sequence<00:02:37.490> where<00:02:38.210> I<00:02:38.240> have<00:02:38.570> used<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.650> image

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
sequence where I have used it and image

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.920 
sequence where I have used it and image
drug<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.310> then<00:02:40.760> here<00:02:41.000> under<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.300> few<00:02:41.480> let<00:02:41.810> me

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
drug and then here under a few let me

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.020 
drug and then here under a few let me
show<00:02:42.080> enable<00:02:42.620> show<00:02:42.740> meter<00:02:43.010> data<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.520> for

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
show enable show meter data and for

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.160 
show enable show meter data and for
example<00:02:44.120> here<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.570> have<00:02:44.870> d<00:02:45.220> render<00:02:46.220> time<00:02:46.430> and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
example here I have d render time and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.390 
example here I have d render time and
when<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.200> am<00:02:48.350> running<00:02:48.560> through<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.920> animation

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
when I am running through the animation

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.220 
when I am running through the animation
you<00:02:49.460> see<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.270> updates<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.750> render<00:02:51.050> time

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
you see that it updates the render time

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.690 
you see that it updates the render time
for<00:02:51.410> each<00:02:51.530> frame<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.010> reads<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.370> directly

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
for each frame and reads it directly

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.490 
for each frame and reads it directly
from<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.970> PM<00:02:53.180> cheese<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.960> you<00:02:54.020> can<00:02:54.230> see<00:02:54.380> it

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
from the PM cheese so you can see it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.190 
from the PM cheese so you can see it
started<00:02:54.830> like<00:02:55.010> one<00:02:55.610> minute<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.750> now

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
started like one minute and it's now

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.080 
started like one minute and it's now
like<00:02:57.470> four<00:02:57.950> minutes<00:02:58.160> per<00:02:58.430> frame<00:02:58.610> which<00:02:58.910> of

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
like four minutes per frame which of

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.890 
like four minutes per frame which of
course<00:02:59.120> is<00:02:59.480> quite<00:03:00.350> long<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.880> because<00:03:01.900> blender

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
course is quite long and because blender

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.160 
course is quite long and because blender
is<00:03:03.110> saving<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.800> meter<00:03:04.100> data<00:03:04.340> as<00:03:04.700> exif<00:03:05.450> data

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
is saving the meter data as exif data

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.740 
is saving the meter data as exif data
inside<00:03:06.830> p<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.130> cheese<00:03:07.280> or<00:03:07.460> tape<00:03:07.640> x<00:03:07.850> people

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
inside p and cheese or tape x people

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.360 
inside p and cheese or tape x people
could<00:03:08.930> for<00:03:09.080> example<00:03:09.110> write<00:03:09.560> Python<00:03:09.890> add-ons

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
could for example write Python add-ons

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.760 
could for example write Python add-ons
that<00:03:10.640> provide<00:03:11.330> statistics<00:03:11.600> on<00:03:12.140> your<00:03:12.560> D

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
that provide statistics on your D

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.500 
that provide statistics on your D
renderings<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.280> your<00:03:13.430> animations<00:03:13.940> even<00:03:14.360> for

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
renderings of your animations even for

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.600 
renderings of your animations even for
your<00:03:14.600> finals<00:03:14.960> and<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.470> super<00:03:16.160> awesome

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
your finals and that is super awesome

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.580 
your finals and that is super awesome
and<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:17.030> really<00:03:17.060> love<00:03:17.600> this<00:03:17.810> new<00:03:18.050> feature<00:03:18.260> it's

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
and I really love this new feature it's

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.500 
and I really love this new feature it's
very<00:03:18.920> very<00:03:19.190> important<00:03:19.640> at<00:03:19.790> least<00:03:20.030> for<00:03:20.210> me<00:03:20.300> and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
very very important at least for me and

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.850 
very very important at least for me and
I<00:03:21.260> guess<00:03:21.440> for<00:03:21.770> some<00:03:21.830> of<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.370> as<00:03:22.640> well
