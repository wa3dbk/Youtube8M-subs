00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.960
 so four workshops with implementations 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.379
 situation on the phases of play in the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.940
 repair surfaces to try to 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.520
 share the decision with the additional 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.390
 the assistant and the central for already 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.220
 put in the future configuration 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.490
 matches 8th finals of cup 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.610
 la France 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.630
 I shoot and I just let go at the entrance of 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.700
 the area of ​​repair 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.950
 the same thing tackle the crunching people 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.450
 same inner things was 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.450
 seen from the game close to the truth tower 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.480
 in front of that that's what I 'm doing 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.510
 position behind behind 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.920
 the additional more or less and see if 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.920
 additional takes the right decision 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.199
 it allows us to really engage 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.770
 direct with the problematic of 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.300
 ground already 2 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.860
 to imagine 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.659
 likewise the referees in the considers 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.110
 in almost almost configurations 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.930
 real two more referees it's two 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.800
 different interpretations sometimes on 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.550
 certain situations 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.280
 so the main basis of work 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.860
 it's the sharing of the decision that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.000
 decide times in which situation and 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.190
 for which situation 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.590
 Concentrate needs to put them 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:32.380
 doubt the goal is a section 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.789
 sports center which is close to the crossroads of 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.920
 two since we are the only section 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:43.000
 Sports labeled high school and fff 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.470
 the national education that we have 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.500
 used to come here to clairefontaine 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.600
 with the referees it's now 4 5 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.030
 in four years that we work 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.940
 regularly with all referees 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.179
 federal authorities, actions must be simulated 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.740
 we have to try to create an arbitrator so 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.870
 that they also feel hardly acquired or 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.430
 No but 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.729
 his last this additional arbitration 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.220
 basically allowed to help the army 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.630
 central in the truth zone 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.060
 that is to say in the surface of 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.920
 repair help to take the good 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.710
 decisions when the balloon crosses me 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.440
 fills does not cross the goal line has 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.450
 actually be from this study the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.480
 camera what the camera is reporting 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.070
 a few seconds later but life 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:43.710
 traditional must be able to 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:45.510
 play in the snapshot it's played at 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.130
 really very little about 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.290
 workshops the images all the remedies that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.390
 can there be allow us to see and 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.270
 even young people realized 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.500
 that in fact it was easy to sion it is necessary 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.420
 put in place modes of 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.090
 communication so that not everyone 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.760
 not at the same time respect 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.530
 areas of intervention for each of the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.140
 tracy functions this additional time 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.870
 referee so there is a whole protocol to 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.880
 set up before any gestures 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.380
 on the part of the additional everything is done 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.200
 by the word which allows to leave to 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.370
 the referee still a choice behind and 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.600
 to make the final decision 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.459
 when we are in the center we have 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.440
 basically a physical fatigue there 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.940
 it's a thune 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.000
 fatigue that is related to concentration 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.950
 which exhausts tremendously pushed things 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.900
 quite new since since 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.670
 level chair mobility is referee 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.590
 so who is before us who is 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.150
 perhaps better able to judge her 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.580
 faults in the area while our 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.530
 role was a little more centered on the 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.350
 taking a hard stance I so at this 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.730
 level there was 12 tranquilized by 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.130
 the contribution of these additional referees 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.110
 to control remains paramount in the 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.660
 in decision making at the level of 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.130
 the line the repair surface know 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.900
 if the fault is inside or 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.060
 the outside of the surface of an overflight 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.120
 is still a little more reinforced everything is 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.010
 ready now I hope that at the level 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.490
 media we will do good 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.480
 benefits for the arbitration to 5 bus 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.740
 during these twelve beings to be ready then 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.540
 to bring is more value than all the 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.520
 world is waiting I think there is a catch 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.170
 of general awareness that the function 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.810
 is specific and that a preparation 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:23.190
 adapted before before the meeting will be there 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.610
 indispensable for the smooth running of 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.610
 the team not
