00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
whether the fun I went with the Corsa AF

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.009 
whether the fun I went with the Corsa AF
128<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.069> blue<00:02:35.280> LED<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> secondary

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
128 the blue LED this is a secondary

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.479 
128 the blue LED this is a secondary
intake<00:02:37.349> front<00:02:37.590> because<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.040> only<00:02:38.190> comes<00:02:38.400> with

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
intake front because the only comes with

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.530 
intake front because the only comes with
one<00:02:38.549> as<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.940> said<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.920> went<00:02:41.400> with<00:02:41.549> AF<00:02:41.909> 120

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
one as I said and I went with AF 120

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.240 
one as I said and I went with AF 120
because<00:02:42.629> it's<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:43.140> pretty<00:02:43.379> quiet<00:02:43.590> file<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.159> it

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
because it's a pretty quiet file so it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.369 
because it's a pretty quiet file so it
pushes<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.549> lot<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.819> air

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
pushes a lot of air

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
so as you can see on the inside of the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.059 
so as you can see on the inside of the
rim<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.790> fun<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.180> got<00:03:18.359> four<00:03:18.750> LEDs<00:03:19.169> one

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
rim of the fun it's got four LEDs one

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.339 
rim of the fun it's got four LEDs one
here<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.549> one<00:03:20.790> over<00:03:21.120> here<00:03:21.359> there's<00:03:22.019> triple

turn<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.989> around<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:29.549> can<00:03:29.609> see<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.209> concept

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
turn it around you can see the concept

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.390 
turn it around you can see the concept
under<00:03:31.260> 12<00:03:31.680> volts<00:03:31.980> DC<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:33.109> 40<00:03:34.109> milliamps<00:03:34.769> in

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
under 12 volts DC and 40 milliamps in

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.050 
under 12 volts DC and 40 milliamps in
that's<00:03:36.120> how<00:03:36.269> much<00:03:36.419> power<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:37.019> uses<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:38.060> over

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
that's how much power it uses and over

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.909 
that's how much power it uses and over
here<00:03:39.209> we<00:03:39.329> have<00:03:39.450> connected<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.169> uses<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> free

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
here we have connected it uses a free

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.520 
here we have connected it uses a free
pin<00:03:41.099> connector<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.760> them<00:03:41.940> overboard<00:03:42.379> also<00:03:43.379> it

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
pin connector to them overboard also it

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.059 
pin connector to them overboard also it
comes<00:03:43.709> with<00:03:43.859> four<00:03:44.519> mounting<00:03:45.480> screws

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
comes with four mounting screws

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.259 
comes with four mounting screws

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.569 
unboxing video of this case and the fun
but<00:03:51.599> right<00:03:52.349> now<00:03:52.470> what<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.680> have<00:03:52.919> to<00:03:52.949> do<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.400> just

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
but right now what I have to do is just

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.280 
but right now what I have to do is just
swap<00:03:53.879> out<00:03:54.030> all<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.359> components<00:03:54.480> from<00:03:55.019> this

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
swap out all the components from this

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.129 
swap out all the components from this
case<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.370> case<00:03:56.609> this<00:03:57.480> case<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> bit<00:03:58.109> a

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
case to that case this case is a bit a

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.110 
case to that case this case is a bit a
little<00:03:58.230> bit<00:03:58.379> longer<00:03:58.739> but<00:03:59.579> at<00:03:59.669> the<00:03:59.730> same<00:03:59.879> time

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
little bit longer but at the same time

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.780 
little bit longer but at the same time
it's<00:04:00.449> less<00:04:01.019> Hall<00:04:01.319> like<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.250> case<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.609> bit

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
it's less Hall like this case is a bit

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.599 
it's less Hall like this case is a bit
taller<00:04:03.060> but<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:04.590> prefer<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.099> design<00:04:05.430> much

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
taller but I prefer this design much

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.849 
taller but I prefer this design much
more<00:04:05.879> and<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.329> looks<00:04:06.599> a<00:04:06.840> bit<00:04:07.079> more<00:04:07.290> elegant

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
more and it looks a bit more elegant

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.170 
more and it looks a bit more elegant
than<00:04:07.919> this<00:04:08.129> case<00:04:08.340> this<00:04:08.549> case<00:04:08.760> just<00:04:09.000> looks

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
than this case this case just looks

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.829 
than this case this case just looks
overblown<00:04:10.079> Rises<00:04:10.620> stuff
