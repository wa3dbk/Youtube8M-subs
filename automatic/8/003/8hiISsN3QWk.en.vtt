conceded<00:00:13.929> the<00:00:14.050> two<00:00:14.230> goals<00:00:14.500> because<00:00:14.769> I've

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
conceded the two goals because I've

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.350

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:18.759 
clear-cut chances I felt the two girls

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.050 
clear-cut chances I felt the two girls
were<00:00:18.939> a<00:00:18.970> little<00:00:19.090> bit<00:00:19.270> too<00:00:19.450> easy<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.369> then<00:00:21.849> we

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
goals down but it was somewhat against

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.579 
goals down but it was somewhat against
the<00:00:49.600> run<00:00:49.719> of<00:00:49.809> play<00:00:49.839> because<00:00:50.289> as<00:00:50.379> you<00:00:50.469> mentioned

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
the game nobre hadn't and that was the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.139 
the game nobre hadn't and that was the
disappointing<00:00:54.219> firs<00:00:54.820> I<00:00:54.879> think<00:00:55.030> we<00:00:55.120> just

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
disappointing firs I think we just

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.970 
disappointing firs I think we just
showed<00:00:55.480> him<00:00:55.600> too<00:00:55.749> much<00:00:55.870> respect<00:00:56.320> from<00:00:56.469> time<00:00:56.800> to

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
showed him too much respect from time to

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.389 
showed him too much respect from time to
time<00:00:57.010> first<00:00:57.489> off<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.899> so<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.199> go<00:00:59.469> in<00:00:59.649> you<00:00:59.859> know

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
time first off and so to go in you know

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.649 
time first off and so to go in you know
had<00:01:00.609> it<00:01:00.640> had<00:01:00.819> been<00:01:00.940> to<00:01:01.120> nil<00:01:01.359> would<00:01:01.480> have<00:01:01.569> been

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
had it had been to nil would have been

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.660 
had it had been to nil would have been
immensely<00:01:02.050> disappointing<00:01:02.800> so<00:01:03.039> the<00:01:03.429> fact<00:01:03.640> that

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
immensely disappointing so the fact that

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.399 
immensely disappointing so the fact that
we<00:01:03.819> got<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:04.089> back<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.330> what<00:01:04.659> I<00:01:04.690> think<00:01:04.930> helped<00:01:05.229> us

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
we got it back to what I think helped us

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.319 
we got it back to what I think helped us
something<00:01:06.159> we<00:01:06.250> played<00:01:06.460> badly<00:01:06.670> first<00:01:07.060> offer

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
something we played badly first offer

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.600 
something we played badly first offer
just<00:01:07.540> for<00:01:07.630> we<00:01:07.840> moved<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.439> ball<00:01:08.619> I<00:01:08.860> mean<00:01:09.310> West

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
just for we moved the ball I mean West

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.920 
just for we moved the ball I mean West
Brom<00:01:09.790> wanted<00:01:10.090> us<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.360> have<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.600> ball<00:01:10.750> which

Brom wanted us to have the ball which

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.600 
Brom wanted us to have the ball which
was<00:01:11.079> unusual<00:01:11.229> for<00:01:11.619> a<00:01:11.770> premier<00:01:12.070> li<00:01:12.189> ting<00:01:12.399> but<00:01:12.549> a

on<00:01:27.670> in<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.820> half<00:01:28.060> with<00:01:28.509> the<00:01:28.630> goal<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.170> then<00:01:29.560> with

on in a half with the goal and then with
a<00:01:29.770> chance<00:01:30.070> later<00:01:30.280> on<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:31.780> started<00:01:31.930> doing<00:01:32.200> the

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
a chance later on we started doing the

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.539 
a chance later on we started doing the
things<00:01:32.469> that<00:01:32.530> we<00:01:32.710> wanted<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:32.979> do<00:01:33.159> certainly

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
things that we wanted to do certainly

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.819 
things that we wanted to do certainly
second<00:01:33.880> half<00:01:34.060> we<00:01:34.270> we<00:01:34.960> we<00:01:35.350> gave<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.560> real

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
second half we we we gave a real

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.440 
second half we we we gave a real
barnstorming<00:01:36.520> performance<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:37.149> like<00:01:37.240> so

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
barnstorming performance and like so

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.910 
barnstorming performance and like so
really<00:01:37.810> really<00:01:37.990> unfortunate<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.829> we

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
really really unfortunate that we

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.010 
really really unfortunate that we
couldn't<00:01:39.159> manage<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.520> get<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.759> so<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.689> managed

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
couldn't manage to get on so you managed

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.889 
couldn't manage to get on so you managed
to<00:01:41.170> take<00:01:42.130> take<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.939> momentum<00:01:43.210> of<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.719> late

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
to take take the momentum of the late

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.359 
to take take the momentum of the late
first<00:01:44.140> I've<00:01:44.380> got<00:01:44.530> into<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.950> second<00:01:45.250> but<00:01:45.340> just

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
first I've got into the second but just

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.700 
first I've got into the second but just
seemed<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:46.119> you<00:01:46.180> were<00:01:46.359> lacking<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.869> drop

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
seemed that you were lacking the drop

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.899 
seemed that you were lacking the drop
here<00:01:47.950> are<00:01:48.070> there<00:01:48.219> in<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.460> box<00:01:48.609> of<00:01:48.759> all

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
wouldn't drop down which you probably

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.660 
wouldn't drop down which you probably
need<00:01:50.500> against<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.859> preeminent<00:01:51.280> yeah<00:01:51.399> well<00:01:51.579> it

of<00:01:55.570> his<00:01:55.719> headers<00:01:56.049> I<00:01:56.200> think

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.890

when a big cross to the back post I

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.130 
when a big cross to the back post I
think<00:01:59.580> we're<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.700> cook<00:02:00.880> worry<00:02:01.120> where's<00:02:01.690> when

think we're to cook worry where's when

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.570 
think we're to cook worry where's when

last-ditch<00:02:05.440> challenge<00:02:07.020> sometimes<00:02:08.020> I<00:02:08.140> think

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
last-ditch challenge sometimes I think

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.540 
last-ditch challenge sometimes I think
game<00:02:08.440> like<00:02:08.650> that<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.950> know<00:02:08.980> you<00:02:09.070> can't<00:02:09.400> do<00:02:09.520> a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
all the possession but we certainly did

you can see the packs and Andrews

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.540 
you can see the packs and Andrews
reaction<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.620> despite<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.070> result<00:02:21.400> they

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
reaction to it despite the result they

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.920 
reaction to it despite the result they
were<00:02:21.580> more<00:02:22.120> than<00:02:22.150> proud<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.690> players

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
were more than proud of the players

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.360 
were more than proud of the players
today<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.530> affinia<00:02:23.830> where<00:02:23.980> think<00:02:24.280> was

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
today the affinia where think was

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.500 
today the affinia where think was
important<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.820> we<00:02:24.970> gave<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.240> funds

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
important that we gave the funds

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.180 
important that we gave the funds
something<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.440> be<00:02:26.530> proud<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.160> think

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
something to be proud of and I think

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.370 
something to be proud of and I think
certainly<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.820> performance<00:02:28.450> for<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:29.050> majority

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
certainly a performance for the majority

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.750 
certainly a performance for the majority
the<00:02:29.800> game<00:02:29.950> certainly<00:02:30.340> did<00:02:30.520> that<00:02:30.670> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
the game certainly did that the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.160 
the game certainly did that the
atmosphere<00:02:31.150> was<00:02:31.180> electric<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:31.930> was<00:02:32.050> my

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
atmosphere was electric and that was my

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.570 
atmosphere was electric and that was my
biggest<00:02:32.380> thing<00:02:32.650> today<00:02:32.860> not<00:02:33.100> letting<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.430> fans

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
biggest thing today not letting the fans

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.700 
biggest thing today not letting the fans
down<00:02:33.790> which<00:02:34.090> sounds<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.630> little<00:02:35.080> bit<00:02:35.230> ironic

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
down which sounds a little bit ironic

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.080 
down which sounds a little bit ironic
because<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.490> know<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.700> fact<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:36.940> we've

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
because you know the fact that we've

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.370 
because you know the fact that we've
done<00:02:37.210> so<00:02:37.450> well<00:02:37.660> they<00:02:37.810> turned<00:02:38.050> up<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.290> the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
done so well they turned up in the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.380 
done so well they turned up in the
numbers<00:02:38.740> but<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.190> mean<00:02:39.790> we<00:02:39.910> gave<00:02:40.060> them<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.270> little

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
numbers but I mean we gave them a little

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.970 
numbers but I mean we gave them a little
bit<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.630> something<00:02:40.750> back<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.620> think<00:02:41.650> most

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
bit of something back and I think most

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.620 
bit of something back and I think most
of<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.280> funds<00:02:42.490> would<00:02:42.640> go<00:02:42.700> away<00:02:42.910> being<00:02:43.300> really

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
of the funds would go away being really

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:52.420 
of the funds would go away being really
really<00:02:43.720> pleased<00:02:44.020> of<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.260> performance

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.489
