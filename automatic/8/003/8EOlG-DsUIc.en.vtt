00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.670
 nest is the sanctuary of thousands of birds 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.189
 who are in danger of 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.469
 extinction and home of two quetzals that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.960
 we had the opportunity to monitor minute 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.519
 a minute at his birth the reporter 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.650
 a maricela bastida visited this 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.690
 amazing place and prepared us the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.180
 next material where we can 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.289
 discover and contemplate that unique space 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.289
 of the nature 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.560
 we are in the aviary the nest the third 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.370
 largest in the world in this place there 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.730
 More than 3000 birds of 330 species are going to

 take a tour is a sanctuary the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.640
 place of more than 1300 birds of 320 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.010
 species most in danger of 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.590
 extinction it is a unique place 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.140
 cataloged as one of the most aviaries 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.330
 great and diverse of the world when 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.000
 you set foot in this magical place to 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.760
 guys and great discoveries that it's about

 of an ideal space to contemplate and 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.750
 get in touch with the nature of 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:10.300
 a close and calm way 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.410
 The main attraction of the nest are the 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.030
 birds and the quetzal is his Mexican species 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.220
 representative a few months ago 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.530
 grint ibi had the opportunity to monitor 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.320
 and report the birth of two 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.110
 quetzals thousand-year-old birds whose plumage 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.440
 It was used in the making of 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.690
 plume of the Aztec emperor moctezuma 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.750
 the nest sanctuary and aviary that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.450
 located in iztapaluca exists thanks to 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.580
 creator of the wildlife foundation 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.190
 the late researcher jesus estudillo 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.160
 lopez who because of his love for 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.310
 birds discovered how to reproduce in 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.950
 captivity quetzales it based on 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.170
 replicate almost exactly the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.600
 forests of the Chimalapas jungle of 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.869
 fog located between the states of 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.149
 oaxaca and chiapas other species that 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.660
 They decorate this aviary are the eagles 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.720
 hummingbirds cranes cockatoos the hunter 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.970
 and the macaw pheasants all inhabit 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.430
 in what some call the real 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.650
 noah's ark among the principals 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.959
 attractive during the periods 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.150
 occasional are the exhibitions of 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.659
 flight where experts cause 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.310
 some well trained raptors 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.069
 overfly and give shows to 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.260
 visitors good for the bird that comes out 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.239
 flying is a harris guide is two 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.609
 aÃ±itos his name is sky is two years 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.069
 of training three years of age the 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.890
 bird that usually does is fly 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.510
 about going up the spectators 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.430
 has an operant training based 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.819
 of meat is put in the glove and the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.280
 bird responds by flying over them 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.459
 another show is the maximum sensation 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.260
 of contact with more than 180 nymphs and 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.019
 Australian parakeets that 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.760
 they find themselves in the place of emotions and 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.030
 who pose in the hands of visitors 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.879
 to feed through the cages 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.069
 of birds of prey we found the area of 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.489
 the animal eagles that live the most 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.980
 time about 70 years but for 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.859
 reach this age this beautiful species 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.099
 must take a difficult decision to be born of 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.330
 new at age 40 his nails shrink 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.730
 and soften 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.190
 making it difficult for him to grab the strawberries 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.440
 which the elongated peak is fed and 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.110
 pointy bends his wings 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.690
 aged and heavy are bent over 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.780
 the chest preventing him from taking flights 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.510
 The two eagle are fast and agile 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.390
 alternatives to die or go through a tough 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.520
 test over 150 days that 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.920
 consists of flying to the top of a 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.160
 mountain and look for shelter in a niche 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.500
 dug in the rock on that site hits the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.380
 old peak against the rock until it breaks 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.720
 and wait until it grows again 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.360
 and can with it tear the nails 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.760
 when the new nails come off 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.830
 eagle removes the old feathers and 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.340
 after five months grown the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.320
 New feathers start to fly again 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.320
 determined to live another thirty years 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.690
 we are in the place of confinement of 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.630
 harpy eagles according to records in 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.750
 mexico there are only two couples of 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.060
 this species and precisely those bones 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.940
 four copies are here in 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.990
 the aviary the nest reported for green tv 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.990
