bicep exercise that I want to share with

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.800 
bicep exercise that I want to share with
you<00:00:21.140> it's<00:00:21.680> a<00:00:21.920> cool<00:00:22.130> isolation<00:00:22.939> exercise<00:00:23.450> that

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
you it's a cool isolation exercise that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.200 
you it's a cool isolation exercise that
also<00:00:24.050> works<00:00:24.500> as<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.890> stretch<00:00:25.279> as<00:00:25.520> well<00:00:26.060> as<00:00:26.180> a

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
also works as a stretch as well as a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.089 
also works as a stretch as well as a
peak<00:00:26.480> contraction<00:00:26.810> loop<00:00:27.200> and<00:00:27.649> what<00:00:28.009> we're

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
peak contraction loop and what we're

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.710 
peak contraction loop and what we're
going<00:00:28.189> to<00:00:28.279> use<00:00:28.430> for<00:00:28.640> this<00:00:28.759> one<00:00:28.970> is<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.570> low

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
going to use for this one is the low

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.780 
going to use for this one is the low
pulley<00:00:30.020> cable<00:00:30.529> on<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:30.980> cable<00:00:31.279> crossover

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
pulley cable on the cable crossover

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.490 
pulley cable on the cable crossover
station<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.660> we're<00:00:32.780> going<00:00:32.899> to<00:00:32.960> do<00:00:33.050> one<00:00:33.320> arm

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
station and we're going to do one arm

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.799 
station and we're going to do one arm
cable<00:00:33.980> curls<00:00:34.309> but<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.120> unique<00:00:35.390> twist<00:00:35.660> that

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
cable curls but the unique twist that

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.209 
cable curls but the unique twist that
we're<00:00:35.930> going<00:00:36.020> to<00:00:36.110> do<00:00:36.290> is<00:00:36.620> we're<00:00:36.800> going<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:36.950> face

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
we're going to do is we're going to face

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.340 
we're going to do is we're going to face
away<00:00:37.430> from<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:37.880> weight<00:00:38.090> stack<00:00:38.360> as<00:00:38.630> we<00:00:39.110> do<00:00:39.230> the

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
away from the weight stack as we do the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.860 
away from the weight stack as we do the
exercise<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.550> reason<00:00:40.850> for<00:00:41.000> this<00:00:41.120> is<00:00:41.630> when

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
exercise and the reason for this is when

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.439 
exercise and the reason for this is when
you<00:00:41.960> face<00:00:42.170> away<00:00:42.469> from<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.710> stack<00:00:43.040> you're<00:00:43.789> the

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
you face away from the stack you're the

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.729 
you face away from the stack you're the
pulley<00:00:44.839> is<00:00:44.960> actually<00:00:45.260> going<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.440> be<00:00:45.500> pulling

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
pulley is actually going to be pulling

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.889 
pulley is actually going to be pulling
your<00:00:45.890> arm<00:00:46.129> back<00:00:46.699> in<00:00:47.179> the<00:00:47.390> bottom<00:00:47.719> of<00:00:47.839> the

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
your arm back in the bottom of the

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.509 
your arm back in the bottom of the
exercise<00:00:48.379> so<00:00:48.949> you're<00:00:49.010> going<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.190> get<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:49.339> good

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
exercise so you're going to get a good

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:50.889 
exercise so you're going to get a good
stretch<00:00:49.910> throughout<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.359> bottom<00:00:50.660> of<00:00:50.780> the

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
stretch throughout the bottom of the

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.779 
stretch throughout the bottom of the
exercise<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.589> then<00:00:51.679> as<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:52.309> bring<00:00:52.489> your<00:00:52.640> arm

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
exercise and then as you bring your arm

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.759 
exercise and then as you bring your arm
up<00:00:52.969> for<00:00:52.999> a<00:00:53.179> peak<00:00:53.390> contraction<00:00:53.749> you<00:00:54.410> really<00:00:54.649> get

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
up for a peak contraction you really get

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.590 
up for a peak contraction you really get
the<00:00:54.859> tension<00:00:55.100> in<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.399> cables<00:00:55.789> right<00:00:56.329> up<00:00:56.449> to

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
the tension in the cables right up to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.750 
the tension in the cables right up to
the<00:00:56.719> top<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:57.499> it's<00:00:57.679> a<00:00:57.739> complete<00:00:58.100> contraction

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
the top so it's a complete contraction

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.970 
the top so it's a complete contraction
full<00:00:59.089> range<00:00:59.329> of<00:00:59.449> motion<00:00:59.600> full<00:01:00.230> stretch<00:01:00.530> full

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
full range of motion full stretch full

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.709 
full range of motion full stretch full
peak<00:01:01.190> contraction<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:01.820> it's<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.329> great<00:01:02.539> way<00:01:02.690> to

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
peak contraction and it's a great way to

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.750 
peak contraction and it's a great way to
finish<00:01:03.079> your<00:01:03.109> bicep<00:01:03.589> workouts<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.519> I'm<00:01:04.610> just

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
finish your bicep workouts so I'm just

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.040 
finish your bicep workouts so I'm just
going<00:01:04.879> to<00:01:04.909> demonstrate<00:01:05.089> here<00:01:07.720> this<00:01:08.720> one<00:01:08.930> you

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
going to demonstrate here this one you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.420 
going to demonstrate here this one you
don't<00:01:09.200> need<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.440> go<00:01:09.530> super<00:01:09.890> heavy<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.250> main

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
don't need to go super heavy the main

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.070 
don't need to go super heavy the main
thing<00:01:10.670> is<00:01:10.790> really<00:01:10.970> feeling<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.510> muscles<00:01:11.870> work

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
thing is really feeling the muscles work

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.190 
thing is really feeling the muscles work
and<00:01:12.440> contracting<00:01:12.950> as<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.159> do<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.430> exercise

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
and contracting as you do the exercise

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.260 
and contracting as you do the exercise
so<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.290> notice<00:01:15.590> I'm<00:01:15.770> standing<00:01:16.190> away<00:01:16.940> from<00:01:17.180> the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
so you notice I'm standing away from the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.910 
so you notice I'm standing away from the
cables<00:01:17.690> were<00:01:17.810> actually<00:01:18.140> pulling<00:01:18.380> my<00:01:18.560> arm

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
cables were actually pulling my arm

00:01:18.920 --> 00:02:21.550 
cables were actually pulling my arm
backwards

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.470 

okay<00:02:22.100> Patricia<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.610> gonna<00:02:22.760> jump<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.240> do<00:02:23.450> a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
okay Patricia is gonna jump in and do a

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.500 
okay Patricia is gonna jump in and do a
set<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:23.959> demonstrate<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.620> exercise<00:02:25.510> so

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
set and demonstrate the exercise so

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.120 
set and demonstrate the exercise so
again<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.900> notice<00:02:27.050> she's<00:02:27.380> standing<00:02:27.830> away

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
again you notice she's standing away

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.490 
again you notice she's standing away
from<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> cable<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.780> her<00:02:29.870> arm<00:02:30.020> gets<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> full

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
from the cable that her arm gets a full

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.640 
from the cable that her arm gets a full
stretch<00:02:30.770> in<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.040> bottom<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.410> full<00:02:33.410> peak

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
stretch in the bottom and full peak

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.730 
stretch in the bottom and full peak
contraction<00:02:33.950> at<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> top<00:02:35.500> another<00:02:36.500> good

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
contraction at the top another good

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.199 
contraction at the top another good
thing<00:02:36.770> about<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.190> exercise<00:02:37.520> is<00:02:37.730> where<00:02:38.090> it's

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
thing about this exercise is where it's

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.090 
thing about this exercise is where it's
a<00:02:38.239> single<00:02:38.450> limb<00:02:38.780> exercise<00:02:39.290> you're<00:02:39.800> working

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
a single limb exercise you're working

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.760 
a single limb exercise you're working
each<00:02:40.370> side<00:02:40.640> individually<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:42.440> helps<00:02:42.680> to

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
each side individually and this helps to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.590 
each side individually and this helps to
build<00:02:43.010> balance<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:43.760> proportion<00:02:43.880> between<00:02:44.420> the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
build balance and proportion between the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.960 
build balance and proportion between the
left<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.140> right<00:02:45.319> biceps<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.100> if<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:46.850> got

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
left and the right biceps so if you got

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.490 
left and the right biceps so if you got
one<00:02:47.150> arm<00:02:47.270> that's<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.600> bit<00:02:47.780> bigger<00:02:47.959> or<00:02:48.110> stronger

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
one arm that's a bit bigger or stronger

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.620 
one arm that's a bit bigger or stronger
than<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.830> other<00:02:48.980> one<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.730> doing<00:02:50.030> single<00:02:50.360> limb

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
than the other one and doing single limb

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.690
