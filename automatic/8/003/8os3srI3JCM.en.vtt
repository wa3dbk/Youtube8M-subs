moved on a bit since then we now use the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.360 
moved on a bit since then we now use the
equivalent<00:01:06.980> of<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.100> contents<00:01:07.700> of<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.720> bag

equivalent of the contents of the bag

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.430 
equivalent of the contents of the bag
okay<00:01:10.420> it's<00:01:11.420> just<00:01:11.570> like<00:01:12.350> fibrous<00:01:12.980> fluff<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.780> it

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
okay it's just like fibrous fluff and it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.820 
okay it's just like fibrous fluff and it
seems<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.860> hold<00:01:16.190> its<00:01:16.400> color<00:01:16.700> better

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
seems to hold its color better

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.319

the<00:01:18.830> trouble<00:01:19.159> with<00:01:19.250> sawdust<00:01:19.759> is<00:01:19.939> that<00:01:20.119> it

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
the trouble with sawdust is that it

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.710 
the trouble with sawdust is that it
fades<00:01:21.759> not<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:22.880> mention<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.299> it<00:01:23.509> looks

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
fades not to mention that it looks

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.600 
fades not to mention that it looks
nothing<00:01:23.930> really<00:01:24.320> like<00:01:24.650> grass<00:01:24.950> it's<00:01:25.280> just<00:01:25.490> sort

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
nothing really like grass it's just sort

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.520 
nothing really like grass it's just sort
of<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.820> colour<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.630> you're<00:01:29.810> sprinkling<00:01:30.170> it

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
of a colour and you're sprinkling it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.700 
of a colour and you're sprinkling it
rather<00:01:30.710> than<00:01:30.950> placing<00:01:31.280> it<00:01:31.960> yeah<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:33.259> mean<00:01:33.409> it<00:01:33.530> is

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
rather than placing it yeah I mean it is

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.249 
rather than placing it yeah I mean it is
like<00:01:34.180> it's<00:01:35.180> not<00:01:35.270> really<00:01:35.509> a<00:01:35.540> powder

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
like it's not really a powder

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.429 
like it's not really a powder
it's<00:01:36.890> like<00:01:37.329> fibrous<00:01:38.329> okay<00:01:41.200> so<00:01:42.200> like<00:01:42.350> if<00:01:42.409> you

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
it's like fibrous okay so like if you

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.370 
it's like fibrous okay so like if you
teased<00:01:42.799> out<00:01:43.040> cotton<00:01:43.520> more<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.990> might<00:01:45.200> get

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
teased out cotton more you might get

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.649 
teased out cotton more you might get
something<00:01:46.210> vaguely<00:01:47.210> similar<00:01:47.689> I<00:01:48.200> think<00:01:48.530> it's<00:01:48.920> a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
something vaguely similar I think it's a

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.340 
something vaguely similar I think it's a
man-made<00:01:50.659> so<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:51.829> it's<00:01:52.430> I<00:01:52.930> think<00:01:53.930> it's<00:01:54.229> like

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
man-made so it's it's I think it's like

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.690 
man-made so it's it's I think it's like
a<00:01:54.380> nylon<00:01:55.600> right<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.320> this<00:01:57.829> lump<00:01:58.100> sled<00:01:58.520> that

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
a nylon right and this lump sled that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.399 
a nylon right and this lump sled that
you're<00:01:58.880> leaving<00:01:59.210> in<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.570> thought<00:01:59.869> just<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.229> give

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
you're leaving in I thought just to give

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.580 
you're leaving in I thought just to give
it<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.829> different<00:02:01.070> level<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:01.969> glass<00:02:02.590> no

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
it a different level on the glass no

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.469 
it a different level on the glass no
that's<00:02:03.890> just<00:02:04.009> me<00:02:04.280> being<00:02:04.460> careless<00:02:04.820> more<00:02:05.329> than

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
that's just me being careless more than

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.999 
that's just me being careless more than
anything<00:02:05.659> else<00:02:05.899> is<00:02:06.049> very<00:02:06.110> difficult<00:02:06.770> to

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
anything else is very difficult to

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.190 
anything else is very difficult to
sprinkle<00:02:07.610> it

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
sprinkle it

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.270 
sprinkle it
very<00:02:09.830> very<00:02:10.690> nice<00:02:11.690> um<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.650> we'll<00:02:12.860> get<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.040> few

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
very very nice um so we'll get a few

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.070 
very very nice um so we'll get a few
lumps<00:02:13.520> it's<00:02:13.760> okay<00:02:14.090> what<00:02:14.239> we<00:02:14.360> do<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:14.870> just

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
lumps it's okay what we do is we just

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.839 
lumps it's okay what we do is we just
move<00:02:15.290> them<00:02:15.530> around<00:02:15.650> once<00:02:16.130> I've<00:02:16.370> got<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.670> main

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
move them around once I've got the main

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.339 
move them around once I've got the main
bulk<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:18.610> afterwards<00:02:19.610> we<00:02:19.959> are<00:02:20.959> going<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.200> add

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
bulk in afterwards we are going to add

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.890 
bulk in afterwards we are going to add
in<00:02:21.530> some<00:02:21.770> other<00:02:21.980> colors<00:02:22.690> with<00:02:23.690> these<00:02:24.590> powders

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
in some other colors with these powders

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.760 
in some other colors with these powders

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.140 
like well I can think of several things
that<00:02:53.480> would<00:02:53.690> be<00:02:53.870> last<00:02:54.049> to<00:02:54.260> smell<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.620> mmm<00:02:55.310> but

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
that would be last to smell of mmm but

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.789 
that would be last to smell of mmm but
now<00:02:56.299> you<00:02:56.360> see<00:02:56.569> these<00:02:56.690> lumps<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.410> pointed

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
now you see these lumps that you pointed

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.539 
now you see these lumps that you pointed
out<00:02:57.890> we<00:02:57.950> just<00:02:58.100> sort<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.549> move<00:02:59.180> them<00:02:59.450> around<00:02:59.600> a

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
out we just sort of move them around a

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.530 
out we just sort of move them around a
little<00:03:01.549> bit<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.790> don't<00:03:01.910> want<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.180> put<00:03:02.330> too

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
little bit you don't want to put too

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.789 
little bit you don't want to put too
much<00:03:02.690> pressure<00:03:02.989> on<00:03:03.170> otherwise<00:03:03.530> you'd<00:03:03.680> just

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
much pressure on otherwise you'd just

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.680 
much pressure on otherwise you'd just
end<00:03:04.010> up<00:03:04.190> with<00:03:04.310> paint<00:03:04.640> all<00:03:04.910> over<00:03:04.940> your<00:03:05.239> fingers

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
end up with paint all over your fingers

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.820 
end up with paint all over your fingers
in<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.870> huge<00:03:06.170> mess<00:03:07.630> which<00:03:08.630> is<00:03:08.780> sort<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.049> gently

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
in a huge mess which is sort of gently

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.690 
in a huge mess which is sort of gently
brushing<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:11.860> it's<00:03:12.860> difficult<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.459> describe

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
brushing it it's difficult to describe

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.039 
brushing it it's difficult to describe
it's<00:03:14.030> one<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.269> those<00:03:14.329> things<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:14.930> just

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
it's one of those things that you just

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.699 
it's one of those things that you just
sort<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:16.489> do<00:03:16.760> based<00:03:17.239> on<00:03:17.420> experience<00:03:18.290> of

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
sort of you do based on experience of

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.960 
sort of you do based on experience of
having<00:03:19.190> done<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.640> before<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.060> what<00:03:20.420> worked

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
having done it before and what worked

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.430 
having done it before and what worked
what<00:03:22.970> works<00:03:23.239> for<00:03:23.359> one<00:03:23.480> person<00:03:24.079> might<00:03:24.290> not

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
what works for one person might not

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.780 
what works for one person might not
necessarily<00:03:26.680> well<00:03:27.680> we'll<00:03:27.950> leave<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.340> and

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
necessarily well we'll leave it that and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:39.490 
necessarily well we'll leave it that and
we'll<00:03:28.880> come<00:03:29.060> back<00:03:29.269> when<00:03:29.450> it's<00:03:29.630> all<00:03:29.780> done

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.560
