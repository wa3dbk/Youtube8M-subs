alright<00:00:33.000> guys<00:00:33.149> now<00:00:33.180> we're<00:00:33.420> gonna<00:00:33.510> go<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> little

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
alright guys now we're gonna go a little

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.510 
alright guys now we're gonna go a little
bit<00:00:33.930> further<00:00:34.140> into<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> wiring<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.399> can

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
bit further into the wiring as you can

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.310 
bit further into the wiring as you can
see<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.030> got<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> 12<00:00:36.450> volt<00:00:36.660> relay<00:00:36.989> with

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
see here we got the 12 volt relay with

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.560 
see here we got the 12 volt relay with
an<00:00:37.410> inline<00:00:37.710> fuse<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.790> envelope<00:00:39.180> fuse<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
an inline fuse that envelope fuse is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.639 
an inline fuse that envelope fuse is
going<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.750> route<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> positive<00:00:40.620> battery

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
