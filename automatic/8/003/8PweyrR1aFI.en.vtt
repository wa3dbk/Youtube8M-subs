it's<00:00:24.920> a<00:00:25.040> snap<00:00:25.330> hi<00:00:26.330> I'm<00:00:26.720> Jim<00:00:27.050> step<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.619> inventor

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
it's a snap hi I'm Jim step the inventor

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.430 
it's a snap hi I'm Jim step the inventor
of<00:00:28.039> the<00:00:28.250> stepladder<00:00:28.539> I'd<00:00:29.539> like<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.900> give<00:00:30.289> you<00:00:30.410> a

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
of the stepladder I'd like to give you a

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.729 
of the stepladder I'd like to give you a
demonstration<00:00:31.100> of<00:00:31.430> how<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:31.699> system<00:00:31.910> works

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
demonstration of how this system works

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.560 
demonstration of how this system works
if<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:34.309> bow<00:00:34.610> hunt<00:00:34.910> if<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:35.600> gun<00:00:35.989> hunt<00:00:36.260> if<00:00:36.500> you

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
if you bow hunt if you gun hunt if you

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.650 
if you bow hunt if you gun hunt if you
photograph<00:00:38.570> wildlife<00:00:39.170> if<00:00:39.769> you<00:00:40.730> have<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.030> reason

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
photograph wildlife if you have a reason

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.080 
photograph wildlife if you have a reason
for<00:00:41.870> climbing<00:00:42.320> into<00:00:42.470> a<00:00:42.590> tree<00:00:43.070> any<00:00:43.340> place<00:00:43.700> this

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
for climbing into a tree any place this

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.930 
for climbing into a tree any place this
is<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.329> system<00:00:44.840> for<00:00:44.870> you<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:46.040> goes<00:00:46.640> on<00:00:46.910> very

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
is the system for you it goes on very

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.750 
is the system for you it goes on very
easily<00:00:47.480> it<00:00:47.870> does<00:00:48.140> not<00:00:48.350> damage<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:49.010> tree<00:00:49.280> it<00:00:49.520> is

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
easily it does not damage the tree it is

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.819 
easily it does not damage the tree it is
very<00:00:50.360> very<00:00:50.719> secure<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.610> is<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.790> only<00:00:53.000> system

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
very very secure it is the only system

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.610 
very very secure it is the only system
that<00:00:54.829> allows<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:56.090> user<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.930> stress<00:00:57.290> test

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
that allows you the user to stress test

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.580 
that allows you the user to stress test
your<00:00:57.829> cord<00:00:58.360> before<00:00:59.360> you<00:00:59.750> step<00:01:00.050> on<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.410> rung

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
your cord before you step on the rung

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.920 
your cord before you step on the rung
you<00:01:01.190> exert<00:01:01.579> more<00:01:01.850> force<00:01:01.910> in<00:01:02.600> in<00:01:03.289> the<00:01:03.829> retainer

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
you exert more force in in the retainer

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.469 
you exert more force in in the retainer
during<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.080> locking<00:01:06.470> process<00:01:07.090> than<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:08.240> do

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
during the locking process than you do

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.810 
during the locking process than you do
when<00:01:08.690> you<00:01:08.810> stand<00:01:09.140> on<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:09.410> that<00:01:10.100> means<00:01:10.430> if<00:01:10.700> you

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
when you stand on it that means if you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.960 
when you stand on it that means if you
have<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.420> retainer<00:01:12.020> that's<00:01:12.770> weak<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:13.729> will

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
have a a retainer that's weak it will

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.359 
have a a retainer that's weak it will
break<00:01:14.179> during<00:01:14.509> that<00:01:14.810> camming<00:01:15.259> process<00:01:15.800> not

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
break during that camming process not

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.850 
break during that camming process not
when<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:16.729> stand<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:17.209> it<00:01:17.350> one<00:01:18.350> of<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.530> really

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
when you stand on it one of the really

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.980 
when you stand on it one of the really
neat<00:01:19.039> things<00:01:19.069> about<00:01:19.580> this<00:01:19.850> is<00:01:20.300> that<00:01:20.450> it's<00:01:20.899> an

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
neat things about this is that it's an

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.710 
neat things about this is that it's an
inline<00:01:21.380> configuration<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.209> to<00:01:23.360> say<00:01:23.569> it's

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
inline configuration that is to say it's

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.719 
inline configuration that is to say it's
exactly<00:01:24.229> like<00:01:24.319> a<00:01:24.500> ladder<00:01:24.830> it<00:01:25.369> gives<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:25.700> a

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
exactly like a ladder it gives you a

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.559 
exactly like a ladder it gives you a
horizontal<00:01:26.479> rung<00:01:26.899> that<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.380> can<00:01:27.560> hang<00:01:27.770> on<00:01:27.800> to

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
horizontal rung that you can hang on to

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.029 
horizontal rung that you can hang on to
and<00:01:29.569> it<00:01:29.750> gives<00:01:29.929> you<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.110> place<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.440> put<00:01:30.830> both

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
and it gives you a place to put both

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.580 
and it gives you a place to put both
your<00:01:31.069> feet<00:01:31.340> at<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.759> same<00:01:31.789> time<00:01:32.270> again<00:01:32.959> exactly

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
your feet at the same time again exactly

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.350 
your feet at the same time again exactly
like<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:33.800> ladder

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
like a ladder

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.389 
like a ladder
another<00:01:35.360> advantage<00:01:35.810> over<00:01:36.080> typical<00:01:37.009> ladders

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
another advantage over typical ladders

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.180 
another advantage over typical ladders
is<00:01:37.580> that<00:01:37.970> each<00:01:38.149> rung<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.660> fastened<00:01:39.289> directly

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
is that each rung is fastened directly

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.900 
is that each rung is fastened directly
to<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.490> tree<00:01:40.789> so<00:01:41.440> it's<00:01:42.440> every<00:01:43.310> rung<00:01:43.550> is<00:01:43.759> as

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
to the tree so it's every rung is as

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.550 
to the tree so it's every rung is as
solid<00:01:44.090> as<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.450> tree<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:44.990> you're<00:01:45.110> putting<00:01:45.440> it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
solid as the tree that you're putting it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.889 
solid as the tree that you're putting it
on<00:01:45.649> there<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:46.340> no<00:01:46.520> there's<00:01:47.060> no<00:01:47.270> twisting

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
on there is no there's no twisting

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.529 
on there is no there's no twisting
there's<00:01:48.200> no<00:01:48.759> bouncing<00:01:49.759> there's<00:01:50.000> there's<00:01:50.330> none

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
there's no bouncing there's there's none

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:51.850 
there's no bouncing there's there's none
of<00:01:50.690> those<00:01:50.780> things<00:01:51.080> that<00:01:51.319> we<00:01:51.470> typically

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
of those things that we typically

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.680 
of those things that we typically
associate<00:01:52.489> with<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.729> ladder<00:01:53.030> involved<00:01:53.569> with

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
associate with a ladder involved with

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.660 
associate with a ladder involved with
these<00:01:53.869> they're<00:01:54.410> every<00:01:54.770> bit<00:01:54.950> as<00:01:55.069> solid<00:01:55.429> as<00:01:55.550> the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
these they're every bit as solid as the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.699 
these they're every bit as solid as the
tree<00:01:55.849> that<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.149> put<00:01:56.360> them<00:01:56.509> on<00:01:56.660> if<00:01:57.470> for<00:01:57.679> some

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
tree that you put them on if for some

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.979 
tree that you put them on if for some
reason<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:58.610> want<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.030> reposition<00:01:59.539> one<00:01:59.869> of

00:01:59.979 --> 00:01:59.989 
reason you you want to reposition one of

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:01.690 
reason you you want to reposition one of
these<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.470> very<00:02:00.679> very<00:02:00.920> easy<00:02:01.130> thing<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.489> do

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
these it's a very very easy thing to do

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.150 
these it's a very very easy thing to do
you<00:02:01.849> just<00:02:02.030> unlock<00:02:02.239> it<00:02:02.509> move<00:02:03.410> it<00:02:03.560> wherever<00:02:03.739> it's

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
you just unlock it move it wherever it's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.370 
you just unlock it move it wherever it's
more<00:02:04.399> in<00:02:05.060> line<00:02:05.119> with<00:02:05.390> where<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.929> want<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.259> go

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
more in line with where you want to go

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.630 
more in line with where you want to go
and<00:02:06.619> lock<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.950> back<00:02:07.099> down<00:02:07.310> again

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
and lock it back down again

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.260 
and lock it back down again
simple<00:02:08.360> as<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:09.429> can<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.819> shift<00:02:11.060> these

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
simple as that I can I can shift these

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.479 
simple as that I can I can shift these
around<00:02:11.569> for<00:02:11.870> instance<00:02:12.590> if<00:02:12.739> we<00:02:12.770> decided<00:02:13.370> we

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
around for instance if we decided we

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.490 
around for instance if we decided we
wanted<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.970> stand<00:02:14.270> over<00:02:14.630> here<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.200> wanted

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
wanted the stand over here but we wanted

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.110 
wanted the stand over here but we wanted
this<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.830> come<00:02:15.860> up<00:02:16.099> on<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.430> side<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.849> stand

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
this to come up on the side of the stand

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.990

system<00:03:54.989> here<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.560> with<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.190> system<00:03:56.609> I<00:03:56.730> can

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
system here and with this system I can

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.110 
system here and with this system I can
put<00:03:57.239> up<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.599> 16<00:03:58.290> foot<00:03:58.620> high<00:03:58.769> tree<00:03:59.190> stands<00:03:59.609> the

put up to 16 foot high tree stands the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.300 
put up to 16 foot high tree stands the
beauty<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.199> can<00:04:01.440> have<00:04:01.590> one<00:04:01.799> stand<00:04:02.099> for

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
beauty of it is I can have one stand for

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.860 
beauty of it is I can have one stand for
morning<00:04:02.609> hunting<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.150> once<00:04:03.389> stand<00:04:03.690> for

these things come on go on and come off
the<00:04:07.620> tree<00:04:07.829> so<00:04:08.099> easily<00:04:08.430> it's<00:04:08.970> no<00:04:09.209> problem<00:04:09.510> for

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
the tree so easily it's no problem for

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.689 
the tree so easily it's no problem for
me<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.930> remove<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.410> bottom<00:04:10.560> four<00:04:10.980> I<00:04:11.190> can<00:04:11.549> leave

me to remove the bottom four I can leave
the<00:04:11.910> top<00:04:12.120> steps<00:04:12.510> up<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.750> hardest<00:04:13.230> ones<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.470> get

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
the top steps up the hardest ones to get

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.559 
the top steps up the hardest ones to get
up<00:04:13.709> plus<00:04:13.919> the<00:04:13.949> tree<00:04:14.220> stand<00:04:14.609> nobody<00:04:15.120> can<00:04:15.269> get<00:04:15.389> at

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
up plus the tree stand nobody can get at

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.659 
up plus the tree stand nobody can get at
them<00:04:15.690> but<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.079> get<00:04:16.380> right<00:04:16.530> back<00:04:16.680> up<00:04:16.739> there<00:04:17.220> let

me show you how easy this comes off the

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.560 
me show you how easy this comes off the
tree<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:19.739> just<00:04:19.919> lift<00:04:20.130> up<00:04:20.310> it's<00:04:20.639> off<00:04:20.849> but<00:04:21.419> what

tree you just lift up it's off but what
about<00:04:21.780> this<00:04:21.989> knot<00:04:22.199> we<00:04:22.410> made<00:04:22.620> well<00:04:23.120> fortunately

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
about this knot we made well fortunately

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.730 
about this knot we made well fortunately
for<00:04:24.300> us<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.630> not<00:04:24.780> really<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.110> not<00:04:25.289> at<00:04:25.470> all<00:04:25.560> it's

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
for us it's not really a not at all it's

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.310 
for us it's not really a not at all it's
sort<00:04:25.949> of<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.070> slip<00:04:26.310> jam<00:04:26.639> job<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.169> really

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
sort of a slip jam job and it really

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.080 
sort of a slip jam job and it really
does<00:04:28.560> come<00:04:28.770> off<00:04:28.860> easy<00:04:29.130> every<00:04:29.550> single<00:04:29.880> time

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
does come off easy every single time

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.940 
does come off easy every single time
okay<00:04:30.510> so<00:04:30.570> now<00:04:30.840> we<00:04:30.900> want<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.289> put<00:04:31.469> it<00:04:31.560> back<00:04:31.680> on

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
okay so now we want to put it back on

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.070 
okay so now we want to put it back on
watch<00:04:32.219> this<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> few<00:04:32.640> easy<00:04:32.940> steps<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.810> first

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
watch this a few easy steps the first

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.740 
watch this a few easy steps the first
thing<00:04:34.289> we<00:04:34.409> do<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:34.740> come<00:04:34.950> through<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.400> V<00:04:35.610> then<00:04:36.599> I

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
thing we do is come through the V then I

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.150 
thing we do is come through the V then I
come<00:04:36.960> up<00:04:36.990> under<00:04:37.469> the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
come up under the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.200 
come up under the
and<00:04:39.090> over<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.509> top<00:04:39.720> bar<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.860> then<00:04:41.819> finally

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
and over the top bar and then finally

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.749 
and over the top bar and then finally
down<00:04:42.389> through<00:04:42.629> this<00:04:42.750> loop<00:04:43.340> now<00:04:44.340> I've<00:04:44.460> got<00:04:44.669> her

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
down through this loop now I've got her

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.999 
down through this loop now I've got her
on<00:04:44.910> there<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.360> just<00:04:45.960> need<00:04:46.319> to<00:04:46.470> tighten<00:04:46.680> up<00:04:46.830> my

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
on there I just need to tighten up my

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.909 
on there I just need to tighten up my
rope<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.340> little<00:04:47.550> bit<00:04:48.289> there<00:04:49.289> she<00:04:49.500> is

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
rope a little bit there she is

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.649 
rope a little bit there she is
then<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.550> next<00:04:50.789> thing<00:04:50.879> I<00:04:51.000> need<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.210> remember

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
then the next thing I need to remember

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.390 
then the next thing I need to remember
is<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:51.960> these<00:04:52.169> points<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:52.740> this<00:04:52.860> step<00:04:53.129> have

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
is that these points in this step have

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.309 
is that these points in this step have
to<00:04:53.550> be<00:04:53.669> just<00:04:53.879> about<00:04:54.060> even<00:04:54.270> with<00:04:54.659> the<00:04:54.720> rope<00:04:54.960> so<00:04:55.229> I

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
to be just about even with the rope so I

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.760 
to be just about even with the rope so I
lift<00:04:55.590> up<00:04:55.770> once<00:04:56.669> I<00:04:56.819> lift<00:04:57.000> her<00:04:57.210> up<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.560> can

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
lift up once I lift her up and I can

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.730 
lift up once I lift her up and I can
snap<00:04:59.490> her<00:04:59.669> in<00:04:59.789> place<00:05:00.060> now<00:05:01.020> if<00:05:01.199> I<00:05:01.349> can<00:05:01.590> do<00:05:01.710> that

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
snap her in place now if I can do that

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.740 
snap her in place now if I can do that
tell<00:05:02.699> you<00:05:02.819> you<00:05:02.970> can<00:05:03.150> do<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.300> too

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.779 

did<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:06.840> hear<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.050> sound<00:05:07.409> that<00:05:07.740> was<00:05:08.669> the

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
did you hear that sound that was the

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.360 
did you hear that sound that was the
sound<00:05:09.000> of<00:05:09.210> safety<00:05:09.690> that<00:05:10.620> was<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.800> sound<00:05:11.099> of<00:05:11.280> a

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
sound of safety that was a sound of a

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.520 
sound of safety that was a sound of a
breakthrough<00:05:11.669> in<00:05:12.030> three<00:05:12.240> steps<00:05:12.479> walking<00:05:13.349> in

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
breakthrough in three steps walking in

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.100 
breakthrough in three steps walking in
so<00:05:14.220> we<00:05:14.310> can't<00:05:14.550> go<00:05:14.699> anywhere<00:05:14.909> and<00:05:15.270> yet<00:05:15.900> it's

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
so we can't go anywhere and yet it's

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.770 
so we can't go anywhere and yet it's
totally<00:05:16.680> legal<00:05:16.889> doesn't<00:05:17.699> fix<00:05:18.030> to<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.360> tree<00:05:18.569> in

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
totally legal doesn't fix to the tree in
