technical was avoiding every Supercross

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.060 
technical was avoiding every Supercross
tracks<00:01:17.759> technical<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.470> looks<00:01:19.650> easy<00:01:19.860> on

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
tracks technical it just looks easy on

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.950 
tracks technical it just looks easy on
TV<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.240> when<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.720> down<00:01:21.900> here

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
TV but it's not when you get down here

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960 
TV but it's not when you get down here
and<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:22.439> phoenix<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.340> weekend<00:01:23.700> we've<00:01:23.850> got

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and then phoenix this weekend we've got

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.880 
and then phoenix this weekend we've got
some<00:01:24.150> monster<00:01:24.990> loops<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.530> they're<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.799> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
some monster loops so they're going to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.740 
some monster loops so they're going to
be<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> challenge<00:01:26.460> tonight<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
be a challenge tonight I think this

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.569 
be a challenge tonight I think this
track<00:01:28.020> overall<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.650> much<00:01:28.860> more<00:01:29.040> technical

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
track overall is much more technical

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.679 
track overall is much more technical
than<00:01:29.759> last<00:01:30.210> weekend<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.869> nothing<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:31.650> is

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
than last weekend so nothing really is

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
than last weekend so nothing really is
surprising<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.720> me<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.140> everything's<00:01:34.979> just

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
surprising to me here everything's just
