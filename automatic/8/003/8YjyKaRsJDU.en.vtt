 lollipops, lollipops, o, stick, stick, stick, 

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.863
 lollipops, lollipops, o, stick, stick, stick, 

00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:08.647
 lollipops, lollipops, o, stick, stick, 

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:09.789
 lollipops, lollipops 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.187
 (exciting music) 

00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:12.223
 (lollipops shout) (cracks) 

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:13.202
 Ba, stupid, stupid, stupid 

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:15.092
 Not cool, man. 

00:00:15.092 --> 00:00:17.977
 (spot) Whatever. Cupcake. 

00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:19.766
 Don't call my Cupcake. 

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.351
 Fine. Muffin. 

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:22.956
 Don't call me Muffin. 

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.435
 FINE, GREAT CHRISTMAS. 

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:27.388
 Wait what? 

00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:29.476
 Ba, stupid, stupid, stupid 

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:30.796
 (Laughs) 

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.564
 - Yo, Orange, do you want to play Minecraft? 

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.250
 Not now, Little Apple. 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.937
 It seems to be a very busy day. 

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:38.273
 I don't even have time to make a brief joke on your costs. 

00:00:38.273 --> 00:00:40.284
 Wiea, you're really beaten. 

00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:42.580
 Yes, will probably have to overshoot the title card as well. 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.819
 (exciting music) 

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:46.623
 HEY, WHAT PLEASE I SAY ABOUT THE TITLE CARD ?! (Grom) 

00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:48.269
 [Vote over] Ow, my leg! - It's better. 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.017
 Now where was I? 

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:52.114
 [Vote over] You have an 11 hour meeting with - 

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:53.374
 APPEAL! 

00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:55.182
 [Vote over] Haha, very funny. 

00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:57.173
 What do you mean? I'm talking about Apple here. 

00:00:57.173 --> 00:00:58.311
 Hello, Orange. 

00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:00.871
 Hello, keep in the mud. (Laughs) 

00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:02.801
 No! 

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.889
 I think I was wrong about the mud. (Laughs) 

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:10.237
 (laughs) It doesn't look good to me, is it? 

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.065
 (exciting music) - But don't worry, caramel, 

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:13.223
 I'll never forget you. 

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:16.779
 Actually, it's a caramel! (Caramel shouts) 

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:17.856
 Meh, whatever. 

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:19.765
 Hey, hey, nice sausage roll, hey! 

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:22.000
 You have to talk to me. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.890
 Because I am Bockwurst! 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.836
 And I am his brother Knackwurst. 

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.075
 And we're here 

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:29.127
 [Both] get you up. 

00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:30.914
 Yes, I didn't know we had a sausage 

00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:33.170
 party today. (Laughs) 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.486
 But why does he laugh at us? 

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:37.517
 Probably because you're just talking to me. 

00:01:37.517 --> 00:01:39.488
 (talk gibberish) 

00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:43.511
 No, you're talking like me. You even grow like me. 

00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:48.511
 (talk gibberish) 

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:01.403
 Sorry, I just cleaned my throat. 

00:02:01.403 --> 00:02:03.475
 What I meant was grill! 

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:08.475
 (talk gibberish again) 

00:02:10.517 --> 00:02:13.930
 I hate it when the worm comes strangling. (Laughs) 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.393
 Hey, hey, Pudding Pop, what's going on there 

00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:16.490
 Center, James Brown? 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.400
 Oh, not much, Orange. 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.696
 (exciting music) What did you work for? 

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:21.549
 Grill! 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.551
 Why would you put a nice pudding doll on a grill? 

00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:27.949
 Why?!? !!?!? !!? !!? 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.070
 Yes, I have to say I also struggle with that. 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.137
 So, that's wisdom you're looking for. 

00:02:34.057 --> 00:02:36.657
 Maybe you should look inside. 

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:38.688
 Yes, and maybe you should look out for shopping malls. 

00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:39.995
 Huh? 

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:43.747
 Oh, how thoughtful. Cookie wrote me a little note. 

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.820
 Soon you will run out of jokes. 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.669
 I wonder what that means. 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.371
 Hello, friend, can you tell me where 

00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:53.865
 To find the fridge? (Laughs) 

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:57.400
 Beat me, last I heard, it was going on. (Laughs) 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.838
 Very good thank you. 

00:02:59.838 --> 00:03:04.172
 No problem, you can of ... 

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:05.832
 you know things 

00:03:05.832 --> 00:03:07.498
 Foam, non-dairy dessert topping, 

00:03:07.498 --> 00:03:10.281
 but all my friends call me whipped cream. 

00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:11.947
 Yes, I bet they do. 

00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:13.613
 And how. 

00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:15.909
 (Laughs) 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.860
 Dude, what's up? 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.030
 It's just a long day. I'm not out of jokes, okay? 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.056
 OMG. The fortune cookie was right. 

00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:26.474
 No, I have something for that, just wait. 

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:30.056
 About, about, about ... 

00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:35.041
 (dramatic music) 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.073
 Forget about this. (Spit) 

00:03:40.073 --> 00:03:43.304
 Wiea! 

00:03:43.304 --> 00:03:48.267
 (positive music)
