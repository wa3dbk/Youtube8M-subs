hi<00:00:03.310> this<00:00:03.759> is<00:00:03.909> a<00:00:03.940> design<00:00:04.630> for<00:00:04.960> a<00:00:05.020> love<00:00:05.440> spoon

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:05.770 
hi this is a design for a love spoon

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.060 
hi this is a design for a love spoon
that<00:00:06.040> I've<00:00:07.019> actually<00:00:08.019> been<00:00:08.230> admiring<00:00:08.679> for

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
that I've actually been admiring for

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.629 
that I've actually been admiring for
quite<00:00:09.250> some<00:00:09.490> time<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.980> always<00:00:11.980> been<00:00:12.340> kind<00:00:12.580> of

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
quite some time and always been kind of

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.490 
quite some time and always been kind of
afraid<00:00:12.760> to<00:00:13.000> try<00:00:13.360> it<00:00:13.389> because<00:00:13.900> it's<00:00:14.110> very

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
afraid to try it because it's very

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.390 
afraid to try it because it's very
delicate<00:00:15.340> and<00:00:15.820> fragile<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.710> I<00:00:18.010> was<00:00:18.160> kind<00:00:18.369> of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
delicate and fragile and I was kind of

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.189 
delicate and fragile and I was kind of
thought<00:00:18.550> it<00:00:18.670> was<00:00:18.789> you<00:00:19.270> know<00:00:19.390> a<00:00:19.660> little<00:00:20.020> too

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
thought it was you know a little too

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.410 
thought it was you know a little too
hard<00:00:20.410> for<00:00:20.560> me<00:00:20.710> but<00:00:21.000> I'm<00:00:22.000> going<00:00:22.150> to<00:00:22.180> give<00:00:22.300> this

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
hard for me but I'm going to give this

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.140 
hard for me but I'm going to give this
one<00:00:22.480> a<00:00:22.630> try<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:24.340> I've<00:00:24.460> decided<00:00:24.699> to<00:00:24.850> make<00:00:25.029> this

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
one a try and I've decided to make this

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.470 
one a try and I've decided to make this
one<00:00:25.359> out<00:00:25.510> of<00:00:26.130> walnut<00:00:27.130> I<00:00:27.550> had<00:00:27.970> a<00:00:28.000> nice<00:00:28.210> piece

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
one out of walnut I had a nice piece

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.439 
one out of walnut I had a nice piece
here<00:00:28.779> so<00:00:29.619> I<00:00:29.650> got<00:00:29.859> a<00:00:29.890> pattern<00:00:30.160> and<00:00:30.550> I<00:00:31.150> glued<00:00:31.420> it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
here so I got a pattern and I glued it

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.419 
here so I got a pattern and I glued it
on<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:32.019> a<00:00:32.050> piece<00:00:33.039> about<00:00:33.609> a<00:00:33.670> one-inch<00:00:34.089> thick<00:00:34.510> and

00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:35.429 
on to a piece about a one-inch thick and

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:41.250 
on to a piece about a one-inch thick and
I've<00:00:36.429> already<00:00:36.729> cut<00:00:37.149> out<00:00:39.659> the<00:00:40.659> pattern<00:00:40.839> on<00:00:41.229> the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
I've already cut out the pattern on the

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.119 
I've already cut out the pattern on the
scroll<00:00:41.620> saw

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
scroll saw

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.949 
scroll saw
so<00:00:42.789> roughed<00:00:43.149> it<00:00:43.269> out<00:00:43.420> I<00:00:45.269> basically<00:00:46.269> just<00:00:46.569> you

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:46.959 
so roughed it out I basically just you

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:49.860 
so roughed it out I basically just you
know<00:00:47.079> I<00:00:47.109> took<00:00:47.679> the<00:00:47.799> pattern<00:00:48.129> I<00:00:48.449> sized<00:00:49.449> it<00:00:49.690> to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
know I took the pattern I sized it to

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.809 
know I took the pattern I sized it to
something<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:50.559> you<00:00:50.979> know<00:00:51.100> that<00:00:51.429> I<00:00:51.459> wanted<00:00:51.760> to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:51.819 
something that you know that I wanted to

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:55.559 
something that you know that I wanted to
work<00:00:52.120> with<00:00:52.149> and<00:00:52.629> then<00:00:53.729> cut<00:00:54.729> that<00:00:54.879> out<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.510> I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569 
work with and then cut that out and I

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:57.329 
work with and then cut that out and I
use<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.839> little<00:00:55.959> rubber<00:00:56.199> cement<00:00:56.499> and<00:00:57.159> glued

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
use the little rubber cement and glued

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.969 
use the little rubber cement and glued
it<00:00:57.459> on<00:00:57.579> to<00:00:57.789> my<00:00:57.969> wood<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:59.109> then<00:00:59.559> what<00:00:59.679> I<00:00:59.709> did<00:00:59.829> was

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
it on to my wood and then what I did was

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.049 
it on to my wood and then what I did was
after<00:01:00.609> cutting<00:01:00.879> out<00:01:01.209> the<00:01:02.639> little<00:01:03.639> detailed

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
after cutting out the little detailed

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.139 
after cutting out the little detailed
parts<00:01:04.420> here<00:01:04.780> with<00:01:05.469> the<00:01:05.590> scroll<00:01:05.799> saw<00:01:05.859> I<00:01:06.310> took<00:01:07.060> it

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
parts here with the scroll saw I took it

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:08.789 
parts here with the scroll saw I took it
up<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.420> bandsaw<00:01:07.899> and<00:01:08.109> I<00:01:08.229> cut<00:01:08.469> it<00:01:08.560> in<00:01:08.619> half

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
up to the bandsaw and I cut it in half

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:16.679 
up to the bandsaw and I cut it in half
now<00:01:09.460> what<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:09.670> did<00:01:09.909> was<00:01:09.939> I<00:01:15.180> can't<00:01:16.180> really<00:01:16.359> see<00:01:16.600> it

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
now what I did was I can't really see it

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.270 
now what I did was I can't really see it
but<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.200> cut<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.530> bottom<00:01:17.649> part<00:01:17.829> a<00:01:18.070> little

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
but I cut the bottom part a little

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.700 
but I cut the bottom part a little
thicker<00:01:18.520> than<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.719> top<00:01:19.960> part<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.259> want<00:01:20.439> the<00:01:20.530> top

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
thicker than the top part I want the top

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.950 
thicker than the top part I want the top
part<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.039> be<00:01:21.159> about<00:01:21.340> 1/4<00:01:21.670> so<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.750> these<00:01:22.899> are

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
part to be about 1/4 so that these are

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.160 
part to be about 1/4 so that these are
actually<00:01:23.890> round<00:01:24.159> and<00:01:24.549> not<00:01:24.820> oblong<00:01:25.299> and<00:01:25.539> then

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
actually round and not oblong and then

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.959 
actually round and not oblong and then
the<00:01:26.320> bottom<00:01:26.590> part<00:01:26.619> will<00:01:27.219> be<00:01:27.369> a<00:01:27.399> very<00:01:27.670> shallow

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
the bottom part will be a very shallow

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.419 
the bottom part will be a very shallow
spoon<00:01:28.509> on<00:01:28.689> this<00:01:28.869> one<00:01:29.079> I<00:01:29.289> did<00:01:30.189> a<00:01:30.219> little

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
spoon on this one I did a little

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.880 
spoon on this one I did a little
rounding<00:01:31.299> here<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.899> started<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.469> ease<00:01:32.649> it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
rounding here and I started to ease it

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.459 
rounding here and I started to ease it
into<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.990> body<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.109> then<00:01:35.229> what<00:01:35.380> I'll

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
into the body and then what I'll

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.789 
into the body and then what I'll
probably<00:01:35.560> do<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:36.539> take<00:01:37.539> this<00:01:37.689> on<00:01:37.929> to<00:01:38.079> my<00:01:38.560> belt

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
probably do is take this on to my belt

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.929 
probably do is take this on to my belt
sander<00:01:39.219> and<00:01:39.960> smooth<00:01:40.960> up<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.289> back<00:01:41.499> and<00:01:41.939> round

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
sander and smooth up the back and round

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.230 
sander and smooth up the back and round
the<00:01:43.149> outside<00:01:43.179> of<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.960> spoon<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.369> then<00:01:45.999> up

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
the outside of the spoon and then up

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.059 
the outside of the spoon and then up
start<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.109> carve<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.569> inside<00:01:49.920> part<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:50.979> the

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
start to carve the inside part of the

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.399 
start to carve the inside part of the
spoon<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.579> then<00:01:52.539> I'll<00:01:52.689> start<00:01:52.929> working<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.259> the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
spoon and then I'll start working on the

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.319 
spoon and then I'll start working on the
rest<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.829> and<00:01:54.700> I'm<00:01:54.789> going<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.969> make<00:01:55.090> two<00:01:55.299> of

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
rest of it and I'm going to make two of

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.349 
rest of it and I'm going to make two of
these<00:01:55.539> and<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.069> not<00:01:57.219> my<00:01:57.369> design<00:01:59.819> but<00:02:00.819> I

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
these and this is not my design but I

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.959 
these and this is not my design but I
want<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.899> try<00:02:02.079> it<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:03.310> as<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.639> was<00:02:03.759> made

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
want to try it just as it was made

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.059 
want to try it just as it was made
before<00:02:04.179> before<00:02:05.109> I<00:02:05.139> did<00:02:05.499> anything<00:02:05.679> to<00:02:05.799> change

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
before before I did anything to change

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.040 
before before I did anything to change
it<00:02:06.249> what<00:02:06.429> I'm<00:02:06.520> going<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:07.179> do<00:02:07.389> after<00:02:07.780> I've

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
it what I'm going to do after I've

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.840 
it what I'm going to do after I've
carved<00:02:08.440> these

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
carved these

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
experience I want to then make a similar

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.260 
experience I want to then make a similar
design<00:02:17.830> but<00:02:18.520> what<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.700> want<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.970> do<00:02:19.090> is

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
design but what I want to do is

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.480 
design but what I want to do is
incorporate<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:20.350> idea<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.800> serpents<00:02:21.370> or

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
incorporate the idea of serpents or

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.590 
incorporate the idea of serpents or
lizards

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
lizards

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.530 
lizards
I<00:02:22.630> already<00:02:23.050> card<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.560> lizard<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.330> carve<00:02:25.330> some

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
I already card the lizard and carve some

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.670 
I already card the lizard and carve some
twisty<00:02:26.460> snake-like<00:02:27.460> vines<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.600> my<00:02:28.840> walking

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
twisty snake-like vines on my walking

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.310 
twisty snake-like vines on my walking
stick<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.540> what<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.720> want<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.900> do<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.200> either

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
stick and so what I want to do is either

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.040 
stick and so what I want to do is either
take<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:33.430> have<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> couple<00:02:34.390> patterns<00:02:34.840> for

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
take a I have a couple patterns for

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.950 
take a I have a couple patterns for
dragons<00:02:35.560> either<00:02:36.400> use<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> dragon<00:02:37.270> or<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.570> lizard

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
dragons either use a dragon or a lizard

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.710 
dragons either use a dragon or a lizard
or<00:02:38.080> even<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.440> snake<00:02:39.370> idea<00:02:40.210> instead<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.660> the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
or even a snake idea instead of the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.770 
or even a snake idea instead of the
vines<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.760> instead<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.240> this<00:02:43.420> being<00:02:43.660> a

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
vines and so instead of this being a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.870 
vines and so instead of this being a
leaf<00:02:44.020> up<00:02:44.350> here<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:44.890> would<00:02:45.040> be<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.760> know<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
leaf up here this would be you know a

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.390 
leaf up here this would be you know a
Serpent's<00:02:46.390> head<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.900> then<00:02:47.740> I'm<00:02:47.920> not<00:02:48.040> sure<00:02:48.250> if

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
Serpent's head and then I'm not sure if

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.350 
Serpent's head and then I'm not sure if
I<00:02:48.520> did<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.790> dragon<00:02:49.390> or<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:50.580> lizard<00:02:51.580> this<00:02:51.940> this

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
I did a dragon or a lizard this this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.420 
I did a dragon or a lizard this this
area<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.720> here<00:02:52.780> could<00:02:53.170> be<00:02:53.200> maybe<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.830> body<00:02:54.040> and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
area in here could be maybe the body and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.900 
area in here could be maybe the body and
a<00:02:54.460> couple<00:02:54.670> legs<00:02:54.960> in<00:02:55.960> this<00:02:56.200> area<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.820> then<00:02:57.820> you

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
a couple legs in this area and then you

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.840 
a couple legs in this area and then you
could<00:02:58.030> have<00:02:58.120> other<00:02:58.620> snakes<00:02:59.820> coiling<00:03:00.820> around

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
could have other snakes coiling around

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.870 
could have other snakes coiling around
it<00:03:01.270> so<00:03:02.020> I'm<00:03:02.620> going<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.010> alter<00:03:03.310> just<00:03:03.520> this

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
it so I'm going to alter just this

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.510 
it so I'm going to alter just this
design<00:03:04.270> after<00:03:04.480> I've<00:03:04.690> made<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:05.080> one

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
design after I've made this one

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.350 
design after I've made this one
according<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:06.730> pattern<00:03:06.970> with<00:03:07.270> the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
according to this pattern with the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.270 
according to this pattern with the
flowers<00:03:07.780> then<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.560> want<00:03:08.740> to<00:03:08.800> try<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.040> with<00:03:09.160> a

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
flowers then I want to try it with a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.280 
flowers then I want to try it with a
serpent<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.880> see<00:03:10.180> how<00:03:10.300> I<00:03:10.330> can<00:03:10.420> adapt<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.080> I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
serpent and see how I can adapt it I

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.080 
serpent and see how I can adapt it I
don't<00:03:11.680> know<00:03:11.770> if<00:03:11.890> I'll<00:03:11.980> also<00:03:12.310> do<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.760> when<00:03:12.940> in

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
don't know if I'll also do that when in

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.270 
don't know if I'll also do that when in
walnut'<00:03:13.810> have<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.230> card<00:03:14.530> wall<00:03:14.740> but<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.070> a<00:03:15.100> while

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
walnut' have a card wall but in a while

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.280 
walnut' have a card wall but in a while
but<00:03:15.550> I<00:03:15.610> did<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.850> few<00:03:16.000> test<00:03:16.270> cuts<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.720> just<00:03:16.930> it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
but I did a few test cuts and it just it

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.160 
but I did a few test cuts and it just it
just<00:03:17.320> feels<00:03:17.560> really<00:03:17.860> beautiful<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.880> comes<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
just feels really beautiful it comes the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.870 
just feels really beautiful it comes the
the<00:03:20.470> finish<00:03:20.800> that<00:03:20.980> comes<00:03:21.190> off<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.370> knife<00:03:21.640> is

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
the finish that comes off the knife is

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.140 
the finish that comes off the knife is
just<00:03:22.150> fantastic<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:23.490> that's<00:03:24.490> a<00:03:24.640> project<00:03:25.060> that

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
just fantastic so that's a project that

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:35.290 
just fantastic so that's a project that
I'll<00:03:25.270> be<00:03:25.360> working<00:03:25.690> on<00:03:25.750> next
