00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.040
 Hello 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.990
 this 12- measure album is 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.950
 chord progression is the most common 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.950
 use 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.580
 You come there a goal without sun. 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:23.189
 he goes through three chords with only seventh 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.500
 doc seventh and reconsider each 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.640
 following that of 12 bars is 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.640
 called decorum 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.590
 are notes that combine headdresses 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.590
 simultaneously 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.730
 are these same notes exchanged 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.210
 consecutively one to one safe route 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.250
 for you to use improvisation of course 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.739
 that you at the time of improvising will not 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.250
 only use these notes but it is 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.559
 It's important that you have them up your sleeve. 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.539
 the positions of the notes within the agreement 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.180
 are named with degrees 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.899
 so the first note is called 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.710
 fundamental or first degree 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:14.250
 then comes the larger third after the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:18.360
 fifth and the seventh minor some 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.659
 exercise suggestions for you to stay 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.270
 with these clear notes and memorize 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.939
 they in the instrument 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.000
 after the examples you can play 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.009
 together with the base in two frames 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.829
 recorded for you to play together 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.689
 The first exercise I'm going to do is 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.060
 so you 'll improvise by playing 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.060
 only the fundamentals of each chord 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.369
 discuss the example 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:42.390
 ah ah ah now improvise using 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:45.390
 and minor sevenths 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.390
 example 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.810
 now use the fundamental seventh and 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.810
 the inks 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.330
 finally start an example I'll use 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.220
 all landfill bills 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.220
 the four notes for each code 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 ae 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.560
