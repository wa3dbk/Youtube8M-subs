00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.360
 well this again I'm going to teach 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.060
 prepare a mojito 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.100
 we are at the time of the next 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.620
 way first the first thing that we have 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.990
 what to do as I said today, good 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.850
 we place the mint is fundamental 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.740
 it spearmint and peppermint not 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.869
 good times for reasons of period of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.670
 other time we can find ourselves like this 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.200
 how good we have to replace it but 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.910
 always telling our client to 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.370
 that mind we put sugar not to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.260
 too many people put sugar 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.120
 impalpable so that not for not 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.180
 is the sugar down I'm not very 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 agreement but they are sugar modalities not 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.200
 a lot because the drink does not have to be 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.070
 sweet has that refreshing with a hint 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.290
 sweet and a little lime juice 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.970
 as to be able to macerate 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.490
 there are two ways to make a mojito 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.700
 once we already have this or we can 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.740
 [Music] 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.290
 put limit sewing that is a 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.360
 concentrate of herbs we put some 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.610
 small drops because it is very strong is 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.530
 very concentrated or we can put it 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.379
 In the end I choose to propose it here because 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.450
 I prefer that the cup drink take 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.729
 aromas take a little more different color 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.520
 and we look like we proceed to macerate 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.010
 we're going to be very space let's turn the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.890
 cup this has to be done very slowly 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.570
 because sometimes when it becomes strong 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.940
 the leaves are losing small 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.700
 bits small particles that then to 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.810
 the time to take good the client is 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.240
 is with all the bits in the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.040
 tongue and mean unpleasant once 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.020
 we are refreshing the whole cup already 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.350
 we devise the whole glass with the aroma of 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 Mojito 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.800
 let's go scattering everywhere and 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.590
 Well here I have crushed ice because 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.960
 there is a piece of ice 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.689
 we are going putting it is important that 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.350
 be there I have chopped it so that you 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.549
 Give a little more than a little more cold 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.560
 alvarado is important this work be 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.380
 well cool it has to be cool if 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.420
 we are not going badly good in this case we 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.920
 let's use a road character 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.799
 characteristic of Cuba is in fact a 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.060
 robot is clear Havana Cuba 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.959
 generally to make mojito the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.860
 havana key yellow letter that is a 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.440
 yellow and that is three years 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.290
 but good complex issues that's very 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.030
 very difficult to get from here and 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.650
 that maybe replacing that is 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.920
 also from the same brand havana clave 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.959
 but the old white does not make sense 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.540
 use the other year children degrees 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.840
 because it's another flavor that does not do well 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.510
 at the drink does not do it very smoked no no 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.400
 is what we look for in the drink 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.790
 Lets put 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.530
 this I almost already do it to eye could be 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.819
 say it's three ounces of rum 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.819
 we mix a little 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.030
 we continue making use of the aroma of water 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.370
 with gas we complete it upwards 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.459
 [Music] 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.790
 we complete it all we are going to put two 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.019
 droplets of vitter angostura so that 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.640
 so that when it presents itself in the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.280
 person who takes it can feel 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.250
 the aromas of entry and well we're going to 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.240
 decorate finally with a small 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.899
 slice of lime 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.899
