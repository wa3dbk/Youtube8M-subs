00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
okay I'm ready to start brushing out the

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.340 
okay I'm ready to start brushing out the
curls<00:01:08.920> I<00:01:09.220> do<00:01:09.909> have<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.240> sitter<00:01:10.570> part<00:01:10.900> which<00:01:11.200> you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
curls I do have a sitter part which you

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.640 
curls I do have a sitter part which you
can<00:01:11.530> leave<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.820> way<00:01:13.060> but<00:01:13.120> even<00:01:14.050> when<00:01:14.170> I<00:01:14.229> part

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
can leave that way but even when I part

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.370 
can leave that way but even when I part
my<00:01:14.740> hair<00:01:14.860> on<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.400> side<00:01:15.790> I<00:01:16.120> initially<00:01:17.080> start

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
my hair on the side I initially start

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.560 
my hair on the side I initially start
with<00:01:17.560> my<00:01:17.710> hair<00:01:17.890> parted<00:01:18.190> in<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.430> center<00:01:18.760> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
with my hair parted in the center the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.880 
with my hair parted in the center the
reason<00:01:19.840> why<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.050> because<00:01:20.290> when<00:01:20.740> I<00:01:20.830> do

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
reason why is because when I do

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.920 
reason why is because when I do
eventually<00:01:21.310> part<00:01:21.729> it<00:01:21.850> on<00:01:21.940> this<00:01:22.000> side<00:01:22.180> it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
eventually part it on this side it

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.770 
eventually part it on this side it
creates<00:01:23.350> quite<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.650> bit<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:23.950> volume<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:25.000> first

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
creates quite a bit of volume so first

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.240 
creates quite a bit of volume so first
I'm<00:01:25.960> going<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.140> go<00:01:26.229> ahead<00:01:26.259> and<00:01:26.680> just<00:01:26.830> start

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
I'm going to go ahead and just start

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.780 
I'm going to go ahead and just start

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
do with the clamp up I carefully put my

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.630 
do with the clamp up I carefully put my
hair<00:03:52.350> on<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:53.490> barrel<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.480> hot<00:03:54.960> iron<00:03:55.230> and

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
hair on the barrel of the hot iron and

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.850 
hair on the barrel of the hot iron and
then<00:03:56.640> just<00:03:56.910> push<00:03:57.210> it<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:58.350> opposite<00:03:58.740> direction

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
then just push it the opposite direction

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.500 
then just push it the opposite direction
of<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.970> hair<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.960> that<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.200> creates<00:04:01.710> lift<00:04:02.040> and

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
of the hair so that it creates lift and

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.730 
of the hair so that it creates lift and
then<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.780> pull<00:04:04.050> that<00:04:04.260> out<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:06.260> then<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.350> do<00:04:07.410> it

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
then just pull that out and then I do it

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.250 
then just pull that out and then I do it
a<00:04:07.920> little<00:04:08.130> further<00:04:08.430> down<00:04:08.660> just<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:09.810> it'll

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
a little further down just so it'll

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:18.699 
a little further down just so it'll
it'll<00:04:10.590> create<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.070> dip<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:13.350> really<00:04:13.890> is<00:04:13.950> that

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.809 

and<00:04:19.220> then<00:04:19.370> at<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.609> very<00:04:19.639> ends<00:04:20.329> of<00:04:20.389> the<00:04:20.539> hair

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:21.819 
and then at the very ends of the hair

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.950 
and then at the very ends of the hair
just<00:04:22.819> kind<00:04:23.150> of

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
just kind of

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.590 
just kind of
hot<00:04:25.650> iron<00:04:25.889> down<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:26.669> it'll<00:04:26.850> create<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.330> curl

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
hot iron down so it'll create a curl

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.250 
hot iron down so it'll create a curl
back<00:04:27.960> into<00:04:28.530> what<00:04:28.710> you've<00:04:28.889> created

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.170 

and<00:04:32.130> then<00:04:32.250> I'm<00:04:32.370> just<00:04:32.490> going<00:04:32.670> to<00:04:32.730> brush<00:04:32.940> that

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
hairstyle and it really is quite simple

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.119 
hairstyle and it really is quite simple
you<00:05:03.740> just<00:05:03.889> have<00:05:04.249> to<00:05:04.430> have<00:05:04.460> patience<00:05:05.090> and

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
you just have to have patience and

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.999 
you just have to have patience and
continually<00:05:07.129> curl<00:05:07.699> under<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.569> it<00:05:09.560> does<00:05:09.830> have

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
continually curl under and it does have

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.790 
continually curl under and it does have
a<00:05:10.039> tendency<00:05:10.279> to<00:05:10.840> stay<00:05:11.840> really<00:05:12.229> high<00:05:12.439> up<00:05:12.469> and

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
a tendency to stay really high up and

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.939 
a tendency to stay really high up and
curl<00:05:13.099> too<00:05:13.400> much<00:05:13.669> if<00:05:13.909> you<00:05:14.090> use<00:05:14.120> too<00:05:14.629> much<00:05:14.949> hair

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
curl too much if you use too much hair

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.610

gel<00:05:16.249> or<00:05:16.490> hair<00:05:16.879> putty<00:05:17.180> so<00:05:17.749> it's<00:05:17.870> almost<00:05:18.379> better

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
gel or hair putty so it's almost better

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.679 
gel or hair putty so it's almost better
just<00:05:18.979> to<00:05:19.129> leave<00:05:19.279> it<00:05:19.340> in<00:05:19.520> wet<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:20.120> let<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.360> dry

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
just to leave it in wet and let it dry

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.739 
just to leave it in wet and let it dry
that<00:05:20.990> way<00:05:21.370> if<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.610> do<00:05:22.819> use<00:05:23.060> hair<00:05:23.360> putty<00:05:23.629> or

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:23.749 
that way if you do use hair putty or

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:25.959 
that way if you do use hair putty or
hair<00:05:24.050> gel<00:05:24.289> just<00:05:24.590> use<00:05:24.770> it<00:05:24.919> at<00:05:25.039> the<00:05:25.069> very<00:05:25.189> ends

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:25.969 
hair gel just use it at the very ends

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.480 
hair gel just use it at the very ends
and<00:05:26.120> this<00:05:26.599> will<00:05:26.749> keep<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.710> very<00:05:27.979> inside

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
and this will keep the the very inside

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.610 
and this will keep the the very inside
of<00:05:28.639> the<00:05:28.729> crow<00:05:28.939> nice<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.449> tight<00:05:29.689> but<00:05:30.469> you

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
of the crow nice and tight but you

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.959 
of the crow nice and tight but you
really<00:05:30.830> don't<00:05:31.009> need<00:05:31.250> much<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:31.759> through

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
really don't need much of it through

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.790 
really don't need much of it through
here<00:05:32.240> and<00:05:32.509> it<00:05:32.719> causes<00:05:32.900> it<00:05:33.110> to<00:05:33.259> be<00:05:33.409> sticky

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
here and it causes it to be sticky

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.999 
here and it causes it to be sticky
anyway<00:05:34.279> if<00:05:34.969> you<00:05:35.180> use<00:05:35.419> hairspray<00:05:35.719> use<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.860> as<00:05:36.979> a

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
anyway if you use hairspray use it as a

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.269 
anyway if you use hairspray use it as a
final<00:05:37.550> touch<00:05:38.229> because<00:05:39.229> it<00:05:39.500> causes<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:40.069> hair

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
final touch because it causes the hair

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.490 
final touch because it causes the hair
to<00:05:40.370> be<00:05:40.460> hard<00:05:40.729> to<00:05:40.939> comb<00:05:41.210> through<00:05:41.240> if<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.349> use

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
to be hard to comb through if you use

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.619
