then it's going to force you out of the
car<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:03.020> just<00:05:03.560> run<00:05:03.890> out<00:05:04.130> of<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.400> garage<00:05:04.550> okay

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
car and just run out of the garage okay

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.360 
car and just run out of the garage okay
then<00:05:05.630> look<00:05:05.930> on<00:05:06.080> your<00:05:06.200> little<00:05:06.380> map<00:05:06.740> it's<00:05:07.190> going

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
then look on your little map it's going

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.980 
then look on your little map it's going
to<00:05:07.460> give<00:05:07.670> you<00:05:07.790> a<00:05:07.820> little<00:05:07.940> car<00:05:08.360> sign<00:05:08.660> and<00:05:08.900> your

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
to give you a little car sign and your

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.020 
to give you a little car sign and your
car's<00:05:09.260> probably<00:05:09.410> going<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.740> be<00:05:09.800> parked<00:05:10.160> around

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
car's probably going to be parked around

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.640 
car's probably going to be parked around
the<00:05:11.360> corner<00:05:11.420> and<00:05:11.900> you're<00:05:12.170> going<00:05:12.290> to<00:05:12.350> sprint

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
the corner and you're going to sprint

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.960 
the corner and you're going to sprint
over<00:05:12.980> and<00:05:13.160> there<00:05:13.310> is<00:05:13.460> going<00:05:13.610> to<00:05:13.730> be<00:05:13.760> the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
over and there is going to be the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.240 
over and there is going to be the
duplicated<00:05:14.600> version<00:05:14.900> of<00:05:15.020> that<00:05:15.170> car<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.860> only

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
duplicated version of that car the only

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.220 
duplicated version of that car the only
downside<00:05:16.490> is<00:05:16.820> that<00:05:17.060> your<00:05:17.330> friend's<00:05:17.720> car<00:05:17.990> gets

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
downside is that your friend's car gets

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.650 
downside is that your friend's car gets
dumb<00:05:18.470> like<00:05:19.460> destroyed<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.300> doesn't<00:05:20.570> get

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
dumb like destroyed it doesn't get

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.480 
dumb like destroyed it doesn't get
deleted<00:05:20.900> it<00:05:21.140> gets<00:05:21.290> destroyed<00:05:21.650> so<00:05:22.040> they<00:05:22.280> have

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
deleted it gets destroyed so they have

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.550 
deleted it gets destroyed so they have
to<00:05:22.640> pay<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:22.910> insurance<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:24.140> get<00:05:24.260> it<00:05:24.410> back

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
to pay the insurance to to get it back

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.440 
to pay the insurance to to get it back
but<00:05:25.220> for<00:05:25.430> something<00:05:25.640> like<00:05:25.790> an<00:05:25.940> adder<00:05:26.150> that

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
but for something like an adder that

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.350 
but for something like an adder that
saves<00:05:26.720> you<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:27.020> know<00:05:27.140> like<00:05:27.380> a<00:05:27.410> million

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360
