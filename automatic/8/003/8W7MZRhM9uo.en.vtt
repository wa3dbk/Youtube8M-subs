that I squirm around a lot in my seat or
that<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.269> don't<00:00:18.599> really<00:00:18.869> look<00:00:19.050> at<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.590> camera

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
that I don't really look at the camera

doing a lot of things with my hands
mostly<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.880> think<00:00:27.060> my<00:00:27.150> biggest<00:00:27.179> problem<00:00:27.839> is<00:00:28.080> not

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.179 
mostly I think my biggest problem is not
speaking<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> camera<00:00:29.339> and<00:00:31.189> looking

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.260 
around and looking at other things or
just<00:00:34.489> stammering<00:00:35.489> or<00:00:35.730> having<00:00:36.000> trouble

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
just stammering or having trouble

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.090 
just stammering or having trouble
getting<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.539> words<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.050> mouth<00:00:37.110> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
getting the words out of my mouth this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.670 
getting the words out of my mouth this
isn't<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.460> because<00:00:38.789> I'm<00:00:38.910> nervous<00:00:39.590> I'm<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
isn't really because I'm nervous I'm a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.520 
isn't really because I'm nervous I'm a
little<00:00:40.710> bit<00:00:41.039> nervous<00:00:41.190> talking<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> camera

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
little bit nervous talking to the camera

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.220 
little bit nervous talking to the camera
but<00:00:43.699> that's<00:00:44.699> not<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> main<00:00:45.120> issue<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:46.050> think

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
but that's not the main issue I think

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
but that's not the main issue I think
the<00:00:46.559> main<00:00:46.710> issue<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.129> when<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> look<00:00:47.789> at

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the main issue is that when I look at

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.400 
the main issue is that when I look at
the<00:00:48.059> camera<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:49.020> imac<00:00:49.379> what<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> see<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
the camera on my imac what I see is a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.590 
the camera on my imac what I see is a
black<00:00:52.410> strip<00:00:52.829> across<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.550> top<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.269> the<00:00:54.390> screen

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
with the dead little camera eye staring

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.479 
with the dead little camera eye staring
back<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:57.809> me<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.769> look<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.280> talk

back at me and when I look at it to talk

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.060 
back at me and when I look at it to talk
to<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.079> they're<00:01:01.079> my<00:01:01.350> mind<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.739> goes<00:01:02.039> blank
