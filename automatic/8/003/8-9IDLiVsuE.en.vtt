00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:12.090
 a saved Weber mrc crew expatriate Woongjin water repellent star disk love mc 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.320
 The contribution that contributed to the biotem will be given to the coin to go to our impressions 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.490
 How about this 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:23.070
 So I thought you would go up the river unconditionally, so I feel a little 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.910
 It's just normal though 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:32.369
 Lee Dae-hyung came up as a substitute and seems to be a little bit better. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.309
 After he laughed at his rivalry and became a principle champion, 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.520
 Did your thoughts or confidence change a lot? 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:45.670
 Because I am the winner rather than the child , 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.120
 I think I was more cautious about playing more games. 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.800
 2 Houses to themselves 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.720
 In the water tank car 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:03.890
 When I went there, how likely is it that I won? 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:07.530
 It was not just a few percent and I just went to the point of winning 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.740
 I think I won the championship. 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.690
 What are you two examples just did not go up or end 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.110
 Putting this idea is finally clamoring 100000000 heard krauts up 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.860
 How much did you get around you? 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.420
 I got the reaction. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.340
 He gives them came to celebrate his son's one kid that I won and that thought 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.710
 I heard them. 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.690
 In fact, the top cs2 3 Dropped season when not full then the little dick 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.759
 What was the reason 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:41.970
 I am 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:48.590
 In season three seasons Stuttgart when I play it while advantageously Liu 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:54.439
 Scrape go out alone. That's why Honda is the district by mistake 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:58.900
 My partner was good , of course, but my babbot was so wet that I could not sleep 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:03.580
 I think it's a little trimming. 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.500
 Before that overseas, it was evaluated as being strategic and polling intelligent 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.080
 You think so yourself 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.040
 Bath myself but I've not think so, I think that is Just 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.330
 game 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:20.650
 It's my own style. 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.440
 How does it feel to see a lot of players follow their own play ? 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:29.320
 Uh food but joins 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:33.900
 I do not care because it's not like me doing it. 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:40.340
 Maybe you could ask for that help. 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:45.890
 What pieces received a lot of help and a lot of kids to help other sseuldeut 5 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:49.700
 Other players with a lot of players who opened a pretty little exchange 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:55.360
 How to shift the game to pass the story became 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:59.540
 Since that time, just like this team a long time because there is not the same team when the industry's image 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.410
 I think my little upright yieoganeun not far 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:08.000
 It looks like there's a lot of creative power out there just in case. 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.160
 So I think just a little faded, but getting anything out of play in teranjeon 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.310
 Because of what I am. 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:20.209
 I used to have my own style in the old days when I was an athlete . 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:25.099
 Ateran's limit was eight years ago. 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:31.370
 Just days doenya spirits into thinking that if you toss a little slow 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:36.590
 In addition to my own colors rather than creativity and a little slow to shift 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.450
 In a note presented to Hooters before Robert expansion suggest he pull the empty first 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.879
 With a playable feeling 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:49.010
 I have not been able to sign it well, but what is the climate? 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:56.120
 There is no apparent reason why the 5 just look at the map bwagamyeonseo 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:04:02.420
 If the industry is open'm about Ile de la Kearney's so little itgu 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:06.890
 It is not easy to pull the giant quickly , 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:11.000
 I studied nicely when I was studying strategy . 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.790
 Gonna put you to sleep so I should think about opening or that game 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.660
 If you think like this 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:23.930
 When I catch more things every 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:29.030
 Look exhausted built in ladder games so just fine, no matter win or lose whiteness 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:32.539
 If you want to build it, you can refine that build and make it brown. 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.830
 That day, Heo-su-su will be Kim Hee-seon seven times. 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:42.280
 I was a big fan, did you know 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:49.900
 I did not know. But I knew that parochialism would make me unique. 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:54.850
 Build some thing you ever learned relocation sseotdeon the demons that eat less gas fire 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:58.870
 Over proud to say that somewhere Berserker is also lowering the income Hawkes Mill Building 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:04.270
 I bought it a long time ago, and I'm honored to have it. 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:08.350
 I did not do it, but I just tried it on Red, but it was okay, but the Dick BlizzCon 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:12.310
 I thought it was over. Mania said he wrote it. 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:17.080
 No, the player was sleeping well in the field and I was thinking. 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.490
 Went out, unplug the banned its overseas now water Dream Act children ah go out 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.430
 The mission is out. 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.060
 What do you think of Goethel's book? 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:30.330
 I'm on the positive side. 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:35.290
 If you are in the same foreign country, please do a lot of fans fans too. 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:37.430
 You know you can meet all the new players, different players think its good points 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:43.460
 If it's bad, 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:46.699
 Ah , so the Americas have a little time difference, 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:51.770
 It seemed okay except for the womb . 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:54.810
 But ever go out international competition ran its performance rose something like Isaac wanted players 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.140
 Let me show you. 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.379
 Would not show ought to win wooseul 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.210
 Ah 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:11.060
 Still, I do not like ceremony if it is one by one. 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:15.560
 I want to do it, 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:21.460
 Dimae that comes ahead of him to McDonough 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:27.530
 But to think you think Merton is looking at the player Jean toughest players 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:34.340
 Because for me it is an opportunity to verify the teranjeon I just pop up the middle 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:39.860
 I am going to do my best in 10 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:43.550
 I think myself and my wife are the best in the world . 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.369
 If you win the red fire, you will think so. 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:50.159
 U 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:55.830
 So if you want the last word about yet but the fourth river 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:57.749
 Make a copy every day and earn a good title in Dream Nuclear 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.199
