two generations ago as we move into
summer<00:00:23.369> every<00:00:24.180> week<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.539> get<00:00:24.660> more<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:24.960> more

summer every week we get more and more

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.710 
summer every week we get more and more
vegetables<00:00:26.189> coming<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:27.359> know<00:00:27.420> starting

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
vegetables coming in you know starting

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.740 
vegetables coming in you know starting
with<00:00:27.750> early<00:00:28.039> lettuces<00:00:29.039> well<00:00:30.029> asparagus<00:00:30.480> is

with early lettuces well asparagus is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.250 
with early lettuces well asparagus is
probably<00:00:31.019> our<00:00:31.140> first<00:00:31.640> green<00:00:33.079> vegetable<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
probably our first green vegetable and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.069 
probably our first green vegetable and
then<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> lettuces<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.550> spinach<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
then we get the lettuces and spinach and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.530 
then we get the lettuces and spinach and
then<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.829> different<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.090> all<00:00:39.329> the

60 different vegetables that we grow
start<00:00:41.250> coming<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.300> gets<00:00:42.450> increasingly

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
start coming in so it gets increasingly

the fact that we're doing any of this is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.880 
the fact that we're doing any of this is
a<00:01:47.810> sign<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.200> poor<00:01:48.910> preseason<00:01:50.440> cultivations<00:01:51.440> to
