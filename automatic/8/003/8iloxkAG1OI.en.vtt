out<00:00:32.489> from<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> scene<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:34.040> I've<00:00:35.040> already<00:00:35.309> kept

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
out from the scene and I've already kept

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.660 
out from the scene and I've already kept
mine<00:00:35.820> out<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> alpha<00:00:37.680> Channel<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.640> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
mine out and I have a alpha Channel so I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
mine out and I have a alpha Channel so I
am<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.719> load<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> selection<00:00:40.680> from<00:00:40.770> an

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
am going to load the selection from an

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.340 
am going to load the selection from an
alpha<00:00:41.280> Channel

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.209 

now<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.590> where<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.860> should<00:00:46.920> probably

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
now this is where you should probably

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.279 
now this is where you should probably
pause<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> video<00:00:47.879> take<00:00:48.149> time<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.660> make<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> good

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
pause the video take time to make a good

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.650 
pause the video take time to make a good
clean<00:00:49.440> selection<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.280> object<00:00:50.760> once<00:00:51.510> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
clean selection of your object once you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.040 
clean selection of your object once you
have<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.980> need<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.370> copy<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.629> paste

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
it to its own layer

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.660 
it to its own layer
here<00:00:58.079> I'll<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.800> turn<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.129> my<00:00:59.160> original

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
here I'll do and turn off my original

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.639 
here I'll do and turn off my original
layer<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.180> assure<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> nice<00:01:01.050> clean<00:01:01.379> cut

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
layer to assure I have a nice clean cut

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.070 
layer to assure I have a nice clean cut
as<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.340> could<00:01:02.760> see<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.480> looks<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.019> do

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
as I could see it it looks like I do

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.530 
as I could see it it looks like I do
next<00:01:04.769> thing<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.159> will<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> create<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
next thing to do will be to create a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
next thing to do will be to create a
layer<00:01:06.810> above<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.229> original<00:01:07.640> that<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.760> will

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
layer above the original that we will

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.270 
layer above the original that we will
use<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.119> our<00:01:09.420> background<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.830> fill<00:01:11.189> up

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
use for our background we will fill up

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210 
use for our background we will fill up
with<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.460> color<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.270> our<00:01:12.450> choice<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.110> I'm<00:01:13.979> going

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
with a color of our choice so I'm going

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
with a color of our choice so I'm going
to<00:01:14.310> go<00:01:14.430> ahead<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.670> create<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.939> layer<00:01:15.299> then

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to go ahead and create that layer then

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.910 
to go ahead and create that layer then
I'm<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.189> pick<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> color<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.990> use<00:01:19.619> as<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I'm going to pick a color to use as a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.789 
I'm going to pick a color to use as a
background<00:01:20.250> color<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.720> pick<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.140> shade

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
one that I think would look good and I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.490 
one that I think would look good and I
will<00:01:27.650> pick<00:01:27.890> this<00:01:28.040> up<00:01:28.480> now<00:01:29.480> I<00:01:29.540> am<00:01:30.020> going<00:01:30.230> to<00:01:30.380> go

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
background layer with my foreground

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.000 
background layer with my foreground
color<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.940> think<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.780> looks<00:01:38.960> good<00:01:39.230> I'll

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
color and I think it looks good I'll

color and I think it looks good I'll
make<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.220> copy<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.760> object<00:01:40.880> layer<00:01:41.360> for

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
make a copy of the object layer for

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.580 
make a copy of the object layer for
later<00:01:42.080> use<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.970> hide<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.180> for<00:01:44.630> now<00:01:44.750> because<00:01:45.440> we

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
later use and hide it for now because we

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.460 
later use and hide it for now because we
will<00:01:45.680> be<00:01:45.830> using<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:46.280> in<00:01:46.370> a<00:01:46.490> moment<00:01:47.200> go<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.260> the

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
I think this one here will do it click

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.460 
I think this one here will do it click
OK<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.680> again<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:07.220> need<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.459> edit<00:04:07.940> fill<00:04:08.269> with<00:04:09.260> my

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
OK and again I need to edit fill with my

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.339 
OK and again I need to edit fill with my
newly<00:04:09.860> selected<00:04:10.040> foreground<00:04:10.849> color<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.349> now

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
newly selected foreground color and now

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.949 
newly selected foreground color and now
it's<00:04:12.590> a<00:04:12.799> lighter<00:04:13.160> shade<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.580> blue<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.750> think

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
it's a lighter shade of blue and I think

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.590 
it's a lighter shade of blue and I think
those<00:04:15.080> colors<00:04:15.410> look<00:04:15.650> good<00:04:15.860> together<00:04:16.070> but<00:04:17.030> you

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
those colors look good together but you

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.300 
those colors look good together but you
can<00:04:17.780> actually<00:04:17.900> take<00:04:18.200> this<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.380> little<00:04:19.040> bit

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
can actually take this a little bit

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.430 
can actually take this a little bit
further<00:04:19.579> if<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:19.910> want<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.540> I'll<00:04:21.139> show<00:04:21.380> you

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
another way to make color adjustments do

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.480 
another way to make color adjustments do
