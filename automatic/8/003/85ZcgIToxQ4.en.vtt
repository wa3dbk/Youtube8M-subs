00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.949
 I 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:30.440
 perry books and not to you aurÃ©lie I 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.910
 believe we will not be able is cut off so 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.030
 you too the little girls of your 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.380
 entourage are just fan of the queen of 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.320
 snow i'm going to show you today 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.489
 how to make a cake inspired by 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.680
 their favorite cartoons 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.770
 for that we need cake at 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.780
 yogurt about 20 cm in diameter from the 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.360
 white sugar dough of sugar dough 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.970
 blue for an ace portfolio flakes 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.400
 sugar decorations a little sugar 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.760
 ice cream and icing to make this cake 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.010
 in express version you do not break me 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.440
 the ears too long we're going 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.120
 use icing all good month 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.960
 it's pink today because it's 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.030
 what I had in my fridge 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.560
 but obviously the ideal is that they 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.350
 be white you can also put 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.630
 raspberry jam or other 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.830
 types of jam inside the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.390
 cake we will always need more 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.370
 the wise for the perimeter to serve a 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.930
 little glue before depositing the dough 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.790
 sugar for frosting you can 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.619
 buy it nearby or take the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.520
 recipe that is in the video of 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.159
 bunch of cupcakes 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.229
 we'll start by putting icing on 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.689
 center of a first cake 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.280
 so there our cupcakes when they 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.700
 are they are pretty flat so we do not 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.930
 do not cut if they are a little above 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.340
 exactly below a great trick 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.750
 you give them a good shot of 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.850
 pots and it allows them to 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.259
 cool well flat but for really 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.280
 that the cake is flat we are still going 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.400
 returned the second 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.040
 ato face plate up 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.650
 I take off the baking paper that was 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.330
 very ingeniously but at the moment the 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.310
 cooking and then to get a 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.160
 really perfect circle we can use 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.300
 an adjustable waist circle just a 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.300
 very little bouthillette 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.950
 and 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.739
 I will quickly cover the cake 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.269
 frosting the purpose it's really not that 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.569
 it's nice but just that it forms a 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.910
 layer that come to serve as glue for 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.920
 sugar paste 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.240
 good it obviously has to be when 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.090
 even they say to not make big 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.190
 pie a dish so it's in simple m of which 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.350
 jam is that then jam 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.940
 it's for the center layer finally he 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.530
 always need icing or something 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.900
 something a little more pasty than 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.810
 jam to serve as glue this name 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.790
 we see too much be the spread 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.980
 serves as glue but it does not allow 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.720
 hide for example the holes that can there 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.530
 to have in the cake what kind of things 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.020
 it works 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.020
 but it will never be a perfect ghetto 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.020
 and 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.569
 and here we are going to put it at 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.209
 fridge for it to take well 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.760
 will now move on to decorating to 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.050
 small white flakes well 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.150
 sure 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.860
 a little sugar dough if you can 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.560
 the spread 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.420
 and use cookie cutters for 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.700
 shots and flakes and I'm going 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.940
 try to get a blue color 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.950
 close to our heroine 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.030
 I mixed three blocks of blue and one 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.350
 little white than what I found 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.010
 that he is a little aggressive 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.040
 we do not forget when we spread that I 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.450
 be a little point 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.650
 it avoids putting too much icing sugar 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.650
 which dries the dough 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.050
 m 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.460
 I will prepare the dough for what will 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.230
 we serve to cover the entire cake 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.910
 so as would have said hop 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.920
 every time I give a little help 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.290
 of roll I re form a circle like 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.500
 that we do think a good jump on 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.500
 end 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.890
 we will deposit the cake directly on 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.890
 his service plate 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.620
 the sugar hat on the forearms 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.620
 and I put it in front of 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.990
 then I work as it was a 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.120
 fabric I get up and flatten with the palm 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.280
 from the hand 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.720
 I get up I called these cases as of 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.630
 love 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.510
 I get up I flatten there it's a moment where 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.340
 can use a straightener but I have 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.790
 I did not take 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:54.320
 gold this dough and I said it's 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.720
 with the bench well the edges then 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.850
 I use a spatula a little bent 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.490
 and I came to cut out the sugar dough 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.390
 in plating well to the soul of the spatula 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.390
 all around 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.140
 I propose to put some dough in 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.850
 white sugar on top with effect 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.930
 snow falling and suddenly we stuck 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.930
 everything and flakes back 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.220
 and 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.910
 c 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.950
 op 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.350
 and 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.350
 and 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.200
 I propose that we just stick full 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.360
 small flakes on the white a little 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.550
 on blue % use glue 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.770
 food or a small sugar mixture 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.060
 ice cream and let the flakes stick 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.830
 and I meanwhile I'm going to do 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.830
 a pretty color of proxies 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:00.320
 filed not eat everything down for 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.710
 hide all that is ugly on the 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.710
 cake 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.480
 I use a small sugar dough tool 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.710
 which looks like a shell I 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.210
 by the way you can use a real 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.010
 shells or then a fork 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.930
 the idea is to create a border all 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.260
 around the cake we could of course have 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.260
 potato 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.639
 good I think we are not bad on the 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.349
 deco flakes a little snowman 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.229
 during that time you see ah yeah 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:43.479
 Too little dough ball hop a few 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:45.729
 days in a style and that's it's a 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.559
 winter cake complete if you too 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.539
 you liked the recipe and that you 

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:52.710
 liked the song and after that you 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:55.150
 you feel free of books and 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.199
