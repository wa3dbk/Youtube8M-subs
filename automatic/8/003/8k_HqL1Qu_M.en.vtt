00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.070
 Hey people today I'll show you one 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.590
 Gameplay video to crossfire crossfire 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.360
 is a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.310
 fri ego shooter you can do it too 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:30.450
 I would compare with counterstrike 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:32.610
 it is not so bold to say 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.559
 graphically not quite as nice as 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.030
 counterstrike and many of you the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.840
 could play two probably now 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.550
 be adjusted 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.050
 the game is complete 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.300
 of course you have her here in the course 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.220
 itemshop as with all play the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.280
 In fact, we are here for free 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.930
 with rp that's this alternative currency 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.520
 Of course you can choose others 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.649
 You do not buy weapons like that now 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.850
 can buy 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.469
 but the nice thing about a shooter is 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.210
 you do not necessarily need them like that 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.030
 You see, this is not so dramatic 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.030
 great here the awm maybe but 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.580
 yes what can one say then synonymous gp 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.000
 is the currency that earns itself 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.380
 can here you have still so capps 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.570
 as you can turn on it and with 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.119
 Happy then again so special 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.250
 Weapons here golden and hit me yes 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.660
 here if you have enough coupons then 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.380
 can you also in which great 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.380
 to bring weapons 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.440
 a itemshop stop on the normal 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.630
 gp weapons 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.780
 there you already have in the nice 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.100
 selection of weapons 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.380
 In addition, there are also characters 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.880
 any additional stuff with which you 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.680
 level could rise exactly 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.399
 Although rising level takes quite 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.700
 long but you can stop then 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.170
 better cart we show you this 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.210
 just play in game 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.539
 I think that will be pretty short 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.539
 Gameplay video coding 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.500
 Do not be mad at me if I'm with you 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.489
 rugby-star's control namely 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.489
 no more 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.489
 Marienau 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.210
 Lick me on the ass I'm bad 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:40.240
 The letter I no longer played time 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:47.950
 So do not be angry with me, but more with me 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:50.410
 Diablo employs battlefield 3 who 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.510
 many shooter plays that knows too 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.070
 It's not that easy then 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.070
 get used to the old shooter again 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.200
 that's just what we're playing here 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.060
 but they do not take 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.420
 16 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.670
 nature 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.200
 yes we are yes 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.709
 In this look the game has never been 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.709
 played 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.380
 that's because every shooter 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.350
 somehow world is the sensibility and 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.120
 the know-how and the speed we 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.490
 runs and no idea what all 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.220
 very realistic 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.220
 The type of camp so now first 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.980
 on 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:41.170
 my food I have this now 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.170
 behind 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.259
 for that 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.940
 As I said you can complete yourselves 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.850
 own clan make people invite the 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.070
 last weeks introduced upright 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.550
 the plan is so desktops at least at 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.550
 the meriva 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.100
 I already have the game 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.760
 no longer played eternities which 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.760
 play in others 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.069
 but I was packing so badly 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.460
 Games are still waiting to be 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.460
 last 

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:38.919
 it is now to show it off 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.919
 meant 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.160
 or how it looks 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.220
 must be expensive construction or the end of 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:06:01.630
 change exactly 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:03.940
 block me even more I eat so while 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.660
 the mission packaged in best of the 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:11.340
 team also with a - kd nice that times 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.340
 to have played a long day again 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.900
 And now I do not feel like it anymore 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.980
 yes, here you see, for example, far 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.980
 that still takes up to level up picture 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.980
 reason 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:35.150
 Williams can't see me like that here 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.100
 Do you still have a daily mission? 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.220
 I could just say something else 30 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:44.110
 Kills in Ghost Match Team this five times 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.110
 win or skf and 30 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.949
 yes and for that always something for it 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:55.070
 do you get the awm a for example ? 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:57.139
 no idea what do you fuck yourself yes 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.970
 okay that's it with the gameplay 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.500
 crossfire I hope it was fun 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.669
 look at my other gameplay 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.930
 videos at this maybe a bit 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.580
 are also a bit exciting 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.360
 games 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.699
 one must also times a bog 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.530
 between parking in between makes 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:12.650
 but still quite fun then 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:16.930
 a lot of fun German end everything de wake 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.930
 I stop watching the gameplay
