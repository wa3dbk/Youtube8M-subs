00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
the next question comes from Lam pal who

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.679 
the next question comes from Lam pal who
is<00:02:19.170> shooting<00:02:19.739> in<00:02:20.250> manual<00:02:20.909> mode<00:02:20.939> and<00:02:21.390> cannot

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
is shooting in manual mode and cannot

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.050 
is shooting in manual mode and cannot
change<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.319> aperture<00:02:22.709> he<00:02:23.250> says<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:23.640> fixed

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
change the aperture he says it's fixed

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.780 
change the aperture he says it's fixed
at<00:02:24.180> f9<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:25.409> when<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.680> switch<00:02:25.950> into<00:02:26.129> aperture

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
at f9 but when you switch into aperture

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.539 
at f9 but when you switch into aperture
priority<00:02:27.030> mode<00:02:27.390> he<00:02:28.079> can<00:02:28.260> change<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.250> my

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
priority mode he can change it so my

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.339 
priority mode he can change it so my
guess<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.209> you're<00:02:30.599> using<00:02:30.900> an

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
guess is that you're using an

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.240 
guess is that you're using an
entry-level<00:02:32.010> DSLR<00:02:32.970> like<00:02:33.510> maybe<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.930> D<00:02:34.170> 3200<00:02:35.069> or

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
entry-level DSLR like maybe a D 3200 or

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.849 
entry-level DSLR like maybe a D 3200 or
a<00:02:35.280> canon<00:02:35.730> rebel<00:02:35.760> camera<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:37.049> cameras<00:02:37.620> like

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
a canon rebel camera and on cameras like

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.970 
a canon rebel camera and on cameras like
that<00:02:38.189> you<00:02:38.909> have<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.629> press<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.290> hold<00:02:40.349> down<00:02:40.799> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
that you have to press and hold down the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.089 
that you have to press and hold down the

your<00:02:44.220> control<00:02:44.670> dial<00:02:44.939> in<00:02:45.150> order<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.599> change<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
your control dial in order to change the

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.080 
your control dial in order to change the
aperture<00:02:46.409> now<00:02:46.980> without<00:02:47.280> knowing<00:02:47.609> what<00:02:47.760> camera

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
aperture now without knowing what camera

aperture now without knowing what camera
you're<00:02:48.269> using<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.780> cannot<00:02:49.049> say<00:02:49.379> that<00:02:49.409> with<00:02:49.680> a

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
you're using I cannot say that with a

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.039 
you're using I cannot say that with a
hundred<00:02:50.010> percent<00:02:50.069> accuracy<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.209> if<00:02:51.629> you're

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
hundred percent accuracy so if you're

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.680 
hundred percent accuracy so if you're

an<00:03:40.769> older<00:03:41.099> camera<00:03:41.609> and<00:03:41.819> if<00:03:41.940> you're<00:03:42.060> having<00:03:42.269> to

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
an older camera and if you're having to

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.720 
an older camera and if you're having to
push<00:03:42.599> your<00:03:42.720> ISO<00:03:43.139> up<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.530> high<00:03:43.859> level<00:03:44.370> in

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
push your ISO up to a high level in

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.180 
push your ISO up to a high level in
order<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.389> get<00:03:45.599> decent<00:03:45.959> shutter<00:03:46.560> speeds<00:03:46.979> while

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
order to get decent shutter speeds while

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.729 
order to get decent shutter speeds while
shooting<00:03:47.400> in<00:03:47.609> low-light<00:03:47.819> on<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.750> Canon<00:03:49.139> 50d

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
shooting in low-light on the Canon 50d

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.619 
shooting in low-light on the Canon 50d
it<00:03:50.010> just<00:03:50.489> might<00:03:50.669> be<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:50.970> fact<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.359> you're

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
it just might be the fact that you're

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.689 
it just might be the fact that you're
shooting<00:03:51.900> at<00:03:52.169> too<00:03:52.440> high<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:52.829> an<00:03:53.040> ISO<00:03:53.489> and

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
shooting at too high of an ISO and

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.270 
shooting at too high of an ISO and
they're<00:03:54.090> too<00:03:54.359> grainy<00:03:54.720> for<00:03:55.019> your<00:03:55.199> taste<00:03:55.560> being

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
they're too grainy for your taste being

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.030 
they're too grainy for your taste being
over<00:03:56.609> camera<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.659> might<00:03:57.840> not<00:03:58.079> want<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.620> shoot

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
over camera you might not want to shoot

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.059 
over camera you might not want to shoot
at<00:03:59.310> higher<00:03:59.639> ISOs<00:04:00.329> now<00:04:01.079> one<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.620> things<00:04:01.889> you

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
at higher ISOs now one of the things you

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.490 
at higher ISOs now one of the things you
could<00:04:02.370> do<00:04:02.669> rather<00:04:03.359> than<00:04:03.659> buying<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:04.079> new<00:04:04.199> camera

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
could do rather than buying a new camera

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.460 
could do rather than buying a new camera
is<00:04:04.799> buy<00:04:05.370> lenses<00:04:05.729> that<00:04:06.090> have<00:04:06.299> faster<00:04:06.870> apertures

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
is buy lenses that have faster apertures

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.469 
is buy lenses that have faster apertures
I<00:04:07.680> don't<00:04:07.949> know<00:04:08.040> what<00:04:08.190> lens<00:04:08.400> down<00:04:08.609> is<00:04:08.909> using<00:04:09.299> but

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
I don't know what lens down is using but

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.330 
I don't know what lens down is using but
if<00:04:09.569> you're<00:04:09.720> using<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:10.079> standard<00:04:10.139> kit<00:04:10.739> lens<00:04:11.010> that

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
if you're using a standard kit lens that

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.189 
if you're using a standard kit lens that
can<00:04:11.519> be<00:04:11.639> pretty<00:04:11.879> limited<00:04:12.150> working<00:04:12.959> with

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
can be pretty limited working with

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.960 
can be pretty limited working with
something<00:04:13.530> like<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.680> 50<00:04:14.099> millimeter<00:04:14.280> F<00:04:14.729> one

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970

chance to thoroughly test it so i don't

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.390

know<00:05:03.520> is<00:05:03.670> that<00:05:03.790> generally<00:05:04.450> speaking<00:05:04.800> sensor

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
know is that generally speaking sensor

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.740 
know is that generally speaking sensor
based<00:05:06.060> autofocus<00:05:07.060> is<00:05:07.240> still<00:05:07.900> not<00:05:08.350> as<00:05:08.740> good<00:05:09.130> as

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
based autofocus is still not as good as

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.170 
based autofocus is still not as good as
optical<00:05:10.750> autofocus<00:05:11.500> systems<00:05:11.890> in<00:05:12.070> DSLRs<00:05:12.880> it's

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
optical autofocus systems in DSLRs it's

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.240 
optical autofocus systems in DSLRs it's
just<00:05:13.510> not<00:05:13.750> there<00:05:14.110> yet<00:05:14.320> it<00:05:14.590> is<00:05:14.710> going<00:05:14.890> to<00:05:15.070> get

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
just not there yet it is going to get

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.730 
just not there yet it is going to get
there<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.820> sony<00:05:16.060> alpha<00:05:16.300> 6000<00:05:17.140> in<00:05:17.290> general

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
there and the sony alpha 6000 in general

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.470 
there and the sony alpha 6000 in general
was<00:05:17.950> a<00:05:17.980> huge<00:05:18.370> leap<00:05:18.610> forward<00:05:18.940> in<00:05:19.270> those

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
was a huge leap forward in those

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.690 
was a huge leap forward in those
autofocus<00:05:20.170> performances<00:05:20.890> so<00:05:21.160> it<00:05:21.370> might

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
autofocus performances so it might
