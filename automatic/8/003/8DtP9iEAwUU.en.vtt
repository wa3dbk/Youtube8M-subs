 radical currents 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.539
 arise only through the compromise pressure 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.129
 maybe I am then I come now too 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.500

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.510
 extrapolated the year 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.710
 the final solution 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 Pixie Lott MatthÃ¤us is the decision until the 80s 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:32.569
 the dumbness of this makes Doms is complete 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.040
 It is a miracle that the SPD is the subject of democracy party Germany 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.430
 the separatist party or is he is always so noble at BVB comes 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.790
 or something like coach the cargo area shops and do a good job 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.620
 I think we have this rhetoric 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.840
 "I never appreciated directly against dangerous opponents 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.080

 Cans were only a few innovations entered 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 we have 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.590
 Take your time to call weapons on the edges of the nameless 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.880
 but in the formula 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 accordingly, the others were one 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.550
 according to Dudenhoffers, the young ones are self-made

 spent a son 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.810
 we are all not saying 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.079
 because then a home win so prepare them to see their money soon so far again

 Landertinger 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.450
 they have a lot of catching up to do 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.770
 at the moment rather normal if you are the danes 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.739
 the single 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.739
 the HSG Lima 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:09.339
 and what will he say that we appear our national newspapers 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.989
 Web page weeks time 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.189
 what he will be he i look at my phone soon what we say he is 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.620
 that in Austria very many 19-year-old donations are very many 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.900
 Leaflets distributed thus the z4 had been present as a crude fake 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.759
 unmasked 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.589
 From it went from a publishing house in its executive committee the chairman of the 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.359
 Democratic Parties State Council 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.689
 why will we do that the business is not prohibited 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.859
 why we disagree several times 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.489
 because our government work is very much in a state of law 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.509
 the new technology 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.799
 who by true and forbidding would be a stab in the wasp's nest 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.589
 happily sealed was restricted to 4GB 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:56.809
 but that wirelessly lost to 6 8 4 6 5 what I hardened there 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.939
 if something is not experienced ward off the beginnings of thinking that I love you 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.040
 we offer 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.730
 nothing but from the People's Party they wrote look into the distant future 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.979
 in the back and when that's all over 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:12.249
 where is it all but the car was on the 10 which was on it 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:17.389
 look back in the east yet it was way i pay as annoyance 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.239
 a joke someday become very fashionable again everywhere 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.120
 then one of the annotated ones will discover a Germany almost Marie 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.539
 Wenzel single piece I would say 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.120
 this organism does not inspire him it matters 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.120
 if he is happy that is the question that he is free that is the goal 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.540
 just as she is secondary to the state that she is good 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.380
 it does not matter that the state lives it depends on what the human being is 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.360
 Life 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.259
 Bugatti that affect but also head of the car parts of the thick 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.740
 Fish will get on the dung heap and people older courage to themselves 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.189
 without diagnosis, the fear of the state 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.020
 what is her biggest hit third round 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.020
 and that we will then go the time of the day 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.770
 there 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.550
 at about ten o'clock so everything as always 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:15.119
 he himself was evidently not in a victory 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.740
 we will see differently because while the Chinese are coming to an end 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.740
 we want the opponent on the 1st 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.839
 we have Varazdin very well 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.180
 but that's just it 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.629
 to reach 10 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.020
 only by the way still with those 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.180
 Submit in march it may work 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.440
 percent
