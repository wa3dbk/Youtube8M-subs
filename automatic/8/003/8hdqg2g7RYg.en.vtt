00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.500 

this<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.230> an<00:00:19.380> 18-speed<00:00:19.770> transmission

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
this is an 18-speed transmission

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.050 
this is an 18-speed transmission
generally<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.290> 18-speed<00:00:22.920> has<00:00:23.310> more<00:00:23.670> gears

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
generally the 18-speed has more gears

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.000 
generally the 18-speed has more gears
than<00:00:24.420> you'll<00:00:24.599> ever<00:00:24.750> even<00:00:25.050> need<00:00:25.349> to<00:00:25.500> use<00:00:25.680> unless

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
than you'll ever even need to use unless

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.310 
than you'll ever even need to use unless
perhaps<00:00:26.820> you're<00:00:27.270> pulling<00:00:27.599> trains<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
perhaps you're pulling trains in the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.370 
perhaps you're pulling trains in the
balancer<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.610> heavy<00:00:29.820> weight<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.960> basically

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
balancer for heavy weight but basically

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.070 
balancer for heavy weight but basically
it's<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.040> an<00:00:32.340> H<00:00:32.820> pattern<00:00:33.449> shift<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
it's just a an H pattern shift with a

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.500 
it's just a an H pattern shift with a
splitter<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:37.400> I'll<00:00:38.400> get<00:00:38.640> us<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:38.970> here<00:00:39.300> we'll

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
splitter so I'll get us going here we'll

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.080 
splitter so I'll get us going here we'll
do<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> H<00:00:39.930> pattern<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.650> you'll<00:00:40.830> see<00:00:41.040> how<00:00:41.910> it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
do the H pattern and you'll see how it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
do the H pattern and you'll see how it
works<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.660> cat<00:00:45.660> litter<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.379> cats<00:00:46.710> like

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
works this is a cat litter and cats like

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.180 
works this is a cat litter and cats like
to<00:00:47.580> shift<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.780> lower<00:00:49.110> field

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.130 

and<00:00:52.700> if<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:52.970> shift<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.420> properly<00:00:53.930> at<00:00:54.110> the

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
and if you shift it properly at the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.900 
and if you shift it properly at the
proper<00:00:54.620> rpm<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.280> can<00:00:55.430> see<00:00:55.610> it<00:00:55.700> takes

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
proper rpm you can see it takes

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.790 
proper rpm you can see it takes
virtually<00:00:56.360> no<00:00:56.510> effort<00:00:56.840> at<00:00:56.900> all<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:57.590> there's

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
virtually no effort at all so there's

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.479 
virtually no effort at all so there's
four<00:00:58.250> now<00:00:59.150> I<00:00:59.210> split<00:00:59.690> it<00:00:59.980> and<00:01:00.980> here's<00:01:01.220> the<00:01:01.400> it

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
four now I split it and here's the it

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:27.429 
four now I split it and here's the it
started<00:01:01.879> each<00:01:02.090> pattern<00:01:02.450> again

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.559 

so<00:01:27.859> there's<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.280> second<00:01:28.700> each<00:01:28.820> pattern<00:01:29.210> one

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
so there's the second each pattern one

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.300 
so there's the second each pattern one
on<00:01:29.749> top<00:01:30.020> theater

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
on top theater

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.399 
on top theater
and<00:01:31.460> then<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.760> get<00:01:31.880> into<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.240> top<00:01:32.479> gear<00:01:32.840> now<00:01:33.049> I

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
and then to get into the top gear now I

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.410 
and then to get into the top gear now I
just<00:01:33.799> put<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:34.460> again

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.080 

and<00:01:37.930> we're<00:01:38.170> in<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.380> top<00:01:38.620> gear<00:01:38.979> there<00:01:39.340> there

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
and we're in the top gear there there

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.140 
and we're in the top gear there there
are<00:01:40.150> all<00:01:40.300> sorts<00:01:40.750> of<00:01:40.979> gears<00:01:41.979> in<00:01:42.310> between<00:01:42.729> does

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
are all sorts of gears in between does

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.270 
are all sorts of gears in between does
it<00:01:43.330> say

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
it say

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.410 
it say
during<00:01:45.790> ow

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
during ow

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.740 
during ow
I<00:01:47.450> just<00:01:48.320> like

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.590 

five<00:01:52.170> years

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.039 

Chipping<00:01:58.350> well<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:59.390> kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.600> riding<00:02:00.840> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
Chipping well is kind of like riding a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.690 
Chipping well is kind of like riding a
bike<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.470> more<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.830> do<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> better<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
bike the more you do it the better you

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.950 
bike the more you do it the better you
get<00:02:02.909> at<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:04.080> can<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.490> two<00:02:05.490> trucks

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
get at it you can have two trucks

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.870 
get at it you can have two trucks
identically<00:02:06.960> SPECT<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.710> they'll<00:02:08.550> they'll

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
identically SPECT and they'll they'll

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.850 
identically SPECT and they'll they'll
shift<00:02:09.239> differently<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.080> every<00:02:10.350> truck<00:02:10.590> shifts

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
shift differently so every truck shifts

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.979 
shift differently so every truck shifts
a<00:02:11.039> little<00:02:11.190> differently<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.730> each<00:02:11.940> has<00:02:12.540> its<00:02:12.569> own

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
a little differently in each has its own

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.960 
a little differently in each has its own
personality<00:02:15.410> just<00:02:16.410> take<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> time<00:02:17.430> spend<00:02:17.850> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
personality just take the time spend the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.630 
personality just take the time spend the
time<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.360> get<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.660> know<00:02:19.130> what<00:02:20.130> your<00:02:20.160> truck

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
time to get to know what your truck

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.500 
time to get to know what your truck
likes<00:02:21.060> where<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.540> sweet<00:02:21.780> spots<00:02:22.140> are<00:02:23.510> take

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
likes where the sweet spots are take

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.830 
likes where the sweet spots are take
your<00:02:24.690> time<00:02:24.930> shift<00:02:25.770> slowly<00:02:26.569> feather<00:02:27.569> the

slide it in never try to force a gear

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.750 
slide it in never try to force a gear
you<00:02:34.290> don't<00:02:34.500> need<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.860> force<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.190> gear<00:02:35.519> theirs

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
you don't need to force the gear theirs

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.570 
you don't need to force the gear theirs
they'll<00:02:36.180> slide<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.720> themselves<00:02:37.410> literally<00:02:38.220> if

they'll slide in themselves literally if

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.130 
they'll slide in themselves literally if
you<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.209> everything<00:02:39.540> lined<00:02:39.900> up<00:02:40.110> correctly
