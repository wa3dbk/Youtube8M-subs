physiologist and when our eyesight

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.609 
physiologist and when our eyesight
offers<00:01:08.850> doing<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.210> sports<00:01:09.450> science<00:01:09.750> degree<00:01:09.990> so

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
offers doing a sports science degree so

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.320 
offers doing a sports science degree so
firstly<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> sports<00:01:11.790> science<00:01:12.090> degree

firstly it is a sports science degree

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.670 
firstly it is a sports science degree
which<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.659> quite<00:01:12.869> kind<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.260> an<00:01:13.380> overall

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
which was quite kind of an overall

which was quite kind of an overall
Jeanette<00:01:14.460> overall<00:01:15.240> sport<00:01:15.780> science<00:01:16.049> which

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
Jeanette overall sport science which

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.560 
Jeanette overall sport science which
included<00:01:16.560> aspects<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.159> nutrition<00:01:17.570> physiology

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
included aspects of nutrition physiology

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.649 
included aspects of nutrition physiology
psychology<00:01:19.700> biomechanics<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.360> after

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
psychology biomechanics and then after

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.300 
psychology biomechanics and then after
that<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.840> went<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.409> specialized<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that I went and specialized to do a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.460 
that I went and specialized to do a
master's<00:01:23.970> degree<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.630> purely<00:01:24.900> in

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
master's degree but just purely in

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.320 
master's degree but just purely in
exercise<00:01:25.860> physiology<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.549> think<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.210> also

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
exercise physiology I think it also

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.969 
exercise physiology I think it also
helps<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:27.930> been<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.229> competitive<00:01:28.740> sport

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
helps it be been in competitive sport

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.590 
helps it be been in competitive sport
yourself<00:01:29.280> from<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.030> you're<00:01:30.240> used<00:01:30.509> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
yourself from you know you're used to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.149 
yourself from you know you're used to
being<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> sporting<00:01:31.439> environment<00:01:31.530> you

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.539 
like you like you're very passionate
about<00:01:34.439> sport<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
about sport I think that's one of the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.210 
about sport I think that's one of the
most<00:01:35.670> important<00:01:36.119> things<00:01:36.329> because<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.409> if

to women are you going to disembody who

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.630 
to women are you going to disembody who
I'm<00:02:20.140> not<00:02:20.290> going<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.530> disembody<00:02:20.920> him<00:02:21.069> all<00:02:21.489> I'm

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
I'm not going to disembody him all I'm

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.920 
I'm not going to disembody him all I'm
going<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.849> do<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.150> I'm<00:02:22.269> going<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.450> make<00:02:22.540> him<00:02:22.750> run

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
going to do is I'm going to make him run

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.869 
going to do is I'm going to make him run
on<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.290> run<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.920> treadmill<00:02:24.340> usually

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
on the run and the treadmill usually

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.550 
on the run and the treadmill usually
what<00:02:25.030> we<00:02:25.120> do<00:02:25.269> is<00:02:25.300> we<00:02:25.690> start<00:02:26.019> them<00:02:26.230> off<00:02:26.290> at<00:02:26.440> an

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
what we do is we start them off at an

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.320 
what we do is we start them off at an
easy<00:02:26.830> pace<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.340> then<00:02:27.430> we<00:02:27.550> make<00:02:27.700> LIGO<00:02:28.000> harder

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
easy pace and then we make LIGO harder

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.610 
easy pace and then we make LIGO harder
and<00:02:28.480> harder<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.780> harder<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.140> we<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.470> watch

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
and harder and harder and we just watch

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.559 
and harder and harder and we just watch
how<00:02:29.830> their<00:02:30.040> body<00:02:30.340> reacts<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.030> increase<00:02:31.540> in

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
how their body reacts to the increase in

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.140 
how their body reacts to the increase in
it<00:02:31.810> exercise<00:02:32.349> intensity<00:02:32.800> okay<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:33.760> can<00:02:34.090> you

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
it exercise intensity okay so can you

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.509 
it exercise intensity okay so can you
tell<00:02:34.239> me<00:02:34.450> what's<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:36.130> what<00:02:36.280> we<00:02:36.370> have<00:02:36.489> here

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
tell me what's this so what we have here

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.400 
tell me what's this so what we have here
is<00:02:36.940> we<00:02:37.150> basically<00:02:37.450> it's<00:02:37.750> measuring<00:02:38.170> his

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
is we basically it's measuring his

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.690 
is we basically it's measuring his
expired<00:02:38.890> oxygen<00:02:39.430> oxygen<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.540> carbon<00:02:40.690> dioxide

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
expired oxygen oxygen and carbon dioxide

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.390 
expired oxygen oxygen and carbon dioxide
so<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:44.200> what<00:02:44.319> we<00:02:44.410> have<00:02:44.560> along<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.860> top<00:02:45.069> is<00:02:45.280> we

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
so so what we have along the top is we

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.559 
so so what we have along the top is we
have<00:02:45.549> time

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
have time

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.750 
have time
oxygen<00:02:47.470> volume<00:02:47.769> of<00:02:47.860> oxygen<00:02:48.160> that's<00:02:48.280> expired

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
oxygen volume of oxygen that's expired

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.150 
oxygen volume of oxygen that's expired
in<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.060> minute<00:02:49.299> liters<00:02:49.630> per<00:02:49.810> minute<00:02:49.959> volume<00:02:50.890> of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
in a minute liters per minute volume of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.910 
in a minute liters per minute volume of
carbon<00:02:51.370> dioxide<00:02:51.849> and<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:52.720> we<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.290> he's

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
carbon dioxide and then we have a he's

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.850 
carbon dioxide and then we have a he's
have<00:02:54.280> how<00:02:54.970> far<00:02:55.299> above<00:02:55.510> resting<00:02:56.170> he's<00:02:56.380> working

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
have how far above resting he's working

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.720 
have how far above resting he's working
so<00:02:58.620> usually<00:02:59.620> people<00:02:59.650> was<00:03:00.220> he<00:03:00.310> worked<00:03:00.519> hard

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
so usually people was he worked hard

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.360 
so usually people was he worked hard
obviously<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.630> figure<00:03:01.930> goes<00:03:02.079> up<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:03.280> then

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
obviously that figure goes up and then

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.650 
obviously that figure goes up and then
we<00:03:03.489> have<00:03:03.700> something<00:03:03.970> called<00:03:04.209> respiratory

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
we have something called respiratory

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.920 
we have something called respiratory
exchange<00:03:05.260> ratio<00:03:05.829> which<00:03:06.549> is<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:07.120> ratio

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
exchange ratio which is the ratio

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.490 
exchange ratio which is the ratio
between<00:03:08.799> carbon<00:03:09.670> dioxide<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.480> o2<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.290> he's

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
between carbon dioxide and o2 that he's

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.080 
between carbon dioxide and o2 that he's
oxygen<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.430> he's<00:03:12.640> expiring

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
oxygen that he's expiring

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.150 
oxygen that he's expiring
okay<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.150> we'll<00:03:16.989> give<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.530> link<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:17.950> find

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
okay so we'll give you the link to find

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.009 
okay so we'll give you the link to find
out<00:03:18.220> more<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:18.760> what<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.329> is<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.750> measures

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
out more so what this is it measures

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.240 
out more so what this is it measures
your<00:03:20.160> vo2<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:21.609> so<00:03:22.450> when<00:03:22.630> you're<00:03:22.750> looking<00:03:23.049> at

your vo2 so so when you're looking at

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.920 
your vo2 so so when you're looking at
when<00:03:24.250> you're<00:03:24.370> looking<00:03:24.609> at<00:03:25.180> an<00:03:25.359> endurance

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
when you're looking at an endurance

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.569 
when you're looking at an endurance
athlete<00:03:26.290> or<00:03:26.410> you're<00:03:26.500> looking<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.769> see<00:03:27.040> how<00:03:27.280> a

athlete or you're looking to see how a

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.309 
athlete or you're looking to see how a
fit<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.030> person<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.600> we<00:03:28.750> have<00:03:28.900> something<00:03:29.230> that's

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
fit a person is we have something that's

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.949 
fit a person is we have something that's
called<00:03:29.590> vo2<00:03:29.950> max<00:03:30.370> which<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.000> it's<00:03:31.660> basically

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
called vo2 max which is it's basically

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.870 
called vo2 max which is it's basically
the<00:03:32.139> maximum<00:03:32.410> amount<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.829> oxygen<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.310> person

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
the maximum amount of oxygen a person

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.030 
the maximum amount of oxygen a person
can<00:03:34.030> breathing<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.660> then<00:03:34.989> use<00:03:35.200> utilize<00:03:35.859> to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
can breathing and then use utilize to

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.229 
can breathing and then use utilize to
the<00:03:36.130> working<00:03:36.459> muscle<00:03:36.819> whilst<00:03:37.000> they<00:03:37.209> are

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
the working muscle whilst they are

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.020 
the working muscle whilst they are
exercising<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:38.530> an<00:03:39.370> endurance<00:03:39.760> trained

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
exercising so an endurance trained

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.370 
exercising so an endurance trained
athlete<00:03:40.359> or<00:03:40.450> someone<00:03:40.660> who's<00:03:40.810> very<00:03:40.930> fit<00:03:41.230> would

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
athlete or someone who's very fit would

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.559 
athlete or someone who's very fit would
have<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.530> very<00:03:41.799> high<00:03:42.069> vo2<00:03:42.549> Max<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.000> generally

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
have a very high vo2 Max and generally

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.420 
have a very high vo2 Max and generally
someone<00:03:44.019> who's<00:03:44.170> got<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.380> higher<00:03:44.650> vo2<00:03:45.069> max<00:03:45.250> would

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
someone who's got a higher vo2 max would

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.150 
someone who's got a higher vo2 max would
be<00:03:46.230> performed<00:03:47.230> much<00:03:47.319> better<00:03:47.560> at<00:03:47.709> major<00:03:47.859> games

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
be performed much better at major games

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.620 
be performed much better at major games
like<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.609> Youth<00:03:48.760> Olympic<00:03:48.880> Games<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.480> things

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
like the Youth Olympic Games and things

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.069 
like the Youth Olympic Games and things
like<00:03:49.750> that

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
like that

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.670 
like that
okay<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:51.599> understood<00:03:52.599> some<00:03:53.019> part<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.290> it<00:03:53.500> so

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
okay so I understood some part of it so

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.559 
okay so I understood some part of it so
if<00:03:53.980> wyman<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.639> fitting<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.090> going<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.420> have<00:03:55.540> a

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
if wyman is fitting is going to have a

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.180 
if wyman is fitting is going to have a
higher<00:03:55.870> vo2<00:03:56.590> agree

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
higher vo2 agree

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:22.340 
higher vo2 agree
okay<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:57.519> let's<00:03:57.880> see<00:03:58.150> how<00:03:58.329> fit<00:03:58.540> why<00:03:58.720> -<00:03:59.079> okay

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.230 

and<00:04:22.920> what<00:04:23.070> would<00:04:23.160> happen<00:04:23.310> in<00:04:23.700> a<00:04:23.790> test<00:04:24.030> is<00:04:24.210> that

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
and what would happen in a test is that

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.510 
and what would happen in a test is that
we<00:04:24.420> can<00:04:24.750> would<00:04:25.170> sometimes<00:04:25.410> we<00:04:25.800> do<00:04:25.980> four-minute

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
we can would sometimes we do four-minute

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.390 
we can would sometimes we do four-minute
stages<00:04:26.910> he'd<00:04:27.090> run<00:04:27.390> then<00:04:28.140> we<00:04:28.260> take<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.500> fingertip

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
stages he'd run then we take a fingertip

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.280 
stages he'd run then we take a fingertip
blood<00:04:29.670> sample<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.570> measure<00:04:30.840> lactate

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
blood sample of to measure lactate

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.020 
blood sample of to measure lactate
lactic<00:04:31.650> acid<00:04:31.950> in<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.160> blood<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.700> lactic

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
lactic acid in the blood so a lactic

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.120 
lactic acid in the blood so a lactic
acid<00:04:33.360> shows<00:04:33.630> again<00:04:34.170> it<00:04:34.350> shows<00:04:34.530> how<00:04:34.710> hard<00:04:34.920> that

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
acid shows again it shows how hard that

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.430 
acid shows again it shows how hard that
person<00:04:35.520> is<00:04:35.610> working<00:04:35.870> Canton<00:04:36.870> down<00:04:37.020> out<00:04:37.200> is

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
person is working Canton down out is

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.410 
person is working Canton down out is
taking<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.830> sample<00:04:38.190> so<00:04:38.700> once<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.000> samples

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
taking the sample so once the samples

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.940 
taking the sample so once the samples
once<00:04:39.690> has<00:04:39.810> come<00:04:39.990> down<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.350> give<00:04:40.560> us<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.740> reading

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
once has come down and give us a reading

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.130 
once has come down and give us a reading
of<00:04:41.130> how<00:04:41.310> how<00:04:41.670> hard<00:04:41.850> is<00:04:42.030> working<00:04:42.390> when<00:04:42.780> when<00:04:43.050> you

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
of how how hard is working when when you

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.360 
of how how hard is working when when you
start<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.530> exercise<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.010> pain<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.340> your

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
start to exercise the pain in your

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.220 
start to exercise the pain in your
muscles<00:04:44.490> when<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.270> when<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.690> feel<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.020> pain

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
muscles when you when you feel the pain

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.330 
muscles when you when you feel the pain
it's<00:04:46.470> actually<00:04:46.710> about<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.980> custard<00:04:47.250> that's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
it's actually about to custard that's

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.550 
it's actually about to custard that's
causing<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.820> pain<00:04:48.030> well<00:04:48.510> it's<00:04:48.630> hydrogen<00:04:49.170> ions

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
causing the pain well it's hydrogen ions

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.720 
causing the pain well it's hydrogen ions
that's<00:04:49.710> within<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:50.100> lactic<00:04:50.430> acid<00:04:50.700> that

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
that's within the lactic acid that

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.080 
that's within the lactic acid that
causes<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.390> pain<00:04:51.630> so<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.520> if<00:04:53.520> that<00:04:53.730> take<00:04:53.910> gets

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
causes the pain so so if that take gets

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.880 
causes the pain so so if that take gets
really<00:04:54.360> really<00:04:54.480> high<00:04:54.810> this<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:55.170> what<00:04:55.410> makes

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
really really high this is what makes

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.350 
really really high this is what makes
exercise<00:04:56.310> are<00:04:56.430> really<00:04:56.580> really<00:04:56.790> hard<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.180> will

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
exercise are really really hard and will

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.510 
exercise are really really hard and will
eventually<00:04:57.510> stop<00:04:57.960> you<00:04:58.050> exercising<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:59.100> what

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
eventually stop you exercising so what

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.190 
eventually stop you exercising so what
we<00:04:59.640> can<00:04:59.790> do<00:04:59.940> is<00:05:00.060> we<00:05:00.360> can<00:05:00.480> monitor<00:05:00.840> someone's

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
we can do is we can monitor someone's

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.350 
we can do is we can monitor someone's
lactic<00:05:01.560> acid<00:05:01.830> production<00:05:02.070> and<00:05:02.490> then<00:05:03.030> we<00:05:03.180> can

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
lactic acid production and then we can

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.010 
lactic acid production and then we can
see<00:05:03.680> we<00:05:04.680> can<00:05:04.860> look<00:05:05.010> at<00:05:05.190> how<00:05:05.970> hard<00:05:06.270> or<00:05:06.570> how<00:05:06.810> long

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
see we can look at how hard or how long

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.530 
see we can look at how hard or how long
they<00:05:07.230> could<00:05:07.440> maintain<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:08.250> certain<00:05:08.850> speed<00:05:09.180> or<00:05:09.210> a

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
they could maintain a certain speed or a

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.290 
they could maintain a certain speed or a
certain<00:05:09.900> case<00:05:10.620> or<00:05:11.010> something<00:05:11.820> like<00:05:12.000> that<00:05:12.060> when

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
certain case or something like that when

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.880 
certain case or something like that when
they're<00:05:12.480> when<00:05:12.990> they're<00:05:13.140> running<00:05:13.260> or<00:05:13.560> cycling

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
they're when they're running or cycling

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.500 
they're when they're running or cycling
or<00:05:14.280> rowing<00:05:14.640> or<00:05:14.850> whatever<00:05:15.030> it<00:05:15.210> might<00:05:15.330> be

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
or rowing or whatever it might be

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.920 
or rowing or whatever it might be
so<00:05:16.020> yeah<00:05:16.260> 2.3<00:05:17.190> millimoles<00:05:17.640> per<00:05:17.820> liter<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.630> liter

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
so yeah 2.3 millimoles per liter a liter

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.870 
so yeah 2.3 millimoles per liter a liter
of<00:05:19.320> blood<00:05:19.410> so<00:05:19.920> it<00:05:20.070> means<00:05:20.220> we're<00:05:20.400> talking<00:05:20.520> quite

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
of blood so it means we're talking quite

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.990 
of blood so it means we're talking quite
like<00:05:21.300> small<00:05:21.540> figures<00:05:21.870> but<00:05:22.110> what<00:05:22.970> was<00:05:23.970> a

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
like small figures but what was a

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.580 
like small figures but what was a
national<00:05:24.480> runner<00:05:24.630> here<00:05:24.900> so<00:05:25.110> a<00:05:25.140> national

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
national runner here so a national

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.410 
national runner here so a national
runner<00:05:25.770> at<00:05:26.100> ten<00:05:26.370> would<00:05:26.550> be<00:05:26.580> probably<00:05:27.030> less

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
runner at ten would be probably less

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.540 
runner at ten would be probably less
than<00:05:27.480> one<00:05:27.930> no<00:05:28.620> point<00:05:28.860> eight<00:05:29.040> naught<00:05:29.370> point

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
than one no point eight naught point

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:37.519 
than one no point eight naught point
naught<00:05:29.880> point<00:05:30.120> nine<00:05:30.710> you're<00:05:31.820> unbelievable

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.589 

you
