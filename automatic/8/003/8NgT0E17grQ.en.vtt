00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
 I liked and in the portrait of the activity there are two options in the 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.920
 life 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.099
 I call him 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.250
 it shows how urgent it is to act, she added last night. 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.560
 dreams he already has a lot for what looks like atabal the sea on dry foot 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.329
 and food and that's exactly what will happen for this Saturday adventure 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.859
 morning the dream will become reality is that a departure will not be fictitious 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.710
 25 college and high school students accompanied by a dozen 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.030
 teachers and volunteers 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.730
 will rush to istanbul rabiller had been the school city andrÃ© 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.610
 maurois from bischwiller to istanbul the bet is a bit crazy but to bring 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.220
 the students needed a strong project we had to caricature a small 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.550
 little tired of seeing the different Amish sea communities would sign in the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.950
 playground 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.740
 reading on one side the French on their side did not wish 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.920
 answer bring back everyone 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.730
 in an interview there is not much left to assemble for 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.070
 federate people 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.690
 the races to do 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.729
 but on a dynamic that serves all 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.799
 so that's what's very motivating in three weeks then it's 14 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.380
 boys will engulf 3200 km and cross the 10 countries 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.360
 a somewhat lengthy journey that they decided to follow the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.760
 danube by a bike path for security reasons 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.680
 but beyond a sporting adventure it's also a human adventure that its 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.840
 students and their teachers are going to live there is obviously the sportier aspect 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.210
 go to the end of his effort but there is also the aspect and 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.400
 which they miss a little bit these two 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.259
 the journalists% and prepare his business had maintained his bike 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.890
 smile 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.729
 in the train in the city account open to others through the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.650
 cultures in europe the european countries through his antecedents 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.700
 bratislava 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.510
 budapest beautiful bunches for greens is on the stock market as each time says 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.930
 different cultural contexts for students this journey a project 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.210
 personal and a source of fulfillment 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.310
 everyone by the yardstick of the particular expectations of coming back maybe 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.760
 changed better 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.330
 open mind 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.230
 and for 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.620
 communicate more easily with people these encounters will be passing 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.149
 in our character thaksin 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.800
 so that will happen learning to live in society 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.289
 that's the players 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.289
 something sure that's what I could rely on 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.679
 better later because we do not need the community duo 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:18.699
 and the heaviest even if equipped formats physical goes it's 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.589
 surpassed think it's a learning of life 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:22.439
 the tunnels 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.219
 will never be very far away because for that would it be possible to ensure a 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.669
 continuity school each will have courses to follow during these moments 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.969
 resting the head and legs so the legs well prepared since the start 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.019
 but we went out every wednesday since september 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.590
 as part of unss school sport from 1 pm to 4 pm 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.809
 and we went out every Sunday from 8:30 to 12:30 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.469
 so they made huge concessions especially in relation to their time 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:48.759
 free 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:52.749
 2 we read all tight in your trades universe because we believed 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:53.749
 one exercises 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:57.170
 expected arrival for cyclists the caravan accompanying them on the 21st 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:58.240
 April in Istanbul 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.910
 memories full head and miles in the calves
