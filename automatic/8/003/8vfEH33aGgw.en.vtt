and that hasn't happened many times
before<00:03:50.660> in<00:03:51.050> Swedish<00:03:51.380> history<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:52.040> we<00:03:52.160> have

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
before in Swedish history and we have

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.650 
before in Swedish history and we have
performed<00:03:52.760> really<00:03:52.910> well<00:03:53.030> both<00:03:53.390> in<00:03:53.570> the

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
championships and in the qualifying

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.860 
championships and in the qualifying
stages<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:56.960> I<00:03:56.990> think<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.470> expectations<00:03:58.130> are

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
stages so I think the expectations are

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.050 
stages so I think the expectations are
high<00:03:59.870> from<00:04:00.260> from<00:04:00.530> ourselves<00:04:00.710> and<00:04:01.190> from<00:04:01.970> the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060
