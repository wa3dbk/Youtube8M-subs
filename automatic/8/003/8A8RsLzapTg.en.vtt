in a little bit first let's take a look

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.079 
in a little bit first let's take a look
at<00:00:39.330> the<00:00:39.390> stylus<00:00:39.930> TV<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.979> all<00:00:41.400> black<00:00:41.729> around

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the edge it's pretty understated which

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.740

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
in a TV this large isn't a terribly bad

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
in a TV this large isn't a terribly bad
thing<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.710> when<00:00:46.830> we<00:00:46.890> say<00:00:47.070> large<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.460> mean<00:00:47.640> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
thing and when we say large we mean it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.640 
thing and when we say large we mean it
this<00:00:47.879> TV<00:00:48.180> screen<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:48.809> five<00:00:49.080> feet<00:00:49.379> wide

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
this TV screen is about five feet wide

this TV screen is about five feet wide
by<00:00:50.010> two<00:00:50.070> point<00:00:50.519> eight<00:00:50.610> feet<00:00:50.879> tall<00:00:51.269> and<00:00:51.690> even

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
by two point eight feet tall and even

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.840 
by two point eight feet tall and even
when<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.409> put<00:00:52.589> on<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> four<00:00:52.979> by<00:00:53.129> three<00:00:53.159> image<00:00:53.729> of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
when you put on a four by three image of

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.490 
when you put on a four by three image of
those<00:00:53.909> old<00:00:54.180> images<00:00:54.479> with<00:00:54.659> the<00:00:54.869> letterbox<00:00:55.110> bars

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
those old images with the letterbox bars

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.009 
those old images with the letterbox bars
on<00:00:55.680> either<00:00:55.799> side<00:00:56.159> it's<00:00:56.430> 57<00:00:57.089> inches<00:00:57.330> diagonal

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
on either side it's 57 inches diagonal

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.380 
on either side it's 57 inches diagonal
so<00:00:58.229> the<00:00:58.650> 70<00:00:59.070> inch<00:00:59.220> TV<00:00:59.549> is<00:00:59.729> substantially

so the 70 inch TV is substantially
larger<00:01:00.540> than<00:01:00.869> the<00:01:00.960> 65<00:01:01.500> inch<00:01:01.530> models<00:01:02.100> used<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:03.059> a

lot<00:01:03.299> of<00:01:03.330> its<00:01:03.479> competitors<00:01:03.799> so<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.979> see

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
lot of its competitors so you can see

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.710
