00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.799

 lol it's a bit of a surprise 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.970
 but it's also a great joy for the team that has a lot 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.230
 worked percent during this summer 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.289
 we will try to do the best possible for the race of course the objective its 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.169
 customers 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.620
 after the sites where goes well if and if we have no technical problem 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.620
 why not on the podium we hope 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.909

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.990

 gold bowl this motor a pair of invitation boots 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.570
 but I'm here it's a bit like the label at home on the tire as a 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.069
 sort of tribute to open and medium-range 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.500
 we learn today that the pressure of an English inhabitant outweighs the 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.569
 month of August so that in the end it will pay morning of its antenna 2 before 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.569
 the end of the service was illusory 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.090

 Yes quite 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.369
 to tests for me it's 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.869
 it's great especially that it was obviously that it's my last 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.479
 race 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.090
 twins OEMs now go 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.219
 I am here for a good pilot 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:21.090
 profession pressure 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.659
 so with the cottages 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.969
 like this rebound is twice second of beautiful races even if we do not have 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.249
 victory 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:29.040
 now it's me last night 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.040
 in the street in front of a motor change at the last moment so the bike 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.990
 was not quite 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.370
 like that of 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.310
 we used to the tests so it disturbed me a bit and it took me a long time 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.309
 put in the bath 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.309
 after the second night relay there I really feasted on age 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.509
 the decrease in temperature in euros only the tires worked well 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:47.449
 as well 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.599
 do not call I'm well feasted I'll go back up and it looks good for 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.509
 tomorrow's second session the second inning having returned 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:54.789
 second 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.520
 I managed the start of the race with the track is tricky 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.490
 during the first two reconnaissance rounds 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.490
 track for his voice instead where he had to place zero 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:06.449
 but I quickly made the 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.020
 fat then the delay and why we went ahead quickly enough 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.020
 so after he had to manage 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.680
 back next year for a fourth victory with the giant team 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.439
 manager and a new teammate 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.539
 yes but that's what is actually looming 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.759
 here you said sylvie won at spa and then the golden bowl I stop so we have 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.539
 won at spa have won these gold flights so 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.520
 but that will be it's going to make it odd to change teammates from what we're 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.039
 is used to afp all places 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.490
 because we get along very well 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.250

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.699
