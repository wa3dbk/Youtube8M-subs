but<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> idea<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:27.689> thing<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
but you get the idea the thing is the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.189 
but you get the idea the thing is the
back<00:00:29.179> the<00:00:30.179> back<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> would<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:30.960> really

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
back the back of it would get really

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.490 
back the back of it would get really
loose<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:32.369> every<00:00:32.640> few<00:00:32.880> days<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.480> that's<00:00:34.350> not

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
loose like every few days and that's not

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.319 
loose like every few days and that's not
cool<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.160> I'd<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> keep<00:00:35.730> tightening<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
cool and I'd have to keep tightening it

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.520

what it means

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.329 
what it means
could<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.120> fusion<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> ostrich<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.070> good

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.880 
goes all the way up there it swivels 360
degrees<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.820> any<00:01:27.030> other<00:01:27.210> chair<00:01:27.890> it

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
degrees just like any other chair it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
degrees just like any other chair it
does<00:01:29.189> tilt<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.119> there's<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.689> tilt<00:01:30.990> mechanism

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
does tilt so there's a tilt mechanism

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.859 
does tilt so there's a tilt mechanism
right<00:01:31.680> there<00:01:32.240> that's<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> adjust<00:01:33.689> how<00:01:33.840> much

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
right there that's to adjust how much

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.649 
right there that's to adjust how much
the<00:01:34.229> tilt<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:34.890> sorry<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:36.270> you

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the tilt and then sorry and then you

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.730 
the tilt and then sorry and then you
push<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.890> stop<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> tilt<00:01:39.290> well<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.500> can't

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
push this in to stop a tilt well I can't

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.109 
push this in to stop a tilt well I can't
really<00:01:40.860> demonstrate<00:01:41.009> unless<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.670> sit<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.030> it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
really demonstrate unless I sit in it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.039 
really demonstrate unless I sit in it
but<00:01:42.689> um

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
but um

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.760 
but um
you<00:01:43.740> push<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.450> disable<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> tilt<00:01:46.590> so

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
you push that in to disable the tilt so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.370 
you push that in to disable the tilt so
it<00:01:46.829> doesn't<00:01:47.070> tilt<00:01:47.189> back<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.570> pull<00:01:49.229> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it doesn't tilt back or you can pull it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.920 
it doesn't tilt back or you can pull it
out<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.130> it'll<00:01:50.310> tilt<00:01:50.520> back<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.000> can't<00:01:51.840> really

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
out so it'll tilt back I can't really

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.170 
out so it'll tilt back I can't really
demonstrate<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.310> know<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:54.030> get

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
demonstrate that but you know you get

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.990 
demonstrate that but you know you get
the<00:01:54.329> idea<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.340> it's<00:01:56.340> made<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.640> leather<00:01:56.790> so

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the idea so it's made of leather so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.749 
the idea so it's made of leather so
